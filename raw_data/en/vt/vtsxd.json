This report summarises our achievements and challenges over the past 12 months, our ambitions for 2019/20 and describes the context in which we have operated. It also includes the Quality Account, which details our approach to quality and improvement priorities. The past 12 months have been extremely challenging for the NHS with continued financial squeeze in all sectors, coupled with growing levels of demand, culminating in increasing occupancy rates in hospitals and a steady decline in financial and operational performance. A shortage of qualified staff to fill important roles, and the impact of Brexit, has compounded this position. Despite this we have continued to focus our work to further integrate health and care services in this part of Devon , whilst als o investing in our acute care pathways and collaborating with other NHS Foundation Trust s in our county through our Sustainability and Transformation Partnership . As we move in to 2019/20, the Foundation Trust has already seen the further development of integrated services with the formation of a new county -wide service for children's and young person. This service called 'Family Health Devon' will see us work in partnership with Devon Partnership Trust , Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust and Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust . There still remains much to do and our financial position presents us with ongoing challenges as we move in 2019/20. We are also aware that o ur Devon system will need to consider how to meet the continuing pressure on performance targets and the availability of financial resources. In responding to this we recognise that o ur staff are our greatest resource and therefore enabling them to make the best use of their skills competence and experiences to do what is important for the people they support and care for is paramount . A commitm ent to the wellbeing of our staff whilst keeping our values of 'working with you, for you' is the golden thread underpinning our new focus, that will enable d ecision maki ng and control of resources to be delegated to teams within a defined self -organising structure. At the same time , we have been working towards establish ing a new operational delivery structure that will mean our model of care being delivered through five new Integrated Service Units . This is the next step in our becoming a fully integrated organisation, thanks to enhanced clinical leadership and a focus on clinical pathways aligned to each of our five localities. Maintaining quality and safety of all our services is para mount at this time of change, and will be a key focus over the coming year as th is model develops and embeds. We therefore believe that we have now reached a position where a person's care pathway from home to hospital to community hospital to home is as seamless as it has ever been. We are privileged to h ave a very supportive community and our local charities, including The League of Friends , have continue d to raise an incredible amount of money to support patient care and made many generous donations throughout the year to the hospital and community services. 7 Finally, we would like to thank all our colleagues for the outstanding care they have provided to our local community, both in our hospitals and through community services, and to pay tribute t o the people who make our ambition of providing integrated care a reality for people in our care. Thanks are also due to our Non -Executive Directors and Governors who have helped, supported and challenged constructively throughout the year. There remains much to do to achieve our goals and aspirations but we are grateful for the opportunity we have to positively affect our patients and our local community that we serve. This is an important time for us as we develop further as an integrated care organisa tion and w e will continue to do all we can to provide the best possible hea lth care to our local community as we continue on 'Our Journey'. Richard Ibbotson, KBE, CB, DSC, DL Chairman 28 May 2019 Liz Davenport Chief Executive 28 M ay 2019 8 Part I - Performance Overview of performance The purpose of this overview of performance is to provide the reader with sufficient information to understand the organisation, its purpose, main objectives, the key risks to the achievement of its objectives, and how it has performed during the year. Chief Executive's statement on p erformance The performance of the Foundation Trust is monitored and overseen by the Foundation Trust Board of Directors through reviewing monthl y performance reports which are provided to the Finance, Performance, and Investment Committee and the Board. These reports cover all the key national and local performance standards to provide evidence on key performance indicators for the Board to consider. Monitoring of performance during the year was delivered via four Service Delivery Units covering medicine, surgery, community and women, children, and diagnostics and therapies. Performance monitoring require d Service Delivery Units to review quality and performance dash boards relevant to each of their units and to present plans where there were risks or concerns. This process provide d the Foundation Trust Executive and Foundation Trust Board as surance that performance rules a re underst ood, and remedial action plans a re taken forward when necessary. Looking ahead to 2019/20, the process of performance monitoring will be delivered through the creation of a new operational management structure seeing the change from the previous service delivery units to service alignment ar ound a locali ty based integrated service unit model. The process of executive review meetings for the monitoring of performance will cover each of the five Integrated Service Unit s ('ISUs'). These meetings will require ISU teams to review their quality an d performance dashboards and to present plans where there are risks or concerns. This process will give the Executive Team and Board, assurance against performance delivery that risks are identified early with remedial action plans taken forward where nec essary. The Clinical Commissioning Groups ('CCG') in Devon merged with effect from 1 April 2019, and the Foundation Trust is now commissioned by Devon CCG for the significant majority of the services it delivers. The Devon STP is now coterminous with the CCG, along with 43 other STPs in England. The STP was established to enable the pooling of resources, and expertise where appropriate, so that a sustainable health and care system exists across Devon. Our Foundation Trust is one of the partners in the Devon STP. The STP has been a positive catalyst for Devon. It has helped leaders build a collaborative and system -wide approach across the NHS and local government. As a result, Devon is in a stronger position in which to fu rther integrate services health and care services for the benefit of its population. The collective work by leaders will be vital to help tackle the financial an d service performance challenges to be faced. The focus of working as part of an integrated he alth and care system in Devon, and as an STP, has been the driver for developing innovative new approaches, as well as some major successes shown below : o Ground -breaking collaboration: all four organisations providing acute hospital services have agreed a ' mutual support' approach to benefit patients. NHS 9 England have highlighted it as an \"exemplar of joint working\". The first phase of Acute Services Review has developed 'Best C are for Devon' standards for urgent and emergency care, stroke, and maternity ser vices, with clinical recommendations to provide services at all four of Devon's major hospitals if these standards are met. The next phase will look at wider service collaboration and new clinical networks will support this approach. o 'The best bed is your own bed': We are enhancing community services to support thousands more people to live independently at home. This has led to a reduction in acute and community hospitals beds by 213 over the past two years whilst at the same time improving outcomes for pe ople and service performance o No health without mental health: Devon has many leading and innovative mental health services. These include liaison psychiatry in each A&E to ensure people get the right help when they need it, psychological therapies for peo ple with long -term conditions, specialist support for women with postnatal depression and a new specialist unit opening next year so women can stay near their families so they do not need to travel outside the county. o All GP Practices in Devon rated 'Outst anding' or 'Good' in the latest CQC assessment. o Innovative collaboration between the NHS and social care: an award -winning campaign, led by Devon County Council with support from the NHS, is having a positive impact on recruiting people to work in the he alth and care sector in Devon. o The Foundation Trust led the successful award of the children's services tender through a Devon Alliance that commenced on 1 April 2019. In addition, the STP has focused on driving clinical improvement as well as productivity , efficiency, and sustainability. For example, STP leaders have signed up to the national 'Getting It Right First -Time ' programme, which is helping to improve the quality of care within the NHS by reducing unwarranted variations, bringing efficiencies, and improving patient outcomes. We are also using the Model Hospital approach, ensuring that everything we do is based on best practice. Further d eveloping local i ntegration Whilst we have made good progress, we and our partners (i.e. our commissioners in Devon CCG, Torbay Council and Devon County Council, GPs, and local voluntary sector organisations) recognise there are further integration opportunities that would help to improve the health, care, and wellbeing of our local population. We believe that the be st way to build on our achievements is to continue to focus on optimising the care model to support local people in their communities, rather than in bed based care, whenever it is safe to do so. The Foundation Trust 's Medical Director is leading the Clini cal Cabinet for the STP and is also leading on the establishment of a number of clinical networks that the Foundation Trust has been asked to host. These networks have been established to secure additional resilience across health and care providers throu gh greater partnership working. 10 Purpose and activities of the Foundation Trust Our purpose is to provide safe, high -quality care and social care at the right time and in the right place to support the people of Torbay and South Devon to live their lives to the full. We do this because we want people to: o Be empowered to manage their own health and care needs o Work in partnership with professionals o Only tell us their story once o Access seamless care easily o Have care in or close to home, whenever appropriate o Work together as a community to look after health and care needs. Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust is an award winning Foundation Trust providing high quality, personalised acute, elective, specialist, social care and community care services to a resident population of approximately 293,000 people, plus about 100,000 visitors at any one time during the summer holiday season. We employ approximately 6,000 staff including front -line health and social care staff, such as nurses, occupational thera pists, social workers, consultants and physiotherapists who work in people's homes and community settings. We have around 600 volunteers working in Torbay Hospital and across the community, inclu ding our Leagues of Friends who fundraise to help support the Foundation Trust . Approximately 75,000 people received treatment in our Emergency Department during the year, and 41,000 were treated in our Minor Injury Units. There were around 500,000 face -to-face contacts with service users and carers in their homes and communities each year. The Foundation Trust has an annual operating budget of over \u00a3441 million. We provide services from our main hospital site, Torbay Hospital, and from community hospitals, as well as health centres. Our main services are commiss ioned by Devon Clinical Commissioning Group as well as Torbay Council and Devon County Council. In addition to partnerships with its commission ers, the Foundation Trust has a lso developed a range of strategic and business partnerships, including; o The Foundation Trust is a partner in a Limited Liability Partnership (Health and Care Innovations LLP) providing health care videos developed by clinicians and specialists to improve the patient and user experience of the care we provide; o The Foundation Trust has a wholly owned subsidiary to provide an on -site pharmaceutical dispensary at Torbay Hospital; o The Foundation Trust is a partner in a Limited Liability Partnership to support the Foundation Trust 's ambitions to develop new buildings to replace out -of-date facilities; o With three other Devon NHS Foundation Trust s the Foundation Trust joined University of Exeter's new Academy of Nursing. This will help to bolster the nursing profession through development and training, with our local nurses at the forefron t of regional, national and international advances in care. o The Foundation Trust partnered with Plymouth University to launch Torbay Clinical School, to promote clinical research. 11 History and statutory background of the Foundation Trust Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust ('the Foundation Trust ') is a statutory body which , in October 2015 , became a public benefit corporation, f ollowing its approval as a NHS Foundation Trust by the Independent Regulator of the NHS Foundation Trust s authorised under the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2006. The Foundation Trust was formed by the merger of two Foundation Trust s - South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (providing acute services); and Torbay and Southern Health an d Care NHS Foundation Trust , (providing community and adult social care), thereby enabling us to implement a new model of integrated care. In creating the Integrated Care Organisation we brokered a financial Risk Share Agreement with our partners, which h as stood us in good stead and enabled major changes to how health and care is delivered for our local population. The princip al location of business of the Foundation Trust is Torbay Hospital, Lowes Bridge, Torquay TQ2 7AA . In addition to the above, the Foundation Trust has registered the following locations with the Care Quality Commission: o Ashburton and Buckfastleigh Hospital, Eastern Industrial Estate, Newton Abbot TQ12 4XX o Castle Circus Health Centre, Abbey Road, Torquay TQ2 5YH o Dartmouth Clinic, Mayors Avenue, Dartmouth Dawlish Hospital, Barton Terrace Dawlish EX7 9DH o Kingsbridge Hospital Hams) Special Care Dental, Plymouth Road, Kingsbridge TQ7 1AT o Newton Abbot Hospital, Jetty Marsh Road, Newton Abbot TQ12 2TS o Paignton Hospital, Church Street, Paignton Park Road, Torquay 3QH o Tavistock Special Dental uth Road, Tavistock 8BX Hospital, Coronation Road, Lodge, Walnut Road , Torquay TQ2 6HP The Foundation Trust is registered with the Care Quality Commission without condi tions and provides the following regulated activities across the stated locations: o Diagnostic and screening procedures; o Family planning services; o Management of supply of blood and blood derived products; o Maternity and midwifery services; o Personal care; o Surgical procedures; o Termination of pregnancies o Transport services, triage and medical advice provided remotely; and o Treatment of disease, disorder or injury 12 As a Foundation Trust responsible for public funds, the Board of Directors is accountable to local people represented by the Council of Go vernors. Full guidance on how Foundation Trust s are required to operate is available from NHS Improvement . Highlights of the y ear 2018/19 The Foundation Trust received an overall rating of G ood' from the Care Quali ty Commission in May 2018 , following inspections undertaken in February and March 2018. The report rated the Foundation Trust as 'Outstanding ' in the 'Caring ' category. The Care Quality Commission also inspected the Foundation Trust for its 'Use of Resources' during the year and rated the Foundation Trust as 'Good'. Highlights during the year included: o We opened a new state -of-the-art cancer targeting Linear Accelerator (LINAC) radiotherapy machine. o Our Medical and Admissions Avoidance Team (MAAT ) nurses began training community nurses to enable more people to receive specialist treatments at home. o With our partners we acquired \u00a31.3m funding to continue with the Health and Wellbeing Programme, enabling voluntary sector support for people over 50 needing help with 'what matters to them '. o The Foundation Trust laid on a number of free events for unpaid carers as part of Carers Rights Day. o Health Service Journal (HSJ) shortlisted our blood management team for a patient safety award. Supporting our sta ff o We welcomed our fifth cohort of nurses from the Philippines. o The NHS celebrated its 70th birthday on 5 July 2018.

Our vision is a community where we are all supported and empowered to be as well and as independent as possible, able to manage our own health and wellbeing, in our own homes. Whe n we need care, we have choice about how our needs are met only having to tell our story once. Our values and the NHS Constitution The NHS belongs to all of us and the NHS Constitution sets out the rights and responsibilities of patients and staff. We have adopted the core values of the NHS Constitution, consistent with our vision and our aim to improve quality through partnership. Our staff will put patients and service users first by following the NHS Constitution's core values: o Respect and dignity. o Commitment to quality of care. o Compassion. o Improving lives. o Working together for people. o Everyone counts. Our partners Our Foundation Trust is all about working in partnership with the people we serve at the centre. We work mainly with GPs and primary care, Devon County and Torbay C ouncils, the local community voluntary sector , and our main commissioner now called Devon Clinical Commiss ioning Group ('CCG') since the merger of NHS South Devon and Torbay CCG and NHS Northern, Eastern and Western Devon CCG, effective from 1 April 2019 . We have plans for the next four years to deliver real change in how services are provided. Key risks to performance , NHSI s tandards , emergency access , 4-hour ED wait In 2018/19, the Foundation Trust did not deliver the level of performance expected against the key NHSI performance standards. Emergency access standard: The winter in 201 8/19 highlighted system vulnerabilities to maintaining target waiting times in the Emergency Department , although system safeguards did give assurance that patient care and safety was maintained. This was further supported by an unannounced inspection of the Emergency Department by the Care Quality Commission; the feedback from which was very positive of the care provided. The principle risk being maintaining timely discharge and flow in to and out of the hospital setting, and in doing so to secure the Medic al Assessment area for direct GP emergency admissions piloted in December 2018 that clinical teams found invaluable in improving the care and delivery of the 4 hour standard. The system response in 201 8/19 was to deliver the actions identified following the assessment of learning from the previous winter. This included the establish ment of the Medical Assessment Service with additional staffing , the establishment of a 24/7 Clinical Site Team and additional nursing staff on medical wards , amongst other im provements. 14 The Foundation Trust has also increased capacity in domiciliary care and enhanced medical assessment capacity in the community with coordination with partners , to maintain system -wide oversight and ensure effective escalation. It is necessary to balance the risk to elective care and referral to treatment , and cancer standards when managing emergency care. In other words, when the re is pressure on the Emergency Department , this may impact on other care. The Board monitors this impact through reg ular monitoring and reporting of actual and forecast positions and may escalate further actions in relation to key NHSI performance indicators. Referral to treatment standard: Good progress has been made against delivery improvement against the key NHSI re ferral to treatment standard, including to reduce the number of people waiting 52 weeks for treatment by half and to have the number of people waiting longer than 18 weeks no higher in March 2019, than that in March 2018. In November 2018, two operating th eatres were closed due to concerns raised with ongoing ventilation and air conditioning issues. During the strip -out works, additional remedial structural works were identified putting the scheduled operational reopening of these theatres back to August 2 019. The result of the loss of two theatres meant that from December 2018 through to March 2019, the Foundation Trust did not achieve the planned trajectory for reducing to zero the number of our longest waiting patients waiting over 52 weeks to treatment from initial referral. In response to the impact from the loss of theatre capacity, plans were agreed to provide short term capacity through extended day working in other theatres with additional weekend lists and outsourcing to other providers. A recove ry trajectory based on this additional short term capacity plans was submitted to achieve a total of 72 people waiting longer than 52 weeks at the end of March 2019; this target figure was missed by just eight patients with a total of 78 being declared. Cancer standards: The Foundation Trust maintained its commitment to prioritise delivery of cancer standards with several significant investments to increase capacity across clinical teams and diagnostics capacity approved during 2018/19. Throughout the disruption from theatres the Foundation Trust made a commitment to protect theatre lists for cancer and urgent patients; this has been maintained. As a result of these investments, our plans for both the 14 day urgent referral and 62 day from urgent referral t o treatment cancer standard, forecast compliance for the 14 day urgent referral standard in October 2019, and the 62 day from urgent referral to treatment cancer standard in August 2019. This is set against the 11% increase in urgent two -week wait referra ls for suspected cancer and the associated increase in activity to meet this demand being carried forward in to the 2019/20 operational plan s. Diagnostics: In 2018/19 , the Foundation Trust has seen a deterioration in performance with March 2019 performance of 10.11% against a standard of 1%. Recovery plans are being drawn up to increase the support from mobile scanner visits to bolster capacity in 2019/20. These plans also take into account the replacement progra mme of aging equipment with both a CT and MR scanner scheduled to be replaced by March 2020 and the potential disruption this may cause to operational capacity. Further detail on key risks is set out in the Annual Governance Statement. 15 Going c oncern Under international accounting standards the Board of Directors is required to consider the matter of going concern. These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. Financial plans negotiated across the Devon Sustainability Partnership footpri nt were agreed and submitted on 23 May 2019. The Board of Directors acknowledge that the Foundation Trust, with the benefit of additional income agreed through that process, is forecasting a \u00a34.7m surplus for 2019/20. The forecast is based upon a number of assumptions including the delivery of cost improvement plans, the limited cash headroom within that plan, and that contracts will be signed in line with this agreement. In this context, the Board of Directors recognises the risk that the Foundation Trust might fail to deliver on its financial plan and require financial support from the Department of Health and Social Care during the course of 2019/20 in order to meet its liabilities and continue to provide healthcare services. The extent and nature of the financial support from the Department of Health and Social Care, including whether such support will be forthcoming or sufficient, is currently uncertain, as are any terms and conditions associated with the funding. The existence of such material uncertain ty may cast doubt about the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. The Trust will apply for cash support in line with current NHS Funding policy. After making enquiries, the Board of Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Trust has adeq uate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. The expectation is informed by the anticipated continuation of the provision of servi ce in the future, as evidenced by inclusion of financial provision for that service in the published documents. Contracts for Service are due to be signed with the Trust's main commissioners in the near future. The accounts do not include any adjustments t hat would result if the Foundation Trust was unable to continue as a going concern. In summary, the Board of Directors has reviewed the following and the Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust is considered as a going concern. o The Board of Directors has approved an Annual Plan which demonstrates compliance with its licence from NHS Improvement. The Trust has a positive cash balance and a committed working capital facility with the Independent Trust Financing Facility. o The Board of Directors has a Str ategic Plan which demonstrates compliance with its licence from Monitor. o The Trust does not intend to apply to the Secretary of State for the dissolution of the NHS Foundation Trust. o The Trust does not intend to transfer the services to another entity conc ern. 16 Performance Analysis National and Local Standards The purpose of this overview of performance is to provide the reader with sufficient information to understand how the organisation has performed against key regulator standards during the year. During the reporting period, performance reports we re provided monthly to the Finance, Performance and Investment Committee and the Board. These reports cover ed all the key national and local performance standards to provide assurance to the Board. In 201 8/19, against the operational performance indicators described in the Single Oversight Framework that are monitored by NHSI , we have performed as follows: 4 Hour Emergency Department ('ED') waiting times : In 2018/19 , performance has remained below the agreed trajectory of performance. Progress has been made with recruitment to nursing and middle grade doctor posts. These substantive recruitments have increased staffing resilience and team working across the emergenc y department and inpatient medical assessment teams. Feedback from an u nannounced CQC visit to the ED was positive in relation to the care provided and the joint working between the acute physicians and the ED consultants. The front door assessment mod el piloted in December 2018 supports direct GP referral to medical team assessment and much closer working between the emergency department and inpatient medical assessment teams. This change will become a key enabler to reduce overcrowding and to underpin i mproved resilience with reduced waiting time within the Emergency Department. This model of care has required investment to increase staffing levels to extend hours of senior front line presence including weekends in the assessment ward areas. The pilot de monstrated that a step change in performance can be achieved however , it has not been possible to maintain the availability of the assessment capacity during the winter months. Corporative Objective Target NHS I - OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE (NEW SINGLE OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK FROM OCTOBER 2017) A&E - patients seen within Building on this pilot in the coming year and in preparation for next winter our plans will focus o n creating the capacity to ring -fence sufficient assessment space to manage the daily number of direct emergency admissions. To support this development, thr ee clinically led and operational enabled task and finish groups have been established. o Front door: Emer gency ED and medical assessment; o Wards: Inpatient patient processes for review, treatment, flow and discharge planning ; and, o Home first: community cap acity to prevent admissions and maintain patients at home. The expected improvement in 2019/20 is to achieve a minimum performance of 90% in Q4 against the current 95% national standard. Referral to Treatment (RTT) access times : RTT performance t rajectory set out in our plans wa s to maintain performance at 81% for the first 6 months of 2018/19, and then increase to 82% for the remainder of the year . Performance followed this trajectory very closely with the investments and actions agreed in our pl ans halting any further deterioration in the performance that had been seen in the previous year against this standard. Waiting times remained a challenge in several specialties which were exacerbated by the failure of two operating theatres in November 2018. Our trajectory for the number of longest wait patients over 52 we eks was being achieved from July 20 18 to Nov ember 2018 however , due to the theatre failures we were unable to maintain this agreed trajectory of improvement for the remainder on 2018/19 . The Foundation Trust has worked with regulators NHSI to validate recovery plans and create more robust assurance process for future performance improvement. At the end of March 2019 the number of longest waiting patients over 52 weeks for treatment red uced to 79 against our target of 72. The plans for 2019/20 reflect the continued loss of capacity from theatre remedial works due for completion in August and then an improving position to have no patient waiting over 52 weeks by March 2020 . Cancer 62 day from urgent referral : Performance did not achieve the standard of 85% , with an average of 78.8% of patients referred on an urgent referral treated within 62 days of referral. Whilst not achieving the headline target of performance , teams have managed to see on average a 15% increase in urgent referrals and make solid progress with permanent staffing recruitment to build capacity across Urology Lower and Upper GI pathways. With these developments a trajectory of improvement has been confirmed to see standards achieved in 2019 /20. Diagnostics waiting times : Performance did not m eet the n ational standard of less than 1% of patients waiting over 6 weeks. Performance at the end of March 2019 wa s 13% of patients waiting over 6 weeks for diagnostic tests. The main pressure areas we re CT and MRI di agnostic tests. These services we re reliant upon additional capacity from visiting mobile van visits to maintain capacity levels and waiting times. A programme of additional mobile van visits is s cheduled for 2019 /20 to support improvement against these 18 diagnostic waiting times. Plans also include the replacement of one CT scanner and one MRI scanner, with a proposal being developed to have a third permanent on -site CT scanner in 2020. Dementia Fi nd: The assessment of patients who are admitted to hospital over the age of 75 for dementia was introduced as part of the updated Single Oversight Framework in October 2017. The standard wa s achieved with 92.8% of qualifying patients receiving timely deme ntia screening on admission to hospital. Assurance and performance monitoring : Bi-weekly assurance meeti ngs led by the Chief Operating O fficer review these key standards and operatio nal plans. Each month executive -led Quality and Performance R eview meetings are held with each of the Service Delivery Unit ('SDU') management teams covering medicine, surgery, community and women, children, diagnostics, and therapies. These meetings require SDU teams to review their quality and performance dashboar ds and to present plans where there are risks or concerns. This process gives the executive team and Board of Directors assurance of action plans and actions being taken. Summary of performance - 2018/19 c ompared to 2017/18 This year (2018/19) Previous year (2017/18) Total revenue income \u00a3441,046,000 \u00a3427,207,000 Foundation Trust funded capital expenditure (excluding capital acquired under absorption) \u00a314,009,000 \u00a36,642,000 Total revenue expenses (including PDC*, but excluding gain from absorption) \u00a3438,900,000 \u00a3410,518,000 Pay expenditure (excluding capitalised costs) (including depreciation and PDC) \u00a3198,177,000 \u00a3187,533,000 How much we spend per day and impairments) \u00a31,227,000 \u00a31,136,000 Full -Time Equivalent and includes worked FTE of bank and agency staff. 19 Financial performance Funding overview The Foundation Trust earned \u00a3441 million of income during 201 8/19, primarily from clinical activities, but also received a significant contribution from education and training and other income generation activities. In 2018 /19 much of the Foundation Trust 's clinical income was received under the terms of the Risk Share Agreement developed in support of the integrated care model, and in partnership with South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group and Torbay Council. Consequently, a far smaller proporti on received by the Foundation Trust was derived from act ivity undertaken at a tariff price, following the funding principles of the system known as Payment by Results (PbR), which is the norm in the sector. Under the Risk Share Agreement, most of the Foundation Trust 's patient -related income was funded on a bl ock-contract basis, with the Foundation Trust receiving a fixed amount of income for providing a defined range of services. Any underspends in a dult social care allocations in Torba y Council are allocated to the Foundation Trust and to the extent that exc ess costs drive a reduction in the planned surplus or deficit, South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning contribute 50% of any variation; effectively sharing the cost of system wide cost over -runs. It is important within such a model, where risk is shared across a system, to design health and care services that operate within the resource available to Commissioners. As a health and care system we have jointly developed an integrated model of care that we are confident will improve, or at worst mainta in, standards of care and at the same time reduce costs. Value for Money As an NHS Foundation Trust , we focus on ensuring the best possible economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the use of resources. We aim to provide the best possible health and socia l care within available resources. Ensuring value for money in all the Foundation Trust 's activities is therefore a fundamental part of our financial strategy. The Foundation Trust targeted delivery of \u00a326.9 m of savings in 2018/19 . This was the requirement of NHS Improvement in order for the Foundation Trust to deliver its revenue control total target . The Foundation Trust achieved a total of \u00a3 18.5m of income an d cost reduction in the year, \u00a3 8.0m of which is recurring in a full year, but with a non -recurr ent element in the year of \u00a3 10.5 m. To demonstrate value for money, the Foundation Trust uses benchmarking information such as the NHS productivity metrics. For procurement of non -pay related items, the Foundation Trust has a procure ment strategy which maximises value using national contracts and through collaboration with other NHS bodies in the Peninsula Purchasing and Supply Alliance. Capital developments d uring the last year During 2018 /19 the Foundation Trust continued to invest in its facilities and equipment and carried out capital projects totalling \u00a3 15.3 million. In addition to this sum the Foundation Trust received c haritable donations totalling \u00a3 1.3 million which has predominantly been invested in new me dical equipment. Part of the Foundation Trust 's capital expenditure has 20 been supported by the Public Dividend Capital received from the Department of Health and also supported by finance leases with commercial providers . Cashflow During the year the net cash balance decreased form a credit balance of \u00a36.1million to a net credit balance of \u00a32.2million. This was after accessing the Foundation Trust's working capital facility within year; the balance being accessed totalling \u00a310.5million. Therefore the net cash deterioration total led \u00a314.4million. The pri ncipal components driving this decrease in cash; one being the reported reve nue position for the year i.e. net deficit of \u00a32.0million (excluding the net reversal of impairments) ; repayment of existing debt principal of \u00a37.8million and capital expenditure investments made in excess of depreciation and external sources of capital funding of \u00a31.6million. The balance of the movement totalling \u00a33.0million relates to movements in worki ng capital (\u00a31.3million) and adjustments made to the opening reserves figure as a consequence of the introduction of the new IFRS9 and IFRS15 accounting standards (\u00a31.7million) . As descri bed in the Annual Accounts the Foundation Trust has an approved Revol ving Working Capital Facility in plac e with the Department of Health, which expires in September 2020 . The facility total led of \u00a3110m, of which \u00a310.5m was being used at 31 March 2019. Further details of cash movements are disclosed in the Cash Flow State ment within the Foundation Trust 's accounts. Financial framework Being licensed as an NHS Foundation Trust means that the Foundation Trust , as well as being more accountable to its local public and patients, has greater financial freedoms. NHS Foundation Trust s are free to retain any surpluses they generate and to borrow to support investment. As noted in Par t VI of th e annual report, the Foundation Trust 's financial performance is monitored by NHS Improvement. Accounting framework As an NHS Foundation Trust , we apply accounting policies compliant with NHS Improvements Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual , which are judged to be the most appropriate to our circumstances for giving a true and fair view. Accounting policies Accounting policies for pens ions and other retirement benefits are set out in a note to the full accounts (note 1.5) and details of senior employees ' remuneration are given in the Remuneration Report. Income from non -contracted activity A percentage of the Foundation Trust 's income i s from non -contracted income. In the absence of the last month's activity data being available at the time the accounts were prepared, an accrual for the income has been calculated, based on the non -contracted income activity to period 11. 21 Partially comple ted p atient spells Income in the accounts related to 'partially completed spells' is accrued based on the number of occupied bed days per care category, and an average cost per bed day per care category. Risk of fraud in revenue and e xpenditure recognition Under ISA (UK&I) 240 there is a (rebuttable) presumption that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition. The testing of revenue recognition, as set out in the external audit plan, is focused on utilising computer aided audit techniques. Audit work h as focussed on the areas of greatest risk, which is deemed as those which would show an overstatement in performance, either through overstatement of revenue or understatement of expenditure. Valuation of property, plant and equipment (PPE) The valuation of PPE is an elevated risk raised by the external auditors, as identified in their audit plan. This is due to the level of assumptions and estimation that is required by the District Valuer in their assessment of the values of land and buildi ngs (including buildings useful lives). The Foundation Trust engaged the District Valuer to perform a full revaluation durin g 201 8/19. As part of external audit's year -end procedures, PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC) have consulted with their own internal val uers to determine whether the valuation methodology and assumptions used were app ropriate. In addition, they have focused their testing on the information provided to the District Valuer for assessment. Charitable f unds Torbay and South Devon NHS Charitabl e Fund is a registered charity (number 1052232) and as such a separate legal entity, established to hold charitable donations given to Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust . Donations are received from individuals and organisations and are independe nt of the monies provided by the government. These charitable donations are a very important source of funds and continue to provide benefits for patients and service users. Based upon the most up to date figures (subject to audit), in 2018/19 the Charitab le Fund received donations and legacies totalling \u00a31,927 ,000. This included very generous donations of \u00a3 1,477 ,000 from the Leagues of Friends of our Hospitals towards the purchase of equipment and other items, including \u00a31,267 ,000 from the Torbay Hospital League of Friends . The Charitable Fund also received \u00a3 107,000 from Torbay Medical Research Fund in respect of various research projects within the Foundation Trust . Other donations have been used to purchase numerous items of medical and other equipment, as well as supporting the training and development of staff and patient /client welfare. Full details can be found in the Charitable Fund's Annual Report and Accounts, which is produced by the Foundation Trust in its role as Corporate Trustee. Emergen cy preparedness, response, and r esilience ('EPRR') On 29 October 2018, the Foundation Trust Board formally received and signed -off the outcome of the NHS England/CCG assessment against core standards in relation to its responsibilities as a Category 1 respond er under the Civil Contingencies Act (2004). The 22 Foundation Trust was substantially compliant with the EPRR core standards, apart from seven amber ratings in relation to the provision of a roster for decontamination, as the Foundation Trust relies on volun teer staff members, business continuity plans being written, a statement of compliance data protection governance and executive training portfolios. In addition to the assessment against core standards, NHS England and the Clinical Commissioning Group undertook a deep dive into the provision of an 'incident coordination centre'. Performance against eight criteria w ere rated as 'Good' with only one amber rating due to the availability of national guidance that is awaiting publication by NHS England. The Foundation Trust 's Chief Executive provided an assurance letter to NHS England describing the compliance position against core standards and the deep dive undertaken . Environmental matters and impact on the environment As an NHS organisation, and as a s pende r of public funds, we have an o bligation to work in a way that has a positive effect on the communities we serve. Sustainability means spending public money well , the smart and efficient use of natural resources and building healthy, resilient communities. In 2018/19, the Foundation Trust has continued t o reduce its environmental impact . In order to fulfil our responsibilities for the part we play, the Foundation Trust has undertaken risk assessments and has a Sustainable Development Management Plan ('SDMP') in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The Foundation Trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaption Rep orting requirements are complied with. Our SDMP recognises that as one of the largest employers in the region and a healthcare provider that promotes wellbeing, we have a responsibility to maximise our contribution to creating social value and ensure tha t our use of resources is efficient thus maximising the funds available for patient care. For the year 2018 /19, achievements include d:- Improving waste recycling throughout the Foundation Trust , achieving over 50% of the recycling target in 2018/19 - a con tinued improvement on the previous year's achievement. A joint project between the Foundation Trust 's procurement and waste management department led to a total of over six tonnes of furniture being re-used - a saving of \u00a340,000. Minimizing food waste in the way it is prepared, procured, and served, including composting coffee granules and promoting the Foundation Trust as a 'Refill ' water site (reducing usage of plastic bottles). Continuing to promote cycle to work and car sharing initiatives, includin g financial incentives for cycle purchases via a salary sacrifice scheme. Moving the Foundation Trust 's fleet of vehicles to electric charging and introducing electric charging points at Torbay Hospital. Maximising the estates grounds to support health and wellbeing at work including a woodland walk, landscaped gardens and a sensory garden. The Foundation Trust recognis es that to achieve greater efficiencies, it must make changes to its estate, both in terms of replacing the ageing pla nt infrastructure and continue to introduce energy efficient means of heating, lighting, and controls. While 23 capital monies have been limited over recent years, 2019 /20 sees a real opportunity for the Foundation Trust to improve sustainability within our infrastructure. The Foundation Trust is currently developing a business case having successfully received outline approval for a \u00a313.3m development of its Accident and Emergency Department . The new build ing extension will be designed to achieve building research establishment environmental assessment ('BREEAM') rating of 'excellent ', while the refurbishment of existing patient areas will present an opportunity to opt imise efficiencies, aiming for a 'good' rating . The Foundation Trust 's Health & Wellbeing Programme will also be progressed with BREEAM influencing its design, identifying opportunities to maximise efficiencies during construction. Social and community issues The Foundation Trust has a significant profile in the local area and sees its community role as important both as a health care provider and potential local employer. In addition to which our staff support many health related groups in both a business and volun tary capacity. We also enable our staff to play a full part in the community, for example by acting as governors for schools and colleges. During the year we continued to build on our links with schools and colleges by holding open day events for local students to hear about careers in the NHS. Our G overnors also organised a careers information day at South Devon College in which students heard from NHS professionals about the varied career opportunities available within the NHS. Anti-bribery and human rights issues Our internal processes ensure consistency with our zero tolerance approach to bribery and we work closely with our Local Counter Fraud Specialist ('LCFS') to raise awareness of our policies and procedures through local induction sessions and bespoke train ing. During the year the Foundation Trust commissioned a management database system to support the Foundation Trust 's compliance with NHS England guidance on managing conflicts of interest. We encourage anyone with a concern to speak out and report conc erns through our Foundation Trust policy. Employees can raise concerns through internal channels, either via our Freedom to Speak Up Guardians ('FTSU') or the LCFS . The FTSU and LCFS report periodically to the Board and the Audit Committee, respectively and the FTSU line management is direct to the Chief Executive. As an organisation we recognise the benefits of ethical procurement and professional training. We endorse membership of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply for our professional buying team. This in cludes the adoption of the Insti tute's code of conduct, which is also included within the Foundation Trust 's Standing Orders and Standards of Business Conduct. We also encourage our suppliers and contractors working on our behalf to challenge unethical behaviour and promote a 'speak up' culture. We have a number of policies in place which cover social, community, counter fraud, bribery and human rights matters. A process is in place to ensure that none of our policies have an adver se or discriminatory effect on patients and staff. The Foundation Trust has a Board approved anti -slavery and human trafficking statement, which is published on its website. 24 Important events since the end of the financial year There have been no material events affecting the Foundation Trust since the end of the financial year.

No political donations were made or received by the Foundation Trust in the reporting period. Independence of the n on-executive directors The Foundation Trust Board of Directors has assessed the independence of the Non - Executive Directors and co nsiders all current Non -Executive Directors to be independent in that there are no relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect their judgement as evidenced through their declarations of interest, previous employment, or tenure. Committees of t he Foundation Trust board of directors The Board has established the 'statutory' Committees requir ed by the NHS Act 2006 and the Foundation Trust Constitution. The Executive Nominations and Remuneration Committee, and the Audit Committee each disch arge the duties set out in the Foundation Trust Constitution and their Terms of Reference. The Board has chosen to deploy two additional 'designated' Committees to augment its monitoring, scrutiny, and oversight functions, particularly with respect to qual ity and financial risk management. These are the Quality Assurance Committee and the Finance, Performance, and Investment Committee. The role, functions and summary activities of the Boa rd's Committees are described in the Accountability Report . (a) Executive nominations and remuneration committee The purpose of the Executive Nominations and Remuneration Committee is to conduct the formal appointment to, and removal from office, of Executive Directors of the Foundation Trust , other than the Chief Executive who shall be appointed or removed by the Non - Executive Directors subject to approval by the Council of Governors. The Committee also considers succession planning for Executive Directors, considering the challenges and 29 opportunities facing the Foundation Trus t, and the skills and expertise that will be needed on the Board of Directors in the future. The Foundation Trust is also required to appoint a Remuneration Committee in accordance with Schedule 7 of the NHS Act 2006 (paragraph 18(2)), Schedule 1 of the Constitution, and the Monitor NHS Foundati on Trust Code of Governance. The Executive Nominations and Remuneration Committee fulfils the dual purpose of the two statutory committees for nomination and remuneration of Executive Directors. It also decides the r emuneration and allowances, and the other terms and conditions of office, of the Executive Directors, and reviews the suitability of structures of remuneration for senior managers. The Committee met on a number of occasions in the reporting period to consi der changes in remuneration for Executive Directors and to lead on the appointments of Executive Directors, namely the Chief Executive and Director of Transformation and Partnerships as a result of retirements. The appointment of the Foundation Trust 's Ch ief Operating Officer to the substantive position of Chief Executive following a period of acting as Chief Executive also resulted in the Chief Operating Officer position being appointed to on a n interim basis prior to being filled on a substantive basis. The Committe e was supported in the recruitment process by an external recruitment consultant. The Chair of the Committee submitted a report to the Board following each meeting, highlighting any matters requiring disclosure to the Board. (b) Audit c ommittee The Foundation Trust 's Audit Committee works in parallel with the Quality Assurance Committee with a shared membership. This provides the Non -Executive Directors with two perspectives on similar or related data, allowing for comparison or 'triangulation' in considering due processes as well as tangible outcomes. Terms of Reference for both committees are published in the public domain. The Audit Committee consists entirely of Non -Executive Directors and reviews the effectiveness of systems of governance, ris k management and internal control across the whole of the Foundation Trust 's activities. By comparison, the Quality Assurance Committee reviews the actions being taken by the Foundation Trust to ensure the on -going maintenance of standards of quality of ca re, and improvements where necessary to patient experience. During 2018/19 the Audit Committee reviewed the adequacy of: o all risk and control -related disclosure statements, together with any accompanying Head of Internal Audit Opinion statement, external a udit opinion or other appropriate independent assurances, prior to endorsement by the Board; o underlying assurance processes that indicated the degree of the achievement of corporate objectives, the effectiveness of the management of principal risks, the co ntrols in place and the appropriateness of the disclosure statements; o policies for ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory, legal and code of conduct requirements , including the implementation of new accounting standards (IFRS 9 and 15) ; 30 o policies and procedures for all work related to fraud and corruption as set out in Secretary of State Directions and as required by the Counter Fraud and Security Management Service ; and o the Committee's Terms of Reference and work plan. The Committee sought reports a nd assurances from Directors and managers as appropriate, concentrating on the over -arching systems of governance, risk management and internal control, together with indicators of their effectiveness; notably, the committee - initiated improvements to the B oard Assurance Framework. As part of the year -end reporting process, the Director of Finance presented the impact of the two new accounting standards, IFRS 9 and 15 on the Foundation Trust final outturn position, which the Audit Committee considered for o nward reporting to the Board. Note 35 provides further detail relating to the reassessment undertaken in relation to IFRS 9 and 15. The Committee met on five occasions in the reporting period , and was attended by the Director of Finance and other senior managers, including the Chief N urse and Company Secretary. A g overnor observer was also in attendance . The Committee undertook a self - assessment during the year and also reviewed its terms of reference. The Chair of the Committee submitted a report to the Board following each meeting, highlighting any issues requiring disclosure to the Board. No additional non -audit services were required during the period. Audit committee c hair's opinion and r eport In support of the Chief Executive's responsibilities a s Accounting Officer for the Foundation Trust , the Audit Committee has examined the adequacy of systems of governance, risk management and internal control within the Foundation Trust . From information supplied, and formed the opinion that: o there is a gene rally adequate framework of control in place to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of objectives and management of risk; o assurances received are sufficiently accurate, reliable, and comprehensive to meet the Accounting Officer's needs and t o provide reasonable assurance; o governance, risk management and internal control arrangements within the Foundation Trust include aspects of excellence as well as aspects in which on-going attention to the control improvement is required; o financial contr ols are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance against material misstatement or loss; and o the quality of both Internal Audit and External Audit over the past year has been satisfactory. The Committee discharged its role through the year as follows: o we reviewed the establishment and maintenance of an effective system of governance, risk management and internal control across the whole of the Foundation Trust 's activities (both clinical and non -clinical) ; o we ensured that there was an effective internal audit function established by management that meets mandatory NHS Internal Audit Standards and provides appropriate independent assurance to the Committee. The 31 Committee reviewed and approved the internal audit plan, ensuring that it was consistent with the audit needs of the organisation as identified by the Assurance Framework. We considered the major findings of internal audit's work (and management's response). The Internal Auditor had unrestricted access to the chair of the Committee for confidential discussion; o we reviewed the work and findings of the external auditor and considered the implications and management's response to their work. The External Auditor had unrestricted access to the chair of the com mittee for confidential discussion; o we reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements before submission to the Board ; o we ensured the Standing Financial Instructions and Standing Orders were maintained and kept up to date, with an annual review of inst ances where exceptions to the rules were made ; o we reviewed the findings of other significant assurance functions, both internal and external to the organisation, and considered the implications to the governance of the Foundation Trust . This included a reg ular report from the NHS Counter Fraud Service and the independent review of the Estates department ' and o additionally, we specifically reviewed the Foundation Trust 's information governance procedures, its Whistle Blowing Policy, and sought assurances regarding the control of data used in the Quality Report. (c) Quality assurance c ommittee The Foundation Trust Board of Directors established the Quality Assurance Committee to support the Board in discharging its responsibilities for monitoring the quality of the Foundation Trust 's services. This includes the essential standards of quality (as determined by Care Quality Commission's registration requirements), and national targets and indicators (as determined by NHSI's Single Oversight Framework ). The Committee's work plan is aligned to the Foundation Trust 's corporate objectives and associated risks. The Commit tee reviews the outcomes associated with clinical services and patient experience and, the suitability and implementation of risk mitigation plans regarding their potential impact on patient outcomes. The Committee is also required, as directed by the Boar d from time to time, to consider issues relating to quality where the Board requires this additional level of scrutiny. During the year, the Committee considered: o the Quality Strategy and associated priorities; o the Patient Experience Strategy; o the Voluntee r Strategy; o patient surveys; and, o the monthly Integrated Quality, Finance, and Performance Report . Additional reviews have included serious incidents; complaints; maternity ; and the 62 -day cancer treatment target. 32 The Committee met six times during this reporting period. A Governor observer was present at each meeting. The Chair of the Committee submitted a report to the Board following each meeting, highlighting any issues requiring disclosure to the Board. (d) Finance, p erformance, and investment committee The Finance, Performance, and Investment Committee has delegated authority from the Foundation Trust Board of Directors, subject to any limitations imposed by the Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board, to r eview and make such arrangements as it considers appropriate on matters relating to: o control and management of the finances of the Foundation Trust ; o target level of efficiency savings and actions to ensure these are achieved; o budget setting principles; o year-end forecasting; o commissioning; and, o capital planning . The Finance, Performance, and Investment Committee met on twelve occasions during this reporting period. A Governor observer was present at each meeting. The Chair of the Committee submitted a report to the Board following each meeting, highlighting any issues requiring disclosure to the Board. The Committee undertook a review of its Terms of Reference during Q uarter 4 and agreed a change of name for the Committee from April 2019 onwards to Finance, Performance and Digital Committee to reflect the broadened scope of the work of the Committee . Enhanced q uality governance r eporting The Board was satisfied during the year that, to the best of its knowledge and using its own process es (supported by Care Quality Commission information), the Foundation Trust had, and will keep in place, effective leadership arrangements for monitoring and continually improving the quality of health and social care, including: o ensuring required standar ds are a chieved (internal and external); o investigating and ac ting on substandard performance; o planning and managing continuous improvement; o identifying, sharing, and ensuring delivery of best -practice; and o identifying and managing risks to quality of care . This encompasses an assurance that due consideration was given to the quality implications of plans (including service redesigns, service developments and cost improvement plans) and that processes would be in place to monitor their on -going impact on qu ality and take subsequent action as necessary to ensure quality is maintained. The basis of the Board of Directors confirmation was set out in the draft corporate governance statement to be submitted to Monitor at the end of June 2019, which was prepared a fter due and careful enquiry. The Annual Governance Statement provides further information. 33 Membership and a ttendance at board and c ommittee meetings The Foundation Trust Board of Directors discharge d its duties during 2018/19 in ten meetings, and through the work of its Committees. The Chairman of the Board submitted a report to the Council of Governors (the 'CoG') at each meeting, highlighting any matters requiring disclosure to the Council. The table below shows the membership and attendance of Directors at meetings of the Board and Board Committees during the year .

The Chief Executive appraises individual Executive Directors. Non -Executive Directors and the Chief Executive are appraised by the Chairman . The Chairman is appraised by the Senior 34 Independent Director in conjunction with th e Governors ' Nominations and Appointments Committee. The Foundation Trust Board of Directors undertakes a self -assessment of its performance each year to establish whether it has adequately and effectively discharged its role, functions, and duties . For the reporting period, the Board's performance, considering the role, function, and work of the Board Committees, was of the requisite standard. The Board believes that it is balanced and complete in its composition and appropriate to the requirements o f the organisation. This was attributed to the comprehensive annual cycle of reporting, a robust Board Assurance Framework and Risk Register, and a development plan undertaken under the guidance of the Chair and Company Secretary. The findings of the internal audit, combined with the Head of Internal Audit Opinion set out in the Annual Governance Statement, support the Board's conclusion. Similar assessment exercises were undertaken for each of the Committees of the Board, all of which were considered to h ave fully discharged the duties set out in their Terms of Reference. The c ouncil of governors The Council of Governors is responsible for discharging the general duties set out in legislation which are: o to hold the non -executive directors individually and collectively to account for the performance of the board of directors ; and o to represent the interests of the members of the Foundation Trust as a whole and the interests of the public. The Council of Governors discharge d its statutory duties as set in the NHS Code of Governance supported through its sub -committees and working groups. It remains the responsibility of the Foundation Trust Board of Directors to design and implement the strategy of the Foundation Trust . The Council of Governors and Foundation Trust Board of Directors communicate principally through the Chairman who is the formal conduit Chairman of the two corporate entities. This relationship is formally extended and augmented by Governors and Directors participation in Council to Board meeting s to ensure constant and clear communication and co -operation between the Board and the Council of Governors. Additionally, Directors regularly attend meetings of the Council of Governors and Governors regularly attend meetings of the Board. The Board of D irectors may request the Chair man to seek the views of the Council of Governors on any matters it may determine.

The Foundation Trust Secretariat maintains a register of interests, which is available to members of the public by contacting the Company Secretary at the address given at 'Appendix B - Further information and contact d etails '. Committees of the council of g overnors The Council of Governors has appointed two standing committees and one working group. These are: (a) Non-executive directors' nomination and remuneration c ommittee The Non -Executive Directors' Nomination and Remuneration Committee is a formal Committee o f the Council established in accordance with the NHS Act 2006, the Foundation Trust Constitution, and the Monitor NHS Foundation Trust Code of 37 Governance for carrying out the duties of G overnors with respect to appointments, remuneration and other terms of service of the Chairman and Non -Executive Directors. Its functions include: o to receive advice as necessary on overall remuneration and terms and conditions of service for the Chairman and Non -Executive Directors; o to recommend to the Council of Governors t he levels of remuneration and terms and conditions of service for Chairman and Non -Executive Directors; o to monitor the performance of the Non -Executive Directors through the Foundation Trust Chairman; o to monitor the performance of the Foundation Trust Chairman through the Senior Independent Director; to undertake a periodic review of the numbers, structure, and composition (including the person specifications) of the Chairman and Non -Executive Directors, to reflect the expertise and experience required, an d to make recommendations to the Council of Governors; o to develop succession plans for the Chairman and Non -Executive Directors, considering the size and compos ition of the Foundation Trust ; and o identify and nominat e candidate s to fill the Chairman and No n-Executive Director posts as they arise . The Committee met during the year to consider remuneration levels for Non -Executive Directors, re -appointment of Non -Executive Directors and the recruitment of a Non - Executive Director to replace a retiring Non -Executive Director post the year -end. An external recruitment agency was commissioned to support the recruitment process. (b) Quality and compliance committee The Committee is a formal Committee of the Council esta blished in accordance with the Foundation Trust Constitution for monitoring, reviewing, and reporting on the quality of clinical and social care services provided by the Foundation Trust . Its functions include the review of: o the systems in place to ensure the delivery of safe, high quality, person - centred care. o quality indicators flagged as of concern through escalation reporting or as requested by the Foundation Trust Board. o progress in implementing action plans to address short comings in the quality of services, should they be identified. o progress on the Care Model Strategy. It is the Quality and Compliance Committee 's responsibility to write the G overnor statement in the quality report contained within the annual report and ac counts . 38 (c) Membership g roup The group is a formal w orking group esta blished in accordance with the Foundation Trust constitution for monitoring, maintaining, and advancing the Foundation Trust 's membership. Its functions include: o advice - by offering advice and information to the Council of Governors on the community perception of the Foundation Trust 's cond uct of its healthcare provision; o recruitment - by seek ing to maintain the registered membership at its present level and to maintain under review mean s of achieving a representation of all sectors of the community; o information - by promot ing a series of seminars and events for members and members of the public , focusing on significant sectors of the Foundation Trust 's work; o engagement - by promot ing communications to and from members; and, o partnerships - by actively working with Healthwatch, the local Patient Participation Groups and other appropriate agencies whose experience might add to the pool of knowledge about the public response to the Foundation Trust and the delivery of its services. Membership and m eetings o f the council of g overnors Membership is free and aims to give local people and staff a greater influence over how our services are provided and developed. It also helps the Trust to work much more closely with local people and service users. Our members have the chance to find out more about the hospitals, our community services, the way they are run and the challenges they face, and furthermore, help us work with local people to improve t he care and experience of patients and their carers. Members also elect representatives to the Council of Governors. The Foundation Trust had 16,709 members as at 31 March 2019, split between 10,473 public members and 6,236 staff members . The public constituencies of South Hams and Plymouth (eastern), Teignbridge and Torbay comprised 1,185 members; 3,848 members; and, 5,440 members, respectively. Public membership is open to people aged 14 or over and who live within our defined membership area. All eligible staff members automatically become Foundation Trust staff members unless they choose to opt out. Staff are eligible for membership provided that they hold a permanent contract of employment with us or they have been employed by the Trust on a te mporary contract of 12 months or longer . The Council of Governors met on a total of f our occasions during 2018/19. This included its four Council of Governors meetings and the Annual Members' Meeting at which the Annual Report was presented to the Governors by the Board. Figures in brackets indicate the number of meetings the individual could be expected to attend by their membership of the Board or Committee.

For this year's asses sment, an on -screen survey was used to capture Governors' responses to a range of questions framed in the context of the duties of governing bodies. Results of the survey were assessed to identify areas of development for the Council as well as priorities to be addressed in the forthcoming year. These are summarised in the Council's Strategy document available on request from the Company Secretary at the address given at \" Appendix B - Further information and contact d etails \". Stakeholder relations In addition to our partnership working, we engage directly with other stakeholders including our patients, service users, carers, families, and the public to understand, listen and where possible adapt or change the services we offer and recognise the value of their ideas about these how services can be developed and improved. The Foundation Trust Board recognises the importance of understanding the service use r experience and continues its commitment to receive a service user story at each Board meeting. With such a large public membership, this allows the organisation to harness and utilise the experience of our members, who provide the Foundation Trust with k nowledgeable information. The Foundation Trust Governors as well as patient representatives also attend important groups such as the Quality Improvement Group, Mortality Surveillance Group, and Learning from Complaints / Engagement Group so that the Founda tion Trust better understands the service user experiences needs and experiences. Information and feedback is received from many quarters including national surv eys, local surveys run through c linical effectiveness and consultations, these provide a rich source of data and with the National surveys benchmark data we can use for comparisons. We also receive valuable ideas and suggestions from well -established patient pathways, social media and service user groups which operate within the Foundation Trust . The Foundation Trust also works with external organisations such as Healthwatch and seAp (a charity providing independent and confidential advocacy services) , both of which are seen as providing a valuable source of information from local people who use Foundation Trust services. This partnership working is welcomed. The Council of Governors' Membership Group, focuses on ensuring there is an ongoing dialogue with Foundation Trust members and that the Foundation Trust continues to develop the membership to make it as representative as possible of the whole community. Public membership at the end of March 2018 totalled 10,389 and 10,473 at the end of March 2019. This represents around seven per cent of the households in the Foundation Trust 's catchment area. Members of the public, living in any of the three public constituencies and aged over 14, are eligible to become members. Among the critical components to our being a successful health and care provider is our leadership. We strengthene d our Board of Directors during the year through the re- 41 appointment of two experienced Non -Executive Director s and post year -end the successful appointm ent of a Non -Executive Director who succeed ed an existing Non - Executive Director when their term of offi ce expire d Another important factor to strong organisational leadership is to be found in the partnerships we have forged - critical to us as an integrated care organisation. During the previous reporting period, the Foundation Trust consulted extensivel y with its staff to inform a new organisational structure for operational delivery - one which w ould best support how the Foundation Trust delivers health and social care for each of the localities it serves. The system leadership structure was developed following consultation and implemented in April 2019 with the premise of managing services in each locality. Fees and charges (income generation) Costs associated with fees and charges levied by the Foundation Trust are set out in note 5 to the annual a ccount s. Income disclosures required by Section 43(2A) of the NHS Act 2006 As disclosed in the Foundation Trust 's annual accounts, the Foundation Trust complies with the need to ensure that income from the provision of goods and services for health service s in England is greater than its income from the provision of goods and services for any other purpose; Section 43(2A) of the NHS Act 2006 (as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2012). The other income that the Foundation Trust receives either full y covers the cost of those services or for income generating activities, profit is directly reinvested into the provision of health and social care. Counter Fraud The Foundation Trust acknowledges that it has a responsibility to ensure that public money is spent appropriately and that it has policies in place to counter fraud, bribery, and corruption. The Foundation Trust has detailed standing financial instructions, standing orders, N HSCFA compliant standards of business conduct policy and a counter fraud, bribery, and corruption policy to ensure probity. The Foundation Trust has support from an experienced independent Local Counter Fraud Specialist (LCFS) to ensure risks are mitigated and systems are resilient to fraud and corruption. The Audit Committee receives and approves the counter fraud annual work plan and annual report, monitors co unter fraud arrangements at the Foundation Trust and reports on progress to the Board. During 2018/19 a total of 197 days were provided. The Foundation Trust raises awareness of fraud in its staff communications through regular newsletters, displays in public and staff areas, new employee induction and individual department awareness presentations fro m the LCFS. Cost allocation and charging guidance The Foundation Trust has complied with the cost allocation and charging guidance issued by HM Treasury and Regulators. 42 Better payment code of practice The Better Payment Practice Code requires the Foundation Trust to aim to pay all undisputed invoices by the due date or within 30 days of receipt of goods or a valid invoice, whichever is later. No payments were made during the year (2017: \u00a3Nil) under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Ac t 1998. 2018/19 2017/18 Number \u00a3000 Number \u00a3000 Total year 127,505 202,840 115,696 178,176 Total Non 113,637 175,391 102,705 149,834 Percentage of Non target 89% 86% 89% 84% Total NHS trade invoices year 1,863 7,803 1,704 10,684 Total NHS trade invoices 1,440 5,169 1,289 6,331 Percentage of 77% 66% 76% 59% Accessible Information Standard NHS England mandated the Accessible Information Standard on 24th June 2015, which applies to all organisations providing NHS or Adult Social Care. Organisations are required to follow the standard by law. The Accessible I nformation Standard directs and defines a specific, consistent approach to identifying, recording, flagging, sharing, and meeting individuals' information and communication support needs. The Foundation Trust has assigned an implementation lead and lead d irector to drive forward work in this important area and continues to make progress through collaboration with service users. Statement as to Disclosure to Auditors (s418) The Board of Directors reports that for everyone who is a director at the time this report is approved: o as far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the NHS Foundation Trust 's auditor is unaware; and o the director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to ma ke themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the NHS Foundation Trust 's auditor is aware of that information. \"Relevant audit information\" means information needed by the NHS Foundation Trust 's auditor in connection with prep aring their report. A director is regarded as having taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to do the things mentioned above, and: o made such enquiries of their fellow directors and of the corporation's auditors for that purpose; an d o taken such other steps (if any) for that purpose, as are required by their duty as a director of the company to exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence. 43 The directors consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for patients, regulators and other stakeholders to assess the NHS Foundation Trust 's performance, business model and strategy.

A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is the actuarially assessed capital value of the pension scheme benefits accrued by a member at a point in time. The benefits valued are the member's accrued benefits and any contingent spouse's pension p ayable 47 from the scheme. A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme, or arrangement to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme or arrangement when the member leaves a scheme and chooses to transfer the benefits accrued in their former scheme. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued because of their total membership of the pensi on scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which the disclosure applies. The CETV figures, and from 2005 -06 the oth er pension details, include the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transfer red to the NHS pension scheme. They also include any additional pension benefit accrued to the member because of their purchasin g additional years of pension service in the scheme at their own cost. CETVs are calculated in accordance with SI 2008 No.1050 Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) Regulations 2008. Real Increase in CETV - this reflects the increase in CETV effec tively funded by the employer. It does not include the increase in accrued pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee (including the value of any benefits transferred from an other scheme or arrangement) and uses common market valuation fa ctors for the start and end of the period. On 16 March 2016, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a change in the Superannuation Contributions Adjusted for Past Experience (SCAPE) discount rate from 3.0 per cent to 2.8 per cent. This rate affects the calculation of CETV figures in this report. Due to the lead time required to perform calculations and prepare annual reports, the CETV figures quoted in this report for members of the NHS Pension scheme are based on the previous discount rate and have not been recalculated. 48 Annual statement on remuneration The Foundation Trust has established two committees responsible for the remuneration, appointments and nominations of directors. A description of the committee responsible for Non-Executive Director remuneration can be found in the section 'Committees of the Council of Gover nors'. The committee responsible for the remuneration of Executive Directors is described below. The role of the Executive Nominations and Remuneration Committee The Executive Nominations and Remuneration Committee ('the Committee') advises the Board on matters regarding the remuneration and terms of service for senior managers. The Committee is established for the purpose of overseeing the recruitment and selection process for executive directors and associate directors i.e. senior managers, and the appointment of formal Board positions, for example the senior independent director. The Committee's second purpose is to determine the remuneration and terms of service of Executive Directors and Associate Directors. The term 'senior managers' covers Founda tion Trust employees in senior positions, who have authority and responsibility for directing and controlling major Foundation Trust activities. These employees influence the decisions of the entire Foundation Trust , meaning that the definition covers the Chief Executive and Board -level directors. The advice offered covers all aspects of salary, including performance -related pay and bonuses , as applicable , pensions, provision of cars, insurance, and other benefits. Advice on arrangements for termination of contracts and other general contractual terms also falls within the remit of the Committee. Specifically, the Committee is charged with: o advising on appropriate contracts of employment , including remuneration , for senior managers; o monitoring and evaluatin g the performance of individual senior managers; o making recommendations regarding the award of performance -related pay based; on both the Foundation Trust 's performance and the performance of individuals; and o advising on the proper calculation of any termi nation payments. The Committee is empowered to obtain independent advice as it considers necessary. At all times, it must have regard to the Foundation Trust 's performance and national arrangements for pay and terms of service for senior managers. The Co mmittee meets several times a year, to enable it to make its recommendations to the Board. It formally reports to the Board, explaining its recommendations and the basis for the decisions it makes. The Commi ttee's membership includes all N on-Executive Directors. The Chief Executive and other senior managers should not be present when the Committee meets to discuss their individual remuneration and terms of service but may attend by invitation from the Committee to discuss other staff's terms. Accordingl y, the Chief Executive and the Director of Workforce and Organisational Development attend the Committee when required. The Company Secretary attends the Committee in an advisory capacity. 49 Senior managers' remuneration p olicy The remuneration package for senior managers consists of the following factors: Item Rationale Salary The Foundation Trust strategy and business planning process sets the key business objectives of the Foundation Trust which are delivered by the senior managers. This success measure is one of the ways in which the senior managers' performance is monitored. Foundation Trust senior managers' remuneration is based on market rates and there is no automatic salary rises. To ensure that the pay and terms of service offered by the Foundation Trust are both reasonable and competitive, comparisons are made between the scale and scope of responsibilities of senior managers at the Foundation Trust and those of employees holding similar roles in other organisations. A report is prepared for the Executive Nominations and Remuneration Committee by the Director of Workforce and Organisational Development, which makes these comparisons between the Foundation Trust 's remuneration rates f or senior managers and market rates. The base salaries of Executive Directors in post at the start of the policy period and who remain in the same role throughout the policy period will not usually be increased by a higher percentage than the maximum incr emental uplift applicable to the highest paid staff on Agenda for Change. The only exceptions are where an Executive Director has been appointed at below market level to reflect experience. Senior managers are paid spot level salaries rather than on an inc remental scale and may collectively receive an annual uplift depending on the decisions taken by the Executive Nominations and Remuneration Committee. All senior managers' remuneration is subject to satisfactory performance of duties in line with their emp loyment. There is no performance related pay so senior managers receive one hundred per cent of their salary subject to the relevant deductions. Taxable benefits The Executive Nominations and Remuneration Committee agree any taxable benefit . This forms p art of the recruitment and retention of senior managers by ensuring that the Foundation Trust remains competitive. There is no maximum amount payable. Pension Standard pension arrangements are in place in 201 8/19. This forms part of the recruitment and retention of senior managers by ensuring that the Foundation Trust remains competitive. There is no maximum amount payable. Bonus There is no bonus scheme for any senior manager in Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust . The maximum that could be paid is \u00a3nil. All other staff are subject to Agenda for Change pay rates, terms and conditions of service, which are determined nationally . Other Individual items such as lease cars are not offered as part of a remuneration package. Board level directors may, however, put forward an individual request in respect of such items. Senior managers' terms and conditions e.g. holidays, pensions, sick pay are in accordance with Agenda for Change terms and conditions. 50 For Executive Directors there are no arrangements relating to termination payments other than the application of employment contract law. No significant awards have been made to either present or past senior managers within 2018/19. During the year ending 31 March 201 9, two Executive Directors and senior managers were paid more than \u00a3142,500 as identified by the remuneration report (audited information) . The steps outlined above provides the Executive Nominations and Remuneration Committee with assurance that th e remuneration level is reasonable and linked appropriately to the weight of th e role based on accountability, job responsibilities and the knowle dge and skills required for each of those positions . Remuneration is set in accordance with NHS Agenda for Change for all staff other than doctors and directors . Pay and conditions of service for doctors is agreed nationally. Senior manager's objectives an d performance Senior managers meet annually with the Chief Executive to agree core and individual performance objectives and subsequently meet with the Chief Executive monthly to discuss the progress made towards the targets set. A formal interim progress review is held six months after the objectives were set; a final review of performance and achievement of objectives is held at the end of the year, when objectives for the following year are also discussed and agreed. The Chief Executive's performance is appraised using the same system, but their performance objectives are agreed with and monitored by the Chairman. This process was designed to ensure that clearly defined and measurable performance objectives are agreed, and progress towards these objectiv es is regularly and openly monitored, both formally and informally. The Chief Executive presents an assurance report to the Committee each year outlining the appraisal process undertaken. The Committee also receives a summary report on the performance of each of the executive directors and associate director and a recommendation in respect of any proposed changes to remuneration levels. The Chairman adheres to the same process in regard to the Chief Executive. Chairman and non -executive director r emunera tion Chair man and Non -Executive Director remuneration is overseen by the Non -Executive Director Nominations and Remuneration Committee ('Committee') as outlined in the Accountability Report 'Committees of the Council of Governors' section . The Committee makes recommendations to the Council of Governors on the Non -Executive Director s and Chairman's remuneration levels. The Chairman and Non -Executive Directors receive spot level remuneration but can claim reasonable expenses , for example travel expenses, as per other employees. The Non -Executive Directors (excluding the Foundation Trust Chairman), receive baseline remuneration currently set by the Council of Governors at \u00a313,000 per annum with some Non -Executive Directors receiving an additional one -off responsibility allowance based on Board positions held. The remuneration package for the Chairman and other Non -Executive Directors remain the same as the previous year and are made up of: 51 Item Rationale Remuneration \u00a345,000 per annum for the Non -Executive Chairman - three days per week Remuneration \u00a313,000 per annum for all other Non -Executive Directors - three days per month Remuneration Additional responsibility allowance of \u00a33,000 for the Chair of the Audit Com mittee Remuneration Additional responsibility allowance of \u00a31,500 given to the Senior Independent Director (SID*) Remuneration Additional responsibility allowance of \u00a31,000k given to the Vice Chair Expenses Chairman and Non -Executive Director mileage r ates are aligned with latest guidance; 56p per mile for the first 3,500 miles reducing to 20p per mile thereafter. All other expenses remain in line with Foundation Trust policy .

Governors' e xpenses Governors may be reimbursed for legitimate expenses, incurred during their official duties, as Governors of the Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust . During the financial year, a number of Governors were paid expenses to reimburse their travel costs incurred while attending meetings of the Foundation Trust and at external training and development events. 31 March 20 19 31 March 2018 Number of Governors in office 26 25 Number of Governors receiving expenses 7 10 Total expenses paid to Governors \u00a32,019.52 \u00a32,117.43 Fair pay m ultiple (audit ed information ) Reporting bodies are required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration of the highest paid Director in their organisation and the median remuneration of the organisation's workforce. The banded remuneration of the highest -paid Director in Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust in the financial year 201 8/19 was \u00a31 85,000 - \u00a3190,000 (201 7/18, \u00a3170,000 - \u00a3175,000). This was 6. 6 times (2017 /18, 6.5 ) the median remuneration of the workforce, which was \u00a32 8,050 (2017 /18, \u00a326,260). In both 2018/19, no employees (2017/18, 5) received remuneration in excess of the highest paid Director . Remuneration ranged from \u00a317 ,460 to \u00a3185,000 . (2017/18, \u00a315,404 - \u00a3509,227) remuneration includes salary and non -consolidated performance -related pay. It does not include benefits -in-kind, severance payments, employer pension contributions and cash equivalent transfer value of pensions. The median calculation is based on the full -time equivalent staff of the Foundation Trust at the reporting period end date on an annualised basis. Definition of 'senior m anagers' The definition of 'senior managers' is 'those persons in senior positions having authority or responsibility for directing or controlling t he major activities of the NHS Foundation Trust '. This includes the Chief Executive, Chairman, Executive , Associate and Non -Executive Directors. This definition covers all t hose who hold or have held office as Chairman, Non - 53 Executive Director, Executive Director, Associate Director or senior manager of the NHS Foundation Trust during the reporting year. It is irrelevant that: o an individual was not substantively appointed (hol ding office is sufficient, irrespective of defects in appointment) ; o an individual's title as Director included a prefix such as 'interim, acting, temporary or alternate' ; or, o an individual was engaged via a corporate body, such as an agency, and payments were made to that corporate body rather than to the individual directly. Liz Davenport , Chief Executive 28 May 2019 54 Part IV - Staff Report Analysis of staff costs (audited information) The Foundation Trust is required to provide an analysis of staff costs, in categories defined in the NHS Information Centre's Occupational Code Manual.

Analysis of worked full time equivalents (FTEs) (audited information) The Foundation Trust is required to provide an analysis of average staff numbers, in categories defined in the NHS Information Centre's Occupational Code Manual. This analysis distinguishes between 'permanently employed' and 'other' staff. The average number of employees is c alculated as the whole time equivalent number of employees under contract of service in each week in the financial year, divided by the number of weeks in the financial year. The \"contracted hours\" method of calculating whole time equivalent number is used , that is, dividing the contracted hours of each employee by the standard working hours. Staff on outward secondment are not included in the average number of employees. During 2018/19 , the Foundation Trust reviewed the way in which it categorises staff numbers, in order to improve alignment with NHS Digital's guidance on the categorisation of staff using Occupation Codes. The principal outcome of this review was an increase in the number of staff classified as 'Healthcare assistants and other support staf f' and corresponding reductions in other categories (principally 'Administration and Estates', 'Nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff' and 'Scientific, therapeutic and technical staff'). 2017/18 prior year values have been restated accordingly . 55 2018/19 2017/ 18 Total Number Permanently Employed Other Number Total Number Medical and dental 526 501 25 501 Ambulance staff - - - - Administration and estates 1,144 1,137 7 1,108 Healthcare assistants and other support staff 1,757 1,757 - 1,706 Nursing, midwifery, and health visiting staff 1,189 40 1,231 Nursing, midwifery and health visiting learners - - - - Scientific, therapeutic, and technical staff 692 678 14 669 Healthcare science staff 95 95 - 78 Social care staff 122 - 122 115 Total staff numbers (average) 5,565 5,357 208 5,408 Of which number of employees (WTE) engaged on capital projects 39 39 - 22 Analysis of sickness absence The Foundation Trust continues to develop the overall health and wellbeing of its workforce, and management of sickness absence. The sickness absence rate for the 2018 compared to the previous two years is shown below. Year 12 months sickness FTE FTE days available FTE days lost to sickness Digital - Sickness Absence and Workforce Publications - based on data from the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) Data Warehouse. *Period covered: January to December 2018. *Data items: ESR does not hold details of the planned working/non -working days for employees so days lost and days available are reported based upon a 365 -day year. *The number of Full -Time Equivalent (FTE) days available has been taken directly from ESR. This has been converted to FTE years in the first column by dividing by 365. *The number of FTE days lost to sickness absence has been taken directly from ESR. The adjusted FTE days lost has been calculated by multiplying by 225/365 to give the Cabinet Office measure. *The average number of sick days per FTE has been estimated by dividing the FTE days by the FTE days lost and mul tiplying by 225/365 to give the Cabinet Office measure. This figure is replicated on returns by dividing the adjusted FTE days lost by a verage FTE. Staff policies and actions applied during the y ear The Foundation Trust continues to be committed to providi ng an inclusive environment for our patients, staff, and visitors. We believe in providing equity in our services, in treating 56 people fairly with respect and dignity and in valuing diversity both as a health and care services provider and as an employer. The work that has formed part of 'Our Journey' has continued with the development of a number of resource tools designed to support teams to have local conversations about 'Our Journey' and to create their own local plans. The Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out the responsibilities of the Foundation Trust , its staff, and those who use its services. The Foundation Trust actively promotes a culture that values difference and recognises that people from different backgrou nds and experiences bring valuable knowledge and insights to the workplace and enhances the way we work. The Foundation Trust strives to be inclusive, where diversity is valued, respected, and embedded in all areas across the organisation. This will giv e us the ability to recruit and retain a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve. The Diversity and Inclusion Policy affords equal protection to those who access our services, ensuring people are involved in their care and its workforce, ensuring staff have fair and equal opportunity. The Foundation Trust is committed to compliance with the Equality Act 2010, and as part of the subsequent Public -Sector Equality Duty, is dedicated to: o eliminating discrimination; o promoting equality of oppor tunity; and o fostering good relations. All Foundation Trust policies continue to be subject to a Rapid or Full (E) Quality Impact Assessment which aims to tackle discrimination or disadvantage at the outset. The Foundation Trust continues to be a 'Mindful E mployer ', supporting health and wellbeing at work. The Foundation Trust ' Employability Policy supports those who may experience disadvantage to find sustainable employment through experience -based work placements. We support a range of people to develop th eir employability skills in a safe environment through our work experience programmes, traineeships, apprenticeships and eventually through securing employment. We recognise that there may be times when staff experience episodes of poor wellbeing. For th ese staff we have policies in place to ensure they get the support and guidance and reasonable adjustments they need to assist them through this difficult time. We have an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) which staff can access themselves for a variety of issues they may be concerned with. Optima Health is our Occupational Health provider. For staff to feel valued and engaged, it is paramount that they are kept well informed. All staff have access to the Foundation Trust 's internal communication system which incorporates the All Staff Bulletin, Executive Blogs, and forums where information and opportunities are shared. Staff can gain support fro m Freedom to Speak Up Guardians and Diversity and Inclusion Guardians where they can speak confidentially on ma tters that may concern them. All Guardians and Advisors have undergone training pertinent to this role and will signpost staff to resolve the issue themselves or where they may obtain further support. In addition to this resource the Foundation Trust have embedded c oaching into the organisation. Coaching is one of the most cost -effective development investments that any 57 organisation can make. One -to-one coaching helps individuals to enhance their own work practices. This, in turn, can vastly improve their p ersonal and team performance. Coaching is for all staff and focusses on how you want things to be, what you need to achieve and how you are going to get there. The Coa ching Collective is a group of s taff, which have had advance coaching skills training to be able to assist staff. The details are available on the staff ICON pages. This initiative had been running for two years and in September 2018 we hosted a Coaching Conference in Torbay which generated a lot o f interest from the Torbay and South Devon community and beyond. Feedback received to date about the Coaching Collective has been positive. Under the leadership of the Equality Business Forum, our Employee Network Groups, including the Disability Awarenes s and Action Group (DAAG). Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Group (LGBT) and the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Representatives (BAME), have an opportunity to affect positive change. 2018 national NHS staff s urvey Staff e ngagement The Foundat ion Trust recognises the importance of staff engagement as a core enabler to delivering our purpose and providing safe, high quality, person centred care. Research has shown a clear relationship between staff engagement and individual and organisational outcome measures, such as staff absenteeism and turnover, patient satisfaction and mortality; and safety measures, including infection rates. The more engaged staff members are, the better the outcomes for patients and the organisation generally. The Foun dation Trust s Staff Engagement and Communication Strategy articulates how we seek to achieve and sustain high levels of staff engagement. A key component of the strategy is to continue to build the 'Employee Voice ' whereby staff views are regularly sought, listened to, and acted upon. Where staff feel able to speak out about concerns and identify opportunities for improvement and feel their views are considered when decisions are being discussed that affect them. The Foundation Trust has a range of opportunities for staff to share their views and to engage with the wider Foundation Trust agenda which include the following communication channels : o 'Just Ask!' noticeboard for staff to ask questions or raise issues wi th the executive team ; o Staff Surveys including the national annual staff survey and quarterly pulse surveys e.g. Staff Friends and Family Test, 'Great Place to Work' survey; o Freedom to Speak Up Guardian network ; o Health and wellbeing networks, including men tal health forum ; o Equality forums ; o Joint consultations/neg otiations with the Trade Unions; o Foundation Trust Talk - monthly briefing session for all staff from the Executive team ; and o Staff Governors . Summary of performance The NHS staff survey is conduct ed annually. From 2018 onwards, the results from questions were grouped to give scores in ten indicators. The indicator scores were based 58 on a score out of 10 for certain questions with the indicator score being the average of those. The response rate to the 2018 survey for Foundation Trust staff was 43%. This is above average for combined acute and community Foundation Trust s in England (41%) and compares with a response rate of 37% in 2017. This improvement lends support to the revised approach taken to the fieldwork during the year which saw a move away from a centralised approach to a more local approach, congruent with the Foundation Trust 's direction of travel to establish self-organising teams. Scores for each indicator tog ether with that of the survey benchmarking group are presented in the table below. In comparison to 2017, the Foundation Trust has maintained or seen improvement in seven of the ten themes ( one not comparable). There has been a statistically significant improvement in three themes - staff engagement ; safety culture ; and, safe environment - violence. Whilst there has not been a statistically significant deterioration in any theme, the Foundation Trust has seen a reduction in health and wellbeing and quali ty of care themes over the past three years. In comparison with all combined acute and community Foundation Trust s in 2018, the Foundation Trust performs equal to or above the national average in seven of the ten themes. The Foundation Trust performs particularly well with regard to health and wellbeing, morale, bullying and harassment and staff engagement. The Foundation Trust performs below the national average in regards to quality of appraisal, quality of care and safety culture. The Foundation Trust did not feature in the bottom 20% of scores for any of the indicators. 2018/19 2017/18 2016/7 Foundation Trust Benchmarking group Foundation Trust Benchmarking group Foundation Trust Benchmarking group Equality, diversity and inclusion 9.2 9.2 9.2 9.2 9.4 9.3 Health and wellbeing 6.0 5.9 6.1 6.0 6.3 6.1 Immediate managers 6.8 6.8 6.7 6.8 6.8 6.8 Morale 6.3 6.2 Not comparable Quality of appraisal s 4.9 5.4 4.8 5.3 4.9 5.4 Quality of care 7.3 7.4 7.4 7.5 7.5 7.5 Safe environment - bullying and harassment 8.2 8.1 8.2 8.1 8.3 8.2 Safe environment - violence 9.5 9.5 9.4 9.5 9.5 9.5 Safety culture 6.6 6.7 6.5 6.7 6.6 6.7 Staff engagement 7.1 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.2 7.0 59 Future priorities In order to respond to the findings and address the areas of concern, the following areas have been identified as key priorities for 2019/20: o focussed work to improve the quality of staff appraisal s; o further development of the Foundation Trust s health and wellbeing offer for staff, with specific reference to musculoskeletal and mental ill health; o developing a compassionate work environment where people are empowere d to address bullying behaviour; o progressing self - organising teams ; and o development of the 'Speak Up' work progr amme . Performance against these criteria will be monitored through the Workforce and Organisational Development Group .

As a Foundation Trust we are committed to building an organisation that puts patients' and service users wishes at the centre and removing the barriers that hinder sta ff and prevent them working to their full potential. All staff are kept informed and are aware o f the NHS constitution and the o rganisational values. Staff can be assured that they will continue to be supported and valued to carry out their duties effect ively, ensuring that everyone counts. Equality delivery s ystem (EDS2) The Equality Delivery System (EDS) is a governance framework which was mandated by NHS England in April 2015. The EDS is designed to support NHS organisations to meet the requirements o f section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 - the Public -Sector Equality Duty (PSED). The EDS provides a clear and robust framework, enabling NHS organisations to be transparent about their equality performance. The EDS was created to drive improvements, stren gthen the accountability of services to the service users and bring about workplaces free from discrimination . EDS2 comprises of 18 goals, nine p ublic focussed, and nine w orkforce focussed. The Foundation Trust is required to produce specific and measurab le equality objectives to maintain legal compliance. Equality objectives must be published every four years; however, the Foundation Trust can review the objectives annually. These objectives will be informed by the views gathered from any engagement eve nts where our performance has been graded by staff or the public. Workforce disability equality s tandards (WDES) The Foundation Trust is dedicated to equal opportunities for staff with disabilities. We have participated in the 'two-ticks positive about di sabled people ' scheme in the past. This year we will be moving to the 'Disability Confident Standard ', a new initiative from NHS Employers and the Department of Work & Pensions. The Foundation Trust is also committed to providing reasonable adjustments for staff with disabilities as required by Equality Act 2010. We are committed to supporting all staff and will work within the reasonable adjustment framework. Disability equality is advanced throug h staff training and our disability awareness and action working group. During the year we saw the introduction of the Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES) introduced to tackle any barriers that disabled staff may experience in the workplace. We will be required to report in August 2019 on our data and produce a work plan. Workforce race e quality system On 1st April 2015, NHS England launched the Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) to tackle barriers that Black , Asian and Minority Ethnic (B AME) staff may face in the workplace. The standard aims to ensure that employees from B AME backgrounds have equal access to career opportunities and receive fair treatment in the workplace. 64 The data from 2018 survey is as follows: 2018 Average for combined acute and community Foundation Trust s 2017 KF 25 Percentage of staff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from patients, relatives, or the public in the last 12 months White BAME 22% 26% 26% 27% 23% 25% KF26 Percentage of staff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from staff in last 12 months White BAME 23% 24% 24% 29% 22% 26% KF21 Percentage of staff believing that the organisation provides equal opportunities for career progression or promotion White BAME 86% 77% 87% 77% 85% 73% Q17b In the last 12 months have you personally experienced discrimination at work from manager/team leader or other colleagues White BAME 7% 17% 6% 15% 7% 17% Gender pay differential Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees from April 2017 to publish statutory calculations every year showing how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. Gender pay reporting is different to equal pay which deals with the pay dif ferences between men and women who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs, or work of equal value. It is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. The gender pay gap shows the difference in the average pay between all men and wome n in a workforce. Generally, the average pay of women is lower than that of men and this tends to be because there are fewer women in senior high earning positions in organisations than men. Whilst a workforce may be predominantly female, if the most senio r positions are taken up by men, the average pay of women in that organisation could well be lower. 65 The current gender split within the overall workforce is 78% female and 2 2% male. Average gender pay gap Male Female % difference Mean hourly rate 2017 \u00a318.21 \u00a314.45 20.58% Mean hourly rate 2018 \u00a318.76 \u00a314.85 % difference Median hourly rate \u00a312.62 6.18% Median hourly rate 2018 \u00a314.16 \u00a313.10 7.49% Summary of results average gender pay gap The overall percentage variance for the average hourly rate of pay as a mean average is low at 20.84% . This calculation is based on the average hourly rate for 4 ,716 female staff compared to 1 ,339 male staff; because the average is calculated over differen t numbers of staff (there are almost four times more female staff), some variance is to be expected. Having reviewed the data there are two themes which stand out : o when looking at the total workforce, male staff are disproportionately represented in t he lowest and highest pay quartiles ; and o the most obvious im balance of pay is amongst the Medical and Dental staff. It is the inclusion of our Consultant Body which shows a significant impact on the figures , reversing the female positive gender pay gap across the remainder of the Foundation Trust 's workforce. 66 Analysis of our medical workforce continues to reveal it s own complexities. The Junior D octors show a pay gap in favour of female staff, but at more senior level then this is in favour of male employees, with a higher number of male consultants employed compared to female. Although the legacy of a predominantly male Consultant body is slowly changing , as demonstrated by the current Junior Doctor workforce, which shows a higher number of fem ale employees compared to male . The Employability Hub As the largest employer in the area we must use the resources available to us for the benefit of the whole community, and ensure that nobody is excluded, discriminated against, or left behind. The Employability Hub was created to do just that and is a ve hicle for delivering the Employability Strategy; it utilises the benefits of a large employer by offering work placements and training to people within our community. Its aim is to develop and enhance skills and confidence to individuals and as a result t hey are better equipped to find sustainable employment. The hub offers a range of services including work experience to adults and young people and several extended placements and internships to those undertaking the Aspire programme (formerly known as Pro ject Search). We also offer the Step Programme which focuses on supporting people who may face discrimination or social exclusion. Through the Step Programme we are able to offer work placements with the intention of developing knowledge, skills and exp erience to those seeking this support. Those individuals who demonstrate their commitment to the Step Programme may be considered for a Traineeship or Apprenticeship. The Employability Hub was a finalist in the Health Education England Star Awards in 20 16 for advancing innovation in the sector. 67 Part V - Governance Statements NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust has applied the principles of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance on a ' comply or explai n' basis. The NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, most recently revised in July 2014, is based on the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 2012. Compliance with the Code In considering the provisions of the NHS Improvement Code of Governance for Foundation Trust s, the Board of Directors considers that it was fully compliant or had otherwise appropriate arrangements for the governance of the Foundation Trust in place , and consequently there are no disclosure requirements . In accordance with the Code, the Foundation Trust is led by the Board of Directors who have joint and several responsibility for the exercise of the powers of the Foundation Trust . Appointments to the Board both of Executive and Non -Executive Directors in the reporting period meant that the Board was fully constituted.

NHS Improvement's s ingle oversight f ramework NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework provides the framework for overseeing providers and identifying potential support needs to help them improve. The framework looks at five themes: o quality of care; o finance and use of resources; o operational performa nce; o strategic change; and o leadership and improvement capability (well -led). Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from one to four, where 'four' reflects providers receiving the most support, and 'one' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A Foundation Trust will only be in segments three or four whe re it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. For 201 8/19, the Foundation Trust has been placed in segment two which attracts an offer of targeted support in response to concerns in relation to one or more of the five themes. Whilst not currently subject to enforcement action, the Foundation Trust has accepted targeted support from NHS Improvement in respect to the Emergency System and Theatres . 72 This segmentation information is the Foundation Trust 's position as at 20 May 2019 . Current segmentation information for NHS Foundation Trust s is published on the NHS Improvement website. Finance and u se of resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4' where '1' reflects the st rongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding in to Single Oversight Framework, the segmentation of the Foundation Trust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score. Area Metric 2018/19 sustainability Capital service capacity 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 Liquidity 3 3 4 3 3 4 4 4 Financial efficiency I & E margin 3 4 4 4 1 3 4 4 Financial controls Distance from financial plan 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 Agency spend 4 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 Overall scoring 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 The Foundation Trust's financial performance is monitored by NHS Improvement, principally using the measure of 'adjusted financial performance excluding Provider Sustainability Funding ('PSF')'. This measure excludes items such as asset impairment, income/depreciation relating to donated assets and PSF, which do not reflect underlying financial performance. On this measur e, the Foundation Trust is reporting a 2018/19 deficit of \u00a38.17million, \u00a33.75million adverse to that planned. The overall financial performance was a surplus of \u00a32.15million, which included \u00a34.14million reversal of asset impairment and \u00a35.49million of PSF . 73 Statement of Accounting Officer's Responsibilities Statement of the Chief Executive's responsibilities as the Accounting Officer of Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust : The NHS Act 2006 states that the Chief Executive is the Accounting Officer of the NHS Foundation Trust . The relevant responsibilities of the Accounting Officer , including their responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which they are answerable, and for the keeping of proper accounts, are set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum i ssued by NHS Improvement. NHS Improvement, in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor by the NHS Act 2006, has given Accounts Directions which require Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust to prepare for each financial year a statement of accounts in the form and on the basis required by those Directions. The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust and of its income and expenditure, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the accounts, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health and Social C are Group Accounting Manual and to: o observe the Accounts Direction issued by NHS Improvement, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis ; o make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis ; o state whether applicable accounting standards as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual (and the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual ) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in th e financial statements ; o ensure that the use of public funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities, and guidance o confirm that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair balanced and understandable and provides the info rmation necessary for patients, regulators and stakeholders to assess the NHS Foundation Trust 's performance, business model and strategy ; and o prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The Accounting Officer is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS Foundation Trust and to enable him/her to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned Act. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the NHS Foundation Trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. To the best of my knowledge and belief , I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . Liz Davenport, Chief Executive 29 May 201 9 74 Annual Governance Statement Scope of responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS Foundation Trust 's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for whic h I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also respons ible for ensuring that the NHS Foundation Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum. The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to : o identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust ; o evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and o to manage them efficiently, effectively, a nd economically. The system of internal control has been in place in Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. Capacity to handle r isk As accounting offi cer, I have overall responsibility for ensuring that there are effective risk management and integrated governan ce systems in place within the Foundation Trust and these meet all statutory requirements and adhere to guidance issued by NHS Improvement in respect of governance and risk management. The Foundation Trust has a Risk Management Strategy, which is reviewed and endorsed by the Board of Directors. The S trategy provides the framework for managing risks across the organisation which is consistent with best practice and Department of Health guidance. The Strategy provides a clear, systematic approach to the management of risks to ensure that risk assessmen t is an integral part of clinical, managerial and financial processes across the organisation. The Board of Directors provides leadership on the overall governance agenda including risk management. It is supported by a number of sub -committees that scruti nise and review assurances on internal control. These include the Audit Committee, Quality and Assurance Committee and the Finance, Performance and Digital Committee. Underpinning these sub -committees are the executive -led groups - Workforce and Organisa tional Development Group and the Risk Group. 75 Independent assurance on the effectiveness of the system of internal control and overall governance arrangements is provided by the Audit Committee. Additional assurance on the effectiveness of the systems for ensuring clinical quality is given by the Quality and Assurance Committee. The Board of Directors receives a report from the Chair of each of the committees. The Board of Directors also receives the Board Assurance Framework and Corporate Risk Register. The Risk Group oversees all risk management activities across the Foundation Trust to ensure that the correct strategy is adopted for managing risk; controls are present and effective; action plans are robust for th ese risks that are being actively manage d; and, that high risks are scored appropriately . The Risk Group is chaired by the Director of Finance (who is also the designated Senior Information Risk Owner) . Membership includes Executive Directors and senior management representatives from Community Health and Social Care, Estates and Facilities Management; Information Management and Technology, Workforce and Finance and is supported by the Company Secretary, Risk Officer and Patient Safety Lead. In addition, the Executive Directors have in place a process whereby all significant risks to the achievement of service delivery unit and directorate objectives, NHS Improvement governance and compliance requirements and Care Quality Commission regulations are kept under review. Established governance arrang ements maintain effective risk management arrangements across the Service Delivery Units, maintain risk registers and report accordingly. The Service Delivery Unit managers are responsible and accountable to the Chief Operating Officer for the quality of the services they manage and to ensure that any identified risks are placed on the Service Delivery Unit risk register. All such risks are reviewed by the relevant Service Delivery Unit and any escalation as required is managed in accordance with the risk reporting process. Directorate Managers are responsible and accountable to a Lead Director for the quality of the services that they manage and ensure that any identified risks are placed on the Directorate risk register. All such risks are reviewed by the relevant Director ate and any necessary escalation managed in accordance with the risk reporting process. Whilst the Chief Executive has overall responsibility for the management of risk, other members of the Executive Team exercise lead responsibility for the specific ty pes of risk as follows: Strategic risk Chief Executive Clinical and quality risks Chief Nurse/Medical Director Financial risk Director of Finance Workforce risk Director of Workforce and Organisational Development Staffing risk Chief Nurse/Medical Director Environmental risk Director of Estates and Business Development Operational risk Chief Operating Officer IT risk Director of Strategy and Transformation All Board level directors are responsible for ensuring there are appropriate arrangements and systems in place to identify and assess risks and hazards; comply with internal policies and pr ocedures, and statutory and external requirements; and, integrate functional risk management systems and develop the assurance framework. These responsibil ities are supported operationally by divisional managers. 76 All members of staff have responsibility for participation in the risk/patient safety management system, through: o awareness of risk assessments which have been carried out in their place of work and to compliance with any control measures introduced by these risk assessments; o compliance with all legislation relevant to their role, including information governance requirements set locally by the Foundation Trust ; o following all Foundation Trust polici es and procedures; o reporting all adverse incidents and near misses via the Foundation Trust 's incident reporting system; o attending regular training as required ensuring safe working practices; o awaren ess of the Foundation Trust 's patient safety and risk ma nagement strategy; and o knowing their limitations and seeking advice and assistance in a timely manner when relevant. The Foundation Trust recognises the importance of supporting staff. Service Delivery Units and d irectorate risk management activities are supported by a risk management training programme, principally delivered by the Risk Officer and monitored by the Risk Group, whose purpose is to provide a cross -organisational support network. Executive Directors and Non -Executive Directors are provided with risk management training on an individual basis or collectively at Board seminars. The Foundation Trust continues to maximise its opportunity to learn from other Foundation Trust s (particularly those who achie ve outstanding CQC ratings), internal / external audit and continuous feedback is sought internally to ensure the systems and processes in place are fit for purpose. The findings are taken to the Foundation Trust 's Quality and Assurance Committee to ensur e that any learning points are implemented. A wider distribution of learning points for staff is disseminated via staff briefings and bulletins. In addition to the Foundation Trust reviewing all internally driven reports, the Foundation Trust adopts an o pen approach to the learning derived from third party investigations and audits, and/or external reports. The Foundation Trust has also adopted a pro -active approach to seeking independent reviews in which Royal College reviews would be commissioned shoul d concerns be raised of a significant magnitude. I have ensured that all risks of which I have become aware are reported to the Board of Directors . All new significant risks are escalated to the Executive Team and reviewed and validated by the Risk Group. There is a regular programme of review of risks on the Board Assurance Framework by the Board of Directors, the purpose of which is to scan the h orizon for emergent threats and opportunities, and consider the nature and timing of the response required to ensure the risk is kept under control. The risk and control framework Risk is managed at all levels of the Foundation Trust and is co -ordinated th rough an integrated governance framework consisting of seven key groups that report on a regular basis to either the Quality Assurance Committee, Finance, Performance and Investment Committee or Audit Committee. The seven key groups are: Safeguarding / In clusion 77 Group, Quality Improvement Group, Workforce and Organisational Development Group, Capital Infrastructure and Environment Group, Information Management and IT Group, Risk Group and Senior Business Management Group. The Foundation Trust 's risk manage ment strategy has defined the Foundation Trust 's approach to risk throughout the year and provides an integrated framework for the identification and management of risks of all kinds, whether clinical, non -clinical, corpo rate, or financial and whether the impact is internal or external. This is supported by a Board Assurance Framework, which is used to record corporate objectives, risks to their achievement, key risk controls, sources of assurance and gaps in assurance to ensure effective risk management. A t each Board of Directors meeting, papers are provided with a report summary sheet through which Directors identify links to one or more corporate objectives and one or more overarching corporate level risks / themes. The assessment and subsequent manageme nt of risk is informed by its quantification using a risk grading matrix, which is set by the Board of Directors. Consequence and likelihood tables are outlined in the risk management policy. Across a range of domains, the consequence tables grade each ris k by reference to its expected impact. This, combined with the likelihood score, defines a measure of overall risk. The Foundation Trust risk tolerance is defined as: 'the amount of risk the Foundation Trust is prepared to accept, tolerate or be exposed to at any point in time'. In setting a tolerance, it has been determined that any risks to the delivery of the organisation's objectives with a current risk score of 15 or above will be brought through the exception reporting process via the Executive Team and to the Foundation Trust Board of Directors if deemed to be a corporate level risk. Actions and timescale for resolution are agreed and monitored. Such risks are deemed to be acceptable by the Executive Team only when there are adequate control mechani sms in place and a decision has been made that the risk has been managed as far as is reasonably practicable. Risks scored below this level are managed by the relevant lead Director, Service Delivery Unit or Directorate. The Risk Group receives reports on any risks which could impact on the Foundation Trust 's strategic objectives; particularly those risks deemed to be 'major' or 'catastrophic' or which could escalate to these levels if action is not taken. The Risk Group a lso oversees the development of the Foundation Trust 's long -term strategy and implementation of the risk management and assurance framework. A deep dive schedule was established during the year which ensures that significant risks (current risk score of 15) receive detailed scrutiny at the Risk Group, Audit Committee, Quality Assurance Committee or F inance, Performance, and Investment Committee meetings. Further information can be found within the Foundation Trust 's Risk Management Policy. Significant ris ks (any with a current risk score of 15 or more in accordance with the risk scoring matrix) will be reported to and considered by the Executive Team. If it is deemed that a risk is a 'corporate level' risk, it will be added to the Corporate Risk Register as described in the Foundation Trust 's Risk Management Policy. The Executive Team reviews the Corporate Risk Register following Risk Group meetings to ensure that: o the risk has been appropriately assessed and recorded; o actions plans/points are in place and leads identified and timescales for delivery; and 78 o the risk and actions points/plans are monitored to completion. Risks posing a threat to the Foundation Trust 's strategic objectives are escalated to the Board Assurance Framework (BAF). The Executive Team is also responsible for: o ensuring that programme and operational risks are actively managed within their areas of the business; o being owner and action owner of individual risks (including those delegated by the Chief Executive); and o devising short, medium, and long -term strategies to tackle identified risk, including the production of any mitigating action plans. The Audit Committee has responsibility for the review of governance, risk management and internal control covering both clinical and non -clinical areas. The Committee reviews the establishment and maintenance of an effective system of integrated governance, risk management (including regular review of the Board Assurance Framework and internal control, across the whole of the organisation's activiti es (both clinical and non -clinical), that supports the achievement of the organisation's objectives. The Audit Committee will request and review reports and positive assurances from directors and managers on the overall arrangements for governance, risk ma nagement and internal control. The Audit Committee may review the findings of other significant assurance functions, both internal and external to the organisation, and consider the implications to the governance of the organisation and make recommendatio n to the Board of Directors where appropriate. Where the Audit Committee feels that there is evidence of ultra vires transactions, evidence of improper acts or if there are other important matters that the Committee wishes to escalate, the Chair of the Au dit Committee will raise these at a full meeting of the Board of Directors and, if appropriate, exceptionally to NHS Improvement. After each meeting, the Chair of each Committee is required to provide a summary report to the Board of Directors addressing ' key issues' and any 'key decisions/recommendations'. The Board of Directors evaluates the Board Assurance Framework at least twice a year with any exceptions being reported at other times of the year . Corporate level risks / themes are included on all Boa rd papers in relation to the action being taken to manage these risks. An example of where risk management is incorporated into core Foundation Trust business is in relation to the integrated Finance, Performance, Quality and Workforce Board report. The m onthly report to the Board of Directors via the Finance, Performance and Investment Committee provides commentary on performance and on key variances and improvements. The report is created by the outcomes and actions from various meetings, for example, t he Efficiency Delivery Group, Service Delivery Unit Quality and Performance Review meetings and Executive Team weekly meetings. A separate and detailed 'Performance and Quality Data Book' providing detailed assurance, predominantly in table and chart form, is also taken to the Finance, Performance, and Investment Committee monthly. Another example is in relation to the Quality Report. The Foundation Trust identifies up to five quality improvements for the year, which have been developed through di scussions with clinical teams, c ommissioners, and the senior clinical and business leaders in the 79 organisation. These priorities were then signed off by the Board for 2018/19 and managed in accordance with internal processes. An external audit review is undertaken on the Quality Report as part of the year -end audit process to inform the independent auditor's limited assurance opinion on the A nnual Quality Report that can be found at Appendix D. Principal risks The Foundation Trust 's risk management processes have identified a number of risks. These system -wide risks relating to unprecedented challenges in achieving financial sustainability and controlling costs whilst having sufficient monies to maintain the digital and estate infrastructure to ensure continued patient safety, quality and productivity have been considered and reflected in the Board Assurance Framework. The most significant are outlined below along with how they have been/are being managed and mitigated and how outcomes are being assessed. The ris ks to the achievement of the goals are described in the Board Assurance Framework for 2018/19 as: Corporate Theme 1: Available capital resources are insuffi cient to fund high risk / high priority infrastructure /equipment requirements / IT I nfrastructure and systems - Risk of insufficient capital funding and backlog of maintenance - Risk of the c urrent IT systems and i nfrastructure not meet ing future demands. - Risk of f ailure to raise sufficient capital Corporate Theme 2: Failure to achieve key performance / quality standards - Risk of i nability to meet the 4 hour emergency care standard - Risk of i ncreasing Emergency Department admissions requiring CAMHS input - Risk of the Referral to T reatment '' care standard not met - Risk of n on-compliance with the national cancer waiting time standard - Risk associated with a l ack of access to critical ventilation maintenance of all operating theatres - Risk of a l ack of systematic approach to continuing health care learning disabilities assessments. - Risk of o perating l ist capacity due to temporary closure of Theatres A and B Corporate Theme 3: Inability to recruit / retain staff in sufficient number / quality to maintain servi ce provision - Vulnerability of the Junior Doctors rota in Medicine. - Difficulty in recruiting service critical staff Corporate Theme 4: Lack of available Care Home / Domiciliary Care capacity of the right specification / quality - Viability of Care Homes and Nursing Homes due to reduction in supply - Failure to deliver sufficient domiciliar y care to Torbay and South Devon areas Corporate Theme 5: Failure to achieve financial plan - Risk associated with the f inancial sustainability risk rating for 2018/19 - Risk of f ailure to secure fund monies for 2018/19. - Risk associated with the p otential financial impact due to loss or reduction of commercial activities - Risk of an i ncrease in overspends in the independent sector 80 - Risk of f ailure to spend capital within time limits Corporate Theme 6: CQC rating and the inability to deliver sufficient progress to maintain 'good' or achieve 'outstanding' - Vulnerable patients admitted to EAU's whilst awaiting mental health beds - Risk of o vercrowding in the Emergency Department During the year, the Foundation Trust has also monitored closely the risk of Brexit , the potential impact on the UK economy and specifically the implications for the Foundation Trust, both in the near term and further ou t. How the risks were identified and monitored formed part of the Foundation Trust's risk management process. The Foundation Trust accepted that the effect of an EU exit, and in particular leaving the EU market with no deal, was a significant risk. The potential challenges identified included, delays or failures to procure and re ceive goods (including drugs) and services , and staffing from the EU. In order to mitigate the se risks a number of review s were undertaken, for example, business continuity plans and review of capacity. Actions required for data protection and a financial impact analysis were also put in place . Government guidance on the planning of a no - deal Brexit informed the Foundation Trust plans.. The Foundation Trust ensures that public stakeholders are involved in managing risks which impact on them. The Counc il of Governors, having respo nsibility for representing the Foundation Trust members and members of the public, receive briefings from the chief executive and chair and have regular dialogue with the chair, executive and non -executive directors. Matters pe rtaining to the Foundation Trust 's performance, both quality and financial, and any changes to Foundation Trust services are reported. Discussions have also been ongoing throughout the year with commissioner colleagues to ensure all key access targets are being managed from within available resource. There have been regular contract management meetings with the Foundation Trust 's lead commissioners and councils. Looking forward to 2019/20, the Foundation Trust has identified a number of risks, which are be ing managed an d mitigated, which could impact on the achievement of corporate objectives, compliance with its licence or Care Quality Commission ; these being: - Failure to provide safe, quality patient care due to service interruption with major consequences - Failure to achieve the financial plan - Failure to maintain a fit for purpose estate - Failure to maintain a fit for purpose digital infrastructure - Failure to meet agreed trajectories set out with in the annual plan - Failure to recruit and retain sufficient ski lled staff to maintain safe core services - Failure to implement the Foundation Trust s transformation plan - Failure of key stakeholders - Failure to be the employer of choice - Failure to engage and involve the workforce - Failure to change and sustain the organisa tional culture to enable delivery of workforce transformation - Failure to support the mental and physical health and wellbeing of all staff, including supporting their individual needs - Failure to develop a succession planning and talent management system 81 - Failure to create an inclusive culture - Failure to ensure leadership capacity and capability to deliver high -quality, sustainable care - Failure to define a clear vision and credible strategy to deliver high -quality sustainable care to people, with robust plan s to deliver - Failure to ensure a culture of high -quality sustainable care The Foundation Trust 's Annual Operational Plan for 2019/20 has acknowledged the risks facing the Foundation Trust during the coming year and has set out explicit plans for what must be done and how the outcomes will be measured - these being: Financial, performance , workforce and quality risks As the Foundation Trust goes in to 2019/20, plans are in place to mitigate these risks through rigorous budgetary control and management of significant productivity and efficiency improvements. Outcomes will be measured by monthly review of financial, quality, performance and wo rkforce information by the Board, in addition to scrutiny of the impact of efficiency savings on patient safety and quality of service. The Board receive the quality and safety impact assessments of the Foundation Trust 's cost improvement plans from the ch ief nurse and medical director on an annual basis. A Board Sub-Committee focussing on finance is in place to provide additional scrutiny of productivity and improve financial efficiency by reducing variation at directorate level. This will be achieved by benchmarking the Foundation Trust 's operational efficiency against the Lord Carter Model Hospital. Our plans, which are built up from service delivery unit and system developments, set out an ambition to reduce the existing core workforce by 170 wte during 2019/20. The primary focus of this reduction will be on bank and agency. The cost improvement plans ('CIP') requirement for the coming year remains challenging . We plan to deliver 4% efficiencies (\u00a316m) through a combination of core service productivity (2%) and system transformation programmes (2% in 2019/20), and whilst good progress has been made, plans are not yet fully in place. CIP delivery remains a risk and is reflected in the Corporate Risk Register. Capital funding risks Reduced levels of EB ITDA associated with challenged revenue performance in both 2017/18 and 2018/19, has significantly restricted the level of cash available for capital expenditure in recent years. The consequence is seen in an increased backlog in essential repairs and repl acements across all areas of expenditure; estates, IM&T, and equipment. The ability to invest in developmental capital necessary to further develop the Foundation Trust 's care model has, similarly been curtailed. The capital risk facing the Foundation Tr ust is now so significant that it is no longer possible to contain capital spending within internally generated cash. The Foundation Trust will develop further its range of financing options that will enable this risk to be addressed, including: a strateg ic estates partnership; lease options; bidding, largely through STP processes for PDC; and, loan options. System cost pressures The pressure in the 2019/20 cost base reflects the increasing operational risk profile across the Integrated Care Organisation including the costs of addressing the consequences of infrastructure failures, continued in -sourcing and out -sourcing of electiv e 82 patients to maintain a maximum 52 week wait position; continued reliance on agency medical staff in a number of national shortages specialties; uniquely, and most significantly in this ICO, are pressures building in Continuing Health Care and Adult Socia l Care. This is largely the result of a number of providers withdrawing from the market or experiencing difficulty in maintaining qualified staffing, both restricting the number of placements available. The Devon STP s ystem -wide plans for 2019 /20 have b een developed in conjunction with our partners and through the Board. These have been tested by a peer review process organised by the Devon STP and scrutinised by the Regulator . The Board has acknowledged that the Foundation Trust must continue to devel op its planning and delivery models, and to this end the Foundation Trust has implement ed a revised operational structure in which leadership groups, will operate as 'self -managed teams' , with greate r freedoms and authority to act and lead delivery. An en hanced accountability framework and programme management office will support this model . Despite this achievement, the potential failure remains in achiev ing the necessary level of financial improvement reflects the scale of system wide savings required to deliver the Devon STP control total position. At the time of writing this report, the Devon STP has been unable to reach agreement on how much providers should be paid for activity, as the current assessed income requirements in the provider sector are un affordable to the overall system. Performance and activity risks In 2018/19 our performance has been challenged in a number of areas; most notably Referral to Treatment ('RTT') longest waiting pathways longer than 52 weeks, Emergency Department performanc e and diagnostic waiting times. RTT longest waiting pathways > 52 weeks : Plans are in place to increase capacity, however, the recent theatre closures have changed the forecast outturn in the current year leaving a carry f orward of recovery into 2019/20; this is predicated on accessing emergency finance to invest in essential theatre infrastructure maintenance. Urgent care - 4 hour ED standard : The Foundation Trust struggled to achieve the planned trajectory of improvement during 2018/19. Plans for 2019 /20 will see a continuation of investments made in in the previous year to improve the front door assessment, admissions avoidance, and productive ward leading to effective discharge and managing length of stay to planned levels. Work to drive forward the se service improvements and system reset will be clinically led with clear accountability to secure the necessary improvement early in 2019/20. We will be working with the Emergency Care Intensive Support Team (ECIST) to further support our plans. Cance r: Two-week wait for urgent referral and 62 -day to treatment standards were not met consistently during 2018/19. Increased numbers of urgent referrals of 15% in key pathways have been a challenge as have vulnerabilities in key elements of the workforce. Investment is set aside for Urology and General Surgery to increase capacity in order to meet the increase in demand and secure the cancer access standards. However substantive recruitment to key clinical roles continues to be a risk. 83 Diagnostics : increasing demand for diagnostic tests and increasing complexity of tests have seen demand reach a critical point whereby the Foundation Trust is reliant upon outsourcing mobile solutions for both CT and MRI scans. Plans for 2019/20 include an approved bus iness case for a 3rd CT scanner to increase in -house capacity and continuation of mobile scanning and out -sourcing. Bed capacity : we are not planning any further changes to the core number of general and acute beds in our 2019/20 operational plan. We will continue to drive down length of stay and focus on early interventions to avoid admissions and facilitate early discharge. Compl iance with information g overnance requirements Maintaining the security of information that the Foundation Trust holds provides confidence to patients and employees of the Foundation Trust . To ensure that its security is maintained an executive director h as been identified (the Foundation Trust 's Director or Finance) to undertake the role of senior information risk owner (SIRO). The SIRO support the C hief Executive and the Board in ensuring compliance with appropriate standards and management of informati on risks. The SIRO oversees the wide range of measures to protect the data held and the review of information flows to underpin the Foundation Trust 's information governance assurance statements and its assessment against the information governance toolki t. The Foundation Trust 's Caldecott Guardian is the Deputy Medical Director . Freedom of information compliance is managed by the Head of Information Governance . The Head of Information Governance provides support for the day to day management of information governance. There is an established Information Governance Group, chaired by the SIRO, which oversees information governance compliance, manages issues and incidents and reports on action plans and projects. The Information Governance Group r egularly reports and informs on progress and compliance with the Information Governance Toolkit and the SIR O signs -off the year -end annual submission. The Foundation Trust takes an open and transparent approach to reporting and a willingness to apply any l essons learned to further improve information governance processes and procedures. Hence d uring the year a total of 39 incidents were reported to the Data Security and Protection Toolkit ('DSPT') , with 33 meriting further reporting onto the Information Com missioner's Office (' ICO'). The ICO have closed 32 of these reported cases at this time with no further action deemed necessary . In March 2019, the Foundation Trust was affected by a minor spear phishing campaign aimed at public sector bodies , including the NHS , which is still under investigation. Any other incidents recorded during 2018/19 were assessed as being of low or little significant risk. The Foundation Trust Information Governance Assessment report is no longer available and the system has bee n replaced by the 'Data Security & P rotection Toolkit (DSP Toolkit)' . The new toolkit demonstrates that the Foundation Trust is working towards the ten National Data Guardian's data security standards as set out in the Data Security and Protection Standards for health and care. There are no longer attainment levels, instead the toolkit works on either 'standards met' or 'standards not organis ations are to achieve 'Standards Met' on the 84 DSP Toolkit or action plans are in place to ensure compliance . The toolkit publication for the Foundation Trust for 2018/19 was ' standards not met' however, a compliant action plan is in place . Care Qu ality Commission The Chief Nurse is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Foundation Trust 's registration with the Care Quality Commission. This is achieved by: o Reporting a nd keeping under review matters highlighted within inspections; o Liaising with the Care Quality Commission inspectors and senior clinicians and managers in response to any specific concerns raised by the Care Quality Commission by patients and members of the public; o Engaging with the Care Quality Commission inspectors in the inspection process and co -ordinating the Foundation Trust 's response to inspections and any recommendations or actions that arise; o Analysing trends from incident reporting, complaints and patient and staff surveys and sharing the learning from t hese across the Foundation Trust ; o Reviewing assurances on the effective operation of controls; and o Receiving assurances provides by internal audit and any clinical audit conclusions, which provide only limited assurance. As noted in the 2017/18 report, the Foundation Trust received announced inspections in February 2018 in Commu nity C hildren and Young People (Short -announced) , Community End of Life Care (Short -announced) and Social R eablement Services. The Foundation Trust also received three unannounce d inspections over the same period in Maternity, Outpatients and Acute End of Life Care. The table below shows the rating provided for each of the services inspected in 2018 /19. Service Rating Requirement notice Community Children and Young People Good No Community End of Life Requires improvement Yes Social R eablement Services Good No Maternity Requires improvement Yes Outpatients Good Yes Acute End of Life Good Yes Requirement notices and 'should do' action plans are monitored through the individual service leadership teams and reported to the Foundation Trust 's CQC Assurance Group. Following the core service inspections described above, the Foundation Trust recei ved a 'well led' inspection during March 2018. The focus for this inspection was predominantly Foundation Trust Board focussed; the feedback formed part of the overall Foundation Trust report along with the core service reports. The well -led inspection was rated as 'Good'. 85 Other CQC service inspections that took place during 2018/19 included: o Specialist dental services delivered by the Foundation Trust were inspected during February to May 2018 under the Primary Services inspection format. These services are delivered across four Foundation Trust sites and all were found to be delivering care in line with regulations. o Special Education Needs and Disability services in Devon were inspected by Ofsted and the CQC in Dece mber 2018. The inspection was hosted by the Clinical Commissioning Groups and Devon County Council. Foundation Trust staff in various therapies disciplines were involved in the focus groups and inspection. The inspection report findings are yet to be published . o Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure)Regulations (IR(ME)R) 2017 . The CQC undertook a short notice inspection of the Foundation Trust compliance against the IRMER regulations during December 2018, which focussed on the Torbay Hospital site . The inspection noted the good clinical practice, including training packages, incident reporting and investigations, and team working. An Improvement Notice was issued to improve written procedures to meet Regulatory Requirements. The Improvement Not ice requirements and timeframe were met satisfactorily and following submission of an action plan to address the initial findings was accepted by the CQC. o Emergency Department . In February 2019 the CQC undertook a one day unannounced inspection of the Emergency Department at Torbay Hospital . This was one of a series of targeted inspections across a number of Foundation Trust s that took place on a Monday, when acute hospitals were very busy after the weekend. Th e inspection was part of a CQC national programme of inspections by the Pressure Resilience Operational Group. There were several triggers for this visit: Devon was in the spotlight due to the county -wide deteriorating performance against meeting the 4 -hour standard, and th e Foundation Trust 's performance ha d deteriorated; in January the 4-hour position was 66.1% for the Emergency Department and 76.4% overall, against the national target of 95%; and the CQC had also received some complaints. Although the Emergency Department was extremely busy after a challenging weekend, the Foundation Trust staff coped well and the inspectors witnessed good care being provided under pressure. The Foundation Trust has not yet received the draft report following the visit, however, verbal feed back provided on the day was that inspectors were impressed by the quality and safety of care they witnessed. This inspection wa s not part of the inspection regime an d did not of itself impact on the Foundation Trust rating, which remains overall 'Good' . Compliance with NHS Foundation Trust condition 4(8)(b) The assurance process described in this statement allow the Board to issue an accurate Corporate Governance Statement, required under NHS Foundation Trust condition 4(8)(b) of NHS Improvement's provider licence. The Foundation Trust will, during 2019/20, use 86 the learning from its recent Care Quality Commission Well Led and NHS Improvement Use of Resources inspections to form the basis of an externally led assessment developm ental review of leadership and governance using the NHS Improvement well -led framework. Communication with stakeholders The Foundation Trust 's communication team works closely with the quality team and the Foundation Trust membership office. Together th ey ensure there is public stakeholder engagement that address es any perceived or actual risks that might impact on the public. This includes undertaking any necessary consultation exercises. A number of forums exist that allow the Board of Directors, Exe cutive Directors and staff at all level to communicate with stakeholders, for example formal Board to Board and Executive to Executive meetings with local commissioners, Health and Wellbeing Boards and meetings with Healthwatch. The forums provide a mecha nism for risk identified by stakeholders that affect the Foundation Trust to be discussed for any action plans to be developed. Compliance with workforce strategies and 'Developing Workforce Safeguards' The Foundation Trust has processes to ensure that short, medium and long -term workforce strategies and staffing systems are in place to assure the Board that staffing processes are safe, sustainable and effective. Further, a s part of the safe staffing review, the chief nurse and medical director confirm t hat staffing is sa fe, effective and sustainable and meet the requirements of the national quality board. The Board continually reviews the effectiveness of its systems of internal control . The embedding of the strengthened governance framework supports the provision of evidenced based assurance from Ward to Board. The Board reviews the organisation 's performance in the key areas of finance, activity, national targets, patient safety an d quality and workforce in the form of an integrated quality das hboard . This includes the regular presentation of performance information against key quality, workforce and financial metrics to the Board and its Committees. The workforce section contains information on monthly staff sickness, staff turnover and volume of temporary staffing , as well as performance against the annual staff survey. These are high leve l organisational metrics and data that the Foundation Trust will continue to collate, review and analyse each month for a range of workforce metrics, quality and o utcomes indicators and productivity measures . The Foundation Trust' s workforce operating model mirrors that of our Care Model, helping to enable and empower teams to be sel f-organising . In embedding the Foundation Trust's aim to be a fully integrated organisation providing integrated pathways of care a new system leadership structure has been established that will oversee the entire pathway of acre across primary and community care, throu gh to emergency medicine and planned care. Whilst , the new structure is in its early stages of implementation a culture has evolved fostered around autonomy and accountability with a common sense of purpose and overall aim to support and engage staff to remove barriers to their productivity and ensure their time is used in the best way possible to provide direct o r relevant care or care support. 87 The Foundation Trust seeks to continuously improve its performance against workforce standards and the national staff survey. The annual workforce plan that forms part of the Foundation Trust's Annual Plan sets out the key organisational aims for the coming year, including how the Foundation Trust will maximise workforce analytics, plann ing and redesign capabilities. In terms of the wider context, t he Foundation Trust remains fully engaged with the Devon STP Workforce Strategy, of which the main focus of the workforce planning and transformation plan will be centred on developing a cultu re and structure that facilitates trust; involvement and innovation; and, local empowered decision making. Care Quality Commission compliance declaration At 31 March 20 19, the Foundation Trust remains fully compliant with all CQC registration requirements. Compliance with 'Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS ' guidance The Foundation Trust is not fully complaint with the requirement to publish an up -to-date register of interests for 'decis ion-making staff' within the past 12 months, in accordance with the 'Managing Conflicts of Inter est in the NHS' guidance. The Foundation Trust has published an up -to-date register of interests for the Board of Directors within the past 12 months and has a paper -based register of all interests declared by decision -making staff. The Foundation Trust has put in place processes to ensure full compliance during 2019/20. Compliance with NHS pension s chem e regulations As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. Compliance with e quality, diversity, and human rights l egislation Control meas ures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The Foundation Trust is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for our patients, clients, service users, carers, families, and staff and is working hard to mainstream diversity, inclusion, and human rights into our culture. A range of control measures are in place to ensure that the organisation complies with its obligations under Equality, Div ersity and Human Rights legislation. In 2016/17 the Foundation Trust enhanced its Freedom to Speak Up Guardian network through the appointment of two Equality and Diversity Guardians, in response to issues highlighted through the Workforce RACE Equality S tandard (WRES) Survey for the Foundation Trust . Performance is monitored via two core streams: The Joint Equalities Co -operative (for the public) which, reports to the Safeguarding/Inclusion Group and then Quality Assurance 88 Committee through to the Founda tion Trust Board; and the Equality Business Forum (for staff) which reports through the Workforce and Organisational Development Group to the Quality Assurance Committee . The Foundation Trust Board of Directors receives bi -monthly reports on diversity and inclusion issues from the Chief Nurse (service user update) and the Director of Workforce and Organisational Development (workforce update). These include any updates or changes in national mandates together with any risks or challenges. An Annual Equali ties Report is presented to the Board for ratification prior to publication. The primary aim of this report is to evidence compliance with the outcomes set out in the Equality Delivery System Compliance with Clim ate Change Act and the adaptation r eporting requirements The Foundation Trust has undertaken risk assessments and Carbon Reduction Delivery Plans are in place in accordance with emergency preparedness and civil contingency requirements, as based on UKCIP 2009 weather projects, to ensure that this organisation's obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are met. Review of e conomy, efficiency, effectiveness, and use of r esources Directors are responsible for putting in place proper arrangements to secure economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the Foundation Trust 's use of resources. The Foundation Trust has established several processes to ensure the achievement of this. These include: Clear processes for setting, agreeing, and implementing str ategic objectives based on the needs of the local population, reflecting the priorities of key partners and the Department of Health. This includes a clear strategy for patient, client, se rvice users, carers, and public involvement as well as the Foundation Trust public members, providing a key focus for our engagement work within South Devon. Established objectives are supported by quantifiable and measurable outcomes. Clear and effective arrangements for monitoring and reviewing performance which include a comprehensive and integrated performance dashboard used monthly in the performance management of health and social care services and reported to the Board of Directors. The integrated F inance, Performance, Quality and Workforce Report details any variances in planned performance and key actions to resolve them plus the implementation in a timely fashion of any external recommendations for improvement e.g. external audit. There is also a performance management regime embedded throughout the Foundation Trust including weekly capacity review meetings, executive reviews of services, budget reviews (undertaken monthly) and reg ular work to ensure data quality. An internal audit review of governance was undertaken during the year and reported to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Committees consider reports of external regulators and b odies, with improvement action plans developed and their implementation monitored where and as necessary. Through the Finance, Performance and Investment Committee, the Foundation Trust has arrangements for planning and managing financial and other resources in place. These 89 are encom passed in the Scheme of Delegation and the Standing Financial Instructions which receive regular audit review. The Foundation Trust uses other benchmarking tools such as the Model Hospital productivity metrics to demonstrate the delivery of value for mone y. The Foundation Trust continues to develop its reference cost reporting data to ensure services are being provided as efficiently as possible. For procurement of non -pay related items, the Foundation Trust has a clear procurement strategy and collaborate s with other NHS bodies to maximise value through the NHS South West Peninsular Procurement Alliance. Annual Quality Report The Directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS Foundation Trust boards on the form and content of annual Quality Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual. The Annual Quality Report 2018/19 has been developed in line with relevant national guidance. The data and information within the Quality Report is reviewed by the Quality Assurance C ommittee, which is attended by Non -Executive Directors and Executive Directors. The Board of Directors reviews the quality dashboard and the patient safety scorecard at each Board meeting as a standing agenda item. The quality and safety metrics were als o reported on a monthly basis to the Board of Directors through the integrated performance dashboard. The Foundation Trust has developed its vision, values and priorities through wide involvement and in consultation with patients, carers, staff, external s takeholders and Governors. Through this engagement, the Foundation Trust has been able to ensure the Quality Report provides a balanced view of the organisations priorities for 2018/19. In preparing the Quality Report, the Foundation Trust had a project lead to develop the Quality Report, reporting directly to the Chief Nurse. A formal review of the eng agement process was established i nvolving a presentation to Governors and presentation of the initial draft report to its external stakeholders , including : o Clinical commissioning groups; o Healthwatch; o Torbay County Health Scrutiny Board; o Devon County Council's Health and Wellbeing Scrutiny Committee; o Foundation Trust staff; and o Carers Group. As in previous years, the Foundation Trust continues to hold an annual Quality Report engagement event inviting key stakeholders to come together and recommend the priority areas to be included in the following year's report. The feedback from the event continues to be positive, with stakeholders feeling engaged in the dev elopment of the Quality Report. The Foundation Trust has utilised performance reports, governance and quality reports, clinical outcome measures, mortality reports, Health Education England and 90 benchmarking data, and a range of k ey national targets, to govern the work associated with the Quality Report . The Foundation Trust 's external auditor, PwC have undertaken a review of the arrangements in place to secure the data quality information included in the Qualit y Report. The exter nal auditor have provided an unqualified l imited assurance opinion. Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of i nternal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS Foundation Trust that have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the content of the Quality Report attached to this Annual Report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by co mments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board, the Audit Committee, the Quality Assu rance Committee, the Finance, Performance, and Investment Committee, the Executive Group, and the Risk Group and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The Board Assurance Framework itself provides me wit h evidence that the effectiveness of controls that manage the risks to the organisation achieving its corporate objectives have been reviewed. My review has also been informed by the major sources of assurance on which reliance has been placed during the year. These sources include reviews carried out by PwC, Care Quality Commission, Internal Audit, NHS Litigation Authority and the Health and Safety Executive. The following committees and groups are involved in maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control: o The Board of Directors has overall accountability for the governance arrangements, including the committee structure, and ensuring the Foundation Trust adheres to its Constitution and applies its standing orders, scheme of delegation and standing financial instructions correctly. The Chairs of each of the Board sub -committees present a report to the next available Board meeting for the purpose of provid ing assurance on matters within its terms of reference. Urgent matters if requiring escalation to the Board would be reported by the committee chair in the intervening period. The Board has agreed, in conjunction with the Council of Governors, the strate gic objectives for the Foundation Trust . The executive directors have assessed the risks to their achievement, along with risk controls and assurance mechanisms. As part of this risk assessment process, gaps in controls and assurances have been highlight ed. This information is incorporated in the Foundation Trust 's Board Assurance Framework document reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors. 91 o The Audit Committee is re sponsible for establishing an effective system of internal control and risk management and provide an independent assurance to the Board. The Committee takes an overview of the organisation's governance activity by reviewing the statement on internal effectiveness and Annual Governance Statement. Reports from the internal auditors and ext ernal auditor also provide assurance. The Committee also reviews on a regular basis, the risks that are described in the Board Assurance Framework. The Committee has oversight of, and relies on the work of, the Risk Group to monitor the risk management p rocess and risk registers. The committee has oversight of expressions of concerns and whistleblowing arrangements. The Audit Committee is chaired by the Vice - Chair and membership comprises all Non -Executive Directors except the Chairman. o The Quality Assurance Committee provides the Board of Directors with assurances of clinical effectiveness through scrutiny of patient quality and safety, patient experience, medicines management and staffing. It monitors selected quality metrics and ensures the Foundati on Trust has robust systems in place to learn from experience. It receives reports from specialist governance groups e.g. safeguarding; patient safety; and serious incidents. The Quality Assurance Committee is chaired by a Non -Executive Director and reports to the Board of Directors. o The Finance, Performance and Investment Committee scrutinises the financial risks and targe ts and any significant risks to activity and performance. The Committee is responsible for ensuring there are robust financial control procedures in place. The Finance, Performance and Investment Committee is chaired by a Non -Executive Director and repor ts to the Board of Directors. o The Risk Group oversees the risk management process at operational level, ensuring that risks are managed and/or escalated in line with the Risk Management Strategy. o The Internal Audit reports issued in the year have given sig nificant assurance that there is generally a sound system of internal control , designed to meet the organisation's objectives, and controls are generally being applied consistently . Some weaknesses in the design and/or inconsistent application of controls which put the achievement of certain objectives at risk are appropriately managed . There were 15 completed internal audit r eports in 2018/19, of which 14 received significant or satisfactory assurance and one audit report relating to the agency booking process for Allied Health Professional Staff received limited assurance. Action plans and progress is reported in detail to each subsequent Audit Committee meeting as part of Internal Audit's follow up process. The Internal Auditor takes a risk -based appr oach to formulating the annual work plan for agreement with management prior to final approval by the Audit Committee. 92 o External Audit provides independent assurance on the Annual Accounts, Annual Report, Annual Governance Statement and the Annual Quality Report. Conclusion In concluding my review on the overall system of internal control, I am assured that: o The Board, executive directors, senior management and staff of the Foundation Trust , have identified and are managing the risks facing the Foundation Tr ust, with escalation of risk events, an effective process for keeping risk scores up to date and flagging any risk and control concerns; o There is an appropriate risk management framework embedded in the Foundation Trust along with there being no major conc erns from their undertaking an effective programme of independent, risk based monitoring; and o The Foundation Trust 's internal auditors and other independent assurance providers such as external auditors, have no major concerns from their risk focussed prog ramme of independent assurance. My review therefore confirms that no significant internal control issue s have been identified for the financial year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts.

Basis for opinion Independence `` Material uncertainty relating to going concern Material uncertainty relating to going concern Details of material uncertaintyFinancial plans negotiated across the Devon Sustainability Partnership footprint were agreed and submitted on 23 May 2019. The Board of Directors acknowledge that the Foundation Trust, with the benefit of additional income agreed through that process, is forecasting a \u00a34.7m surplus for 2019/20. The forecast is based upon a number of assumptions including the delivery of cost improvement plans, the limited cash headroom within that plan, and that contracts will be signed in line with this agreement. In this context, the Board of Directors recognise the risk that the Foundation Trust might fail to deliver on its financial plan and require financial support from the Department of Health and Social Care during the course of 2019/20 in order to meet its liabilities and continue to provide healthcare services. The extent and nature of the financial support from the Department of Health and Social Care, including whether such support will be forthcoming or sufficient, is currently uncertain, as are any terms and conditions associated with the funding. The existence of such material uncertainty may cast doubt about the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. These conditions, along with the other matters explained in note 1.1.2 to the financial statements, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty, which may cast significant doubt about the Group's and Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the Group and Trust were unable to continue as a going concern. The Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2018/19 requires that the financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis unless management either intends to apply to the Secretary of State for the dissolution of a NHS Foundation Trust without the transfer of the services to another entity, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Trust's current year surplus is \u00a32.; million, which was behind its originally planned control target. The Trust is forecasting a surplus for 2019/20 and having sufficient cash balances during the year. This is contingent on the cost improvement plans being achieved, a working capital facility from the Department of Health and Social Care, which has not yet been confirmed, and having no adverse impact from unsigned income contracts.Independent auditors' report to the Council of Governors of Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts 2018/19 (the \"Annual Report\"), which comprise: the Group and Trust's Statement of Financial Position as at 31 March 2019; the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended; the Group and Trust's Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended; the Group and Trust's Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies. We conducted our audit in accordance with the National Health Service Act 2006, the Code of Audit Practice and relevant guidance issued by the National Audit Office on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General (the \"Code of Audit Practice\"), International Standards on Auditing (UK) (\"ISAs (UK)\") and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not modified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made in note 1.1.2 to the financial statements concerning the Group's and Trust's ability to continue as a going concern.In our opinion, Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust's Group and Trust financial statements (the \"financial statements\"): 103Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Our audit approach Context Overview Risk of fraud in revenue and expenditure recognition Revaluation of land and buildings The scope of our audit Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to going concern, described in the 'Material uncertainty relating to going concern' section above, we determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.Work we performed on going concern In establishing our overall approach, we assessed the risks of material misstatement and applied our professional judgement to determine the extent of testing required over each balance in the financial statements. Going concern As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.In considering the financial performance of the Trust and the appropriateness of the going concern assumption in the preparation of the financial statements, we obtained the 2019/20 annual plan as well as the Trust's cash flow forecasts until the end of May 2020 and: examined the impact of cash flow sensitivities and assessed these against the Trust's ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due; and sensitised the assumptions behind the Trust's financial forecasts by comparing them to historical performance. The Trust's forecasts suggest that further funding will be required for the Trust to meet its liabilities from quarter two of 2019/20. The Trust will negotiate additional loan funding in the last two quarters of 2019/20 to cover the financial requirements for the rest of the financial year. The Trust has stated it will begin these negotiations in the 2019/20 financial year (at least two months prior to the loan being required). The Trust will also assess the need for further funding for 2020/21 when negotiating its control total. Our audit for the year ended 31 March 2019 was planned and executed having regard to the fact that the Group's and Trust's operations and financial stability were largely unchanged in nature from the previous year. In light of this, our approach to the audit in terms of scoping and key audit matters was largely unchanged apart from one key audit matters that was new this year with regards to financial sustainability. Overall Group materiality: \u00a38,820,000 (2018: \u00a38,550,000) which represents 2% of total revenue. 104Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust How our audit addressed the Key audit matter Risk of fraud in revenue and expenditure recognition - Trust Revenue We evaluated and tested that the accounting policy for income and expenditure recognition was consistent with the requirements of the DHSC Group Accounting Manual 2018/19, particularly with the implementation of IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers We read the relevant parts of the risk share agreement against the outturn performance to ensure that no monies were owed by the Trust. We also agreed to agreements with the Clinical Commissioning Group that no monies were repayable as a result of the Trust's under- performance against their control total. For a sample of revenue transactions, which do not arise from block contract arrangements, we agreed the income recognised back to supporting documentation and cash receipts to ensure that they were accounted for in the correct period. In addition, we tested the controls over the patient record system to support the patient activity. Expenditure We selected a number of invoices and payments recognised after the year-end, traced them to supporting documentation, such as invoices to determine whether the expenditure was recognised in the correct period. We determined the risks to be: Manipulation through journal entries inappropriate recognition of revenue where the performance obligation has not occurred; and deferral of expenditure from 2018/19 to 2019/20, through an understatement of liabilities, or an overstatement of prepayments.Our testing identified no issues that required further investigationKey audit matter Within these contracts, there are variable performance measures, including penalties, which are dependent on the delivery of activity. The Trust has a risk share agreement in place with the Clinical Commissioning Group which is that a 50% of variance against plan will be received by, or payable to the counterparties. Furthermore, we performed testing on a sample basis, to agree payments made and invoices received after the year-end to supporting documentation and checking that, where they related to 2018/19 expenditure, an accrual was recognised appropriately. inappropriate recognition of revenue from 2019/20 to 2018/19 in order to improve the current year position; Our journals work was carried out using a risk based approach. We used data analysis techniques to identify the journals that had unusual account combinations. Where unusual journals were identified, we traced them back to supporting documentation to verify our understanding of the journal and corroborate the reason for the journal and the amount recorded.We tested a sample of other revenue by tracing the transaction to invoices or other correspondence, and using our knowledge and experience in the sector, to determine whether the revenue was recognised in the correct period. Items of other revenue included private patient revenue, overseas patient revenue, education and training, and research and development. the Trust being under increasing financial pressure. It has set a control total for the financial year, with STF revenue paid when certain financial and non-financial targets are met. Whilst the Trust is looking at ways to maximise revenue, there is an incentive for the Trust to recognise as much revenue as possible in 2018/19 to meet its control total;See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors'disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements and estimates relating to the recognition of revenue and expenditure and notes 3 to 5 for further information. There continues to be financial challenges in the NHS as demand outstrips funding available. There is increased scrutiny on financial performance as the Trust continues to deliver the benefits associated with the Integrated Care Organisation. The Trust agreed a control of \u00a31.725m surplus with NHS Improvement. The Trust was required to achieve their quarterly control total targets to receive Provider Sustainability income which is paid in quarterly instalments. The Trust receives the majority of its income from local commissioners and the local authority for the services it provides. The majority of contracts are block contracts, which is a fixed agreed amount paid for the year. Other sources of income are variable and based on activity or variations agreed during the year. These variable elements pose the greatest risk and where we focus our work. 105Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Revaluation of land and buildings Trust checking that the portfolio of properties included in the valuation was consistent with the Trust's fixed asset register; and confirming to estates records that the gross internal area used by the Trust's valuer was accurate. How we tailored the audit scope Materiality Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: How we determined itthe accuracy of the underlying data provided to the valuer by the Directors (e.g. Gross Internal Areas) which is used in the valuation. Other than the matter noted in the 'Material Uncertainty relating to going concern' paragraph, we determined that there were no further key audit matters relating to the financial statements of the Group to communicate in our report. Overall materiality Rationale for benchmark appliedWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Trust and the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the environment in which the Group operates. The Trust comprises one single entity with books and records all retained at the head office in Torquay. The group comprises the Trust and SDH Developments Limited. We performed full scope audit procedures on both the Trust and its subsidiary company. We performed our audit at the head office in Torquay. The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. \u00a38,553,656 (2017: \u00a38,058,960)Group financial statements 2% of revenue (2017: 2% of revenue) Consistent with last year, we have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, in the absence of indicators that an alternative benchmark would be appropriate.Trust financial statements \u00a38,550,000 (2017: \u00a38,058,960) 2% of revenue (2017: 2% of revenue) Consistent with last year, we have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, in the absence of indicators that an alternative benchmark would be appropriate. For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was \u00a3168,100 and \u00a38,820,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was less than our overall group materiality. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u00a3300,000 (Group audit) (2018: \u00a3300,000) and \u00a3300,000 (Trust audit) (2018: \u00a3300,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.We confirmed that the valuer engaged by the Trust to perform the valuations had professional qualifications and was a member of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). We obtained and read the relevant sections of the full valuation performed by the Trust's valuer. Using our own valuations specialist, we obtained the methodology and assumptions applied by the valuer and checked they were consistent with market practice and other expected benchmarks We tested the data provided by the Trust to the external valuer by: checking that the portfolio of properties included in the valuation was consistent with the Trust's fixed asset register; and confirming to estates records that the gross internal area used by the Trust's valuer was accurate. We agreed that the values provided to the Trust by the valuer had been correctly included in the accounts and that the valuation movements were accounted for correctly. We have evaluated the impact of depreciating the components over a different life and calculated the impact on depreciation. The difference is immaterial. Our testing noted no material changes in carrying value.See note 1 to the financial statements for the directors' disclosures of the related accounting policies, judgements and estimates and notes 6 and 16 for further information. Property, plant and equipment (PPE), totalling \u00a3189.3 million, represents the largest balance in the Trust's statement of financial position. The value of land is \u00a37.7 million and of buildings is \u00a3145.3 million. All PPE assets are measured initially at cost with land and buildings being subsequently measured at fair value based on regular valuations. The valuations are carried out by professionally qualified valuers in accordance with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Appraisal and Valuation Manual The Directors provide input to the Valuer on the assumptions to be used in the valuation methodology which determines the carrying value of the assets, any impairments and the associated depreciation charge. The Trust commissioned the valuer during 2018/19 to complete a full valuation of the Trust's land and buildings. assumptions made by the Directors, including the condition of the assets, any obsolesce, build costs and the location of a \"modern equivalent asset\"; the estimated useful life of the buildings; andWe determined the areas of risk to be: 106Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Reporting on other information Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statementsPerformance Report and Accountability Report In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Performance Report and Accountability Report for the year ended 31 March 2019 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2018/19.The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. With respect to the Performance Report and the Accountability Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2018/19 have been included.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Trust and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Performance Report or Accountability Report. In addition, the parts of the Remuneration and Staff reports to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2018/19. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group and Trust or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The Trust is also responsible for putting in place proper arrangements to secure economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources.As explained more fully in the Accountability Report set out on page 73, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2018/19, and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Council of Governors of Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust as a body in accordance with paragraph 24 of Schedule 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006 and for no other purpose.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report. We are required under Schedule 10(1) of the National Health Service Act 2006 to satisfy ourselves that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources and to report to you where we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that it has done so. We are not required to consider, nor have we considered, whether all aspects of the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources are operating effectively. We have undertaken our work in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice, having regard to the criterion determined by the Comptroller and Auditor General as to whether the Trust has proper arrangements to ensure it took properly informed decisions and deployed resources to achieve planned and sustainable outcomes for taxpayers and local people. We planned our work in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice. Based our on risk assessment, we undertook such work as we considered necessary. 107Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Other required reporting while the Trust is forecasting a surplus in 2019/20, the Trust has limited headroom with regards to cash; cost improvement plans have not all been developed for 2019/20; and the Trust's cash flow forecasts suggest that further funding will likely be required for the Trust to meet its liabilities in 2019/20 examined the impact of cash flow sensitivities and assessed these against the Trust's ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due; and sensitised the assumptions behind the Trust's financial forecasts by comparing them to historical performance against plan Other matters on which we report by exception We are required to report to you if: the statement given by the directors on page 67 , in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and other stakeholders to assess the Group and Trust's performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Trust acquired in the course of performing our audit. the section of the Annual report on page 29, as required by provision C.3.9 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. the Annual Governance Statement does not meet the disclosure requirements set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2018/19 or is misleading or inconsistent with our knowledge acquired in the course of performing our audit. We have not considered whether the Annual Governance Statement addresses all risks and controls or that risks are satisfactorily addressed by internal controls. we have referred a matter to Monitor under Schedule 10 (6) of the National Health Service Act 2006 because we had reason to believe that the Trust, or a director or officer of the Trust, was about to make, or had made, a decision which involved or would involve the incurring of expenditure that was unlawful, or was about to take, or had taken a course of action which, if followed to its conclusion, would be unlawful and likely to cause a loss or deficiency. we have issued a report in the public interest under Schedule 10 (3) of the National Health Service Act 2006. we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Certificate Heather Ancient (Senior Statutory Auditor) for and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors Bristol 29-May-18We draw your attention to the Group's Financial Review and Annual Governance Statement on page 74 of the Annual Report, which includes further details on the matters noted below and the Trust's actions to address the issues.Under the Code of Audit Practice we are required to report, by exception, if we conclude we are not satisfied that the Trust has put in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2019. Arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources The extent, nature and availably of any financial support to meet funding requirements, which includes a working capital acility from the Department of Health and Social Care, has not yet been confirmed. In considering the financial performance of the Trust and the appropriateness of the going concern assumption in the preparation of the financial statements, we obtained the 2019/20 annual plan and: The Trust's forecasts suggest that further funding will be required for the Trust to meet its liabilities from quarter two of 2019/20. The Trust will likely negotiate additional loan funding in the last two quarters of 2019/20 to cover the financial requirements for the rest of the financial year. The Trust has stated it will begin these negotiations in the 2019/20 financial year (at least two months prior to the loan being required). The Trust will also assess the need for further funding for 2020/21 when negotiating its control total. We certify that we have completed the audit of the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 5 of Part 2 to the National Health Service Act 2006 and the Code of Audit Practice.Adverse opinion Basis for Adverse Opinion and Key Audit MatterAs a result of the matters set out in the Basis for Adverse Opinion and Key Audit Matter section immediately below, we have concluded that the Trust has not put in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of its resources for the year ended 31 March 2019. We focused on this area in particular due to the deterioration in the Trust's financial position and the uncertainty over the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. The Trust continues to experience increases in demand for services that are outstripping increases in funding and cost savings being achieved. The Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2018/19 requires that the financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis unless management either intends to apply to the Secretary of State for the dissolution of a NHS Foundation Trust without the transfer of the services to another entity, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

This includes changes to our care pathways and the design of our new Emergency Department which has been made possible by an allocation of \u00a313 million to give us the right environment to deliver the highest quality emergency care. We are using technology to support delivery of our priorities for example virtual clinics and NHS Quicker enabling improved access to services with real time information to make informed choices. Our clinical teams are taking the lead in making the real changes that reduce potential harm from sepsis. Patients are benefitting from the HOPE program and I am pleased that work in all these areas will continue. We have been tested this year with challenges to timely access to services both in the Emergency Department and more recently theatre capacity which has resulted in delays to treatment for patients requiring routine treatment. We have engaged with national leads to implement plans to address these challenges. Supporting carers across the Urgent and Emergency pathway is a priority area this year and I am pleased to see the continued focus on improving digital and technology enhanced care. We are already seeing the benefits of this with local care home partners. I want to send a huge thank you to staff; I am l ooking forward to next stage of ' Our Journey'. I commend this Quality Account to you and confirm that, to the best of my knowledge, the information in the document is accurate. Liz Davenport, Chief Executive, 28 May 2019 This report sets out how the Trust has delivered against our quality targets over the past year, and our quality improvement priorities and plans for 2019/20. In year we have made progress and addressed a number of challenges to delivery of our quality acc ount priorities . Thank you to staff whose energy commitment and enthusiasm has ensured that we have kept our focus on doing the right thing for people who use our services. 168 Part 2 : Priorities for improvement Looking back: 2018/ 19 In our 2017/18 Quality Account we reported that we would focus on five priority areas for quality improvement in the period 2018/19. These were all locally agreed priorities developed in conjunction with key stakeholders at our annual Quality Accounts Stakeholder meeting. The meeting included Healthwatch, Trust governors, commissioners, and local councillors as well as our health and care teams. The priorities were then endorsed by the Trust board prior to publication. Patient safety Priority 1: To understand, learn from and act on the experiences of our local population using our services during the winter period (Dec to March) 2017/18. During the winter period, health and care services are pressured which may result in patients having poor experiences of care. As a learning organisation it is important that we learn from the users of our services where we have provided excellent care and where it has worked less well, particularly during these busy periods. In quarters 1 and 2 we agreed we would: Analyse complaints, incidents and other forms of user feedback which relate to aspects of care provided during the winter period. Develop a set of principles and mitigating actions which can be included in the planning round for winter 2018/19 . In quarters 3 and 4 we agreed we would: Proactively monitor what we have put in place ensuring that we can further refine plans and act on issues as they arise. Celebrate excellence and share best practice both within the organisation and with our wider community. A small steering group started work on this priority. We started by gathering a wide range of data the Trust collected to compare and contrast over 4 winter periods , (Dec - Mar). The data was taken from sources such as engagement, performance, discharge, waiting times and specifically included activity. Activity data as below showed an increase of attendances from the previous year. 169 The Trusts incidents data, complaints, real time patient feedback was also reviewed. The real time patient experience data show no significant change over the reviewed periods. Patient reported experience remains high. The Friends and Family results also showed consistently good feedback, as below. The data was analysed looking for any trends and the analysis included word clouds and surveys of the Emergency Department Users. These word clouds highlight expectation, waits but also good care and compassion. 0.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.0070.00 Extremely Likely Likely Neither Likely nor unlikelyUnlikely Extremely UnlikelyF&F scores 4 Year Comparison 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 170 The main findings of the wide ranging review included privacy, parking, waiting times, and user variable expectation and understanding of the service. The outcome of this highlighted the building infrastructure as needing modernisation to meet future need. Actions that have followed includ ed: Sharing the findings with the Emergency Department Matron. A patient survey was undertaken in the department to further help the understanding of the patients ' experience and expectations The Emergency Department commissioned Healthwatch Torbay to survey patients as part of a larger piece of work to prepare for the proposed new build to the department. Future actions include the displaying of information electronically in the waiting areas e.g. waiting times and alternative treatment centres. The work undertaken reviewing patient experience and expectation will largely be met with this planned new build for the Emergency Department. The new build will address space and privacy issues and bring real time data on triage waiting times, and alternative treatment centres and their waiting times directly to the patients in the department and also be available online or via the new NHS quicker app. Staff engagement work is ongoing in helping bridge the information gap until the new build is complete by highlighting the alternative centres e.g. Newton Abbot Minor Injuries unit and display of waiting times so users can make an informed choice on where to receive treatment. Priority 2: To improve the way inpatient sepsis is recorded on the wards to enable improved identification and treatment of ward-based sepsis. Sepsis is potentially a life- threatening condition where the body's immune system goes into overdrive in response to an infection. Patients that present with severe sepsis symptoms require rapid administration of antibiotics. Antibiotics are the single most critical action that can prevent deaths from sepsis. The Trust in recent years has been making rapid progress in setting up systems and processes to identify, treat and record sepsis when patients come into A&E. Our monthly audits show that we have an embedded process to identify and treat patients quickly in the Emergency Department Sepsis can also occur on the ward and it is important that we treat these patients quickly. Currently we do not have a systematic way to collect data to evidence that patients are been treated appropriately. 171 In 2018/19 we agreed we would: Spread the use of the inpatient sepsis proforma which has been developed on a ward by ward basis. Improve our data collection methods on the ward so we can report quarterly the number of patients screened and treated for sepsis. Explore the implementation of an electronic sepsis assessment tool and make a business case, if appropriate, for the implementation of the tool. In 2018/19 we have seen the successful embedding of a simplified inpatient sepsis proforma on the wards. This has used both NICE guidance and Sepsis Trust suggestions to provide a local solution. A group of enthusiastic F1 and F2 doctors have helped introduce the concept of raising sepsis at the daily ward safety huddles and assessing if any patients meet the criteria for treatment. They have also helped train the remainder of the junior doctor team. In our Emergency Department we have continued with the successful use of the existing sepsis protocol. This is linked into our IT system, Symphony, used within the Emergency Department Notes reviews have seen antibiotic delivery to suspected septic patients within 60 minutes in over 70% of cases. The remaining cases are due to late triage or a data recording issue on Symphony. Both issues are being addressed. Our Sepsis Working Group has been re-launched and now renamed the Deteriorating Patient Working Group in order to broaden our focus to all patients whose physiology is deteriorating, and not just sepsis. In 19/20 the first role of the new group is to oversee the introduction of NEWS 2 . NEWS 2 is the latest version of the National Early Warning Scores (NEWS) which is a standardised scoring system to assess and respond to acute illness, including sepsis. Ward sepsis proforma - top sheet 172 Clinical effectiveness Priority 3: To redesign outpatients to make these services more patient- centred and use resources effectively. The Trust provides over 300,000 outpatient appointments a year. These appointments are delivered at Torbay Hospital and in our local community hospitals and health and wellbeing centres. The way clinics are delivered has remained largely unchanged over the last thirty years with increasing mismatch of what patients need versus how outpatients work. Also with increasing demands on an outdated outpatient's model, patients are waiting longe r. We currently have over 9,000 patients waiting past their planned to be seen date. Redesigning outpatient services has been recognised nationally as a key priority with the head of the NHS Simon Stevens referring to the way outpatient services are offered 'is obsolete'. There is also recognition that this will take time to make all the changes required. The Trust started on this journey two years ago with it being a Quality Account priority in 2017/18. Last year we agreed to focus on: Improving patient pathways into outpatients from primary care. The IT infrastructure to support a live scheduling system for all clinic accommodation in the integrated care organisation. The IT infrastructure to offer alternatives to face- to-face appointments. Offering appointments in different ways, for example group appointments, telephone, or video phone appointments Reducing unnecessary appointments both first and follow up. Expanding the use of patient-initiated appointments. Our work over the last 12 months includes: Developing virtual clinics where patient's conditions will be reviewed by clinicians and then information shared with patient's by phone, letter or video and only those needing to be seen coming into an outpatient clinic. Recent examples include respiratory services who have set up a virtual pneumonia clinic and audiology. In Pain services work has included developing a new set of resources which people can use to understand their pain condition better and strategies to manage it. Called ReConnect2Life this interactive programme includes a set of six modules including a series of short videos. Early evidence shows the resources are having a positive impact. https://www.torbayandsouthdevon.nhs.uk/ser vices/pain -service/reconnect2life / 173 In Ear, Nose and Throat different stra tegies have been used to redesign services i ncludes stopping referrals for some conditions. A recent example includes stopping outpatient clinics for simple snoring with GPs offering alternative strategies to treat the condition. Also guidelines continue to be updated and standardised across Devon based on best evidence. Examples include rhinitis and globus . All this information about referrals are available to our GPs through the South and West Devon Formulary website https://southwest.devonformularyguidance.nhs.uk/ . In Audiology, hearing test follow ups are now three yearly. Virtual clinics mean that patients are now informed by letter or phone for negative results, saving unnecessary trips to the hospital. Also patient initiated appointments mean that patients are seen when they need to be seen, rather than a standard follow up which may not be necessary and opens up an appointment for someone with a greater need to be seen. These initiatives have saved 402 new ENT appointments 183 follow ups and 2700 audiology appointments in the first six months since the changes have been made. In Podiatry services, outpatient clinic times have been reduced by 25% as a result of developing a suite of videos that patients can use. Patients can practice at a time and place convenient to them and can pause, replay and see and try the correct techniques as much as they want. In spinal services we are in the process of refreshing and relaunching the spinal pathway with patients being referred to a physiotherapist first rather than going straight for an MRI scan. The new spinal pathway was launched on the 1st April 2019 with the aim of reducing unnecessary MRIs and for patients to be seen and treated in a more timely way. 174 In rheumatology services, patient initiated appointments are common place for patients with chronic conditions. Also the team have led in developing group rheumatology sessions. These sessions enable patients to come together to not only be treated individually but also to share and learn how to manage their condition with people they can relate to. The team has also been testing out a tool called PAM (Patient Activation Measure) which measures the knowledge, skills and confidence of a person to manage their own health care. Depending on their level of activation different strategies can be used to support the person. This may range from video and online tools for highly activated individuals to 1-1 coaching for those with a very low level of activation. The infrastructure to support the delivery of outpatient services has also started to be redesigned. Work led by the Medical Director includes reviewing the multiple referral routes into outpatients with the aim of simplifying the routes whilst improving access to advice and guidance by specialists to GPs. Work has also started on outpatient scheduling and on the outpatient environment at Torbay Hospital. There is now a bigger range of multifunctional outpatient rooms available to clinicians and the work currently being undertaken on outpatient scheduling means that the wide range of clinic rooms will be visible and bookable via our Trust intranet. In 2019/20 we will continue to focus on outpatient redesign working pathway by pathway whilst continuing to improve our underlying infrastructure. This work will be led by our two System Medical Directors supported by their Paignton & Brixham Integrated service team and Coastal Integrated Service team. Patient experience Priority 4: NHS Quicker https://www.nhsquicker.co.uk/ NHS quicker is a smartphone app and web application which enables anyone in Devon and Cornwall who has an urgent care problem to see what services are available to them from where they are located. They can then decide: Whether to go. When to go. Where to go. Our aim over the last 12 months has been to increase its use by the public and its visibility within the NHS, with the 175 aim of increasing interest across the wider NHS to adopt this form of technology and put. As of February 2019 we have over 13,500 downloads of the app since its launch. This is a steady growth from its initial launch last winter where national and regional coverage ensured a flurry of downloads. In the last 30 days (Feb) there were 439 downloads onto apple devices and 269 onto android phones and tablets. People can also look at NHS Quicker on their PCs which does not require any downloads at all. The feedback from people using the app is positive and comments include: NHS quicker is not only being used by the public, but also by health and care professionals on a daily basis. The NHS quicker platform is the only system where you can see live wait times across multiple providers, using multiple IT systems across multiple counties. The work started initially by Torbay and Exeter University has spread across Devon and Cornwall and now into Somerset and shortly Bristol. This means that anyone living, working or travelling in the SW will be able to see live wait and travel times at the touch of a button. This platform provides enormous value for money costing just \u00a327,000 to deliver this innovation. The system has also been developed so it could be spread nationally. \"Used NHs quicker this morning .... went to Newton as there was only 2 people waiting ... booked in ... had consultation ... had 3 X -rays ... got treatment plan and crutches ... out in less than an hour ... \" \"My GP used quicker to tell me where I could go to a local MIU which was 15 drive past ED. I was seen so much quicker despite the distance\". \"It is great to see frontline teams working together with academic partners in such an innovative way to come up with solutions. What is more exciting is increasingly seeing these ideas being shared and applied by organisations across the wider STP area and beyond.\" (Medical Director) \"It's fantasti c - I use this every day to see what is happening in my organisation and the status of the adjoining trusts\" \"Seeing data in real time allows us all to plan ahead. This is a first nationally!\" ( NHS Direct or) 176 As a result of the work undertaken, NHS quicker has also been recognised nationally in both the heath and university sector. Quicker was a HSJ award finalist and also recognised in the technological innovation category at the Times Higher Education Awards, only one of four nationally. Both these have helped raised the profile with interest from several other large Trusts in England. In the remaining part of 18/19, our communications team have committed to work with us to run a marketing campaign and Healthwatch continue to helpfully promote the app and platform as part of their local digital inclusion campaigns and through their websites. In 19/20 the aim is to continue to increase coverage through marketing and campaigns and we are exploring the opportunity to obtain a small amount of funding to spread nationally. Priority 5: Wellbeing and supported self-management: HOPE programme T here is wide recognition that focusing on what is important to an individual can improve their sense of wellbeing and support them to positively self-manage and prevent health conditions, so improving their experience of care. Positive self-management starts with the recognition that the individual has choice and control and are equal partners in their care. HOPE (Help overcoming problems effectively) is an evidence-based six-week group programme, co-facilitated by a member of the workforce and an individual with lived- experience. The programme is designed to support people to become more active in managing their own health and to improve their confidence in their own abilities to manage their own health and to seek support when needed. In 2018/19 our objectives were to: To plan and deliver a minimum of 24 HOPE programmes and offer a minimum of 288 places to t he people of Torbay and South Devon on the programme during 2018/19. To offer a variety of HOPE programmes and to increase the number of trained HOPE facilitators available to deliver the HOPE programme To evaluate the effectiveness of the HOPE programme with regards to improving health and wellbeing as well as impact on services. 177 During the course of 2018 we worked to build up the availability and variety of HOPE facilitators across the system, as a result 30 HOPE programmes were offered and run across Torbay and South Devon, serving people with a variety of issues. This equated to 400 places. Of the 400 places 182 people attended the programme. Podiatry HOPE attendees Some courses are more popular than others, depending on the cohort of individuals and the health conditions that they may be living with. Programmes delivered include: Carers HOPE Depression and anxiety HOPE HOPE for the workforce HOPE for Chronic Pain Movement disorders. Substance misuse. Generic HOPE as part of the Wellbeing co -ordination programme. HOPE for people with diabetic lower -limb neuropathy and recurrent ulceration. parent with children exhibiting complex behaviours. We started April 2018 with 19 trained facilitators and by March 2019 we have 64 trained facilitators. We have also been measuring the impact of the programme over the course of the year. We are using a range of qualitative and quantitative measure to do this. Over the course of the year we have been collecting questionnaires completed by the participants of the programme, with a focus on their level of knowledge, skills and confidence to manage their health conditions, mental wellbeing and quality of life. These questionnaires were completed at the beginning of the programme, at the end of the programme, at 6 months after the programme and at 12 months after the programme. As the evaluation is for those people who participated during 2018, we have not yet got the full data returned yet. However we do have the data comparison between the beginning of the programme and the end of the programme, demonstrating on the whole self-reported improvements. These are shown in the tables in this section. 178 We have also be collecting feedback from the course participants. Comments include: \"I felt really nervous at the first session and was worried about what other people might think of me but the facilitators were so warm and welcoming. I instantly felt supported. Each week I came away feeling more empowered to tackle some of the challenges I was facing and it was comforting to know that others who attended the course were facing similar struggles but that together we supported each other to improve and overcome these. The results for all of us who attended the course showed that things had improved significantly and I continue now to reflect and use the strategies I have learnt to improve my life and the way that I overcome problems\". ( HOPE participant) \"When asked would I like to go to the HOPE course with the others I thought \"why\". The reason why, I was gently told, was because I felt angry, frightened , and guilty and knew I couldn't cope. How right. I arrived and sat in a room with people just like me looking around thinking \"what am I doing here!?\" When asked how we felt, we all said sad, negative and unhappy things. However, at the end of our first HOPE get together I felt like I was with people who understand! At the end of the six weeks of HOPE we all, and I do mean all, felt positive about handling our situations better. Our chats, tears and laughter made us all good and trusted friends. We now mee t up once a month and catch up re our lives.... . Due to HOPE my handing of the situation is so much better, because of that my darling is so much more relaxed and, dare I write, less stressed\" (HOPE participant ) Mental wellbeing has improved overall from the start of the course to the end of the course. 54% of people have stated their quality of life has improved as a result of HOPE This shows improvements in people's knowledge, skills and confidence around managing and taking control of their health conditions. Improved levels of activation results in better health, wellbeing and life outcomes for people. 179 In 19/20 we plan to work with hospital speciality teams to develop the HOPE offer to better support people requiring outpatient care, empowering people to better self- manage their health conditions and helping to reduce the number of face to face follow up's required. We plan to work with Coventry University to develop a HOPE for wider determinants of health and its efficacy, testing this locally. T here is a recognised need and interest to expand the variety of HOPE courses offered across Torbay and South Devon, aligned to demand and operational priorities. HOPE is essentially a generic programme, with the greatest benefit coming from bringing people with shared or similar experiences together as peers. We plan to extend the current groups of people that we are offering HOPE to, including testing a 'Virtual/Live' HOPE course for those who may prefer or could benefit from it. We are finally working with our commissioning organisations and our partners, including the voluntary sector to spread this model of care. 180 Local improvement initiatives 2018/19 The Trust is involved in a wide range of improvement initiatives, many of which have been described in the annual report. Below is small selection. These reflect our joined up approach to delivering care. Our integrated care journey Torbay and South Devon Foundation Trust continues to be on a unique journey as one of the few Integrated Care Organisations nationally combining acute and community health and social care services together. In 2019, with the publication of the NHS Long Term Plan, integration of services is seen a key driver in improving the quality of care for patients and their families accessing our health and care services. What matters to Mrs Smith and her family? Our organisation is working closely with our health and care partners (Councils, Commissioners, other Trusts, Voluntary Sector etc.) in progressing at pace the delivery of our integrated care model. The model focuses on 5 key strategic objectives outlined below: Staying well This includes supporting people to live their lives well for as long as possible and working differently to support independence and wellbeing. In the long term this will reduce the burden on health and social care services in the future. Examples of how we are making this happen: Extending Wellbeing Coordination Services delivered by the Voluntary sector Extract from integrated care graphic 181 Extending HOPE (Helping Overcome Problems Effectively) Programme Implementing Making Every Contact Count Managing population health by implementing a risk stratification tool Promoting the best start to life through a focus on children and young people. The Right Care in the Right Place Providing care to people at home or in the community and supporting people to access the right support in the right place when they need it is integral to the way we deliver care. Examples of how we are making this happen: Developing clinical networks across a wider geographic footprint to serve people in Torbay and South Devon. Optimising ambulatory care pathways to increase same day assessment and discharges Implementing the Enhanced Care in Care Homes Framework Embed shared decision making which will ensure people are involved in decisions about their care. Building greater market sufficiency across the care sector Continuing to improve discharge processes through the implementation of a discharge hub in summer 2018 and embedding SAFER principles https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/safer-patient-flow-bundle-implement/ ) as part of a continued focus on Urgent and Emergency Care. Strengthening Partnerships We work closely with partners to deliver health and care across Torbay and South Devon. Examples of how we are making this happen: Developing local and joined up physical and mental health services that deliver holistic care. Providing and develop health and wellbeing centres that provide local access to services people need close to home. Strengthening partnerships with general practice including extending access out of core hours. Continuing to capture real time patient experience on the wards. 182 Sharing Information We are working together to share information so that people only need to tell their story once. Examples of how we are making this happen: Delivering integrated care records within the community. Using technology and new approaches to long term conditions management to enable innovations in outpatient services. Using video-conferencing to link care homes with professionals for advice and guidance. We have also embedded our electronic handover tool (Nerve centre) into all our inpatient wards whilst continuing to use the Risk assessment booklet developed as part of the 2017/18 Quality Accounts to capture a range of clinical assessments. Wellbeing at work Together are investing in care and supporting to both do their jobs and improve it. Examples of how we are making this happen: Focus on 'What is important to you' Promoting a self-organising team culture that frees people to deliver. Our Integrated Maternity Services Maternity services are a fully integrated service working across the hospital and within the community and an early example of the Trust in delivering joined up care. During 2018 the team have worked on five priorities to improve the care provision to women and our families. Below is an outline of two of the projects and the improvements to date. Smoking Cessation We identified compared to other Maternity units we had a high number of women who smoke at the time of birth. We also were not following national guidance in respect to monitoring carbon monoxide (CO) levels in all women in pregnancy. There is strong evidence that reducing smoking in pregnancy reduced the likelihood of stillbirth. The improvements that we have achieved: Policies and guidelines have been reviewed and updated to give staff clearer advice and guidance, 183 CO monitors funded for all midwives - now 100% have a monitor, and all women are monitored at booking. Educated staff around the smoking data locally and Single electronic referral process to the smoking cessation service Newsletter for staff Auditing of data to see how we have made improvements. Postnatal Contraception Following our meeting and a national survey, it was highlighted that women did not feel they were being advised about contraception prior to discharge from hospital. The improvements we have achieved: Developed a postnatal contraception leaflet and videos on hand held devices on the postnatal ward. Plan in 2019 to provide education to Maternity staff on contraception methods. A process for midwives to prescribe and administer the contraceptive pill prior to transfer home. Joining up care for children and young people Following a tender exercise by the two Clinical Commissioning Groups in Devon an alliance of NHS providers led by Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust has been awarded the contract to run community children's health services. The initial contract, which begins on 1 April 2019, is for a period of seven years which can be extended by a further three years. The service will be known as Children and Family Health Devon. A lot of work has gone into ensuring there is a smooth transfer of staff and services from the current provider so that on day one children, young people and their families won't notice a difference. However, o ver the coming months we will be working with staff, partners and most importantly those who use the services to develop the services to achieve the vision of a truly integrated system where children, young people and their families receive the support they need with a greater focus on prevention. 184 National improvement initiatives Currently the Trust is involved in a number of national improvement initiatives including : Seven-day services Torbay hospital continues to work on developing seven-day services. There are 10 clinical standards which are used to measure progress in this area. Our report to our Trust Board in February notes the following: Seven -day service standards Self- assessment Standard 2 Emergency admissions seen by a suitable consultant within 14 hours of admission Standard not met Standard 5 Seven day a week access to diagnostic services such as CT, endoscopy etc. Standard met Standard 6 Seven day a week access to consultant directed interventions e.g. interventional radiology and endoscopy Standard met Standard 8 High dependency patients seen twice daily and other patients once daily by a suitable consultant Standard not met Standard 1 Patients should be involved in shared decision making Currently we do not have robust measurement systems to measure all these standards see commentary below Standard 3 An integrated management plan established within 24hrs of admission to hospital Standard 4 Enhanced handover of clinical care between clinical teams Standard 7 Seven day a week availability of liaison mental health services Standard 9 Readily available support services e.g. pharmacy, community care services Standard 10 Regular review of outcome in terms of patient experience, safety, and clinical outcome Standard 1. Although shared decision making is implicit for patient and clinician interaction, it is rarely explicitly recorded in the notes. Treatment escalation plans are an exception to this. The use of printed patient information sheets is rarely recoded for emergency patients. Standard 3. Work is required to identify the members of the multidisciplinary team needed to provide a holistic assessment of emergency patients within 24hrs of admission as an emergency patient. Standard 4. Handover is led by com petent senior decision makers in the major acute specialities daily. Work is required to provide assurance that the handover process is accurately documented. Standard 7. Liaison psychiatry is available for both adults and children. Data collection methods will need to be developed to assess this. 185 Standard 9. The development of community support services is a major component of the emergency offer. This includes development of enhanced intermediate care and work with care providers and community hospitals. Recent developments include the discharge hub and work to strengthen our frequent attenders offer. Standard 10. Outcomes of emergency patients are monitored by a weekly multi- disciplinary team and a monthly strategic meeting. In 2019/20 our aim is to work on improving seven day services through the newly developed Urgent and Emergency Care Integrated Service. This work will be clinically led by the System Medical Director and operationally delivered by the teams supporting urgent and emergency care. Rotas and gaps The Trust, as with most of health and care organisations is proactively addressing workforce challenges for doctors and dentists in training. As well as traditional recruitment processes the Trust is seeking to secure sufficient substantive Trust Grade Junior Doctors by creating attractive offers including QI and Research opportunities within job plans. In addition, we have a number of Surgical Care Practitioners and Physicians Associates who have just completing or are in the process of completing their training. The Trust continues to develop these roles and the roles of specialist nurses alongside junior doctors to secure increased resilience in the rotas. In 2019/20, as part of their overall improvement work, the Medical Leadership Workforce will review our overarching strategy in relation to the medical and dental workforce. Sign up to safety Tissue viability and pressure ulcer prevention Pressure Ulcers continue to be a key area for the Trust 's sign up to safety activities. To the end of Dec 2018 (start month April 18) there have been 2 patients who have developed Category 3 or 4 pressure ulcers with identified lapses in care against last year's YTD performance of 5 patients. This means that the current position is a reduction of 60% in pressure damage from last year's data. 186 To put this in to perspective when the initial Pressure Ulcer Prevention programme was started in 2014/15 we had 17 patients who suffered pressure damage as a result of lapses in care across the Trust. Pressure ulcer prevention remains a core part of the Trust teaching programme with the following education being provided by the tissue viability team: Pressure ulcer prevention teaching sessions which are open to Trust staff, care homes and GP practices Tissue viability updates which are open to Trust staff, care homes and GP practices Annual conference day for care homes National and international conference representation. To support the pressure ulcer prevention programme we have been working on the types of mattresses we use and how this can support pressure ulcer prevention. The tissue viability team are also involved in the PROMISE quality improvement project which has provided pressure mapping equipment to the Trust of the value of \u00a334k. This enables the tissue viability team to visit patients in their own homes and provide pressure mapping over a 72 hour period to reduce the individual risk of pressure ulcer development and identify strategies that will achieve this. Falls assessment prevention and treatment 1 in 3 people over 65 will have a fall at home. Within hospitals a fall not only can be traumatic to the individual but it is also costly within the local health and care system. With an ageing population in Torbay and South Devon, we recognise that likelihood of people falling is greater and as a result we have two falls specialist supporting us to reduce the number of preventable falls. 187 Over the last year the falls leads have: Worked closely with the newly created Assisted Lift Response Service (ALRT). This lifting service responding to 999 calls for non-injured fallers and was started in July 2018 and is expanding to offer support to our community teams. The service operates from 7.30 am to 4.30 pm Monday to Friday and is accessible by calling the usual 999 number. Tested and purchased new reusable bed and chair sensor pads to reduce fall within the Hospital Reviewed the current 'slipper sox' and moved to a safer double tread supplier. Created a new post fall policy, and post falls review form to ensure information is available in one place to ensure safe and effective handling after a fall . Extended post fall community training to care home staff. Created a suite of falls prevention leaflets available online. Accessed the improved Better Care Fund to expand the successful falls prevention groups further in the community of Torbay and South Devon Between February 2018 and January 2019, the number of falls has continu ed to vary, running between 60 -100 falls per month. During the winter months, the inpatient falls rates are slightly higher due to the number of older more complex people. 188 The falls prevention work will continue to remain a focus for 2019/20 and the Trust will be working on 3 high impact actions to prevent hospital falls; namely: 1. Lying and standing blood pressure to be recorded. 2. No hypnotics or anxiolytics to be given during stay OR rationale documented. 3. Mobility assessment and walking aid to be provided if required. This improvement forms part of national CQUIN programme which will be reporting on throughout the year to the Trust. Medications Safety Medication safety has been continually enhanced by the medical safety pharmacist with the pharmacy department. The work undertaken in this area includes the preparatory foundations for the Electronic Prescribing Medication Administration which is referenced in the improvement priorities for 2019/20. Duty of candour Being open and honest in any situation has always been a clear focus of the organisation and work is always ongoing to ensure any care we give is of the highest quality. If this doesn't happen , the Trust is focused on identifying any issues straight away, recording these on an incident form, informing the patient or family at the earliest opportunity, apologising and involving the family, where possible, in any subsequent investigation. This also includes meeting with families and feeding back any learnings or actions as necessary. The work this year has focused in the Service Delivery Units and, where appropriate, Duty of Candour process was followed in a timely manner. Feedback from patients and families, where this process has been followed has been positive. 189 Incident Investigation One of the key objectives of the governance team was to review the incident investigation process to ensure any local investigations centre on the families need and follow the above duty of candour process. The Trust sourced an external accredited investigations trainer who visited the Trust, worked with the Governance team and trained 15 investigators. The training was very relevant, dynamic and has produced a number of changes in the way incident investigation is undertaken. These include becoming more family centred, i.e. writing the report for the family, having a non-clinical reviewer of the investigation before sign off and a non-clinical proof reader, who ensures technical jargon and acronyms are removed. This has resulted in a number of process changes which are continuing into 2019. Speaking Up We recognise that in order for staff to deliver high quality care they must have a safe and supportive working environment. Staff must feel able to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be listened to, that actions will be taken and that they will be thanked for living the values of the NHS. To continuously develop our safety culture, the Trust has an embedded the 'See Something, say Something' initiative, which encourages and supports staff to raise genuine concerns on any issues at the earliest opportunity. The visibility of the initiative is maintained through posters, leaflets , web pages and screen savers. Under the 'See something Say something' initiative there are a number of people to whom staff can raise their concern, if they don't feel able to report it to their manager. These include: Professional Leads Trade Union/Health and Safety Representatives Health and Safety Managers Human Resources Acceptable Behaviour Advisors Freedom to Speak Up Guardians Diversity and Inclusion Guardian Our network of Freedom to Speak Up Guardians provide ongoing impartial and confidential advice and support to staff in raising concerns, providing regular updates and feedback. 190 The Guardians are very active in the organisation, attending corporate induction and department meetings on a regular basis to ensure there is wide understanding of th e role. The Guardians also present bi-annually to the Board, providing an overview of the number of cases raised, the emergent themes and developments in their work programme. Any concerns about being subject to detrimental treatment as a result of raising a concern are immediately escalated to the Director of Workforce and Organisational Development and the Chief Executive, who in collaboration with the Guardians ensure a safe space is identified for those individuals in the workplace. Feedback from staff who have been supported in raising concerns include: \"This episode has been very upsetting, but does prove the Trust does listen and cares for it employees. \" \"I can never thank you enough for being so approachable, understanding and caring. Making an awful situation very simple and painless.\" In 2019/20, as a Trust, we have agreed to focus on: Development and launch of a speaking up vision which will be embedded in the Trust People Strategy Publicising the learning from speaking up cases across the Trust Development of management training in responding to concerns Ensuring the Trust annual report includes a summary about speaking up Focus attention on minority groups and overcoming barriers to speaking up Review of the Trust bullying and harassment policy and practices. 191 Priorities for improvement Looking forward: 2019/20 The Trust has identified three improvement priorities for the year. These have been developed through discussions with health and care teams and our Trust Executive. We continue to hold the annual Quality Account stakeholders meeting to discuss and agree the priority areas for the year as the feedback year on year of this event is positive. These priorities have been signed off by our Board. The three improvement priorities for the year are: Safety Priority 1: To change our inpatient prescribing for people in hospital inpatient beds across the ICO to our commissioned electronic prescribing and medicines administration programme by 31 December 2019. This will be for adults in all specialties with exceptions such as chemotherapy and intra- operation medications. This project uses a new electronic prescribing and administrative system (EPMA) to record the prescription and administration of drugs, replacing paper-based charts. This new system is a major step towards the creation of a shared care record that all cli nicians can access, whichever part of our health and care system they work within. The system has initially been rolled out into nine of our medical and assessment wards starting in January 2019 . Clinical staff can now record a patient's drug history and their allergies, create a prescription and send it our pharmacy so prescriptions can be dispatched quickly. We can also share the information accurately with the patient's GP. The system is accessible from any Trust computer and the information is shared across all appropriate members of the clinical team, allowing them to make informed decisions. Unlike paper the information cannot get misplaced, lost or in use by someone else. This means that information is more accurate, accessible and available at any point in a patient's journey. We have agreed the following objectives to roll out EPMA and monitor its impact. This includes in quarter 1 and 2 (April to September) we will: Embed EPMA across our medical and assessment wards Roll out EPMA into our surgical inpatient wards Roll out EPMA to all our community hospitals 192 Set up systems and measures to monitor impact (positive and unintended consequenc es). This includes a reduction in missed and late doses, and ensuring the timeliness of care planning summaries is not reduced from our pre-implementation baseline . In quarter 3 and 4: Roll out EPMA to parts of our outpatient services Ensure that EPMA is fully embedded into all inpatient wards across the ICO. Report and publish measures as well as impact both through the Quality Account and through Trust newsletters and Trust communications. We will measure, monitor and report our progress against our objectives on a monthly basis to the Clinical IT User Group. On a quarterly basis this meeting will provide a highlight report to the Board. The project is being clinically led by the System Medical Director (Torbay) working with the EPMA project team. Board level support will be provided by the Director of Strategy and Improvement who also champions the use of technology to improve care. Clinical Effectiveness Priority 2: To implement the roll out of a community IT integrated clinical system to Coastal, and Newton Abbot localities. Within several of our localities recording and capturing patient assessments is not an easy process. Currently we have a mixture of paper based and IT systems which mean that we have to ask patients, their families and carers for the same information several times. Also the present way of working makes it very difficult to share information across our local health and care teams and to enable staff to work effectively outside the area they normally work in. Weekend staff, for example currently work across several localities and cannot easily access patient records. It is important that patient information is securely and easily shared. At the moment, this takes place through manual processes which is not ideal for timely or safe patient care. It also requires a member of staff remembering to share information. As a result of all these problems and the need to be more integrated, we are implementing an IT solution called SystmOne across our community. This system is in use within some of the GP practices in South Devon already and once records have been agreed to be shared our health and care staff can view patient records, when appropriate. SystmOne is also available for use as a mobile solution. This 193 enables staff to download patient information onto an encrypted Trust laptop and visit the patient in their home with accurate up to date information. In 2019/20 we have agreed: Quarter 1 To train community nurses in SystmOne in the Coastal locality Migrate patient records over from the community nurse waiting list Quarter 2 Go live with the community nurses in the Coastal locality Begin training staff on the IT system in the Newton Abbot Locality with a focus on occupational therapists, physiotherapists and enhanced intermediate care teams Quarter 3 Go live in the Newton Abbot locality for the teams trained in quarter 2 Quarter 4 Train community nurses in the Newton Abbot locality Migrate patient records from community nurse waiting list and go live The work will be led by the Community IT project manager supported by the IT Programme Manager. Board level support will be provided by the Medical Director. We will measure and monitor our progress against the objectives and report these to the IT Community Projects Board on a quarterly basis. A highlight report will then go to the Trust Board on a quarterly basis Patient experience Priority 3: To improve the Carers ' experience for themselves and their families receiving care across the urgent and emergency care pathway From Carers' stories, we know that their experience of urgent and emergency care is not always a good one. They feel that hospital staff could have identified them as a Carer sooner1, and for Carers of people with long-term conditions, they sometimes feel that their knowledge and expertise about the person they care for is ignored. 1 Healthwatch Consultation for 2018-2021 Carers Strategy 194 The Trust has signed up to the six principles of the Triangle of Care, identifying and supporting Carers, and treating them as partners in planning the care and support for the person they care for. For many people their first point of using our services can be via A&E and the Minor Injury Units (MIUs). This can be stressful and by its nature is unplanned. If we can improve Carers' experience of the urgent and emergency care (UEC) pathway this should improve experiences across the whole system . We will work closely with Carers and staff to embed the work which has already begun with the Triangle of Care, to start to address issues which have already been identified, and to identify what other priorities there may be going forward. In 19/20, we have agreed to: In quarter 1 Collate complaints feedback and issues already identified by Healthwatch / Carers ' Services Undertake survey work with Carers to identify their priorities Utilise Healthwatch's rate and review cards with volunteers / Carers' supporters in the Emergency Department to gain feedback and identify issues Liaise with staff to identify their priorities and any 'quick wins' Undertake a feasibility study for having additional volunteers / carers' supporters across the urgent and emergency care pathway particularly to address issues already raised such as Carers having to leave people unsupported while they park their car Identify means of improving communication / signage / publicity as required Use the existing Carers' Supporters in other wards to identify issues for Carers who have been admitted via urgent and emergency care Ensure agreed systems for identifying and recording carers are robustly in place, and identify any gaps Embed existing support to Carers e.g. Orange Lanyard and Hospital Passport Begin a programme of Carer awareness training across the pathway In quarter 2: Based on the quarter 1 feedback and analysis develop an action plan which we will co-design with Carers and the teams involved in delivering care along the urgent and emergency care pathway Prioritise areas to focus on. 195 In quarter 3 and 4 We will continue to work on the action plan, sharing successes and learning with the Carers and the clinical teams. We will re- measure at the end of quarter 4 the Carers' experience of accessing and using urgent and emergency care. The work will be led by the Associate Director of Nursing for Urgent & Emergency Care and Newton Abbot locality supported by the Carers Lead and ED Matron. Progress against the objectives will be measured and monitored via the Triangle of Care Steering Group, and reported to Quality Improvement Group on a quarterly basis with a highlight report to the Board by the Chief Nurse on a quarterly basis. 196 Statements of assurance from the Board Review of services During 2018/19 Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust provided and/or sub-contracted 51 relevant health services. Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust has reviewed all the data available to it on the quality of care in 51 of these relevant health services. The income generated by th e relevant health services reviewed in 2018/19 represents 89% (as of the end of March 2019 ) of the total income generated from the provision of relevant health services by Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust for 2018/19. The data and information reviewed and presented covers the three dimensions of quality: patient safety, clinical effectiveness, and patient experience. Participation in clinical audits For the Quality Account, the National Advisory Group on Clinical Audit and Enquiries has published a list of national audits and confidential enquiries. Participation in these is seen as a measure of quality of any Trust 's clinical audit programme. The detail which follows relates to this list. During 2018/19 , 49 national clinical audits and 3 national confidential enquiries covered relevant health services that Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust provides. During that period Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust participated in 98% national clinical audits and 100% national confidential enquiries of the national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries which it was eligible to participate in.

This should be done especially in the presence of anaemia Gain information from ED/ Clinical Experts as to whether this is a procedure undertaken locally - Pregnancy should not alter t he investigation and treatment of a woman presenting with a stroke. Neurological examination including assessment for neck stiffness and fundoscopy is mandatory for all women with new onset headaches or headaches with atypical features, particularly focal symptoms 0493 (NCEPOD) Acute Heart Failure Study Recommendation 4 - Heart Failure medications to be reviewed by Heart Failure Pharmacist - Action: this needs to be discussed with the Pharmacy Team Recommendation 5 - Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) access - achieved with access via cardiologist or Heart Failure Nurse Specialist - Action: audit of BNP use and changes to management 208 Recommendation 6 - Echo should be performed on Heart Failure patients within 48 hours - Action: Audit of echocardiogram access within 48 hours of those with raised BNP or suspected Heart Failure, time from request to perform Recommendation 9 - TEP form completions and documentation - Action: Audit TEP forms for Heart Failure patients Recommendation 11 - Post Heart Failure a dmission, seen by Heart Failure team within two weeks - Action: audit required Recommendation 12 - Confirmed Heart Failure patients should have six monthly reviews - Action: audit required Recommendation 13 - Cardiac rehab for Heart Failure patients - Action: needs to be addressed, to be discussed with community rehab team 0421 (NCEPOD) Chronic Neurodisability Study Recommendation 1 - a) Gross Motor Function Classification System used routinely to describe functional level of child and used as indicators for prognosis and information sharing. Cerebral Palsy Integrated pathway (CPIP) used to share clinical information in standardised way. b -e) There is a lack of consistency in data collection and joining up of data sets, to contribute towards a UK wide picture of need. e) 'Windip' access for all clinicians. 'Infoflex' used for CPIP clinics to share reports. No elect ronic note keeping for therapists or community nursing as yet however this has been requested. Also, no coding for medical outpatient correspondence where these young people are increasingly managed - national recommendations have been made using Systemat ised Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) listings. Action required: - IT systems to be developed to enable data collection across the service; has been escalated/ raised within Directorates but on wider prioritisation list Recommendation 2 - Cerebral Palsy Integrated Pathway (CPIP) is a database in some parts of the UK and internationally. SW CPIP database has been purchased by Bristol as lead provider and the SW NHS Trusts have come together to adopt the database in order to progress this. The CP Integrate d pathway is just one specific neuro -disability and we need to be mindful of ensuring that datasets can be collected for other chronic neuro -disabilities that we might see in childhood, e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Brain tumours etc. Action requ ired: - TSDFT to adopt CPIP SW. Staff already on regional working group but will progress action plan within MDT physio/ Paeds and need to continue liaison with IT about date protection requirements. There will be local training required which can be deliv ered by the MDT team members Recommendation 3 - TSDFT hold a hip surveillance database and CPIP review system and there is robust assessment of diagnostic assessment for the children on that through MDT and paediatricians are aware to ensure physio is invo lved in patient to access that pathway and lead care. We are moving towards joining the South West CPIP database hosted by Bristol Children's Hospital. Local training of paediatricians will be required - training date requested. Action required: - TSDFT in formation governance approval to be sought to adopt CPIP database. Training session for Paediatricians. Recommendation 5: Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) is routinely used on clinic letters and CPIP assessment by physiotherapists but is not embedded across other specialties. Training will start with paediatricians. Action required: - Training date as above. Audit when clinical correspondence is coded Recommendation 7: For children with CP this is, for some, achieved through CPIP (most complex) and partially achieved by most physiotherapists. Paediatricians have a report on the MDT and messages can be relayed to colleagues. Community nursing have access to advice and for all complex conditions children's progress overall is measured to som e extent through outcomes in EHC plans. Action required: - Planning through the Children and Young People bid Recommendation 9 - In reports, EHCP, clinic letters but this is not universal and has been raised at multiagency SEND forum for further focus - implications for access to services (such as GP annual check). Action required: - Table for pan Devon health subgroup Recommendation 14 - Pre and post op planning takes place by communication with the parents and operative team for elective surgery but it re lies on parents letting us know date of surgery (usually in other centres). For emergency surgery in under18s there is shared care with 'Paeds'. For CP and NM disease groups the physiotherapist will be involved in planning changes to equipment as well as planning post op rehab at home and school. In addition to Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy involvement needs to be considered in the planning of 209 any surgery so that a swift and fully supported discharge can be arranged post -surgery. Action required: - This continues improving with pathway development and individual case discussion through networks. It would be beneficial to have primary care on the network also - LD will raise at Clinician to Clinician meeting Recommendation 15: - Paediatric pain profi le used occasionally to help determine source of discomfort. Pain scores are an integral part of inpatient care locally but communication with those with learning difficulties is a separate work stream. Action required: - Audit could be considered at Trust level? Recommendation 16: There is not a named keyworker from Child Health, but there is continuity of care with a named physiotherapist. Handover between physiotherapists is usually planned and parents are involved in transition where there is a change in staffing e.g. a joint appointment is held with both physiotherapists to ensure continuity of care. Community nurse or paediatric school nurse may be involved for under 18s. Occupational Therapist's involved in patient care will ensure a thorough hando ver if cases are being transferred from one clinician to another. Action required: - within CYP bid Recommendation 17: - Achieved - all children with CP GMFCS 3 -5 are on the CPIP care pathway. Children GMFCS 1 and 2 are not included at present as this would need to be a newly commissioned service. Previous business case and commissioners aware. Action required: - within CYP bid Recommendation 20: - Ready Steady Go paperwork (from 14/15) is used by paediatricians and community nursing but is not shared by th erapists at present. Use is not consistent/ embedded. There is no secondary medical service to transition to but individual arrangements are shared with carers/ young people with signposting. Action required: - There is an opportunity for this to be an MDT document in the new service redesign Recommendation 21: Appropriate clinical space is available at special schools, Newton Abbot hospital and at John Parkes unit. In each area privacy can be maintained and age appropriate setting provided. Action required: - Outreach clinics at Totnes hospital need child friendly rooms and patient feedback was of difficult access in radiology - taken on b oard Recommendation 22: Transition planning is undertaken by physiotherapists who may attend transition review meetings. A checklist has been developed describing transition from paediatric to adult physiotherapy services to aid clinicians in this process . Preparing for adulthood is a work stream in Devon and Torbay under the SEND Boards and includes outcome focussed integration. Primary care representation is improving but patchy. A transition report will be completed for children open to OT at the tim e of transition detailing functional skills, needs, and equipment in use. This is shared with adult services and we endeavour a handover to adult OT where appropriate. Action required: - This needs to be a multi -disciplinary plan. Needs ongoing engageme nt with SEND agenda especially to bring on board adult services and primary care Recommendation 25: Communication passports are provided by SALT at special schools. This information is included in the EHC plans but at present there is still poor knowledge of where these are stored and they may be out of date. Action required: - 1- Support plan to raise flag for all children/ YP with EHC plan with signposting. 2 - Staff training. 3 - Work to encourage communication of updates from Education and shared acce ss to therapists reports Recommendation 26: Some resources are made available at John Parkes unit and at health bases within Special Schools. Communications have been distributed to GP surgeries through CCG and all services provide advice and guidance. P romotion of the 'Local Offer' (directory of services) is increasing but care events are still often 'silo focussed'. Action required: - Physiotherapists should routinely offer information at clinics or make resources more available for parents to access i ndependently Recommendation 27: Longer appointments are made at Orthopaedic clinics and they are held at special schools to help improve access. Dedicated clinics have been set up by Radiology for hip screening with trained staff, longer appointments and hoisting facilities. 'Disability matters' has been shared among paediatricians and NHSE/ HEE competencies for working with disabled people have been shared with Directorate for Education. At clinic and school appointments children are accompanied by a c arer who knows the child well enough to be able to facilitate communication. Action required: Share disability matters resource with clinicians at a team meeting and then at induction for new staff Recommendation 30: Children are included in decision mak ing at clinics wherever it is appropriate to do so. This is often facilitated by the parents but SALT is rarely involved to facilitate this. Staff are not yet fully embedding 'having different conversations' with young 210 people early enough in transition. Action required: Within SEND work streams and to consider local audit of use of Ready Steady Go and evidence of engagement through SEND Champions forum. Recommendation 32: Total communication training is available to all clinicians who work with childre n with a learning disability through the SALT department. Therapists and nursing staff are encouraged to book onto this. Royal College of Paediatric and Child Health has recently updated its training programme to include improved generic skills to includ e communication. Action required: - Raise awareness with paediatricians through planned training - await date Recommendation 33: Care Pathways are in place e.g. postural management and CPIP care pathway but they are not published. Action required: - Publish pathways and contact details on the Trust website Recommendation 34: Hoisting is available on request at Torbay and Totnes hospital but not at Newton Abbot. Outreach clinics are held in health facilities on Special School sites to facilitate this. There is close communication and co -located clinics with equipment services (but different providers) and specific joint outcomes measures to include participation and independence. Action required: - Newton Abbot hospital needs a mobile hoist for outpa tient clinics. The ward hoists are not compatible with most children's slings. Funding needs to be sought 0617 MBRRACE - UK - Saving lives, Improving Mothers Care - Lessons learned to inform maternity care from the UK and Ireland Confidential Enquiries i nto Maternal Deaths and Morbidity 2013 -15 Gain information from Emergency Department (ED)/ Clinical Experts as to whether this is a procedure undertaken locally! - A normal ECG and/or a Troponin does not exclude the diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome Gain information from ED/ Clinical Experts as to whether this is a procedure undertaken locally - Women of reproductive age presenting to ED collapsed, in whom a pulmonary embolism is part of the differential diagnosis, should have a Focused Asses sment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) scan to exclude intra -abdominal bleeding from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy before thrombolysis is given. This should be done especially in the presence of anaemia Gain information from ED/ Clinical Experts as to whet her this is a procedure undertaken locally - Pregnancy should not alter the investigation and treatment of a woman presenting with a stroke. Neurological examination including assessment for neck stiffness and fundoscopy is mandatory for all women with ne w onset headaches or headaches with atypical features, particularly focal symptoms Research The number of patients receiving relevant health services provided or sub-contracted by Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust in 2018/19 that were recruited during that period to participate in research approved by a research ethics committee was 1701. Participation in clinical research demonstrates Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust 's commitment to improving the quality of care we offer and to making our contribution to wider health improvement. Our clinical staff stay abreast of the latest possible treatment possibilities and active participation in research leads to successful patient outcomes. Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust was involved in conducting 235 clinical research studies during 2018/19 in 39 specialities. 211 During 2018/19 105 clinical staff participated in approved research at Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust. In the past year more than 22 publications have resulted from our involvement with the National Institute Health Research, which shows our commitment to transparency and desire to improve patient outcomes and experience across the NHS. Our engagement with clinical research also demonstrates Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust's commitment to testing and offering the latest medical treatments and techniques. Here are just a few examples of how our participating in research improves patient care. Clinical Specialty Study details Respiratory Singing for Wellness study: A Trust led and sponsored study, funded by the Torbay Medical Research fund. Chief Investigator Dr Elizabeth Ginn. Is singing a useful way of supporting people in Torbay to self -manage aspects of their Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ).? Does a bespoke respiratory choir provide a non -medical intervention for those with COPD in our local community? Participants were invited to take part in a new 12 -week community choir to help us investigate the effect singing in a choir may have on their breathing, COPD management and wellbeing. There was one group choral session each week for the duration of a 12 -week period. The results showed that participants reported outcomes wholly positive - with emotional narrat ive from participants very encouraging. So powerful were the stories heard, that participants thoughts and emotions were captured (with consent) on a short film by the HiBlio team. Other outcomes include: BBC interested and contacted local Culture board a bout making a short film. Commissioners very excited and three more 12 week courses funded with collaboration with Arts Council and Culture board funding with more groups in Totnes, Brixham (local GP practices supporting self -referral process) and Shiphay , Torquay. A great example of ICO working across boundaries of primary and secondary care. Extension to other vocal practitioners within the community with new people joining - peer teaching occurring and mentorship for the vocal practitioners. The Brompton keen to collaborate using this data and would like it to contribute to a national programme. Participants leaving the first cohort have joined other local 212 choirs to continue their participation in singing. Mentioned in Great Places: local event held by Cu lture Board. A&E HALT -IT Study: Tranexamic acid for treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding: A randomised controlled trial. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common emergency that causes substantial mortality worldwide. This International Emergency room study evaluated the use of tranexamic acid for GI bleeds. Trial results awaited. Patients with Gastro intestinal bleed not routinely given tranexamic acid to control the blood loss. If proves successful with GI bleeds tranex amic acid will reduce the need to have blood transfusions, and therefore reduce side effects such as clotting problems. Will also reduce the amount of blood used generally from the National transfusion service. Quality Improvement Reflections on the res earcher -in-residence model co -producing knowledge for action in an Integrated Care Organisation: a mixed methods case study using an impact survey and field notes . Dr Felix Gradinger, Dr Julian Elston , Susan Martin, Professor Richard Byng and Professor Sheena Asthana. Funded by Torbay Medical Research Fund Background/Aims/Objectives 'Embedded' approaches to knowledge mobilisation are gaining currency, as health and social care services come under i ncreasing pressure to re -design services now rather than wait for research. One such approach is the 'Researcher in Residence' (RiR) model which seeks to co -produce knowledge for action. The aim of this paper is to extend the evidence base regarding mechan isms of impact. Methods A two -year mixed -method case study of the experience and impact of two part -time RiRs , embedded within an Integrated Care Organisation to support the implementation of new models of care. Data included the results of an anonymous impact survey sent to 80 key stakeholders, field notes of meetings (n=112), and observations of naturally occur ring events (n=68). Findings Impacts were identified in relation to use of co -produced evidence, capacity building, changes in ways of working, and to a lesser degree changes in operations or strategy. Impact involved learning which was mediated by thre e non -linear, non -predictable, positive and negative feedback cycles (learning/improvement, access, expectation). A mixture of technical skills, personal attributes and behaviours were identified as key to this mediation. Four key messages Researchers in Residence are embedded in care systems to co-produce knowledge for action. 213 Integrated care case study evidences mechanisms of impact and attributes from a stakeholder perspective. Impact was mediated through three non -linear feedback cycles: Expectations , Access, and Learning and Improvement. The RIR model is a complex implementation intervention that merits roll -out combined with further study. Cancer -Prostate The STAMPEDE (Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy) Trial. STAMPEDE is a multi -centre international, multi -arm, multi -stage (MAMS) platform trial. The aim of the STAMPEDE trial is to test different approaches that try to prevent the tumour re-growth or spread by adding other treatments to the standard hormone therapy. The aim is to improve the survival of men with advanced prostate cancer. One part of the study tested whether adding radiotherapy to the prostate to long-term hormone therapy in men with newly diagnosed disease that had spread beyond the prostate could improve survival. The results showed that overall, radiotherapy did not improve survival for men whose disease had spread beyond the prostate. But, for the subgroup of men with ' low burden' disease (disease that had spread to lymph glands and/or to parts of the bone in the spine and/or pelvis, but not to other parts of the bone or other internal organs), radiotherapy significantly improved survival, with 81% of men alive after thr ee years, compared to 73% in the group receiving drug therapy alone. Implications of these results Radiotherapy to the prostate should now be a standard of care for men with prostate cancer who have a low metastatic burden, but not for men with a high meta static burden Radiotherapy to the prostate is also likely to be beneficial to patients who have non -metastatic, pelvic node -positive disease Radiotherapy to the primary tumour may also be beneficial for other types of metastatic cancer with low burden dise ase; research is needed to test this Radiotherapy is relatively low -cost, has modest toxicity and widely available in most parts of the world STAMPEDE is continuing to test new approaches to treating prostate cancer, with more results expected in 2019. Quality Improvement Research and evaluation of the Trust's integrated care model : Dr Julian Elston and Dr Felix Gradinger are part of the Community and Primary Care Research Group at the University of Plymouth. Three year study funded primarily by Torbay Medical Research Fund. Background In Torbay and South Devon, the acute NHS Trust and adult social care 214 and community services merged in October 2015 to create an Integrated Care Organisation (ICO) - among the first in the UK to adopt this new organisat ional form - implementing a new care model, as part of the integration of services. This vertical integration builds on the history of horizontal (i.e. across sectors) integration between organisations working in the Torbay area, following the development of the 'Mrs Smith model' and the creation of the Torbay Care Trust in 2005 The research was a mixed methods study involving a phased, iterative process of collecting and analysing quantitative and qualitative data. The core of the RiR activity focused on two care model innovations : 1. Enhanced intermediate care service (EIC) provided by multidisciplinary teams in the community looking to avoid hospital admission or bridging journeys back to people's homes 2. Co-located holistic link -worker /social prescribing, Wellbeing Coordinators Programme(WBC) The scope also included a case study of how these contribute to integration in one of the five ICO geographical locality hubs. Findings include: WBC programme has helped over 1,500 people over 50 years 2 LTCs, many frail and elderly in the first year Health and wellbeing improved significantly, with many positive stories of lives turned around. A small proportion of people account for a significant increase i n health and social care use (and cost), often due to a rapid deterioration in their health. Coastal locality model is relatively unique incorporating GPs, alongside health and care professionals and volunteers - working and coming together as an effective multidisciplinary team. Coastal key ingredients appear to be related to: strong championing/leadership, good co -ordination, high levels of trust and respect, co -location and size, contracting and RiR input. Enhanced Intermediate Care in Coastal is keepi ng relatively more people at home, reducing admissions into ED and holding more complex patients. Patient experience is good.

(N.B.The CQUIN value of the contract in 19/20 has reduced from 2.5% to 1.25% of applicable contract value) Care Quality Commission Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust is required to register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and its current registration status is: Diagnostic and screening procedures. Family planning services. Management and supply of blood and blood derived products. Maternity and midwifery services. Personal care. Surgical procedures. Transport services, triage and medical advice provided remotely. Treatment of disease, disorder, or injury. Termination of pregnancy. Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust has no conditions on registration. 216 The Care Quality Commission has not taken enforcement action against Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust during 2018/19. Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust has not participated in any special reviews or investigations by the Care Quality Commission during the reporting period. As noted in the 2017/18 report, the Trust received announced inspections in February 2018 for the following areas; Community children and young people (Short-announced) Community end of life care (Short-announced) Social reablement services. The Trust also received three unannounced inspections over the same period for the below areas; Maternity. Outpatients. Acute end of life care. The table below shows the rating provided for each of the services inspected in 2018. Service Rating Requirement notice Community Children and Young People Good No Community End of Life Requires improvement Yes Social reablement (St Edmunds) Good No Maternity Requires improvement Yes Acute Outpatients Good Yes Acute End of Life Good Yes Requirement notices and 'should do' action plans are monitored through the individual service leadership teams and reported to the Trust CQC Assurance Group. Following the core service inspections described above, the Trust received a 'well led' inspectio n during March 2018. The focus for this inspection was predominantly 217 Trust Board focussed; the feedback formed part of the overall Trust report along with the core service reports. The well- led inspection was rated as 'Good'. The overall Trust rating impr oved to 'Good' as a result of the 2018 inspections and is shown in the table below. The full report can be accessed at https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/new_reports/AAAH1824.pdf Other CQC service inspections during 2018/19 Specialist dental services delivered by the Trust were also inspected during February to May 2018 under the Primary Services inspection format. These services are delivered across 4 Trust sites and all were found to be delivering care in line with regulations. Special Education Needs and Disability services in Devon were inspected by Ofsted and the CQC in December 2018. The inspection was hosted by the Clinical Commissioning Groups and Devon County Council. TSDFT staff in various therapies disciplines were involved in the focus groups and inspection. The inspection report was published on the Ofsted web site on 5 February 2019. Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure)Regulations (IR(ME)R) 2017. The CQC undertook a short notice inspection of the Trust compliance against the IRMER regulations during December 2018, and focussed on the Torbay Hospital site. The inspection noted the good clinical practice, including training packages, incident reporting and investigations, and team working. An Improvement Notice was issued to improve written procedures to meet Regulatory Requirements. The Improvement Notice requirements and timeframe were met satisfactorily and formally closed. The action plan submitted to address additional findings was accepted by the CQC. Emergency Department 2019 In February the CQC attended Torbay Hospital to carry out a one-day unannounced inspection in the Emergency Department. This was one of a series of targeted inspections taking place on Mondays, across a number of Trusts, when acute hospitals are very busy after the weekend. This inspection was part of a CQC national programme of inspections by the Pressure Resilience Operational Group. Although the Emergency Department was extremely busy after a challenging weekend, our teams were coping we ll. The subsequent report notes appropriate processes for initial assessment and triage, that care and treatment was planned carried out in a timely way. Although the inspectors noted that compliance with 218 constitutional standards remained a challenge, new models of care and escalation protocols were providing signs of incremental improvement. There were 2 areas which required improvement, both of which were addressed following the primary feedback. This inspection is not part of the inspection regime and will not of itself impact on the Trust rating, which remains overall 'Good'. Data quality High quality data is important to our organisation for many reasons including our ability to improve our services and to understand how efficient our services are . Within the Trust data quality is managed primarily by the Health Informatics Service and the Information team working together to ensure there are appropriate governance processes in place to manage and improve data quality. NHS number and general practitioner registration code Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust submitted records during 2018/19 to the Secondary Uses Service for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics. The percentage of records in the published data, as of February 2019: which included the patient's valid NHS number was: 99.7% for admitted patient care. 99.9% for outpatient care. 98.6% for accident and emergency care. and those which included the patient's valid G eneral Medical Practice Code was: 99.8% for admitted patient care. 99.7% for outpatient care. 98.7% for accident and emergency care Information governance Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Information Governance Assessment report is no longer available and the system has been replaced by the \"Data Security & Protection Toolkit (DSP Toolkit)\". Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust's toolkit publication for 2018/19 was standards met. 219 Clinical coding Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust was not subject to the payment by results clinical coding audit during the reporting period by the Audit Commission. Data quality improvements Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust committed to take the following actions to improve data quality. Embedding the new information governance toolkit. An internal audit was commissioned and a draft action plan has been completed which will be updated if there are any additional recommendations from the auditors. The plan will be reviewed and approved to go forward at the next quarterly meeting of the Information Governance Steering Group. With regards to the remaining priorities: Maintaining or improving the Trust national SUS data quality position. Obtaining a realistic overview of the Trust 's data quality and related risks to information reporting. Acting on the recommendations of three data quality audits undertaken by the external audi tor in spring 2018 as part of the Trust' s annual quality account. The Trust has had to defer this improvement work as a result of 2 major IT incidences which has meant the Trust teams have been focused on maintaining critical clinical IT systems during this difficult time. The incidents were: Air Conditioning failure of Computer Room 1 at Torbay Hospital on the 27th February 2018. The failure of the 3 air conditioning units and subsequent overheating caused the failure of the system which took the teams several months to resolve. During this difficult period clinical services continued to run normally with health and care teams able to access patient level data. Fire in the electrical switch room/generator room on the 17th April at Torbay Hospital Annex. This room provides the main electrical power to Computer Room 1. Unfortunately the fire destroyed the main incoming cable to the Annex which resulted in no power being available across the site. Work was undertaken to ensure critical services were maintained whilst replacement kit was designed, manufactured and installed. Despite this, data quality is only slightly down on the previous year's position and additional improvements in A&E data in particular should start to feed through from April 2019. 220 Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust will be taking the following actions to improve data quality in 2019/20. Focus improvements on the deferred 2018/19 data quality improvements listed above plus any additional actions as a result of the information governance toolkit evaluation. Acting on the recommendations of three data quality audits undertaken by the external audi tor in spring 2019 as part of the Trust's annual quality a ccount. Data Qu ality Audits undertaken by PWC A&E: maximum waiting time of four hours from arrival to admission/ transfer/ discharge Mandated indicator All cancers: 62 -day wait for first treatment, from: urgent GP referral for suspected cancer, - NHS Cancer screening service referral Mandated indicator Summary Hospital -level Mortality Indicato r Local indicator Mandated quality indicators As part of the annual report the Trust is required to report against several mandatory quality indicators. These are described below. Domain1: Patient safety Lea rning from patient deaths 27.1 During 2018/19, (April 2018 to Mar 2019) of Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust 828 patients died. This comprised the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: 294 in the first quarter; 247 in the second quarter; 287 in the third quarter; 323 in the fourth quarter 27.2 By Dec 2018, 186 case record reviews a nd 186 investigations have been carried out in relation to the 828 deaths included above. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record review or an investigation was carried out was: 67 in the first quarter; 37 in the second quarter; 47 in the third quarter; 35 in the fourth quarter 221 27.3 186 representing <1% of the patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. In relation to each quarter, this consisted of: 0 for the first quarter; 1 for the second quarter; 0 for the third quarter; 0 for the fourth quarter. These numbers have been estimated using the Structured judgement framework based on the Royal College of Physicians guidance. 27.4 Based on the reviews undertaken we have learnt that communication is always an area where the system can improve and a video focusing on critical communication has been made. The video will be used as part of medical and nurse education. 27.5 The Trust has worked on the format and timings of its Mortality Surveillance Group and this is now incorporated within the Quality Improvement Group. This change has allowed for a wider clinical audience to participate in this important review group The group has strengthened its participation with the divisional Mortality and Morbidity meetings held in each speciality. These local meetings send through the review documents for the deaths they have reviewed as well as identifying any issues. These include learnings around VTE and the length of time prophylactic treatment needs to continue for, Mental capacity assessments as well highlighting the compassionate and family centred care that is given at the end of life . 27.6 The VTE learning is being shared at the Doctor grand rounds, the video produced is being used at local induction and planned Mental capacity talks are being planned at various meetings including a larger presentation by Browne Jacobson on mental capaci ty law 27.7 85 case record reviews and investigations were completed after January 2018 which related to deaths which took place before the start of the reporting period. 27.8 1, representing < 1% of the patient deaths before the reporting period, are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. This number has been estimated using the Structure Judgement framework. 27.9 1 representing < 1% of the patient deaths during 2017/18 are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. 222 Preventing people from dying prematurely Oct 17 - Sept 18 July 16 - June 17 July 15 - June 16 Oct 14 - Sept 15 SHMI 0.9039 0.8530 0.8440 0.812 National High - Low 1.26 - 0.69 1.22 - 0.73 1.17 - 0.69 1.17 - 0.65 Band (Band 2 = as expected Band 3 = lower than expected) 2 3 3 3 Observed deaths 1736 1,808 hospital-level mortality Indicator, or SHMI, is a measure of the number of patients that have died in hospital or within 30 days of being discharged from hospital.

These range from prospective redesigns of functions, reviews of services and retrospective reviews via investigation or mortality reviews from Dr Foster 231 Part 3 : Our performance in 2018/19 Overview of the quality of care based on Trust performance Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust an integrated care organisation. It continues to work with and be accountable to: NHS Improvement, our regulator. The Care Quality Commission (CQC). The commissioners via the various health contracts. The Local Authorities for social care. Our local communities through our members and governors. We also continue to work with the Devon 'STP'. The STP brings together our NHS organisations to develop plans and transform services across our county. The Devon STP has set out the operational planning context for 2019/20 that will see system plans capture the benefits of reducing variation in care and provision, and in reducing health inequalities with a focus on access, outcomes and management of demand. There is a shared focus on increasing planning alignment in 2019/20. Whilst there is a continuing need for individual organisations to deliver their respective annual planning accountabilities, including their contribution to the NHS 2019/20 deliverables and the 2019/20 requirements of the recently published NHS Long Term Plan, collective planning will be a foundation of 2019/20, as the Devon system advances in maturity in readiness to become established as an Integrated Care System. To deliver high impact transformational change and make the best use of any additional investment in 2019/20, system leaders have identified the following shared priorities: Accelerating the digital opportunities for the system - fewer, more integrated and interoperable, care record systems and transformation of access to care through technology. Development of an acute strategy for Devon and Cornwall, including tertiary services; and implementation of service delivery networks and changes in line with this direction of travel. Piloting the implementation of the national community models for mental health , to improve the interface between primary and secondary care, development of in- patient services, work on geographical scope of specialist services and the relevant shifts in investment required. 232 Addressing inequalities by ensuring resources are deployed in line with strategic ambitions and population needs and outcomes Investment in prevention to support people's needs in better ways, alternative to traditional care settings, to impact on demand in 2019/20. Additionally, it is felt that there are two areas which have previously been agreed for implementation that need to be progressed locally across the system for 2019/20. Implementation of the Integrated Care Model (ICM) blueprint agreed in2017, which will also help to stabilise primary care and impact on demand. Implementation of the Devon workforce strategy agreed in November 2018 Our role Torbay and South Devon Foundation Trust has played a significant system role in shaping the design and development of system plans. This includes the executive team providing system leadership across a number of work streams in addition to the Trust's Medical Director holding a joint post as Medical Director for the STP. The Trust is advancing the system priorities as part of its local transformation plans and is making significant progress in a number of key areas: Prevention : Managing demand that comes into our services has been a key part of the Trust's care model strategy. As a consequence we have invested in a number of interventions and new approaches that are already impacting on the way people use our services. This includes Wellbeing Co-ordinators who assist people to connect with alternatives services, HOPE programmes and Patient Activation Measures that assist in increasing a person's activation and reduce their reliance on healthcare. Integrated Care Model : We have made significant progress in leading a pioneering programme of change over the last three years. The integrated care model has enabled us to increase the number of people being cared for at home by approximately 40%. The enhanced care in the community model brings community health and social care teams together with primary care to avoid admissions to hospital and enable safer and timelier discharges home. We have advanced our Digital Strategy with the introduction of a new single community care record that joins together information within primary care with community teams. This supports our objective that people should only have to tell their story once, as staff can now access joined-up information about a person supporting integrated delivery of care and support. We have also led on the development of our digital offer with the development and use of NHS Quicker 233 alongside the development of a comprehensive health and care video offer to the public. We have brought together local partners and service users to develop a joint plan for how we improve our local offer to people experiencing mental illness in Torbay and South Devon. A group has now been convened to ensure that the actions we have committed too are delivered and that this improves access to physical and mental health services alongside improvements in people's experience of care. A critical part of our future plan as an organisation is that we set ambitious objectives for how acute services will operate differently in the next 5 years. This means working closely with partners across the STP in the development of clinical networks in order to optimise the quality of care to the local population and to develop long term service resilience. Our clinical leaders are already engaged in scoping what the future of our acute services strategy looks like and how this impacts our workforce planning and the development of our estate and technology infrastructure. Our transformation plans, in addition to advancing system priorities are also critical to enabling us to meet our planning milestones for financial savings, workforce resilience and development, activity trajectories and improved quality indicators. These changes are the critical indicators for successful transformation alongside people who use our services telling us that they have received high quality care that is compassionate and available when they need it. Performance in 2018/19 The executive team review each month the integrated performance report that describes progress and operational updates against key performance indicators. This allows the executive team and board to review performance and establish forward actions. Every year the performance report and indicators are reviewed with the Board and key stakeholders to ensure that the report is fit for purpose. NHSI our regulators gain assurance through the \"Single Oversight Framework\" and central returns against the regulatory performance standards. The next table shows perf ormance against the \"Single Oversight Framework\" indicators as reported in Board reports. The summary shows actual performance over previous years and our latest performance to end of January 2019. 234 Indicator/Target Quality Indicator Target/ Standard 18/19 17/18 16/17 Maximum time of 18 weeks from point of referral to treatment (RTT) - incomplete pathways Experience 92% 82% 81.6% 87.2% A&E: maximum waiting time arrival to admission/transfer/discharge Experience 95% 86.3% 89.7% 90.9% Maximum 6 diagnostic procedure Effectiveness <1% 8% 4.2% 1.7% Cancer 62 day wait for first treatment from urgent GP referral for suspected cancer Effectiveness 85% 79.4% 83.1% 88.7% Cancer 62 day wait for first treatment from NHS cancer screening service referral Effectiveness 90% 94.1% 95.9% 94.5% Summary Hospital Venous thromboembolism Safety 95% 91.5% 91.5% 94% With regards to: Referral to Treatment waiting times: As planned we have maintained the % of patients treated within 18 weeks at 82% although this remains below the operational standard of 92%. A+E Maximum waiting time < 4 hours : Our overall performance not met planned trajectory of improvement. Over the c ourse of the year and in preparations for winter we have supported some key service improvement and operational changes. These have focused on: Optimisation of admissions avoidance through use of integrated and enhanced GP support Urgent care GP referred p athways direct to enhanced front door medical teams and acute care model piloted from December 2018 to reduce overcrowding within ED. Patient flow with focus on proactive care and introduction of Red to Green introduced November 2018. System with coordinat ion of complex discharge support through the Discharge hub introduced September 2018. The system has continued to struggle to improve performance and we are in addition now working closely with the Emergency Care improvement team (ECIST). A review of ongo ing plans and recommendation from ECIST will then inform how performance trajectories are met in 2019. 235 Cancer 62 -day treatment from referral : Performance has not met target (85%). In 2018/19 the Trust has made investments into clinical teams to support p athways across Urology and Colorectal teams with this increased capacity to be fully embedded from April 2019. The Trust is therefore now planning to see improvements through 2019 and deliver the expected standard against these targets. Diagnostic waiting times: The standard of 1% is not met. The Trust is working to a local tolerance to achieve 4% of patients waiting over 6 weeks to reflect on -going demand pressures across several diagnostic tests. The operational planning priority for 2019/20 is to remain within the 4% tolerance, whilst business plans to increase capacity are developed. VTE: Based on a rolling average the Trust is underperforming. With the roll out of the Electronic Prescribing Medication Assessment system (EPMA) data capture should impr ove. Local priorities In addition to reporting performance against the statutory indicators for regulatory assessment a range of further indicators are reported to the Board. These have changed slightly from the previous year's account reflecting the priority areas for the integrated care organisation.

The Trust Board will ensure that governance arrangements will continue to provide the oversight and scrutiny against the quality and patient safety outcomes. In the Trust the 2019/20 performance priorities are: Cancer: The national targets for all eight cancer key performance indicators will be met. Recovery trajectories to deliver these standards are confirmed in our operational plan. A&E 4 hour waits: The targets for the year are to achieve and maintain a minimum standard of 90%. RTT: We will ensure the number of people on incomplete pathways does not increase and we will maintain a minimum performance against RTT targets of 82%, whilst also reducing the number of people waiting over 52 weeks to zero. Diagnostics: Plans for 19/20 need to respond to increased demand for diagnostic services. The Trust has several areas that are operating at full capacity and will be reliant on additional outsourcing and mobile solutions to maintain diagnostics waiting times. Our plans will deliver an improvement trajectory to achieve minimum of 96% of patients waiting under 6 weeks for diagnostic tests. Operational delivery Within the Trust we currently implementing our new service delivery structure based on two system teams and 5 localities as follows. Torbay System delivery system comprising of: Torquay Locality Paignton and Brixham locality South Devon delivery system comprising of: Coastal (Teignmouth and Dawlish) Moor to Sea (Ashburton, Bovey Tracey, Totnes and Dartmouth) 237 Newton Abbot In addition to these localities based teams there will central corporate services function and a trust wide operations team. The new system will come into operations from 1st April 2019. Alongside this new operational structure there will be revised arrangement for board oversight and corporate governance. These arrangements will form part of the 19/20 work plan. 238 Annex 1 - Engagement in developing the Quality Account Prior to the publication of the 2018 /19 Quality Account we have shared this document with: Our Trust governors, commissioners, and Board. Healthwatch. Torbay Council Health Scrutiny Board. Devon County Council's Health and Wellbeing Scrutiny Committee. Trust staff. Carers Group. As in previous years, we continue to hold an annual Quality Account engagement event inviting key stakeholders to come together and recommend the priority areas to be included in this year's Quality Account. The feedback from the event continues to be positive with stakeholders feeling engaged in the development of the Quality Account and receiving feedback from the work undertaken in the previous year. In 2019/20 we will continue to share our progress against our Trust improvement priorities and continue to work closely with the users of our services to improve the overall quality of care offered. 239 Statements from Commissioners, Governors, OSCs and Healthwatch Statement from South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group on Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account 2018/19 NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is the lead commissioner for Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust (TSDFT) and is pleased to provide commentary on TSDFT's Quality Account for 2018/19. NHS Devon CCG came into existence on the 1st April 2 019 following the merger of South Devon and Torbay CCG and Northern, Eastern & Western Devon CCG. NHS Devon CCG's role is to quality assure services it commissions, delivered by TSDFT, by attending organisational meetings and boards, and by reviewing performance and quality data, including investigation reports. This continuous process has enabled confirmation that the information presented in this Quality Account appears to be an accurate and fair interpretation regarding the services provided. TSDFT's Quality Account validates the commitment to quality in patient care. The account details achievements and improvement that reflects the positive experience patients describe. TSDFT also continue to demonstrate their open and transparent approach, describi ng areas that require further improvement. For example, further efforts to improve performance where it is below national standards, leading to improved patient care and experience. NHS Devon CCG recognises the quality of work implemented through the TSDF T five priorities. This includes the use of patient experience and feedback and its contribution to improvements within the Emergency Department facility. NHS Devon CCG continues to encourage TSDFT to further develop improvements in processes. This includes the use of technology for early recognition of the deteriorating patient. We have been pleased to support the development of innovative ways to deliver outpatient clinics and support for patients. These include the respiratory service virtual pn eumonia clinics, pain services using online video resources, and the rheumatology department utilising group clinics. As well as offering alternative high quality outpatient care for patients, this work appears to have reduced demand on appointments which is crucial in assisting the system when under pressure. NHS Devon CCG commends the development of the NHS Quicker application, an innovation recognised nationally for improving patient experience and reducing pressure demands within the system. Looking ahead, we are pleased to support the three quality improvement priorities TSDFT has developed, recognising their value in relation to the shared priorities 240 across the STP towards the Devon Integrated Care System (ICS). In-hospital electronic prescribing w ill be a helpful step towards a shared care record accessible to all within Torbay hospital. Further implementation of the community IT integrated clinical system will address the current recognised short falls. Plans to improve the urgent and emergency ca re pathways from the carer's perspective will potentially improve experience for those accessing services at this often difficult time. NHS Devon CCG will support TSDFT to prioritise the improvements developed across the whole Integrated Care System. Thes e include the acceleration of digital opportunities, the development of the national community model for mental health, investment in prevention to impact on demand, implementation of the integrated care model (ICM), and the Devon workforce strategy. TSDFT's Quality Account demonstrates the Trust's ongoing commitment to safe and high quality of care for all. NHS Devon CCG commend this Quality Account and TSDFT for its continued focus on quality of care, patient safety and a positive patient experience. Statement from Governors on Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account 2018/19 The Governor Quality Account statement supports the continued commitment of the Trust in continuing to develop and implement its strategy for health and soci al care. The year has been the most challenging to date, with national performance standards for all areas continuing below those set. This was further compounded by theatre infrastructure failure. Set against an equally challenging financial budget the T rust however has maintained its strategic objectives by focussing on the provision of safe, high -quality and best experience care. This was endorsed by the content of the CQC Well Led Report earlier in the year and the recent unannounced focussed inspecti on of the emergency department Last year's Quality Account listed four priority areas for quality improvement in 2017/18 all of which had been agreed with local stakeholders. Considerable progress has been made in these areas with further work continuing. The Council of Governor's chosen quality audit for 2018 was the review of re - admissions within 28 days. The audit identified that the Trust continues to be in the 241 lower quartile nationally for readmissions. Governor representatives participated in the Qua lity Account Stakeholders meeting for this year and the audit chosen for 2019/20 as recommended by NHSI is Standard Health Mortality Indicator (SHMI). There continues to be strong evidence that the Trust continues to review and participate in national clin ical audit and research. One area of interest is the researchers in residence supported by Plymouth University undertaking a detailed review of the new health care model. The Governor observer role at Trust Committees and at working group level provides the Council of Governors with the opportunity to engage with the safety and quality agenda and in providing assurance on the performance of the Trust against the National Key Performance Indicators. The Council of Governors' Quality and Compliance Committee continues to provide the Council of Governors with evidence that the Trust, through its statutory committees reviews and reports on compliance of CQC Key Lines of Enquiry. Membership of the Quality and Compliance Committee has been enhanced to now include representation from Healthwatch. The Council of Governors is again able to confirm that they continue to receive assurance of the Trust's commitment to the provision of safe high -quality responsive health and social care. We recognise and support the key c hallenges facing the Trust in delivering new models of care within a very tight financial framework and look forward to continuing to be active participants working together in the future. Statement from Devon County Council's Health and Adult Care Scrutiny Committee on Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account 2018/19 Devon County Council's Health and Adult Care Scrutiny Committee has been invited to comment on the Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust's Quality Account for the year 2018/19. All references in this commentary relate to the reporting period of the 1st of April 2018 to the 31st of March 2019 and refer specifically to the Trust's relationship with the Scrutiny Committee. The Scrutiny Committee commends the Tr ust on a comprehensive Quality Account for 2018 -19 and believes that it provides a fair reflection of the services offered by the Trust, based on the Scrutiny Committee's knowledge. 242 In terms of the priorities for 2018 -19 Members appreciate the work undert aken by the Trust in the last year to making outpatient services more patient -centred and resource effective. This has been an issue of importance to Members . The Committee notes that the progress of the Trust in improving outpatient pathways during 2018/1 9 has been positive but recognises that that time is needed to make all the changes required. The Committee appreciates the Trust's first 2018/19 priority, the use of the 2017/18 winter period as a learning experience. Members also fully agree with the Tru st's increased attention on improved sepsis identification and treatment. Members also continue to applaud the Trust's introduction of the NHS quicker app and the delivery of HOPE programmes. The Committee fully supports the Trust's Quality Priorities for Improvement 2019/20 and expects that the Trust will continue to work on improving outpatient pathways. Members also appreciate the Trusts priority to change its inpatient prescribing for people in hospital inpatient beds to its commissioned electronic pres cribing and medicines administration programme by the end of 2019. The Committee also supports the Trust's goal to improve Carers' experience for themselves and their families receiving care across the urgent and emergency care pathway. The aim of the Trust to roll out a community IT integrated clinical system to Coastal and Newton Abbot localities is also strongly supported by members. Members anticipate that regular information on the progress of improving carers' experience of urgent and emergency care will be shared by the Trust. The Committee welcomes a continued pos itive working relationship with the Trust in 2019/20 and beyond to continue to ensure the best possible outcomes for Devon residents. Statement from Healthwatch (Torbay) o n Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account 2018/19 Healthwatch Torbay is the independent local champion for people who use health and social care services within the localities of Brixham, Paignton and Torquay. The Trust values our role as a critical friend, giving the opportunity for our representatives to contribu te to service development by bringing our independent knowledge of local people's experience of their health and care service. This year's Quality Account presents a clear explanation of the initiatives and service re-designs required to address the pressu res in the system. Healthwatch Torbay is 243 able to gain deeper insight by taking part in the stakeholder event. In some instances, the priority decisions have supporting evidence from evaluation reports carried out by our volunteers, who are themselves pat ients and carers. This co - operative way of working is valued by both Healthwatch Torbay and the Trust. The Quality Account shows how the Torbay and South Devon integrated system is addressing change pro -actively. The novel ways of working including NHS Quicker, the Researcher in Residence, the growth of video as a communication and learning tool and the intention to roll out SystmOne where it fits with primary care give positive messages for local people to understand. Torbay has substantial issues of inequality so the priorities for prevention work including its evaluation, new approaches and wellbeing focus are to be welcomed. It is also a positive message to local people that the knowledge and experience of unpaid Carers are recognised and that thei r voice will be listened to and respected. Overall we consider that the Quality Account presents a realistic overview of the Trust's performance and identifies appropriate internal controls and assurances. Statement from Healthwatch (Devon ) on Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account 2018/19 Healthwatch Devon welcomes the opportunity to provide a statement in response to the quality account produced by the Torbay & South Devon NHS Foundation Trust for the year 2018/19. Our statement is based on our knowledge of the Trust and its services, and on the feedback we have received about the quality of the services SD&T provides. Review of quality performance in 2018/19 Patient Safety Priority 1: To understand, learn and act on the experience of our local population using our services during the winter period (December to March) 2017/18. Healthwatch Devon has very little intelligence during this period for Torbay & South Devon NHS Foundation Trust. H owever, Healthwatch Devon is encouraged by the illustrated effectiveness of this priority. Priority 2: To improve the way inpatient sepsis is recorded on the wards to enable improved identification and treatment of ward -based sepsis Such initiatives as this are extremely important in successful patient care, early interventions such as the administration of antibiotics for a prompt sepsis diagnosis not only contributes to the patients wellbeing, but also assists the patients prompt 244 recovery, releasing resource for subsequent patients. This can only aid the reputation of the hospital and its staff which will ultimately reflect in the user sentiment which Healthwatch Devon collates. Clinical effectiveness - Priority 3: To redesign outp atients to make these services more patient centred and use resources effectively Healthwatch Devon are particularly interested in the focus on T&SD's commitment to improving the outpatient services as these services has been recognised as a key priority by the head of the NHS, however evidence collected by Healthwatch Devon shows that negative comments around the theme of access to hospital services has increased last year compared with 2017 -18 which would suggest there is still some way to go before this is fully effective. Patient Experience - Priority 4: NHS Quicker From the aspect of service delivery this innovation is of particular interest to Healthwatch Devon as such there is a link on our website. https://healthwatchdevon.co.uk/nhsquicker -app-helps -spend -less-time-waiting - treatment -minor -injury -illness/ To be able to view wait and travel times to the appropriate unit provi ding the care you think you may need can only aid the publics access to healthcare across Torbay and South Devon. Healthwatch Devon is encouraged that the populations served by other Healthwatch organisations will also soon be benefitting from this technology. Priority 5 Wellbeing and supported self -management: HOPE programme Programmes that allow for the population to live more independently in terms of managing their own health through educati on have an important place in today's health care systems. The feedback that has been received would suggest that there is a great benefit to this programme. Healthwatch Devon welcomes the Trust's plans for this programme during 2019/20. Priorities for 2018/19 Healthwatch Devon are looking forward to the service improvements that next year's priorities can provide; 245 Patient Safety Priority 1 Electronic prescribing. To change the current inpatient prescribing for people in hospital inp atient beds to the commissioned electronic prescribing. Priority 2 The roll out of a community IT integrated clinical system to the Coastal and Newton Abbot localities. Patient Experience Priority 3 To improve the Carers' experience for themselves and t heir families receiving care across the urgent and emergency care pathway. Healthwatch Devon notes that there are only three priorities for the coming year, however, also recognises that there is better opportunity to perform well on these three whilst maintaining any on -going initiatives from last year's priorities.
