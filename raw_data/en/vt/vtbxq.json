I would like to touch on a few ways you can help your body fight the never ending viral battle. Our bodies are much like a complex recipe. Skipping or shorting just one ingredient can dramatically alter the outcome. Your body is no different. If we are low or lacking a specific \"ingredient\", we are not allowing it to be its best. Helping the body fend off viral or bacteraial invasions requires optimal fuel and training. I would like to suggest a few ways to help you combat the onslaught of viral invaders. Food/Diet What you put in your body is essentially what you get out. Make sure you are refraining from too much of the processed foods and get back to raw fruits and vegetables. A healthy diet is a great way to build up your immune system. Water Believe it or not, [water is an excellent way to maintain and boost your immune system](https://www.tyentusa.com/blog/immune-system-drinking-water/)! The proper amount of water will help prevent bacteria and viruses from congregating in your sinus, nose, or mouth. Exercise Exercise is one of those things that you can sometimes have \"too much of a good thing\". Good, intense exercise is a great way to keep the body and the immune system strong. But, too much exercise when you are sick or feeling run down will actually weaken your immune system. Sleep This is an important one. If your body is [sleep deprived](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/expert-answers/lack-of-sleep/faq-20057757), it becomes weaker and will make you susceptible to illness. Try to not be exposed to light from a TV, phone, or computer during rest periods. Also, most studies have shown we need between 7 and 9 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Vitamins/Supplements These are just a few tips that can help you stay strong and healthy during stressful periods. If I can be of any help please let me know. There are at least 3 major vitamins you will want to make sure you are getting enough of. Vitamins C, B6, and E have all been proven to [boost immune function](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/eat-these-foods-to-boost-your-immune-system/). I also suggest you consider vitamin D and Zinc.
