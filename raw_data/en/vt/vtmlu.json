The nimh funding provides ve years of support to hiv/ aids prevention and health services at the school's Center for Interdis-ciplinary Research on aids (cira ). The grant from nichd adds to a $15 million grant from the same agency in 2007 to support Yale's role in a na-tional study that will follow 100,000 children from before birth to age 21 to understand factors that contribute to their health and development.

Spinelli, m.d. , and Yale began in 1937, when he was a mere 16-year-old from Stratford, Conn., starting his freshman year of col-lege. This early acquaintance blos-somed through his years in medical school\u2014also at Yale\u2014in his career as an internist and educator, in his role as a leader of alumni, and, in his later years, in philanthropy. Ultimately it was a love affair. Those who knew him well all say the same thing: No one loved Yale School of Medicine more than Nick Spinelli. That love was expressed in many ways, most recently with a $4.5 million bequest that will support both a professorship in neurology and a scholarship fund for medical students. Spinelli, who died in Novem- ber 2007 at the age of 86, endowed the faculty position in the name of Harry M. Zimmerman, m.d. , a notable neuropathologist during A bequest made in captivitybrings $4 million for work on pregnancy, childbirth The School of Medicine sees its share of charitable contributions, but this year, the school is the recipient of a most unusual gift. While interned in a Japanese prison camp during World War II, Albert S. McKern, m.d. , who had earned his master's degree in engineering at Yale 30 years earlier, willed a portion of his estate to the medical school by writing his bequest on a piece of paper. McKern died shortly thereafter. A gift of roughly $12 million will be split evenly among three univer-sities McKern attended: the University of Sydney, where he studied theology; Yale; and the University of Edinburgh, where he earned a medical degree. As per McKern's will, the money will be used to fund research and scholarship centered on reducing pain experienced during pregnancy and childbirth. Born in 1885 in Australia, McKern came to Yale in September 1911, after deciding that theology was not for him because of his lack of skill as a public speaker. After earning his master's at Yale and his medical de-gree at Edinburgh in 1917, he moved to Penang, Malaysia, where he prac-ticed as a physician and surgeon. In Penang, says McKern's grand- son Bill, \"he built up both a success-ful medical practice and real estate holdings, mainly vacant beachfront lots of about three to ve acres each. One was developed into his own house. He also bought a portfolio in the middle of Georgetown, the capi-tal, where the big shopping center is.\" McKern's good fortune was cut short. With the arrival of World War II, Japan invaded Malaysia and on Dec. 8, 1941, began bombing the island of Penang.

Houck Associate Vice President for Development and Director of Medical Development (203) 436-8560 Mary Hu Director of Institutional Planning and Communications Michael Fitzsousa Director of CommunicationsFor a doctor who found his calling as a resident,geriatrics never grows old As a young intern at Boston City Hospital (now part of Boston Medical Center) in the early 1970s, Leo M. Cooney, m.d. , experienced the standard of medical care for elderly patients firsthand, and he describes his impressions from those days in a characteristically unvarnished fashion. \"The thing that struck me was that we did a terrible job caring for older people,\" says Cooney, now the Humana Foundation Professor of Medicine at Yale. \"During my intern-ship and residency I was lectured daily about very exotic diseases. Nobody talked about bedsores and dementia and delirium and osteoporosis and all the things we saw every day.\" But one bright spot was a program at Boston City in which a team of nurses made follow-up visits to nursing home residents who had been treated at the hos-pital's clinic to ensure that the pro-grams and therapies doctors were trying to implement were carried out. \"I was fascinated by that, and I went out eight or 10 times with the nurses to those nursing homes,\" says Cooney, who cites the program as instrumental in his decision to pursue geriatrics. After a fellowship in rheumatol- ogy at Boston University Medical Center, Cooney, a member of the School of Medicine's Class of 1969, was encouraged to come back to Yale by his medical school mentor Robert H. Gifford, m.d. , professor emeritus of medicine, a rheumatolo-gist who was then section chief of general internal medicine. Cooney's charge was to build a program in geriatrics on the firm foundation of the Continuing Care Unit ( ccu ), founded in 1968 on the eighth floor of Yale-New Haven Hos-pital to provide comprehensive care for acutely ill elderly patients. The first job on Cooney's plate was convincing skeptical medical residents that a clinical rotation in the ccu , established by Samuel O. Thier, m.d. (then chair of the Depart- ment of Internal Medicine, now professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School), could be both educa-tional and enjoyable. \"My third day here, the chief resi-dents were trying to 'sabotage' Sam's efforts by combin-ing the rotation with the coronary care unit,\" Cooney recalls. But Cooney turned the situation around, saying with some pride that \"three years later, I got the house staff's teacher-of-the-year award.\" In his teaching, Cooney stresses what he and his colleagues in Yale's top-rated geriatric clinical research programs consider the three most basic objectives of geriatric medicine: clarifying patients' and families' goals of care; sustaining patients' highest levels of physical and cognitive functioning; and safe-guarding patients' independence and autonomy. Goals of care are a highly per- sonal matter, says Cooney, particu-larly in older patients who may take several medications for their many chronic diseases: \"Is your highest priority your comfort, or being in your own home, or maintaining as much cognitive function as you can\u2014or is your highest priority how long you live?\" So-called \"disease management algorithms\" fall short in this population, he says. \"I'm not going to treat your multiple diseases by an algorithm. I'm going to look at you, and say 'OK, let's talk about what you're interested in.' \" Cooney says that working in geriatrics is \"the most gratifying thing I do,\" but he worries that today's best medical students are not specializing in geriatrics, even as those 85 and older have become the fastest-growing segment of our population. The only solution, he says, is a \"good sell\" of the field's rewards, and \"the best way to sell is to have very good people do very good work.\" Cooney, who turns 65 in Novem- ber, has no plans to retire anytime soon. A bred-in-the-bone baseball fan, he says with a laugh, \"I watch the student evaluations very closely. When they start to say, 'He can talk about the Red Sox, but he doesn't seem to know what's wrong with the patient,' I'm outta here!\" Lifelines LeoCooneyAdding life to \u0003 Printed on recycled paperExpert on race's role in care wins fellowship Marcella Nunez-Smith, m.d. , m.h.s. , assistant professor of medicine, has received the 2008 Herbert W.

Women's health advocate honored for distinguished leadership Carolyn Mazure Online: Yale Netcast \"Women's 2008 3Advances Health and science news from Yale Blood vessel gene affects brain region Vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ), which promotes blood vessel growth, has been a favorite target for scientists seeking to starve cancerous tumors of their blood supply or to help repair damaged hearts. Recent research has indicated that this growth factor may also be crucial for the development and repair of the hippocampus, an area of the brain where memory is consolidated and which has been implicated in depression, schizo-phrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Now a new study, published online in August in the journal Biological Psychiatry , provides additional evidence linking vegf to mental health. School of Medicine research- ers have found that a variant of the vegf gene is associated with a reduction in the size of the hip-pocampus. This reduction in hip-pocampal volume suggests a pos-sible cause of cognitive problems reported by some patients using anti- vegf therapies for cancer and other diseases. \"As we identify these genes, we can develop new and more effective treatments that could target the related, specific molec-ular mechanisms,\" says Hilary Blumberg, m.d. , associate profes- sor of psychiatry and diagnostic radiology and lead author of the new study.Bench-to-bedside approach yields important insights into a common disorder It all started with a mouse, says Jack A. Elias, m.d. , chair of the Department of Internal Medicine and an expert on lung diseases. A few years ago, Elias, the Waldemar Von Zedtwitz Profes-sor of Medicine, discovered that mice he had engineered to develop asthma had high levels of a very unusual en-zyme. The enzyme, chitinase, is more commonly found in plants and lower organisms, where it breaks down chitin (pronounced \"ky-tin\"), an abundant and sturdy sugar polymer that gives insect and crustacean shells their resilience and strength. In humans, chitinases are thought to provide a rst line of defense against fungi and some parasitic worms that also bear outer coats containing chitin. That result was intriguing, because environmental exposure to indoor pollutants such as fungi and dust mites has been blamed for the growing inci-dence of asthma over the last decades. Translating the chitinase nding quickly from mice into humans, Elias and Geoffrey L. Chupp, m.d. , associate professor of medicine and director of the Yale Center for Asthma and Airway Disease ( ycaad ) soon discovered that people with severe asthma have high levels of a chitinase-related protein, ykl-40, in their blood. Then, they found that ykl-40 plays a central role in regulating the immune response and driving the lung infl ammation that is at the root of asthma. The work could lead to new methods for diagnosing and treating asthma, a disease that af-fects an estimated 20 million Ameri-cans, including 9 million children. In the mouse experiments, ykl-40 was not the original protein of interest for Elias. It is not a true chitinase; ykl-40 can bind to chitin, but it lacks the enzymatic activity required to break down the tough polymer. However, as reported in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2007, ykl-40 was known to circulate in the blood, and it could be measured with a simple test. \"We saw this chitinase relative and thought 'the cousin may actually be prettier than the girl we' d been dating,' \" Elias said, describing the investigators' early at-traction to ykl-40 as a potential blood marker of asthma. Enter Chupp, a skilled researcher whom Elias had recruited to Yale in 1997. Chupp had taken on the chal-lenge of building up a clinical research program on lung diseases to parallel the basic research effort Elias had orga-nized at the medical school. The result was ycaad , an active clinic that draws referrals from all over Connecticut and surrounding states. Besides receiving the best available treatment, Chupp says, all the pa-tients at ycaad get the opportunity to contribute to research. So far, he has enrolled more than 500 subjects into a well-characterized cohort of asthma sufferers, many of whom have a severe form of the disease. Because of the presence of ycaad , when ykl-40 popped up in the mouse studies, Chupp had everything ready to go to apply the ndings to human disease. After measuring ykl-40 levels in blood samples from 200 patients, the researchers found that the protein was elevated in people with asthma, and its levels were highest in those with severe disease. The same held true in two other patient groups they tested, from Wisconsin and Paris. Levels of ykl-40 in the blood and lungs of these patients correlated with the use of medication to control asthma, with how often people were hospitalized and with the appearance of irreversible lung damage. For the rst time, the severity of airway scarring could be measured by looking at a blood sample. The next question was whether high levels of ykl-40 caused asthma symptoms or merely signaled the damage wrought by the disease. To nd out, Chupp looked for differences in the genetic makeup of people with high or low ykl-40 . The results, re- ported earlier this year, also in The New England Journal of Medicine , show that people who have a particular version of the ykl-40 gene tend to have a higher blood level of ykl-40 , and along with that, a greater risk of getting asthma. Those results were suggestive, but still did not prove that ykl-40 caused any of the pathological changes of asthma. To settle that question, Elias and Chupp went back to mice, geneti-cally engineering them to have either none of the mouse equivalent of ykl- 40, or too much. The result, they say, Asthma: from mouse to man and back again was clear. Animals lacking the protein were resistant to developing the type of infl ammation that causes asthma, while animals with extra protein had an overactive immune response and more severe disease. Further work revealed that ykl-40 is part a novel regulatory pathway governing the level of infl ammation in asthma and in other conditions. The protein works by slowing the rate at which activated immune cells die off. \"We believe ykl-40 is a kind of a rheostat that sets the level of infl am-mation,\" Elias explains. \"If you're a normal healthy person with a normal to low level of the stuff, when you have infl ammation, it clears normally, but if you're a person with high levels of ykl- 40, you end up with a more robust and chronic response and the consequences are therefore worse.\" The latest ndings suggest that not only is the protein a potential disease reporter, but also a likely target for new therapies. The ykl-40 story is a perfect model of how the interplay of animal and human research can speed basic discoveries to the clinic, Elias says. The work proceeded so rapidly because Yale's group of asthma experts functions as an integrated unit. \"We have master clinicians on one side and master scientists on the other side and the two constantly interact with each other,\" he explains. \"We believe that you have to bounce back and forth to move things forward.\" terry dagradi Congress helps donors make gifts to support Yale School of Medicine Congress has passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which makes it easier for owners of individual retirement accounts ( iras) who have reached the age of 70 or older to make qualified charitable distri-butions directly from their ira to charities such as Yale School of Medicine.

Yale professional schools and Yale-New Haven Hospital ( ynhh ) religious ministries have joined forces with the School of Medicine to intro-duce a \"blended learning\" curriculum that addresses the physical, emotion-al, cultural and spiritual issues that arise at the end of life. With funding from the Connecticut Cancer Partner-ship and the state's Department of Public Health, the medical school has collaborated with the Yale School of Nursing, the Yale Divinity School, the Yale University Chaplain's Of ce and the palliative care services of ynhh to develop an interdisciplinary program that will focus on symptom manage-ment, culture and spirituality and the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach to patient care at the end of life. \"The primary goal of palliative care is to prevent and relieve the burdens imposed by diseases and their treatments,\" says Matthew S. Ellman, m.d. , assistant professor of medicine and director of end-of-life care skills education at the School of Medicine. \"The focus is not just the disease; rather, palliative care focuses on alleviating symptoms, whether physical, emotional or spiritual, to improve quality of life in persons with advanced illness. Without the spiritual component, this care is not complete for some patients.\" The curriculum will be required for medical students, and nursing and divinity students are being urged to participate as well. Blended learning will be accomplished by combining learning vehicles, such as web-based courses and traditional face-to-face classroom activities. Students will work through online interactive cases. They will then participate in workshops, moderated by faculty from each school, in which they will share their ideas and experiences with other students to appreciate the value of interdisciplinary teamwork in the care of patients. Through the com-bined resources, students will learn to recognize spiritual distress in patients, and how to conduct an empathetic, re-spectful, open-ended dialogue to help reveal the patient's concerns, as well as other interventions to provide support and encouragement. Participating students also will be encouraged to consider how their own spiritual and cultural beliefs might affect the way they relate to and provide care for patients at the end of life. Once the program is fully estab- lished, the curriculum will be made available to other Connecticut institu-tions for use in palliative care educa-tion.

At about 8:15, as she swam in the school's pool, Munnelly became weak on her right side and unable to speak. Lifeguards pulled her out, and emer-gency personnel based at a re station across the street arrived within ve minutes. She reached New London's Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in just 15 minutes. That's when Munnelly, 67, became the rst patient to bene t from the Yale-New Haven TeleStroke Net-work, a program modeled on a similar initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The new network allows area hospitals to call upon Yale neurologists' expertise in assessing stroke victims using Internet-based videoconferencing and image-sharing technology. Neurologist Joseph Schindler, m.d. , evaluated Munnelly via computer from Yale-New Haven Hospital ( ynhh ), then gave the green light to physicians in New London to use the clot-busting drug tissue plas-minogen activator (tPA). Munnelly received the drug only 37 minutes after reaching the hospital\u2014much more quickly than if she had been transported to ynhh rst. Speed and decisiveness are critically important in treating stroke victims. Most blood clots that cause ischemic strokes can be dissolved by tPA, but this medication can also cause bleeding in the brain, a risk that signi cantly increases three hours after the patient's rst symptoms. To meet that three-hour deadline and try to prevent this complication, doc-tors must ensure that a patient is an appropriate candidate for tPA. Yet in Patients who chronically suffer from such common digestive problems as heartburn, bloating or trouble swal-lowing often try unsuccessfully to manage the symptoms on their own. When, in frustration, they seek the help of a physician, the outcome can be equally disappointing, because these disorders are notoriously dif- cult to diagnose. Yale Medical Group's new Gas- trointestinal Motility Program, in collaboration with Yale-New Haven Hospital, hopes to change that. The multidisciplinary program, one of the rst of its kind in Connecticut, brings together a team of eight gastroen-terologists, surgeons, pathologists and radiologists to provide the latest diagnostic and treatment services to patients with hard-to-diagnose gastrointestinal disorders. The program provides evaluation for a wide array of common and rare most hospitals, neurologists are not always available to assist emergency physicians with the evaluation and treatment decision. As a result, many patients who might bene t from tPA do not receive it. Schindler says the process of eval- uating a stroke patient via TeleStroke is the same as when he sees a patient in ynhh 's emergency department. \"It's no different; it's just the use of technology to do it remotely,\" he says. While seated at a computer 50 miles away from the patient, Schin-dler, the clinical director of the Yale-New Haven Stroke Center ( ynhsc ), used the center's high-speed Internet connection to speak with the patient, family and clinical staff and to review Munnelly's medical history, blood tests and brain scan. He also exam-ined her using a camera with a zoom feature. She was, he determined, a good candidate to receive tPA, and shortly after receiving the drug, Mun-nelly regained the use of her right leg as well as some ability to speak. Schindler, who is optimistic that Munnelly's condition will continue to improve, was pleased not only that the technology worked but also that he and the team in New London could act so quickly. \"We've done it at gastrointestinal constipation. Anish Sheth, m.d. , the program's director and an assistant professor of medicine at Yale, says the program, launched in July, was created in response to patient need. \"We're see-ing increasing numbers of patients with motility disorders\u2014refl ux-related diseases, problems swallow-ing and constipation,\" he says. \"But there really wasn't either the exper-tise or the focus to offer a program to help these patients.\" Many gastrointestinal symptoms are caused by the way the intestine's muscles and nerves work together to move food down the GI tract. These Yale when the entire team was already in the Emergency Department; we assessed and treated the patient in a similar time. But to have that done remotely, it's wonderful.\" Lawrence and Memorial is Con- necticut's rst hospital to link up to the ynhsc via the TeleStroke network.

The problem, according to Sheth, is that while endoscopies provide a good visual picture of the GI tract, they often are ineffective in diagnosing motility disorders, which are caused by weak or uncoordinated intestinal function. \"The intestines are essen-tially nerve and muscle,\" Sheth says.

School of Medicine research- ers led by Peter M. Glazer, m.d., ph.d., chair and Robert E. Hunter Professor of Therapeutic Radiology and professor of genetics, have found a new method to create lasting genetic changes within human blood cells, opening up the possibility of new treatments for inherited hematologic diseases. In the September 9 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers report that they used electroporation\u2014in which an electrical field makes cell membranes more permeable\u2014to insert genetic \"repair kits\" consisting of chemically altered dna into cells to repair the mutated gene in thal-assemia. The faulty gene was fixed, even in human bone marrow cells, meaning that the genetic repair could be inherited by newly gener-ated blood cells. The new technique avoids traditional gene-therapy pitfalls, Glazer says, because it employs synthetic dna that is easier to insert into cells and does not require viruses for its delivery.

A team led by James P . Noonan, ph.d., assistant profes- sor of genetics, has now found that changes in a mere 13 genetic \"letters\" in one such sequence may have unleashed the momen-tous evolutionary changes that enable humans to manipulate tools and walk upright. As reported in the September 5 issue of Science , the human version of the sequence strongly activates a reporter gene in the developing limbs of embry-onic mice, but nearly identical sequences from ape and monkey genomes do not, suggesting that the 13 differences in the human form helped drive the emergence of the human hand and foot. \"The long-term goal is to find many sequences like this and use the mouse to model their effects on the evolution of human devel-opment,\" says Noonan. corbiscyan mag yelo black MACIn 1947, states- man W. Averell Harriman of the Yale Col-lege Class of 1913 wrote to Albert McKern requesting help in rebuilding the war-torn Chang-sha campus of the Yale-in-China Association. Harriman's letter brought this som-ber reply from McKern's estate. 6 www.medicineatyale.orgMcKern from page 1 fl ed for Singa-pore aboard the SS Mata Hari, but the ship was captured in In-donesia. McKern spent the next three years as a prisoner of war. Only two months before the war's end, he died of dysentery in an internment camp in Sumatra. In his will, which he composed with the help of lawyers held along with him in internment, McKern wrote, \"I hereby direct that none of my land or house property be sold until the time speci ed hereunder in this will.\" He stated that his vacant land was to be developed and that other property in Penang was to be renovated and rented out, with the income earned to go mainly to his family. Ten years after the death of his last child, he stipulated, the fam-ily's holdings were to be sold and the money divided three ways between the three universities. The money was to be used \"for the sole and special purpose of estab-lishing medical research scholarships for investigation into the causes, prevention and treatment of men-tal and physical pain and distress during pregnancy, labour and the puerperium [the period following childbirth].\" Yale's portion of the gift will endow annual grants that will be awarded to those doing the most promising research on these issues. Charles J. Lockwood, m.d. , chair and Anita O'Keefe Young Profes-sor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, rst learned about the gift several years ago at a meeting with Andrew A. Calder, m.d. , head of the Division of Repro- ductive and Developmental Sciences at Edinburgh. Lockwood's initial reaction was disbelief. \"He'd had a few drinks and I'd thought he was exaggerating,\" Lockwood recalls. Spinelli also kept close track of faculty research, and made a special point to support the work on spinal cord injury by Stephen G. Waxman, m.d. , ph.d. , chair and Bridget Marie Flaherty Professor of Neurology. Spinelli's father, Domenick, was paralyzed after falling from a wall behind the family's home in Devon, a section of Milford, Conn. A room at the Center for Neuroscience and Regeneration Research, which Wax-man directs at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System in West Haven, was dedicated in Spinelli's honor in 2000. That same year, the medical school named its alumni of ce the Spinelli Of ce of Alumni Affairs. Spinelli was the recipient of numerous awards, including the Yale Medal, the university's highest honor. He received the Distinguished Alumni Service Award and the Peter Parker Medal from the School of Medicine. But no award could match the satisfaction Spinelli received from his interactions with students and resi-dents, says Viola Spinelli, who is pro-viding scholarships for Yale students at the School of Public Health through the Domenick and Gertude Spinelli Fund. \"In good Italian fashion, he'd say, 'You've got to feed them,' and he'd take them through the kitchen to the back room at Leon's [a restaurant then located in the Hill neighborhood adjacent to the medical school cam-pus]. There would be 25 students and house of cers of all nationalities. That created a spirit and an environment where they learned what the practice of medicine was all about.\"Grants from page 1 Eventually Calder invited Lockwood to Edinburgh to serve for a week as the Honeyman Gillespie Visit-ing Professor, and the two began a discussion of joint work that could be done to ful ll McKern's dream. In Edinburgh, Lockwood had the opportunity to meet with a number of preeminent Ob/Gyn researchers, including Hilary Critchley, m.d. , professor of reproductive medicine, and Jane E. Norman, m.d., honorary senior research fellow at the Univer-sity of Glasgow and frequent collabo-rator with Calder. \"I had a chance to review some of their research. They have a very strong program,\" he says, noting work in the areas of prematu-rity and preeclampsia in particular. \"There are a lot of parallels between Edinburgh's department and Yale's. It was really a very exciting visit.\" Lockwood will be devising a joint strategy for using the McKern funds during the 2008-2009 academic year. Given McKern's desire and the needs of the Ob/Gyn eld, he sees re-search on premature birth as a likely area of focus. \"Prematurity is the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, the leading cause of mental retardation, the leading cause of childhood blindness. It costs the U.S. economy around $28 billion a year in terms of health care-related resources. Preterm delivery is a na-tional public health crisis.\" Funds may also support a Yale- Sydney-Edinburgh scholar exchange program and, through the Depart-ment of Psychiatry, research on postpartum depression.of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, designed to seek information that can help prevent and treat some of the nation's most pressing health problems, including autism, birth defects, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Under the direction of princi-pal investigators Michael B. Bracken, ph.d., m.p.h. , the Susan Dwight Professor of Epidemiology, and Kath-leen Belanger, ph.d. , research scientist in epidemiology, the Yale Center for Perinatal, Pediatric and Environmen-tal Epidemiology is participating in the study in collaboration with the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences and the Department of Pediatrics.

Spinelli, like the rest of his class of 48 students, was inducted into the Army, continuing his studies and drilling on the New Haven Green as part of Yale's Com-pany C. Upon graduation in 1944, he shipped out to Germany, where he served as an Army physician until his return to Connecticut. After practicing medicine for the next decade in Stratford, Spinelli was forced in 1968 by a heart condition to give up the life of a practicing internist. He was able to continue working, however, and served as director of medical education at Bridgeport Hospital, developing nearly all the hospital's residency programs. His health improved after a bypass operation and he remained at Bridgeport until his retirement at age 65. Then he took on a new job as alumni director at the School of Medicine from 1985 to 1990. Spinelli forged a strong bond to the School of Medicine for many of the medical students and alumni with whom he came in contact during those years. According to Sharon McManus of the medical school's Of ce of De-velopment, who was among Spinelli's successors as alumni director, each year he would take the entire rst-year class out to dinner at the venerable Yale landmark Mory's in groups of 10. Viola Spinelli recalls, \"This was a period when a lot of foreign students began to come to Yale. He made all of them his kids.\" McManus agrees: \"He saw the diversity of the classes as the smorgasbord of life,\" she says. \"He'd say, 'Isn't it great that someone is go-ing to go back to India and practice medicine in the streets of Calcutta with a Yale education?'\"Spinelli from page 1for Disease Control and Prevention that revealed higher estimates of new hiv infections in the United States than previously calculated, and that emphasized the need for more rigor-ous study of interventions for hiv prevention domestically and abroad. The new round of nimh funding will allow the center to broaden its scope beyond prevention to include research in the realm of clinical health services. Research at cira also will increasingly refl ect the globalization of the hiv/aids pandemic while allow- ing the center to maintain its local and Connecticut-based collaborations. \"We are very excited about the new award, because it will allow us to build on cira 's historic strengths and forge new programs that are responsive to changes in both the pandemic and the scienti c community,\" says Paul Cleary, ph.d. , director and principal investigator for cira and ysph dean.

The Bravo pH monitoring system, a catheter-free instrument that mea-sures acidity levels in patients suspect-ed of having gastroesophageal refl ux disease ( gerd ), is a small capsule attached to the wall of the esophagus. It transmits data to a pager-sized receiver, which is worn by the patient for 48 hours. During the test, the patient pushes a button whenever he or she experiences symptoms, so doc-tors can see if the symptoms correlate with episodes of acid refl ux. When the test is over, data from the receiver is downloaded to pH analysis software, where it is analyzed. The SmartPill capsule, a new technology available at only about a dozen medical centers around the country, is an ingestible device that measures pressure, pH and tempera-ture as it moves through the GI tract, allowing physicians to identify where abnormalities in intestinal transit are located. The SmartPill transmits information to a data receiver worn by the patient. After the capsule has passed from the body, the patient returns the receiver to the physician, who is able to display and analyze the data within minutes. Impedance monitoring is a cathe- ter-based system that enables doctors to diagnose non-acid in which bile or other digestive fl uids other than stomach acid enter the esophagus. The patient wears the monitoring system for 24 hours, and pushes a button whenever he or she experiences symp-toms. Physicians then download and analyze the data to determine whether the refl ux is acidic or non-acidic and whether the symptoms correlate with incidents of refl ux. Other motility tests offered by the program include high-resolution esophageal manometry for evaluation of swallowing dif culty; anorectal manometry with biofeedback for the evaluation and treatment of constipation and fecal incontinence; and hydrogen breath testing for the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth. Because of these and other new tools, advances in the diagnosis of GI disorders have outpaced treatment, Sheth says. \"We're able to diagnose and explain things much better than we were 10 years ago, but treatment needs to catch up.\" He's hoping Yale's Gastrointestinal Motility Program will become a center for cutting-edge re-search and testing. \"We have a couple of protocols ongoing and I anticipate this center becoming a leader in clini-cal trials for motility disorders.\" The motility program treats adult patients, and collaborates with spe-cialists from pediatrics when neces-sary. Given how many people suffer from gastrointestinal disorders, Sheth predicts a sharp jump in referrals once community physicians become aware of the program's existence. \"It's an exciting area of research and clinical care,\" he says.\" It's an area where technology is advancing and where there's long been a need.\" With support from the National Institutes of Health, electron micros-copist Vinzenz Unger, associate professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry, is determining the structure of biologically important molecules.

Zigler received his ph.d. in clinical psychology from the University of Texas at Austin in 1958. He joined the psychology department at Yale in 1959 and also served on the faculty of the csc at the medical school. He founded and is director emeritus of the csc's Edward Zigler Center in Child Devel-opment and Social Policy (formerly the Bush Center), one of the rst sites in Edward F. Zigler, ph.d. , Sterling Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Yale, is the 2008 recipient of the Award for Outstanding Lifetime Contribu-tion to Psychology, the highest honor bestowed by the American Psychologi-cal Association ( apa). Zigler received the award in August during the apa's annual convention in Boston. \"There are very few psychologists whose work has made such a differ-ence as his,\" said apa President Alan E. Kazdin, ph.d ., the John M. Musser Professor of Psychology and professor of child psychiatry in the School of Medicine's Child Study Center ( csc). Zigler was one of the principal archi- tects of the federal Head Start program, founded in 1965. Administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children & Families, Head Start promotes school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children from low-income families through the provi-sion of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services.More recently, Zigler founded the School of the 21st Century (21C) initiative, a community school model that operates in conjunction with state governments and private foundations to incorporate childcare and family support services into schools. Schools that take part in the initiative offer guidance and support for parents; all-day, year-round preschool; before- and after-school and vacation care for school-age children; health education Head Start founder is honored for his lifetime of leadership terry dagradi Erik M. Shapiro, ph.d. , assistant professor of diagnostic radiology and biomedical engineering at the School of Medicine, has been awarded a $1.5 million New Innovator Award by the National Institutes of Health ( nih). Shapiro, who arrived at Yale in 2006 and directs the Molecular and Cellular Magnetic Resonance Imag-ing Laboratory in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology, is developing new ways to enhance cellular and molecular magnetic resonance imaging (mri) technology to allow scientists to observe, measure and even manipulate cell migration in living tissue. \"Erik is an internationally respected researcher, and as evidenced by this award, is doing some of the most excit-ing and innovating research in mri today,\" says R. Todd Constable, ph.d. , professor of diagnostic radiology, neu-rosurgery and biomedical engineering, and a colleague and mentor of Shapiro. Grappling with the cellular dam- age or cell death caused by brain diseases and injury, including stroke, is one of Shapiro's interests. There has been great interest in us- ing stem cells to repair damaged brain regions, but creating a reliable and effective source of human embryonic stem cells, the most clinically promis-ing type, has been politically charged and scienti cally challenging. In recent years, scientists have discov-ered \"stem cell niches\"\u2014microenvi-ronments in the adult body in which dormant stem cells can be activated in response to tissue injury\u2014and Shapiro envisions steering large numbers of these quiescent stem cells to speci c locations in the body to repair dam-aged tissue. Using mri technology in vivo on single cells in intact animals, Shapiro is studying the infl uence of nano- and micro-particles, whose mri properties can be engineered to be sensitive to various stimuli, on the number, direction and destina-tion of migrating cells. Scientist lauded for studies of dormant stem cells as therapy Roslyn Milstein Meyer, ph.d. , a clinical psychologist and assistant clinical professor in psychia- try at the School of Medicine, is one of ve recipients of the 2008 Yale Medal, awarded by the Association of Yale Alumni ( aya). A 1971 graduate of Yale College who received her doctorate in clinical psychology in 1977 from Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Meyer is well known in the NewHaven area for her leadership of a wide array of programs and a long-standing commitment to Yale and the university's environs.Most recently, Meyer has support- ed research and treatment programs at Yale for melanoma, one of the most aggressive forms of cancer. With a gift of $10 million to the school last spring, she and husband Jerome H. Meyer, m.d. , lecturer in psychiatry, are helping to establish the Milstein Meyer Center for Melanoma Research and Treatment, which will enable the development of more investigator-initiated clinical trials and improve Yale's ability to design new treatments for the often-fatal illness. The Meyers' gift builds on the medical school's strengths: Yale's immunobiology research and derma-tology programs are widely viewed as among the very best in the nation, and the last three years have seen the development of a strong program in medical oncology that has attracted nearly a dozen new faculty members with expertise in all the major cancers. Known to friends and colleagues as \"Roz,\" Meyer is a trustee of Yale-New Haven Hospital, a pa-tient advocate for Yale's nih-funded Specialized Program of Research Excellence ( spore ) in Skin Cancer and a co-founder of both New Haven's International Festival of Arts and Ideas and the Leadership, Education, and Athletics in Partnership ( leap ) program. She has served as a member of the Volunteer Council for Women's Health Research at Yale, as a board member of the Yale University Art Gallery and as a trustee for Yale'sJoseph Slifka Center for Jewish Life. Inaugurated in 1952, the Yale Medal is the highest award pre-sented by the aya and is conferred to recognize and honor outstanding individual service to the university. Since its inception, the Yale Medal has been presented to 267 individuals who exemplify the university's ideals and who have given outstanding service to Yale as a whole or to one of its many schools, institutes or programs. Other recipients of the Yale Medal this year are Edward A. Dennis '63; Linda Koch Lorimer, j.d. '77, vice president and secretary of Yale; Don T. Nakanishi '71; and William H. Wright II '82. Roslyn Milstein MeyerEdward Zigler has been a major gure in educational policy for more than 40 years.the nation to combine training in de-velopmental science and social policy. During his 50-year career, Zigler helped to plan several other national projects and policies, including Early Head Start and the Family and Medi-cal Leave Act. In the early 1970s he served as the founding director of the U.S. Of ce of Child Development (now the Administration on Children, Youth and Families) and chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau. Zigler is the author, co-author or editor of over 800 scholarly publica-tions and more than 38 books. He is a member of the Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has received many honorary degrees. Zigler remains as active as ever in his scholarly and social policy endeav-ors. He regularly consults with state governors and legislatures on child development issues and he is actively lobbying the 2008 presidential candi-dates to include universal child care in their platforms. \"Our hypoth- esis is that increas-ing the number of neuroprogenitor cells that migrate to a stroke site will increase the ability of that stroke site to restructure itself, to heal.\" Shapiro says. \"It could lead to a new type of stem cell therapy. Instead of delivering stem cells from another source, we'll manipulate the stem cells that already exist in the body. Whether this approach completely supplants cells from other sources, or adds to them, remains to be seen.\" The New Innovator Awards cover laboratory costs over a ve-year period and are given to young researchers who have not yet received nih research grants. This year, nih awarded 47 scientists $138 million under its New Innovator and Pioneer Award pro-grams. Recipients are chosen through rigorous application and evaluation processes involving several hundred scienti c experts. Recommendations for awards are made to nih Director Elias A. Zerhouni, m.d. \"This award will allow us the freedom to take a high risk/high re-ward approach to a novel type of stem cell therapy, namely the biochemical steering of endogenous, adult multi-potential cell migration,\" Shapiro says. \"The use of mri to monitor these experiments is important because, if these procedures prove successful, we can further implement the same imag-ing methodologies in translation to primate and human studies.\" Shapiro received his ph.d. from the University of Pennsylvania in 2001, and then completed a postdoc-toral fellowship in molecular and cellular imaging at the nih's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
