National Institutes of Health U.S. Department of Health and Human Services D234The Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States Reviewed July 2004 Updated September 2004 NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARYNATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND ALAND AL TERNATIVE MEDICINETERNATIVE MEDICINE The Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States Americans are using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). But, it is often asked, how many Americans? What therapies are they using? For what health problems and concerns? The most comprehensive and reliable findings to date on Americans' use of CAM were released in May 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, part of the Centers for D isease Control and Prevention). They came from the 2002 edition of the NCHS's National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an annual study in which tens of thousands of Americans are interviewed about their health- and illness-related experiences. The 2002 edition included detailed questions on CAM. It was completed by 31,044 adults aged 18 years or older from the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. Some highlights from these findings begin on page 2. To obtain the full report, see page 4. What Is CAM? CAM is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine\u2014that is, medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and their allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses.* In CAM, complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine, and alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. While some scientific evidence exists regarding some CAM therapies, for most there are key questions that are yet to be answered through well-designed scientific studies\u2014questions such as whether these therapies are safe and whether they work for the diseases or medical conditions for which they are used. The list of what is considered to be CAM changes continually, as those therapies that are proven to be safe and effective become adopted into conventional health care and as new approaches to health care emerge. *Other terms for conventional medicine include allopathy; Western, mainstream, orthodox, and regular medicine; and biomedicine. Some conventional medical practitioners are also practitioners of CAM. Biologically based practices use substances found in nature, such as herbs, special diets, or vitamins (in doses outside those used in conventional medicine). Energy medicine involves the use of energy fields, such as magnetic fields or biofields (energy fields that some believe surround and penetrate the human body). Manipulative and body-based practices are based on manipulation or movement of one or more body parts. Mind-body medicine uses a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's ability to affect bodily function and symptoms. Whole medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice. Often, these systems have evolved apart from and earlier than the conventional medical approach used in the United States. NCCAM groups CAM practices into four domains, recognizing there can be some overlap. In addition, NCCAM studies CAM whole medical systems, which cut across all domains. 3CAM Therapies Used the Most Prayer specifically for health reasons was the most commonly used CAM therapy. (See figure 4,which shows the percentage of people using eachof the 10 most common therapies.) Most peoplewho use CAM use it to treat themselves, as onlyabout 12% of the survey respondents sought carefrom a licensed CAM practitioner. Use of Natural Products As shown in figure 4, about 19% (or one-fifth) of the people surveyed used natural products. See figure 5 for the most commonly used naturalproducts and for the percentages of naturalproduct users who took those products. Health Conditions Prompting CAM Use People use CAM for a wide array of diseases andconditions. According to the survey, Americansare most likely to use CAM for back, neck, head,or joint aches, or other painful conditions; colds;anxiety or depression; gastrointestinal disorders; orsleeping problems. (See figure 6.) It appears thatCAM is most often used to treat and/or preventmusculoskeletal conditions or other conditionsinvolving chronic or recurring pain. 2The Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States CAM Therapies Included in the Survey The survey included questions on various types ofCAM therapies commonly used in the UnitedStates. These included provider-based therapies,such as acupuncture and chiropractic, and othertherapies that do not require a provider, such asnatural products, special diets, and megavitamintherapy. (See the blue box on page 3 for acomplete list of therapies that were included.) The results were analyzed including and excluding two therapies\u2014(1) prayer specifically for healthreasons and (2) megavitamins\u2014because earliernational surveys did not consistently include thesetherapies. Unless noted otherwise, the statistics are for CAM use during the 12 months prior to the 2002 survey. How Many People Use CAM In the United States, 36% of adults are usingsome form of CAM. When megavitamin therapyand prayer specifically for health reasons areincluded in the definition of CAM, that numberrises to 62%. (See figure 1.) Who Uses CAM Most CAM use spans people of all backgrounds. But,according to the survey, some people are morelikely than others to use CAM. Overall, CAM useis greater by: I Women than men I People with higher educational levels I People who have been hospitalized in the past year I Former smokers, compared with current smokersor those who have never smoked This survey was the first to yield substantialinformation on CAM use by minorities, and themajor findings so far are shown in figure 2. The full report provides more details about the characteristics of people who use CAM. CAM Domains Used the Most When prayer is included in the definition of CAM,the domain of mind-body medicine is the mostcommonly used domain (53%).
