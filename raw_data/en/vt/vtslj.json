Ensuring you're eating a [well-balanced diet](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g781/belly-fat-foods/), [staying hydrated](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a46956/how-much-water-should-i-drink/) and [getting enough sleep](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a40548531/how-to-fix-sleep-schedule/) is key to feeling your best. But oftentimes, there may be an underlying nutrition deficiency that can manifest as fatigue, among other symptoms. Vitamin B12 is an important nutrient especially of concern for those following a plant-based diet, as it is typically found in animal-based foods. If your doctor has recommended a vitamin B12 supplement, our registered dietitians in the Good Housekeeping Institute Nutrition Lab evaluated over 30 different brands to find the best options on the market. Our top picks: Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a vital role in many functions of the body, including maintaining the health of red blood cells, nerve cells and DNA synthesis, according to registered dietitian Valerie Agyeman, R.D., host of women's health podcast, [Flourish Heights](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-flourish-heights-podcast/id1566812633__;!!Ivohdkk!lJxWbxIKPaJaMaLtDBUvI0XuLM3sMDHby4G_NtG4Mh1ldGBEld_35EKYpKLkXZEUXut-x_9Y4gaZ2zQ1ZkFKzMXXs2NI$). \"Vitamin B12 isn't produced by the body, so it's very important to obtain it from dietary sources or supplements.\" There are certain populations that may find B12 to be especially beneficial. \"Those who are on a mostly vegetarian or vegan diet will likely benefit from a B12 supplement, as will individuals who have gastrointestinal difficulties that may lead to poor absorption of nutrients (like Crohn's disease or weight loss surgeries),\" says Marissa Meshulam, registered dietitian and founder of [MPM Nutrition](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://mpmnutrition.com__;!!Ivohdkk!lnJtXLXEQqNNeTweVQUW8nhnQ31xOGhH-Bs1IjIN3cSY1RP35K1yZSUwoSb7M1laBqC55T4eLxHVravLdJPtwbY$). \"Elderly people may also benefit from a B12 supplement, as absorption can decrease with age.\" But before supplementing with vitamin B12 or any other supplement, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider who will likely run bloodwork first to check your levels and recommend the appropriate dosage.

Take note: Our nutrition pros stress that a supplement should do just that: supplement the diet, not replace high-quality, healthy food. Check with your healthcare provider before starting any dietary supplement regimen. How we chose the best B12 supplements The [Good Housekeeping Institute](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/product-reviews/) Nutrition Lab rigorously evaluates all different types of supplements year-round based on nutritional expertise, ingredients and third-party testing data. We looked at over 30 different brands of B12 supplements when making our selections for the best ones on the market. Our registered dietitians considered form, type, dosage, serving size, price, servings per container, ingredients and whether or not you can take the supplement with or without food. When making our final selections, we aimed to provide options for a variety of personal preferences and price points. We prioritized recommendations that have been tested for purity, potency and safety by a credible third-party organization, as well as products with strict internal quality control standards. We specifically looked at ingredient lists and product quality. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness prior to going to market, it's incredibly important to thoroughly research each supplement you add to your regimen and speak with your doctor before purchasing. What to look for when shopping for the best B12 supplements Vitamin B12 supplements come in all different shapes and sizes (and prices). Here are some key considerations to keep in mind when finding one that is best for you: Form: You'll notice that B12 supplements come in methylcobalamin or cyanocobalamin forms. More on this later, but methylcobalamin is the natural form which may be retained better and longer, whereas cyanocobalamin is the synthetic form that may be better absorbed. Your doctor or registered dietitian can advise on which form is best for your needs. Type: Most B12 supplements on the market come in tablets or lozenges that dissolve under your tongue. But if you prefer a different delivery method, they are also available in gummies and liquid form via a spray bottle. Size: Check the serving size and consider the size of the pill itself. Since B12 supplements vary in terms of dosage, maybe you can just take one serving once a week or potentially double up servings if you need more. Regardless, speak with your healthcare provider to find the appropriate dose for your needs. Price: B12 supplements can vary greatly in price, and more expensive options aren't necessarily better. Plus, each bottle contains a different number of pills and serving size can vary, so we included information on cost per dosage so you can accurately compare each option. Keep in mind that some supplements also include other nutrients like folate or larger complexes. What is vitamin B12? \"Vitamin B12 (aka cobalamin) is a vitamin involved in many processes in our bodies such as energy metabolism, red blood cell formation and nerve function,\" Meshulam says. \"Methylcobalamin is the naturally occuring form found in foods, while cyanocobalamin in the synthetic form found in most supplements.\" Agyeman further explains that cyanocobalamin is commonly found in supplements and food, and the body changes it into active forms. \"Methylcobalamin is the active form that the body directly uses for things like DNA synthesis and nerve health and is better for nerve-related issues,\" Agyeman says. It's best to talk to a doctor before deciding which one to use.\" How much vitamin B12 do you need? \"For most adult women, the recommended daily intake of vitamin B12 is around 2.4 micrograms (mcg),\" Agyeman explains, adding that pregnant and lactating women may need slightly more, usually around 2.6 to 2.8 mcg per day. \"During pregnancy, the demand for nutrients like vitamin B12 increases. Getting enough vitamin B12 is key to support the neurological development of the baby and the overall health of the mother. Vitamin B12 may play a role in fertility by supporting proper hormone balance and reproductive health.\" Agyeman also says that vitamin B12 is involved in bone metabolism and mineralization, so having adequate levels of B12 is especially important for women as they are more prone to bone disorders like osteoporosis. If you aren't getting the necessary amount of vitamin B12 daily, a deficiency may occur. \"Vitamin B12 deficiency shows up as fatigue, weakness, pale skin and breathlessness. It can also lead to numbness, balance problems, cognitive issues, mouth ulcers, a swollen tongue and mood changes like depression,\" Agyeman notes. You may notice that many vitamin B12 supplements have well above 100% of the daily value. But there is no established upper limit for vitamin B12 due to its low potential for toxicity. Given that B12 is a water soluble vitamin, Meshulam says that an excess is not harmful and is typically excreted through urine. That's why at even large doses, it is typically safe to consume vitamin B12 as the body will not store excess amounts, but some side effects may occur such as digestive upset. What foods are rich in vitamin B12? \"Foods like meat, fish, eggs and dairy products contain vitamin B12,\" Agyeman explains. \"Some plant-based options like fortified cereals, plant milks and nutritional yeast also contain it. However, if you are vegetarian or vegan you'll need to consult with your healthcare provider so they can assess whether a supplement is needed since plant sources have limited B12.\" Here is a complete list of foods rich in B12: Beef liver Cooked clams Fortified nutritional yeast Cooked Atlantic salmon Canned light tuna in water Ground beef Milk Yogurt Fortified breakfast cereals Cheddar cheese Whole eggs Turkey breast What are the benefits of taking vitamin B12 supplements? Vitamin B12 supplements can prevent anemia and fatigue due to deficiency, maintaining energy levels, according to Agyeman. \"Vitamin B12 assists nerve health and cognitive function, possibly enhancing memory and mood control too.\" She also emphasizes that B12 supplements are vital for pregnant women to ensure healthy fetal development. Other populations that may benefit from taking vitamin B12 include older adults, as this can counteract age-related absorption decline according to Agyeman. Lastly, she says that people with gastrointestinal disorders such as pernicious anemia, celiac disease, Crohn's disease or those taking specific medications may experience impaired B12 absorption, and proper supplementation can help maintain optimal levels. Are there any side effects of taking vitamin B12 supplements? \"Vitamin B12 supplements are usually safe for most people, but taking too much can cause stomach discomfort or skin issues,\" Agyeman warns. \"If you're allergic or sensitive to B12, it's best to steer clear of these supplements. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting B12 supplements, especially if you have health concerns, have dietary restrictions, take certain medications or are pregnant or breastfeeding.\" Meshulam adds that even though there is no established upper limit for B12, that if your levels become too high you may experience undesirable symptoms like gastrointestinal distress, weakness and tingling sensations in extremities. \"This is why it is so important to get your levels checked and work with a practitioner to figure out what is right for you.\" Why trust Good Housekeeping?
