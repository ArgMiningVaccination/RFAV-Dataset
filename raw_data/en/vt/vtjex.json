Ayurveda originated in India more than 5,000 years ago and is the oldest continuously practiced healthcare system in the world. Drawn from an understanding of nature's rhythms and laws, Ayurveda teaches that humans, as natural beings, are governed by the same rules and laws as all other natural beings. If we choose to ignore these laws, then imbalances will begin to appear, which can lead to disharmony and disease in the mind and body. An Ayurvedic approach treats each individual, taking into account their unique psychological, emotional, and physical conditions. Imbalances in the body are evaluated through the system of the five elements: ether, air, fire, water, and earth. The goal of Ayurveda is to teach people how to attain optimal health through a deeper understanding of themselves and their own particular nature in relationship to the world around them. It is a system based on natural healing through strengthening the body, mind, and spirit and allowing the body's own [natural healing mechanisms](http://kripalu.org/blog/thrive/2012/05/22/ask-the-expert-ayurvedic-answers/) to work to their fullest potential.
