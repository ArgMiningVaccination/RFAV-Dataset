Demographic research is central to quantifying population-level processes and their underlying mech- anisms and has provided critical contributions to a diversity of research elds. Examples include the spread of infectious diseases, eco-evolutionary dynamics and rapid evolution, mechanisms underlying invasions and extinctions, and forest productivity. As the fates of individual organisms are in fluenced by, and subsequently underlie, many other patterns and processes, we suggest that connecting demog- raphy beyond the population level offers promising avenues of innovation in ecology and evolution. 2.Under the premise that population-level processes are an ideal common currency within ecology and evolution, we organized the British Ecological Society Symposium, Demography Beyond the Population . This event attracted international researchers who are applying demographic theory and approaches to a broad range of questions. This special feature builds off of the symposium and illus- trates the ability of demography to connect across diverse research areas in ecology and evolution, including functional traits, transient dynamics, quantitative genetics, environmental drivers and feed- backs, land management and other topics. In addition to highlighting the contributed manuscripts, this editorial provides a brief background on the development of the discipline and suggests how demographic tools may be used in novel ways to study more than justpopulations. 3.Synthesis . This special feature integrates novel lines of research in the vast eld of demography that directly interact with other ecological and evolutionary disciplines. The cross-disciplinary poten- tial of demography is further emphasized by the fact that its 20 manuscripts are spread across all six journals of the British Ecological Society. Together, these articles highlight that there is much to be gained by linking demography to other disciplines and scales in ecology and evolution.

Funda- mental ecological and evolutionary research has emergedfrom this focus, informing our current understanding of den- sity-dependence (Goldberg et al. 2001; Turchin Bas /C19a~nez 2006), infectious disease dynam- ics (Anderson & May 1985; Grenfell & Dobson 1995), the management of invasive and threatened species (Silvertown, Franco & Menges 1996; Morris & Doak 2002; Baxter et al. 2006), and the evolution of life-history strategies (Childs et al. 2004; Salguero-G /C19omez et al. 2015a), to mention a few. However, demography is but one focal point within the broad lens of ecology and evolution, which together encompass a considerable range of scales across space, time and biological*Correspondence authors.

Over the last century, specializa- tion of subdisciplines has coincided with substantial advancesin areas as diverse as genomics, ecophysiology, phylogenet-ics, community ecology and behavioural ecology. Yet, thiscollective endeavour has inherent limitations without adequatebridges across scales (Chave 2013). Along with focused disci-plinary work, we must also pursue quantitative connections across ecology and evolution using flexible frameworks and common metrics. Demography has much to offer in thisregard. Population ecology seeks to understand the drivers of changes in abundance over time and space, with demographymore speci cally related to how underlying vital rates (sur- vival, growth, reproduction, etc.) structure populations. Varia-tion in these vital rates represents a key lter that underlies and connects many aspects of ecology and evolution (McGraw & Caswell 1996; Metcalf & Pavard 2007). Theseprocesses can be considered as a biological 'common cur- rency ', which are arguably situated near the middle of several scaling axes (Fig. 1). Moreover, demography is inherently ascaling tool, translating the fates of individuals into popula-tion-level outcomes. By expanding the boundaries even fur-ther, one can treat demographic metrics as predictor or response variables that link to other scales, promoting con- silience of ecological and evolutionary subdisciplines (Fig. 1). Motivated by recent research that expands the disciplinary boundaries of population ecology, we (with C.J.E. Metcalfand D.Z. Childs) organized the British Ecological SocietySymposium: Demography Beyond the Population (24-26 March 2015, Shef eld, UK). The symposium brought together a broad range of researchers using demographic the- ory and approaches in innovative ways. The resulting specialfeature highlights these avenues of research and mirrors its bridge-building nature as the rst to span across all journals of the BES: Journal of Ecology ,Journal of Animal Ecology , Journal of Applied Ecology ,Functional Ecology ,Methods in Ecology and Evolution , and Ecology and Evolution . Our goal is to urge both demographers and non-demographers alikethat there is much to be gained by linking demography to other disciplines and scales in ecology and evolution. Populations and demography in ecology and evolution Ecology and evolution are deeply rooted in population biol- ogy and demography. Indeed, the factors that determine therates of population increase or decline and the differentialcontributions from individuals are central to evolution by nat-ural selection. This link between individual variation and dif- ferences in survival and reproduction is also the basis of structured populations, a topic that resides at the very core ofdemography (Leslie 1945; Tuljapurkar & Caswell 1997;Caswell 2001). Early pioneers of theoretical ecology includedLotka (1924) and Volterra (1926), whose coupled populationmodels of species interactions have become part of the bed-rock of community ecology. Broad advances in many areasof animal ecology in the mid-20th century, such as life-his- tory evolution (e.g. Cole 1954) or species coexistence (e.g. Macarthur 1958), were strongly in fluenced by the examination of population-level processes. Indeed, Hutchinson 's (1957) classic paper formalizing the concept of the ecological nicheemerged from the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium entitledPopulation Studies: Animal Ecology and Demography. In the latter half of the 20th century, plant ecologists began to (a) (b) (c) Fig. 1.

There are many opportunities for demography to inform -and be informed by -processes in different research areas and/or at variable scales, including (b) translating factors that affect individual organisms into a range of larger-scale outcomes or (c) cap tur- ing eco-evolutionary processes that involve the dynamic feedback system of genetics, environment and demography. \u00a92016 The Authors.

Grif thet al.increase their focus on the fates of individuals and the use of population-level methods, (re)opening avenues of inquiry thatwere previously hindered by a largely 'vegetationalist ' approach (Harper 1967). Today, plant and animal ecologistsare starting to blur taxonomic lines, using many shared frame-works and methodologies with population-level origins. Many of the theoretical population models that helped to advance ecology in the early 20th century did not explicitly consider population structure, a key focus of demography.This limitation was directly addressed with the rise of matrixpopulation models (Leslie 1945; Lefkovitch 1965), which candescribe the population dynamics of virtually any life historythat can be represented with discrete classes. The furtherdevelopment of analytical tools (e.g. Tuljapurkar & Orzack1980; de Kroon et al. 1986; Caswell 1989; van Groenendael et al. 1994) coincided with a tremendous increase in the use of empirical structured population models in ecology over thelast two decades. By the 1990s, matrix population models hadbecome one of the most frequently used methods to translatevital rates into population-level outcomes, allowing research-ers to address a broad range of fundamental and applied eco-logical questions (Caswell 2001; Morris & Doak 2002; Croneet al. 2011). The flexibility and power of demographic tools has increased rapidly over the last decade (Salguero-G /C19omez & de Kroon 2010), mirroring broad advances in computa-tional and statistical approaches in ecology more generally(Green et al. 2005). These advances have opened up new possibilities for increasing the reach of demography through quantitativeconnections with diverse data sets and improved model param- eterization. For example, generalized linear mixed models(GLMMs; Bolker et al. 2009) have been increasingly used to estimate vital rates and provide a broad platform to partitionand attribute sources of variation that underlie population-leveloutcomes. Integral projection models (IPMs; Easterling, Ellner& al. 2014a) have allowed demographers to more comprehensively represent population structure by incorporating both continuous statevariables (e.g. size [Easterling, Ellner & Dixon 2000], fur col-our [Coulson et al. 2011]) and discrete stages (e.g. age [Childs et al. 2003], sex [Schindler et al. 2015], or stage [Zambrano & Salguero-G /C19omez 2014]). Other recent modelling advances, such as integrated population models(Abadi et al. 2010) and physiologically structured models (de Roos & Persson 2001), expand opportunities by combining different data types to understand variation in vital rates. Ineffect, whereas many of the early population-level contribu-tions to ecology were along theoretical lines, the new frontieremphasizes a much greater capacity for empirical connectionsthat incorporate population structure. How, and to what extent, can demographic approaches con- nect with other areas of ecology and evolution today ?A broad literature survey using search terms aligned with differ- ent biological levels of organization points to large overlapsbetween populations and other scales in ecology and evolu-tion (Fig. 2). Cutting edge research grounded in demographysits at the intersections in Fig. 2. For example, recent studieshave used demography to empirically examine questions in Fig. 2.

Links between physiology, functional traits and demographyare increasingly being examined (de Roos & 2010; Zanette, Clinchy & Suraci 2014; Larson et al. 2015), with implications ranging from the demo- graphic scaling of environmental drivers in species range models (Merow et al. 2014b; Normand et al. 2014) to our understanding of forest community dynamics (Iida et al. 2014). Molecular tools to estimate past population size and/orstructure have been widely used (Roman & Palumbi 2003;Jakob et al. 2010), and recent work has incorporated molecu- lar techniques to improve estimates of demographic parame-ters for current populations that are challenging to monitor (Meijer et al. 2008; Caniglia et al. 2014). Spanning multiple intersections, several research groups have used demographyto model large-scale ecosystem processes and function Vanderwel, Coomes & Purves 2013; Haverd et al. 2014). The 20 articles in this special feature build upon the recent research momentum within these ecological inter-sections and address speci c challenges moving forward. Col- lectively, the articles: (i) explore the ways in which demography intersects with other areas of ecological and evo- lutionary research, (ii) identify gaps that can be informed byan understanding of population-level processes, and (iii) eluci-date analytical tools and metrics that facilitate the integrationof population-level processes across organizational, spatialand temporal scales. Opportunities and challenges in the special feature Extending the reach of demography involves both opportuni- ties and challenges. Here, we brie fly highlight the contributing articles within a broader narrative explicitly structured aroundthese opportunities and challenges. We begin by consideringthe concept of the 'trait 'and how it represents a key interface between biology and modelling. We argue that linking traitsto their demographic consequences can provide a broad plat-form for addressing a range of questions. We then focus on our fundamental understanding of the drivers of demographic variation, which is critical to the broader application ofdemography. Several papers also address ways to improveinference given data complexity and limitations inherent inmany demographic data sets. Finally, we discuss the role ofdemography in informing ecological applications and improv-ing forecasting in a changing world. THE TRAIT CONCEPT A central focus of demography is to characterize how varia-tion among individuals contributes to population-level perfor-mance. Individual variation is often adequately represented bytraits such as size, developmental stage, age or location, that isthe 'state variables 'of structured population models. Yet, traits of interest may also be highly relevant to disciplinessuch as anatomy, physiology, genetics or community ecology (Uriarte et al. 2016). Some traits may also pose important interacting effects by differentially in fluencing vital rates across ontogeny (Visser et al. 2016). Thus, determining how various traits affect tness and 'scale-up 'to influence other ecological processes/interactions may crucially involve struc-tured population models that capture the complete life cycle. With an interest in the drivers of selection on heritable traits, Rees & Ellner (2016) present a powerful approach todecompose components of natural selection in structured pop-ulations using IPMs. Unlike evolutionary models of selectionthat ignore population structure, they demonstrate the impor-tance of changes in structure itself in determining selection ontraits. This approach relies on an extension of structured pop-ulations (e.g. based on size) onto an additional trait axis. Sim- ilarly, Childs, Sheldon & Rees (2016) incorporate multiple structuring dimensions to examine selection on labile traits(egg-laying date in this case), which can vary throughout anindividual 's lifetime. Their approach captures the cumulative influence of variable environments experienced over a lifetime to improve our understanding and projections of trait evolu-tion in wild populations. Variation in continuous traits is also critical for understand- ing the complex dynamics of infectious diseases. Metcalf et al. (2016) present a novel use of IPMs to simultaneously capture both relevant individual differences (e.g. viral load,host susceptibility) and important population-level effectssuch as density-dependent transmission. These models can benested within existing disease modelling frameworks (SIR inthis case), increasing the ability to incorporate continuoustraits in a flexible manner. This approach points to a promis- ing new avenue for modelling disease dynamics and also highlights the reach of ecological methods into the realm ofpublic health and medical research. Trait variation is central to an important goal of functional ecology: the identi cation of organismal characteristics that are relatively easy to measure in situ , and which convey meaningful biological information (Violle et al. 2007). From a demographic perspective, we feel that these characteristics are too often pre-named functional traits without a careful consideration of their effects on tness components. Surpris- ingly, the rst formal test of the impact of plant functional traits on the demographic processes involving the full lifecycles of plant species took place only 2 years ago (Adleret al. 2014). Two articles in this special feature shed light on the demographic effects of functional traits and their ecologi-cal consequences. Visser et al. (2016) examine how traits may differentially affect demographic rates across ontogeny. Critically, the authors nd that traits often have opposing effects at different points in the life cycle, highlighting theimportance of a comprehensive understanding of net effects.The in fluence of functional traits is scaled up to the commu- nity dynamics of a tropical forest in Costa Rica by Uriarteet al. (2016). They use an innovative Bayesian approach to study forest succession, linking individual tree growth and mortality to species traits, forest structure and climatic varia- tion. Taken together, these studies suggest that the prospect \u00a92016 The Authors. Journal of Ecology \u00a92016 British Ecological Society, Journal of Ecology ,104, 271 -280274 A. B. Grif thet al.of demographically based forecasts derived from traits may be on the horizon, even for species with few direct demo-graphic observations (e.g. Merow et al. 2014b). UNDERSTANDING VARIATION AND THE DRIVERS OF POPULATIONS In order to link demographic processes with other research areas in ecology and evolution, it is crucial that we continue to expand our understanding of the underlying factors that govern population dynamics. In addition to the exampleshighlighted above, linking traits and demography also providean opportunity to better understand the sources of demo-graphic variation. To this end, Plard et al. (2016) decompose the population growth rate to show how it is affected bychanges in trait means and variances. The authors nd that population dynamics may be more sensitive to changes in the curvature of the relationship between traits and vital rates (as opposed to the overall strength) and that phenotypic variationmay be more consequential for populations of short- vs. long-lived species. Other key sources of demographic variation have often been overlooked or considered as 'noise '. For example, although there has been a great deal of work on the natureand effects of stochastic temporal variation on populations (e.g. Fieberg & Ellner 2001; Doak et al. 2005; Boyce, Hari- das & Lee 2006; Metcalf et al. 2015), much less attention has been paid to the contributions of ne-scale spatial hetero- geneity on population dynamics (but see Rebke et al. 2010). Using a long-term data set of a perennial plant, Crone (2016)nds that increased spatial heterogeneity across a relatively small area ( <0.25 ha) promotes the population growth rate, distinctly contrasting with the negative effect of temporal variation. Such opposing effects of two ubiquitous sources of variation may have important consequences for both appliedforecasting and basic ecology research, as space-for-time sub-stitutions are frequently carried out in eld ecology (Merow et al. 2014b; but see Tielb \u20acorger & Salguero-G /C19omez 2014). In a similar vein, McDonald et al. (2016) explore the role of transient (short term, non-stationary) dynamics on structuredpopulation growth rates. Although transient dynamics are common in natural systems (Maron, Horvitz & Williams 2010; Stott, Townley & Hodgson 2011), demographicresearch has mostly focused on asymptotic metrics (Hastings2004; but see Williams et al. 2011). McDonald et al. use an extensive comparative demography approach with over 130plant species from the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database(Salguero-G /C19omez et al. 2015b) and nd the contribution of transient dynamics to stochastic growth rates to be equally as large on average compared to asymptotic (long term, station- ary) contributions. Together, these papers emphasize the needfor a more comprehensive understanding of the underlyingspatial and temporal components of population dynamics. The in fluence of abiotic and biotic environmental factors (climate, resources, disturbance, predators, etc.) on vital ratesand resulting population dynamics represents another criticalsource of variation that is often not explicitly accounted for indemographic studies (Crone et al. 2013). Moreover, these fac- tors embody the underlying ecological drivers of populationsand thus represent critical mechanisms for scaling and projec-tions. In a comprehensive review of research on environmen-tal drivers in structured population models for over 130 plantspecies, Ehrl /C19enet al. (2016) nd that such studies are indeed on the rise. However, they point to several gaps in the litera- ture that beg for further research, such as density-dependent interactions, dynamic feedbacks, trait evolution and the incor-poration of drivers as continuous metrics. With this insight,the authors provide recommendations to inform the design ofstudies aimed at addressing these gaps. Treurnicht et al. (2016) make progress in several of these areas with an exten-sive examination of how abiotic factors and intraspeci c den- sity relate to the fecundity and recruitment rates of 26 shrub species from South Africa. Across entire species 'ranges, cli- mate and re emerge as dominant drivers, but with effects at distinctly different parts of the life cycle, similar to the resultsfound by Visser et al. (2016). Environmental conditions may also be inferred by trait val- ues themselves (Beckerman et al. 2003). Using a novel regression-based variance decomposition approach, Brookset al. (2016) investigate how the body size of soil mites can act as a proxy for past environments. They show that prior food availability has differential effects on distinct vital rates,including how these in fluences are mediated through the more proximate effect of body size. Henning-Lucass et al. (2016) indirectly examine past environments using a resurrectionecology approach and compare Daphnia populations, dormant for four decades, to current populations from the same lake.They nd strong plasticity to water temperature for past and current populations (with important effects on key vital rates) as well as some evidence for recent microevolution in thisplastic response. The overarching issue of correctly identifying the in fluence of one or more particular environmental factors is addressed byTeller et al. (2016). In practice, researchers often rely on arbi- trary decisions about the spatial scale over which competitionoccurs and aggregate continuous climate data into discrete lags representing factors such as mean temperature. These aggrega- tions are often chosen a priori and could easily average over important variability. Given enough data, Teller et al. show how spline methods can help avoid such a priori decisions. At larger spatial scales, different factors may emerge as importantdrivers of metapopulation and source-sink dynamics. Hein-richs, Lawler & Schumaker (2016) examined over 130 differ-ent model scenarios and found that characteristics of both populations (e.g. capacity for rapid growth) and the landscape (e.g. distribution of habitat quality) contributed strongly to theemergence of source-sink dynamics. However, similar out-comes sometimes resulted across a range of different parametervalues, suggesting complex interactions and scaling pathways. CHALLENGES OF DATA LIMITATION AND UNCERTAINTY Demography can be a 'data hungry 'discipline. Ideally, indi- vidual transitions and reproductive rates throughout the life \u00a92016 The Authors. Journal of Ecology \u00a92016 British Ecological Society, Journal of Ecology ,104, 271 -280Demography beyond the population 275cycle should be carefully detailed, but challenges can emerge from spatiotemporal coverage, imperfect observations and raredemographic events. Several manuscripts in this special fea-ture (Kerr et al. 2016; McDonald et al. 2016) take advantage of the recent push for broad, comparative demographic analy-ses (Salguero-G /C19omez et al. 2015b, 2016) to address questions in ecology, evolution and conservation biology at a global level. Several calls for longer term ecological data have been made to the research community and funding agencies (Croneet al. 2011). The need within demography is critical, particu- larly for long-lived species that may encounter rare, but extre-mely important events such as extreme droughts, episodic re or disease outbreaks (Needham et al. 2016). An important challenge is how to incorporate key demo- graphic rates that occur infrequently (e.g. large tree mortality and masting events) and/or are dif cult to detect (true vs. apparent survival in mobile organisms, hibernation/dormancy,etc.). Barthold et al. (2016) directly address the latter by developing a method to estimate lion mortality that incorpo-rates sex-biased dispersal. Until now, nomadic male lions thatdisperse away from prides have made it dif cult to assess a critical vital rate for this declining species: male survival.Data limitations become even more apparent when extending population models to larger elds of inference, whether spa- tial extent (e.g. Merow et al. 2014b) or community complex- ity (e.g. Needham et al. 2016; Uriarte et al. 2016). To address this challenge, Gonz /C19alez, Martorell & Bolker (2016) use inverse models (Hartig et al. 2012), a promising approach to parameter estimation. With data on population abundancesover time, but with incomplete information on vital rates, theyare able to recover key demographic parameters. Needham et al. (2016) similarly use inverse models to estimate fecun- dity parameters of multiple species from a short-term data set.With this approach, they were able to build individual-basedmodels (IBMs; Grimm & Railsback 2005) to examine thespatially explicit response of a forest community to a treepathogen. Collectively, these three studies advance our abilitytoll in 'holes 'in demographic data sets, extending their general applicability. ECOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND APPLICATIONS Applied ecology has important intersections with a range ofsocial factors (stakeholders, policy frameworks, etc.), andconsequently faces more dimensions and scaling axes thanare depicted in Fig. 1. For example, whereas demographicmodels have long been used to inform speci c management action for ecosystems of species of concern (Silvertown,Franco & Menges 1996; Morris & Doak 2002; Crone et al. 2011), most models are based on factors that directly relate to biology and rarely explicitly incorporate other managementconsiderations such as ef cacy and cost (Shea et al. 2010; but see Baxter et al. 2006). Kerr et al. (2016) provide a broad evaluation of how demographic models align with other met-rics relevant to cost-effective management. Indeed, theyexpand the boundaries of demography by linking model out-puts (e.g. elasticities of population growth rate) for multiplespecies to survey results of land manager action priorities. A keynding is that, while managers do incorporate demogra- phy, they face a much greater range of factors (e.g. off-targeteffects, social impacts) that should be more explicitly consid-ered by ecologists as well. Ecological forecasting has become imperative for policy and management, even as the complex dynamics of global change simultaneously increase the challenge (Mouquet et al. 2015). Crone et al. (2013) demonstrated the shortcomings of matrix population models in accurately forecasting populationdynamics and suggest that a typical disconnect from environ-mental drivers is an important underlying factor. Promisingresearch addressing this priority is reviewed by Ehrl /C19enet al. (2016), and Treurnicht et al. (2016) point to the potential of environmental drivers of vital rates to inform forecasts in both space and time (e.g. range dynamics; Merow et al. 2014b; Normand et al. 2014). Wittmann et al. (2016) take a different angle and nd that habitat suitability based on temperature for Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) correlates with observa- tions of individual growth rates across six continents. Theirstudy is among only a handful that has ground-truthed thelink between trait values (also a key vital rate in this case)and habitat suitability predicted using presence/absence of data. Another potential limitation to accurate forecasting is the context of the community in which populations exist. Need-ham et al. (2016) take a step towards improving species-level forecasts by simultaneously modelling multiple members of aforest tree community. This approach enables one to incorpo-rate constraints on limiting resources and model species inter-actions, which can be key to determining long-term outcomes. Uriarte et al. (2016) take a different approach to forecasting community dynamics by linking variation indemographic rates across multiple species to more readilyobserved functional traits. As projections become a more common tool to forecast the response of natural systems to global change, computationallyefcient platforms for simulations become more important (Visser et al. 2015). Forest simulators have a long history in the ecological literature, but few incorporate size-structure and functional traits in explicit models of plant performanceand density-dependent growth. Falster, FitzJohn & Westoby(2016) introduce plant , an R package that simulates forest development through ef cient models of populations, commu- nities and even meta-communities. Stands can be simulatedstochastically or deterministically and be used to explore avariety of eco-evolutionary questions. Projecting forward The 20 articles of this special feature highlight the opportuni-ties at the intersections between demography and other disci-plines. The ultimate reach of demography will depend in parton research priorities and design, and it will be increasinglyimportant for studies to quantitatively leverage each other. Recent advances in comparative demography (e.g. Jones et al. 2014; Salguero-G /C19omez et al. 2015a) have demonstrated the \u00a92016 The Authors. Journal of Ecology \u00a92016 British Ecological Society, Journal of Ecology ,104, 271 -280276 A. B. Grif thet al.potential of this approach. Yet, most demographic studies are highly variable in nature and implementation and notdesigned with the foresight to connect with other data setsand extend beyond the original study goals. With emergentopen-access demographic data repositories (Lebreton et al. 2010; Salguero-G /C19omez et al. 2015b, 2016) and a greater capacity to quantitatively integrate data sources, demographers should consider how to maximize the broader potential oftheir data when designing studies. For example, while collect-ing demographic data, researchers may want to consider cer-tain covariates that are broadly informative (e.g. density,environmental factors), and which are relatively easy to mea-sure (Ehrl /C19enet al. 2016). In this sense, one might extend the concept of comparative demography to that of collective demography, where demographic data are collected with the a priori consideration that they can inform a broader suite of ecological and evolutionary questions. This is similar to thesoftware engineering concept of extensibility , where future use and compatibility are explicitly considered in the processof designing a flexible system (Erdogmus & Tanir 2002). Beyond the requirements of the data themselves, demo- graphic advances have relied on developing novel quantitative tools. Luckily, the last decades have witnessed unprecedented progress in open-access software packages that allow users toimplement modelling techniques in a relatively straightfor-ward manner (see software packages in Table 1). In addition,many of the manuscripts in this special feature have provided open-access R scripts of their analyses in their online materi-als (e.g. Childs, Sheldon & Rees 2016; Teller et al. 2016). To mark the 100th anniversary of the BES, Sutherland et al. (2013) formulated a list of 100 standing questions in ecology and evolution. We were struck by the degree to which demography and population-level processes are rele- vant to these questions. Naturally, we have no doubt thatother approaches also have considerable and complementaryreach, and we emphasize that our focus on demography is notmutually exclusive vis-a-vis other disciplines. What we see isan emerging opportunity, illuminated by a recent surge indiverse demographic research avenues and connections. Thereis much to be gained by harnessing and directing this momen- tum towards greater ecological consilience.
