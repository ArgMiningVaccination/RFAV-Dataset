Introduction The present review article aims to provide a comprehensive update on recent developments for in vivo applications of nanoimmunotherapy in thelast decade, including clinical translation strategies. We describe how a ratio-nal approach to nanodrug design facilitates customized management of a variety of diseases through nanoimmunotherapy by leveraging specific targeting moieties to optimize delivery, maximize efficacy, and provide spe-cific customization of designed nanodrugs to disease processes. In thisreview, we focus primarily on the following topics: targeted immuno- engineered nanoformulations, clinical translation, challenges associated with current approaches, and future directions.294 Romila Manchanda et al.2. Nanoimmuno-engineering principles 2.1 Immunotherapy The diverse groups of cells, molecules, and organs comprising the immune system perform the remarkable task of safeguarding individuals from foreign pathogens and infections. The immune system is generally divided into the innate and adaptive systems. The innate immune system provides immediateand generalized defense against foreign pathogens, whereas the adaptiveimmune response is slow but specific, and offers dynamic protection. Bothimmunities complement each other in a complex, multifaceted manner to recognize and eradicate any diseased cell ( Walsh & Mills, 2013 ). Although this framework ensures an overarching effective immune response, such complex-ity also presents challenges because it creates a wealth of possibilities fordysfunction or destabilization within critical pathways. Thus, there is the potential for a variety of immune-mediated diseases such as asthma, allergy, malnutrition, and autoimmunity. Furthermore, certain types of infectionscannot be destroyed consistently by the immune system. This ability to bypassthe immune system is not limited to foreign pathogens, as some cells with mutations and/or dysregulation of growth and proliferation pathways (such as tumor cells) are known to escape immune surveillance, resulting in abnor-mal growth and metastasis. These abnormal responses impact treatment out-comes and are responsible for disease development and relapse. Immunotherapy is a form of therapeutic management that manipulates the immune system with respect to its connection to disease processes.This therapeutic approach involves modulation of cells (e.g., lymphocytes,granulocytes, and myeloid cells), organs (e.g., lymphoid), and molecules ofthe immune system in order to reprogram the immune response, train/edu- cate the immune system to identify and fight specific targets such as defective cells or foreign pathogens, and/or diminish the response to innocuousstimuli. Immunotherapies can include different approaches such as anti-body therapy ( Sliwkowski & Mellman, 2013 ), immunomodulation, and engineered T cells, among others ( Khalil, Smith, Brentjens, & Wolchok, 2016 ). Immunotherapies can be classified based on the desired treatment outcome: activating immunotherapies involve an enhancement of the immune response, whereas suppressive immunotherapies are designed to dampen the immune response ( Fig. 1 A and B), and examples of both will be provided in this review. Another way to classify immunotherapies is to divide theminto passive and active approaches. Passive (adaptive) immunotherapy includes295 Nanomaterials to target immunityFig. 1 (A and B) Fabrication of immunoactive and immunosuppressive nanodrug-based systems in disease treatments by modulating immune cells. Figure created with Biorender.com .296 Romila Manchanda et al.monoclonal antibody (mAb) and checkpoint inhibitors and does not stim- ulate the host immune response, so it generally does not result in long-lasting immunity. On the other hand, active immunotherapy (vaccine and allergen- specific) induces a specific immune response (antibodies and T cells) andimparts immunological memory. Active immunotherapy includes CARtherapy and cancer vaccines. Immunotherapy has resulted in promising approaches to cancer treatment such as cancer vaccines (HPV vaccine), cytokine therapies (e.g. interferon,interleukin), adoptive T-c ell CAR-T nivolumab (Opdivo\u00ae)). The use of immunotherapy in the treat- ment of various diseases has also expand ed beyond these initial approaches. Many adjuvant methods use mAb and cytokines such as G-CS, GM-CSF, and IFN , which are employed as nonspecific immunomodulating agents to modulate the role of macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes in variousinfectious diseases. IFN is chronic granulomatous disease, an immu- nodeficiency in phagocytic cells due to mutation in genes associated with the NADPH oxidase system ( V/C19elez, Rocha, Arias, & Lo \u00b4pez, 2015 ). Another example of the expansion of immunotherapy applications involvesreengineering T cells to treat autoimmune-triggered skin disease (pemphigus)for human trials ( Ellebrecht et al., 2016 ). However, immunotherapy is not without limitations. Notably, when the immune system is modulated or activated, it is highly likely that patients may develop undesirable side effects such as fatigue, flu-like symptoms,fever, swelling, diarrhea, and autoimmunity. Moreover, immunotherapyfaces a challenge when attempting to expand the principles of immune mod- ulation to a larger spectrum of patients and to different cancer types and dis- ease processes. Innovation is necessary in order to overcome some of thesehurdles and develop improved treatment approaches. Therefore, currentresearch is focusing on exploring the possibilities of nanodrug design and novel delivery platforms for immunotherapy ( Wang, Ye, Hu, Bellotti, & Gu, 2017 )(Fig. 1 A). Nanomedicine can assist immunotherapy and augment and refine its effects by providing codelivery of therapeutics, site-specific targeting, andstimulation of key immune cells and organs for sustained response. Nanomedicine, in contrast to conventional delivery of cytotoxic agents,297 Nanomaterials to target immunitycan be used to activate key immune cells in order to deploy rapid prolifer- ation and effective response against disease. A more sophisticated under- standing of such modulation has changed the initial narrow focus of thenanomedicine field, which was centered on escaping from the immunesystem (e.g., sequestration of nanomaterials), to a broader view of hownanomaterials can work together with biological systems in order to obtain desired responses. Today, nanoimmunotherapy aims to facilitate and mod- ulate beneficial interactions between nanoparticles and immune cells, andthis mutual interface has become a crucial goal in the validation and designof nanosystems for nanoimmunotherapy. The intrinsic properties of nanomaterials can be leveraged to promote targeted and purposeful interactions with host components, such as phago-cytic cells and the reticuloendothelial system. Thus, there exists a collabo-rative approach to fight disease, rather than the initial narrow focus on engineering nanomaterials that have to bypass immune surveillance to exert their action. For instance, polymeric hydrogels and other nanomaterials havebeen shown to accumulate in lymph nodes and interact with immunecomponents such as T cells and B cells in order to modulate the immune system ( De Koker et al., 2016 ). A crucial tool in nanomaterial engineering is surface functionalization, which allows the design and preparation ofantibody-based nanoparticles that demonstrate increased therapeutic effi-cacy over the administration of free soluble antibodies alone. Moreover,some nanosystems such as dextran- or dextran-sulfate-based systems show intrinsic capability to macrophages ( Heo et al., 2017 ;Ma et al., 2016 ). Therefore, nanoparticles can be used as much more than a delivery vehicle, and can serve multifunctional purposes when designed in a way thatincorporates the potential for immune system interaction. Moreover, because the immune system maintains a challenging equilibrium between immunosuppressive and immunoactive components and pathways, a nano-mediated approach can assist in directing this equilibrium toward targetedand appropriate responses to potential threats, while maintaining tolerance toward healthy tissues. 2.2 Nano-focused immunotherapy The intersection between immunotherapy and nanotechnology has remark-able potential to address major public health problems such as heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Nanoscale-engineering can be used toenable nanoimmunotherapeutics to avoid immune system detection, or as298 Romila Manchanda et al.a means to introduce antigen inhibitors to improve immune system response, among other strategies. Nano-based approaches are often advan- tageous in the areas of cancer management, vaccines, and therapeutics forinflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Nanosystems are on an appropri-ate size scale to modulate immune system molecular and cellular constitu-ents, or to induce immunotolerance against a specific antigen. Engineered immune-focused nanodevices should be equipped with desirable physico- chemical characteristics. Some of these include hydrophilic/hydrophobicbalance, surface charge, minimal toxicity, biocompatibility, colloidal stabil-ity, and disease-modifying properties. Indeed, nanomaterial size is a crucial factor that can be advantageous in reaching certain target tissues; but it can also constitute a challenge, because phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages) areusually able to easily pick up nanoparticles identified as foreign materials.When nanoformulations interact with immune system components in undesirable ways, this can result in an inflammatory response, trigger auto- immune disorders, induce antibody production, and increase host suscepti-bility toward infections and cancer by giving rise to a multilevel immuneresponse against the nanosystem ( Poland et al., 2008 ). Thus, it is often critical for nanoimmunotherapeutic applications that nanoparticles be recognized as self, or that they evade immune recognition completely, in order to opti-mize biodistribution, treatment efficacy, and effectiveness of an imagingagent ( Wang et al., 2020 ). Nanosystems must have access to target tissues. Typically, this is achieved by overcoming physiological or physical barriers in order to effectively reach target tissue cells and exert the intended function. Nanoparticles can beadministered by ), and the desired outcome should be matched by the administration route. Such routes include oral, nasal, parenteral, topical, transdermal, ocular, and pulmonary, among others. The route of nanopar-ticle administration greatly impacts both tissue distribution and the immuneeffects. Mucosal administration , such as that associated with oral, nasal, or rectal delivery, is generally linked to M cells that connect the MALT with themucosal microenvironment, and play a specific role in transcytosis ofmicrobes and particles. Nanocarriers administered through mucosal routeshave shown great potential for efficient mucosal vaccination Chen, & Chorny, of cholesterol- modified was administered intra-nasally and showed the capacityto enhance murine survival rates in response to tetanus and botulin299 Nanomaterials to target immunityneurotoxin tests Nanocarriers with mucodiffusive prop- erties have also been engineered to cross the mucus layer to reach the epithelium. A defined equilibrium among mucoadhesive and mucodiffusiveproperties is important for the efficacy of nanocarriers delivered using mucosalpathways. Mucodiffusion properties largely depend on particle size, whereparticle size should be smaller than mucus mesh size. Thus, the composition and physicochemical properties of the core material, size, and surface structure of nanoparticles are key determining factors for enhanced transport mecha-nisms across the mucosal surface ( Zhang, Gao, & Bao, ). includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutane- ous, intradermal, and intraperitoneal modes, which are used to administer nanoparticles to enter the systemic circulation, stay at the injection site,or travel to the nearest lymph node. Negatively-charged nanoparticles suchas liposomes, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles, e.g., PLGA are more easily drained into the lymphatic system when compared to positively- charged or neutral nanoparticles ( Kaminskas & Porter, 2011 ). Increased uptake into the lymphatics from the interstitium is due to electrostatic repul-sion between negatively-charged particles and the negative extracellular matrix ( Rao, Forrest, Alani, Kwon, & Robinson, 2010 ). Conversely, drain- age of cationic nanoparticles from the injection site to lymph nodes is slowdue to attractive forces among the particles and the extracellular matrix.Cationic nanoparticles are likely to form a repository after injection andto be taken up by outer and migratory APC or slowly drain to lymphatics ( Vicente, Goins, Sanchez, Alonso, & Phillips, 2014 ). Coating of nanocarriers with polyethylene glycol (PEG) can increase drainage intolymph nodes ( De Koker et al., 2016 ), and PEG or other hydrophilic poly- mers are often used to shield engineered nanoparticles from immune surveil- lance in in vivo applications However, it has also been reported that an immunocompetent host's immune system may be capable of producingPEG-specific antibodies after administration of PEG-coated liposomes( Ishida, Wang, Shimizu, Nawata, & Kiwada, 2007 ), so this approach may not necessarily be effective in subsequent administrations. Among parenteral routes, intravenous (IV) nanoparticle administration is the most commonly used because it provides a portal by which to access theentire body and nanoparticles are directly exposed to circulating immunecell components, and to the entire body's rich environment of proteins, cells, and tissues. Particle transport into tissues is dependent in part on the anatomy of blood vessel endothelium, as well as nanovehicle physical prop-erties ( Shah et al., 2018 ;Smith Taylor, & Smith,300 Romila Manchanda et al.2019 ). Lung and muscle capillaries display a continuous morphology and allow only small particles (i.e., typically less than /C243nm) to filter across the capillary wall. On the other hand, kidney (with blood vessel fenestratedendothelia), and liver tissues (with discontinuous endothelia having largerpores) can allow for transport of particles up to /C2460nm ( Almeida, Chen, Foster, & Drezek, 2011 ), but nanoparticles larger than 100 -200nm are more likely to accumulate in the spleen due to particle removal by splenic filtration (Cataldi, are likely not fixed and are reported heterogeneously acrossthe literature, perhaps in part because they such values are affected by other nanoparticle parameters than size such as surface coating, shape, and charge. Nanoparticle surface modification is an important factor when using the IV administration route. IV nanoparticle administration can stimulateimmune tolerance and offers potential ways to modulate immune cells and molecular components in the blood. An important additional consider- ation, however, is that the surface and size of the nanoparticles are ofteninfluenced by biological blood components. In blood, nanoparticles tendto adsorb a protein layer (termed the protein corona, composed of proteins like albumin, immunoglobulin, etc.) that can change their overall hydrody- namic size and surface charge, both of which are critical factors in determin-ing in vivo pharmacokinetics. The addition of the protein corona can alsoenhance agglomeration of nanoparticles and further lead to changes inhemodynamics and transport behaviors throughout the body. In addition, the presence of a protein corona can modify uptake mechanisms compared to those of bare nanoparticles, with nanoparticle-protein corona complexesmore readily undergoing phagocytosis in macrophages ( Corbo et al., 2016 ). This phenomenon occurs for example in cationic gold nanoparticles with a hydrophobic surface, which bind to serum proteins forming a protein corona and are then easily taken up by macrophages ( Saha et al., 2016 ). Various modification methods such as the use of PEG, polysaccharide moi-eties, and zwitter ions have been used to regulate protein corona formation ( Oh et al., 2018 ), but there is still much work that needs to be done in this field. Various nanodelivery systems have been formulated for the intra/subcel- lular localization of therapeutic agents. Internalization of nanoparticles typically involves endocytic mechanisms. Endocytosis encompasses at least two different cellular uptake routes: pinocytosis (uptake of fluids and small ves- icles) and (engulfment of particles larger than Pinocytosis macropinocytosis, as well are both dependent on actin and form protrusions at the cell membrane ( Kumari, Mg, & Mayor, 2010 ). Phagocytosis 2011 ), silica, TiO 2, and Fe 2O3nanomaterials, among others, have been employed to understand diffusion pathways across the cell membrane. Particle size, shape, charge, composition of nanoparticles, and hydrophobic-ity/hydrophilicity are some of the processing parameters governing theinternalization of nanoparticles. Modular multifunctional nanoparticles can be purposefully designed to enable stimulation of different responses, by carefully choosing the appropriate molecular components to obtaindesirable physiochemical properties for specific applications ( Smith & Gambhir, 2017 ). Nanoparticle size is a critical parameter in modulating the innate immune response. Several groups have studied the immunomodulatory properties ofpolystyrene nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 20 to 1000nm.There were significant differences in uptake between the smallest and the largest sizes. Lung DCs captured 20nm polystyrene particles more effec- tively compared to 1000nm particles ( Seydoux et al., 2014 ), whereas larger sized particles tended to be taken up by migratory DCs to the lung-draininglymph nodes ( Blank et al., 2013 ). The uptake of 20-nm particles enhanced antigen presentation to CD4+T cells. The shape of nanoparticles also has a significant role in interactions with the innate immune system ( Getts, Shea, Miller, & King, 2015 ). Bartneck and coworkers found that macrophages took up nanorods (15 /C250nm) more efficiently than 15nm or macropinocytosis ( al., ). Talamini et al. spherical (10 and 50nm), rod (60 /C230nm), and star-shaped (55nm). They found that spherical- and star-shaped goldnanoparticles accumulated in the same ratio in the liver, but star-shaped goldnanoparticles tended to accumulate more in the lungs ( Talamini et al., 2017 ). The enhanced surface hydrophobicity of polymeric particles improves internal- ization into DCs and increases the expression of CD86 in DC populations( Liu et al., 2013 ). Surface charge also plays a critical role in the interactions between innate immune cell components and nanoparticles. Cationic gold nanoparticles are more easily internalized by macrophages and DCs compared to negatively- charged particles due electrostatic between302 Romila et al.positively-charged (Fytianos et al., 2017 ). However, a protein corona on the nanoparticles can mask surface charges and influence targeting ability, thus hindering the bio-logical efficacy of targeted nanoparticles. 2.3 Nanoimmunotargeting One of the critical advantages of nanosystems is the ability to actively targetthem to increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce off-target toxicity. Actively-targeted nanosystems can be developed by surface functionalization ofnanocarriers with bioactive ligands. These nanosystems can identify tissues or cells that have molecular patterns/receptors at their surface, accelerating subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis of the nanoformulation. Thisnanoparticle surface modification is an effective tool that can enhance inter-actions of the nanosystem with a specific population(s) of immune cells. Surface modification of nanoparticles with ligands may be attained via Michael addition, a biotin -streptavidin method, or a carbodiimide 2017 ). Antibody-targeted nanoparticles are an exam- ple of how these modifications are capable of improving antitumor immunity (Schmid et al., 2017 ). TGF is a major mediator of immunosuppression and T cell signaling, and is dysregulated in cancer. PLGA nanoparticles loaded withthe inhibitor TGF receptor 1 were specifically bind to CD8 +T cells by conjugating anti-CD8a F(ab')2 fragments to the particle surface. Theaccumulation of TGF inhibitor at the target site resulted in delayed tumor growth and improved survival ( Schmid et al., 2017 ). Macrophages are involved in a variety of diseases and disorders including inflammation, metabolic disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, andcancer, making them an attractive therapeutic target. Many other cellular and molecular immune system components have also been targeted. In the case of autoimmune disorders, gold nanoparticles loaded with auto-antigens such as ITE have been used to target antigen-presenting cells suchas DCs, and to induce the differentiation of Tregs, to decreased autoimmunity ( Serra & taken upby DCs and promote FoxP3 +Treg differentiation. This approach has been shown to be effective against mouse models of autoimmune encephalomy- elitis and type 1 diabetes ( Neef & Nadeau, Burns, Weiner, & Quintana, 2012 ). Lipid nanoparticles have also been used for targeted delivery of siRNA to inflammatory monocytes in order to303 Nanomaterials to target immunitydownregulate chemokine expression that monocytic tissue localization ( Leuschner et al., 2011 ). 2.4 Rational nanodrug design Rational design of nanomedicines can endow advantageous features, such asimproved efficacy and safety compared to conventional therapeutics, crea- tion of versatile agents with multifunctional applications (such as simulta-neous real-time imaging, targeting, and treatment), and utilization asmolecular biomarkers. Although solid tumors and antimicrobials remain a critical target for nanodrugs, research is also rapidly gearing toward applica- tions in metabolic, neurological and autoimmune al., 2020 ;Ventola, 2017 ). Nanoscale platforms can help overcome some of the physicochemical and biological barriers for conventional pharmaceuticals, such as poor aqueous solubility (e.g., cyclosporin), ( Patra et 2018 ). Formulating a drug in a properly-designed nanoscale cargo can increaseits circulation half-life and enhance target delivery. Additionally, controlled drug release can reduce the required dosage and minimize the need for repeated administrations, which is especially advantageous in inflamma-tory conditions. Lowering the dose while maintaining efficacy results in anincreased therapeutic index for nanosc ale drugs. Another area where nanodrug design can prove useful is for low molecular weight drugs ( <55kDa), including vasoactive intestinal peptide, which are otherwise rapidly cleared in blood cir- culation via renal clearance. Nanoformulations of these drugs have enhancedbioavailability and pharmacological activity, and slowed clearance kinetics( Many have the added advantage of bypassing membrane drug efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein, which are upregulated in cancer cells and lead to multidrug resistance. Nevertheless, there are still challenges in nanodrug design that need to be overcome in order to facilitate clinical translation. It is crucial to study how the physiological and bioactive properties of nanodrugs differ from parentdrug-only forms, and the subsequent impact and potential clinical signifi-cance of those differences. In addition, nanodrugs must overcome biologicalbarriers such as opsonization followed by sequestration by mononuclear phagocytes, distribution in endo-lysosomes, nonspecific distribution in the vascular system, pressure gradients, and drug efflux pumps among others( Blanco, Shen, & Ferrari, 2015 ).304 Romila Manchanda et al.3. Nanoimmunotherapy applications Given the extensive and complex role the immune system plays in different disease states, there are several potential applications for nanoimmunotherapy. These applications span diverse areas such as cancer,cardiovascular disease, central nervous system disorders, diabetes, infection,and autoimmune disease, among others. 3.1 Nanoimmunotherapy applications: Cancer Cancer is a multifaceted disease of the genome that occurs in part due to thefailure of the immune response to recognize cancer cells as a threat and elim- inate them. These malignant cells are able to escape immune surveillance by stimulating various tumor-associated mechanisms, including reduction ofMHC I fragments, reduction in tumor antigen production, defective deathreceptor signaling, reduction of co-stimulation, and production of 2016 ). Conventional cancer regimens including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have well-characterized intrinsiclimitations. Prognosis and treatment selection are mainly determined by diagnosis, and these treatment approaches are often not sufficiently spe- cific to cancer tissue. Additionally, these conventional therapies can affectthe body's ability to fight the tumor. For instance, most chemotherapeuticagents can cause depression of the immune system, which leads to a decreasein available antitumor immune components. The goal of immunotherapy, on the other hand, is to promote an approach in which the body's own immune system is an active participant in cancer management. The goalis to unleash the inherent power of the immune system to attack cancer cellscontinuously and dynamically, while sparing healthy cells. The immune sys- tem has the potential to detect, attack, and continuously monitor abnormal growth, resulting in a prolonged and reliable mechanism of action.Moreover, immune system memory can offer long-term protection in caseof re-occurrence. In general, there are three prerequisites for cancer immunotherapeutic strategy success, not necessarily simultaneous. First, cancer antigens shouldbe effectively escorted to immune cells such as DCs. Second, the anticancerimmune response should be initiated after delivery of the therapeutic sup- plement (adjuvant) and cancer antigen. Lastly, it is important to consider that immunosuppressive T cells such as Tregs and myeloid cells such as305 Nanomaterials to target immunitymyeloid-derived suppressor cells can suppress the activity of anticancer T-effector cells and thereby create an immunosuppressive veil throughout the cancer; therefore, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironmentmust often be modified to improve immunotherapeutic success. Treg-targeting nanoparticles can be engineered to circumvent this tumor immu-nosuppressive microenvironment; for instance, a checkpoint blockade such as CTLA-4, which mediates immunosuppression by decreasing immune sig- naling activity, can be utilized to control the activity of Tregs ( Ou et al., 2018 ; Sacchetti et al., 2013 ). In the tumor microenvironment, MDSC generate various factors such as cytokines (interleukin-10 (IL-10)), which facilitates the production and activation of Tregs. Therapeutic efficacy can be improved by adding combinational treatments, such as chemotherapy, at appropriatetimes ( Emens & Middleton, 2015 ). Various types of cancer immunotherapies have shown promising clinical outcomes. These include checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and CTLA4 inhibition), cytokine-based therapies (including interferons,interleukins, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor),engineered T cells like chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) and T cell receptor (TCR) T cells, agonistic and antagonistic antibodies (which target inhibitory or stimulatory receptors), and cancer vaccines. Cytokine-basedtherapies such as IL-2 can impact both T cells and Tregs. These therapiescan either cause death of stimulated T cells or induce immune toleranceand promote Treg growth, thus potentially leading to inhibition of unwanted autoimmune responses ( Milling, Zhang, & Irvine, 2017 ). Approaches utiliz- ing CAR T Cells and TCR T cells require only a single administration andsome have resulted in extended patient survival. Nevertheless, there are ongo-ing efforts to design CAR T cells that can target diverse antigens despite concerns about cost and side effects ( O'Rourke et al., 2017 ;Schuster et al., 2017). Another promising field is that of cancer vaccines. Some existing can- cer vaccines have been formulated based on DCs, nucleic acids (DNA, RNAand such as mRNA), and neo-antigens, which are a type of tumor-specific antigens (TSA) that arise from altered DNA in cancerous cells. In the vaccine field, studies show that antigen valency (i.e., number of binding sites) impactsthe types of B cell responses and the magnitude of the response, with highvalency enhancing effector differentiation ( Kato et al., 2020 ). A variety of nano-based methodologies can be used to enhance the compre- hensive application of cancer immunotherapy and refine its action. For example, nano-based cancer vaccines have been employed in order to pre-sent tumor-associated antigens (TAA) to APC (DC) and to facilitate specific306 Romila Manchanda et al.cytotoxic T cell and antibody responses. Diverse studies published over the past 10 years show that typically less than 1% of the administered nanopar- ticle dose actually reaches malignant tissue ( Wilhelm et al., 2016 ), empha- sizing the importance of rational design to maximize dose delivery andefficacy. Recently, simultaneous delivery of tumor-specific antigens(TSAs), adjuvant (3-O-desacyl-4 0-monophosphoryl lipid A), and DDA (dimethyldioctadecylammonium, used as a cell invasion moiety) was achieved mice treated with this formulation showedimproved immune response and survival, with tumor growth reduction. Co-delivery of engineered cancer-specific antigen (OVA) and adjuvants in the context of CpG or toll-like receptors using micelles and liposomeshas also shown better immunogenic activity compared to a conventionaltherapeutic approach ( Wilson et al., 2013 ). Liposomal delivery platforms have commonly been used as nanoimmunotherapeutic (CpG, anti-PD-1 and CpG, TGF- , IL-2 and in tumor preclinical studies (Fan et al., 2017 ;Lu et al., 2016 ;Xu, Wang, Zhang, & Huang, 2014 ), and the sheer number of available clinical liposomal formulations suggest nanoimmunotherapeutic liposomal formulations bear watching for regula- tory trials and approvals in the near future. Nanosystems can also be used in biomimetic approaches, in which the nanosystem is designed to elicit an immune response by mimicking a keyaspect of immune biology. For instance, synthetic artificial antigen- presenting cells (sAPCs) are artificial systems that include T-cell stimulating molecules attached to their surface and thereby mimic APCs. The use ofsAPCs is a possible alternative to conventional adoptive T cell therapy, sincethese synthetic particles have the capability to present multiple signals to activate T cells ( Kosmides et al., 2017 ), potentially without some of the lim- itations. In the treatment of multiple melanoma (MM), limitations associatedwith clinically successful CAR- and bispecific-T cell engagers (BiTEs)include difficulty in targeting multiple cancer antigens, short half-lives (2h), and high cost for clinical formulations. Alternatively, a nano-based lipo- somal system conjugated with two antibodies (nanoBiTE) was developed toidentify the epitope on MM and to engage T cells. Multispecific T cellengager nanoliposomes (nanoMuTE) were also developed to target more thanone epitope and engage T cells ( Alhallak et al., 2020 ). Nano-based vehicles can be employed to improve the delivery of mRNA and neoantigen vaccines to target sites, and nanoformulation versa-tility allows for surface modifications and combinational approaches , which can307 Nanomaterials to target immunityhelp induce immunogenicity and enhance therapeutic efficacy in tumors treated by immunotherapy. For instance, combining nanoimmunotherapy with other therapies such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or phototherapycan enhance treatment outcomes and reduce the toxicities involved in eachtherapy. Like other combination treatments, combinational nanoapproachescan take advantage of the beneficial effects of two or more treatment mech- anisms; the difference is that by using nanoapproaches, the multiple treat- ment mechanisms can be packaged into one nanosystem made possible bythe versatility and multifunctionality of nanodesign. For example, to lever-age the effects of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, a PDL1 antibody and gemcitabine-loaded polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel net- work was prepared to degrade in response to radical oxygen species withinthe tumor microenvironment. Murine models of B16F10 melanoma and4T1 breast carcinoma were treated with the hydrogel formulations. Results showed that the hydrogel degraded and released the chemothera- peutic drug, as well as the anti-PDL1 antibody, resulting in a synergisticeffect and increased anticancer immunity compared to nonencapsulateddrugs, as indicated by bioluminescence imaging ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Another example of nano-based cancer immunotherapy is the combination the and oxaliplatin showed a synergistic effect in reducing tumor growth compared to free nanoparticles or oxaliplatin alone. The authors showed that CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and activated DCs weresignificantly increased inside the tumor, and suggest that oxaliplatin maysupport an immunologically \"cold\" tumor becoming \"hot\" and thus suscep- tible to LDP therapy ( Song et al., 2018 ). Besides chemotherapy, another example of a combinational approach is nanoimmunotherapy agents plus phototherapy. Phototherapy can be used incancer treatment by two different strategies: photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). These methods use a specific wavelength of light to stimulate light-sensitive molecules and initiate a specific therapeu-tic effect. PTT uses a light-absorbing material whose light-induced temper-ature increase results in tissue ablation. PDT requires light sources, aphotosensitizer and oxygen. The photosensitizer may be in active form or in prodrug form when administered. When the active photosensitizer is irra- diated with light of a specific wavelength, it creates reactive oxygen species308 Romila Manchanda et al.(ROS) that are cytotoxic to the surrounding environment. Combination platforms (nanoimmunotherapy + PTT) were developed using PLGA and After NIR irradiation, HAuNS generated a PTTeffect in the tumor and simultaneously released APP ( Luo et al., 2018 ). These combinations of phototherapy and nano-based delivery systems are particularly beneficial for inhibition of metastatic tumors that are close to the skin surface or near the surface of other fiber-accessible sites, since lightpenetration in deeper areas is limited even at longer wavelengths. 3.2 Nanoimmunotherapy applications: Cardiovascular disease Despite extensive developments and progress in cure and prevention, heartdisease continues to be the highest collective cause of mortality in the United States in the developed world ( WHO, 2017 ). Heart disease includes a spectrum of disorders with various etiologies and presentations includingcongenital heart disease, ischemic disease, valvular disorders, inflammatorydisease, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy, which may collectively result in congestive heart failure. The main cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is atherosclerosis, which is a multifaceted inflammatory disorder with thicken-ing and plaque formation within the intimal layer of arterial vessels, poten-tially associated ( Ference et al., 2017 ). Abnormal thickening and plaque accumulation can lead to vessel occlusion and irregular flow patterns. Thrombosis, the formation of a clot within a blood vessel, is a potentially fatal consequence of atherosclerosisbecause plaques that have built up over time can rupture and elicit a clottingresponse, leading to vessel occlusion and tissue injury or necrosis. Given the potentially severe consequences of atherosclerosis, plaque development has been extensively studied. Growth of atherosclerotic lesions can lead to thedevelopment of new blood vessels inside the in a manner similar to the progression of cancerous tumors. Monocyte recruitment, mac- rophage accumulation, and B cells in the vessel wall play key roles in plaquedevelopment, so immunotherapy is likely able to impact these processes andprovide an approach to prevention and/or treatment. Importantly, how- ever, the toxicity of immunomodulatory drugs should be considered, which could limit therapeutic applicatio ns in heart disease treatments ( Bringhen et al., 2018) due to side effects such as arrhythmias. Nanoimmunotherapeutic309 Nanomaterials to target immunityapproaches can provide an avenue to target therapy site- and cell-specifically and thereby diminish these concerns ( Dutta et al., 2012 ). Therapeutic approaches such as reducing low-density lipoproteins (LDL), using antithrombotic drugs, and aggressive revascularization methodshave been employed against atherosclerosis ( Arnett et al., 2019 ). Two statin clinical trials (JUPITER and ASTEROID) showed remarkable control over CVD, but controlling lipid levels to achieve a sustained treatment effect has proven difficult. Novel nanomaterials that can be combined with immuno-therapy are being designed to optimize targeting and develop site-specificinterventions in cardiac disease. A multifaceted approach, made possible by combining nanotechnology with immunotherapy, may best address the variety of mechanisms that contribute to plaque development and resultingmorbidity/mortality. Nanomaterial design and selection must consider sev-eral factors including the type, function, and role of immune cells in the pathological microenvironment, and how each cell contributes to the pro- gression of disease. Monocyte and macrophage targeting offer a distinctiveopportunity to modulate inflammatory disease. Nanodrugs that specifi-cally target macrophages pro-inflammatory activities and athero-protective effect ( Cervadoro et al., 2018 ). One example involves lowering serum levels of LDL with statins in combination with nanosystemsto immunomodulate plaque-resistant cells. E- and CCL3) in plaque macrophages decreased et al., 2015 ). A novel macrophage-specific nano- immunotherapy was recently developed to clear atherosclerosis, and efficacy was demonstrated in several murine atherosclerosis models ( Flores et al., 2020 ). This \"Trojan horse system\" (SWNT-SHP1i), which very selectively localized single walledcarbon phagocytosis (M ) in murine models, decreased inflammation based on scRNA-seq studies, and showed no off-target toxicity based on a varietyof evaluations including histology, clinical blood panels, and phenotypic observations. Numerous studies have also investigated anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches to reduce macrophage growth in plaques, such as a et al., 2014 ). Integrating radiolabeling with targeted nanoimmunotherapy of atherosclerosis can help reveal mechanisms of plaqueformation and the role of immune cells therein. Real-time imaging can reportthickening of the vessel wall, inflammation, and propagation ( Calcagno, ;Herbin et al., 2016 ). In the last few decades, as our understanding of the pathogenic mecha- nisms has improved, efforts to design advanced cardiovascular disease treat-ments have shifted to include not only lipid management strategies, but particularly the inflammatory underpinnings of disease, and to better under- stand the role of immune cells and inflammatory modulators in disease pro-gression, particularly in atherosclerosis. The use of nanoimmunotherapythus represents a more holistic, overarching strategy compared with the increasingly antiquated notion of lipid management as the sole treatment approach. Nanosystems provide opportunities for theranostic approachesto thrombosis management, as they can potentially be used for thrombusimaging as well as for delivery of therapeutics or even prevention of throm- bus formation. For example, a lipopeptide nanosystem for combined antithrombotic therapy and fibrin-targeted imaging (using an NIR fluores-cent dye coupled with boronate antioxidant polymer) was developed toinhibit thrombus formation and visualize atherosclerotic plaque. Thrombusformation is related to the presence of hydrogen peroxide which promotes platelet aggregation ( Ambrosio, Tritto, & Golino, 1997 nanosystem derived its efficacy through inhibition of hydrogen peroxidegeneration, serving as an anti-inflammatory et al., 2017 ). In summary, CVD therapeutic strategies increasingly lean on our improved understanding of the underlying inflammatory processes includ-ing the broad role of the immune system; because of these close links, there istremendous potential for nanoimmunotherapeutic treatment of atheroscle- rosis and thrombosis. Further development of nano-based systems combined with immunotherapy will likely help create effective site-specific therapeu-tic modalities that can also reduce off-target effects. 3.3 Nanoimmunotherapy applications: Central nervous system The central nervous system (CNS) comprises the brain and the spinal cord.CNS diseases include a broad spectrum of disorders in which brain or spinal311 Nanomaterials to target immunitycord function is diminished or impaired, resulting in diminished motor, sen- sory, or cognitive performance. The etiologies vary, including but not lim- ited to genetic disorders, infection, stroke, neurodegenerative conditions,brain tumors, trauma, and many other potential sources of damage toCNS structures. One of the most common issues with pharmacologicalmanagement of CNS disorders is the existence of natural barriers to molec- ular transport into the CNS. The three major arachnoid them, the BBB is the major concern for conventionalIV-injected treatments due to the restrictions presented by tight junctions between endothelial cells, permitting very limited penetration to even small molecules. In particular, the BBB limits transport of peripheral circulatingimmune components ( Takeshita & Ransohoff, 2012 ). Special challenges may exist for immunotherapy in CNS treatment because of the scarcity of lymphatic structures in the CNS, and because of what is traditionally known as \"immune privilege,\" i.e., a protective mechanism that minimizesthe chance of CNS inflammation through the ability to tolerate the presenceof antigens without eliciting an immune response ( Louveau, Harris, & Kipnis, 2015). However, some of these concepts are currently being reevaluated based on the presence of resident antigen-presenting cells CNS includingastrocytes, microglia, ;Schetters, Gomez-Nicola, Garcia-Vallejo, & Van Kooyk, 2018 ). Recent evidence also suggests the existence of meningeal lym- phatic vessels, which permit communication between the CNS and the immune system ( Schetters et al., 2018 ). Although the brain has limited lym- phatic vessels in the meninges, these can allow antigens to sink into the cervicallymph nodes, and T cells can be activated there and reach the brain paren- chyma through the cerebrospinal fluid ( McGranahan, 2017 ). Treatment approaches targeting the CNS must consider both transport through the BBB and the unique characteristics of local immune responses.Various delivery strategies have been employed to bypass the BBB and reach the all display inherent lim- itations. Nanomedicine has the potential to improve therapeutic agentdelivery via rational design to tailor size and surface characteristics, so thateffective transport across the BBB is achieved. Nanoparticles that have been proven to cross the BBB include lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, carbon nanotubes, and dendrimers,where In this review, we focus on immunotherapy-based interventions to particularly address CNS cancers, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Gliomas comprise a main cancer of the CNS, with origins in the glial cells that account for 1% -2% of all types of cancers. The most common type of glioma is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Glioblastomas are highly aggressive and spread fast due to their rapid cell replication and ability to induce immunosuppression by, for example, tumor cell-secreted immuno-suppressive factors. One potential approach to treat glioblastomas, amongmany other cancers, is by reversing immunosuppression. As previously dis- cussed, an immunosuppressive environment is characteristic of tumors, but the immunosuppressive capabilities of glioblastomas ( Perng & Lim, 2015 ) are enhanced by CNS barriers to transport as well as vigorous cytokine pro-duction. Various nano-based immunotherapies including CAR-T cells, and checkpoint inhibitors have been employed. One example of glioma-focused nanoimmunotherapy comprises targeted PD-1 and CTLA-4 protein anti-bodies and antibodies specific to the transferrin receptor to facilitate BBBtransport. This nanosystem applied checkpoint inhibitors to shut down mac- rophages and Treg cells, which had acted as a tumor-protective \"shield\" against other immune cells. The resulting activation of cancer-destroyingcells (e.g., lymphocytes and microglia) yielded enhanced survival ( Galstyan et al., 2019 ). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a permanent form of dementia that results in a typically gradual decrease in an individual's cognitive abilities. It is espe- cially prevalent with aging, and remains a major global health concern.Multiple hypotheses regarding its pathogenesis exist, but we still do not fullyunderstand the molecular processes that trigger and perpetuate the disease. Two key known processes in AD include the formation of amyloid plaques as a result of the -amyloid (A ) cascade, and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of abnormal tau ( ) protein; however, neither process fully describes the AD mechanism ( Bloom, 2014 ). Initially, immu- notherapy research in AD focused on targeting and clearing A using nano-based and other strategies, but attention has more recently shifted totheprotein, as the formation of neurofibrillary tangles seems to correlate with cognitive Dickson, 2019 ). Nevertheless, cau- sation remains unclear. Active and passive immunotherapies have eliminated the deposition of A plaques and target tau proteins, with very limited clinical success thus far ( Bittar, Sengupta, & Kayed, 2018 ). While the greatest advances in AD will undoubtedly emerge as mechanistic understanding improves, new313 Nanomaterials to target immunitydevelopments in nanoimmunotherapy may provide an opportunity to over- come some of the aforementioned challenges of traditional immunotherapy, by exploiting features such as controlled antigen release, lack of need for otheradjuvants, and reduction in immunization numbers. Liposomes {(1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and choline (Chol)}coated with antibody (A -monoclonal antibody) showed high stability and targeting to A 42and were developed as a potential proof of concept for AD treatment. However, the study was done ex vivo in post-mortem tissue.A-monoclonal antibody (MAb) liposomes were found to bind amyloid deposits and enhance amyloid clearance ( Canovi et al., 2011 ). Immune- modulating nano-strategies to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs to inflamma- tory sites may also have therapeutic potential in AD. Since BBB permeabilitycan be improved K16ApoE onto PLGA-chitosan nanoparticles improved the permeability of nanoparticlesacross the BBB, and the system showed high affinity to bind amyloid plaques( Ahlschwede et al., 2019 ). These studies are preclinical and measured no cog- nitive outcomes, so they provide only a proof of concept of the strategy, but not an indication of therapeutic significance. Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disease stemming from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. While the causesare not well-understood, recent findings suggest roles of certain proteins (such as -synuclein) and immune cells (such as DCs, microglia, T cells, and B cells) in the pathogenesis or progression of the disorder ( Jiang, Li, Xu, Gao, & Chen, 2018 ). To date, the available treatments, such as dopa- mine replacement strategies, only seek to ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson's. This approach is effective in the early stages, but loses efficacy over time and has many undesirable long-term side effects. Current PDimmunotherapy approaches are based on two strategies: (i) targeting - synuclein and (ii) employing the neuroprotective properties of regulatory cells. Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles carrying alpha-synuclein RNAi plasmid can inhibit -synuclein synthesis and reduce neuron apoptosis, with some functional improvement of locomotion in a mouse model ( Niu et al., 2017 ). Because overexpression of -synuclein results in significant microglial activation, and suppressing microglial activation can reduce neural degeneration ( Allen Reish & Standaert, 2015 ), there is a clear connection of this approach to modulation of the immune response that characterizespathological inflammation in PD. More broadly, granulocyte-macrophage314 Romila sargramostim) can modulate microglial neurotoxicity and may be effective in treating many neurological disorders (Gendelman et al., 2017 ). The potential for combination of Parkinson- specific approaches with a nanosystem in order to bypass the BBB and targetmicroglia is an interesting direction to explore, as research shows thatmicroglia uptake nanoparticles by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, 2016 ). Although nanoimmunotherapy for CNS disorders remains in the very early stages of development, there appears to be much promise in the poten- tial for multifunctional nanoagents to enhance CNS delivery and address immune-related responses. Those responses that generate or perpetuateCNS damage (e.g., inflammatory cascades) could be inhibited, and responsesthat help detect or minimize damage (such as the immune's system ability to fight glioma cells) could be enhanced. 3.4 Nanoimmunotherapy applications: Autoimmune disorders and diabetes In autoimmune disorders, the immune system generally identifies autolo- gous proteins/molecules as \"non-self\" antigens, and starts producing autoreactive T cell and B cell clones ( Rosenblum, Gratz, Paw, & Abbas, 2012 ). Since co-stimulation is essential for T cell activation, interrupting co-stimulatory pathways is one potential therapeutic route ( Barranco, 2016 ;Maxwell & Singh, 2010 ). Treg therapy is another approach to suppress pathological immune responses directed at self-antigens which characterize autoimmune diseases. Allergen-specific immunotherapy and manipulationof the IL-2 pathway have also been employed. A limitation of these treat-ments is that they carry a high risk of systematic immune suppression, and there is still a lack of biological knowledge of molecular pathways for acti- vation of Tregs. Another important consideration in the treatment of auto-immune disorders is that patients are usually prescribed nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressive drugs. There are major biological limitations associated with these medications, including the fact that their transport in physiological fluids is negatively impacted by theirhydrophobicity, their cell uptake is nonspecific, and they also have intrinsicside effects with long-term treatments. Considering both the role of the immune system and the required adjuvant medication, nano-mediated immunotherapy could provide a way to support immunosuppression against315 Nanomaterials to target immunityoveractive autoimmune diseases, while also protecting encapsulated drugs from degradation with increased half-life and enhanced delivery to target cells. Various nanobiomaterials have been used to overcome immune dys-regulation by immunosuppressing autoreactive T cells through modulationof the ( Feng et al., 2019 ). Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the body's ability to process blood sugar is impaired. In healthy individuals, insulin secreted by pancreatic cells regulates blood sugar levels. Individuals with diabetes are either unable toproduce insulin due to cell damage (type 1 diabetes, T1D), or have acquired insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes, T2D). The immune system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. T1D is an autoimmune disease that is both T-cell based (autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells spe-cific to cells) and B cell based (loss of tolerance by autoreactive B cells), and causes continuous damage to cells (recognized as autoantigens) in pancre- atic islets include islet transplantations and glucose level maintenance byinsulin administration, which are limited by either being invasive or requir-ing patience compliance and continuous monitoring. Although historically it was believed that only T1D was autoimmune-related, new evidence indi- cates that T2D also displays autoimmune features with chronic, low-gradeinflammation (LGI) and involvement of T-cell populations including Tregs( de Candia et al., 2019 ). Management of T2D also requires patient compli- ance and continued monitoring for successful outcomes. Innovative approaches to diabetes treatment have recently been devel- oped by leveraging emerging knowledge of the immunological mechanismsassociated with autoimmunity. For instance, Treg induction or DC modu-lation can be used to suppress inflammation and reverse autoimmunity ( Mukherjee & Dilorenzo, 2010 ). The main focus is on reducing the damaging autoimmune reaction against cells, thereby arresting T1D development. A variety of antigens for autoimmune reversal have been studied, including B, and proinsulin C-peptide ( Han, Donelan, Wang, Reeves, & Yang, 2013 ;Yang et al., 2014 ). However, these methods are limited by poor targeting and imprecise intracellular delivery to specificcells. Nano-mediated immunotherapy approaches to T1D management pri- marily focus on controlling and modulating immune cells and suppressing autoreactive cells by modulating the cytokine microenvironment APCs. Nano-based systems have the capacity for utilizing multiple loaded pharmacological molecules to modulate APCs; surface modifications can also be introduced to customize in vivoproperties and behavior. For instance, non-viral siRNA based were to pancreatic (CD11b+macro- phages and DCs), yielding improved Treg activation of lipid/Alox15 siRNA-treated NOD mice Leconet, Petit, Peraldi-Roux, & Bresson, ). Polymeric nanoparticles shown potential in ing autoimmune T1D. PLGA nanoparticles loaded with -cell antigens were tested for reversing the destruction of cells in diabetic mice. Tolerance was restored by inducing Tregs to suppress activated diabetogenic CD4 and CD8 molecules (AhR) ligand ITE) wastested in a T1D mouse model, and showed decreased activation of inflamma- tory effector T cells and increased differentiation of FoxP3+ cells ( Yeste et al., 2016 treat T1D-associated (and now even T2D-associated) autoimmunity has opened new avenues for ther-apies in diabetes, but more research is needed to understand diabetes in terms of its pathogenesis, mechanisms, autoreactive T cell targets, and antigen identification. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurodegenerative condition with no curative therapy. Destruction and demyelination of axons in theCNS lead to impaired nerve signaling and play a central role in MS progres- sion. Although several FDA-approved drugs can help slow disease progres- sion and relapse, myelin destruction can make even challenging( Ojha & Kumar, 2018 ). Lipid-based nanosystems such as liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles have shown promising therapeutic results. PEGylated solid lipid nanoparticles were modified with axoglial glycoprotein antigens (either anti-contactin-2 or anti-neurofascin) and used to successfully delivermethylprednisolone to the brain in mice ( Chountoulesi & Demetzos, 2020 ; Gandomi et al., 2017 ). These antigens are important targets of autoimmune reaction in MS. More recently, a phase 2 clinical study using gold nano- crystals (CNM Au8) from Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. showed signs of robustremyelination and an improvement in murine motor function ( Robinson et al., 2020 ). The nanocatalytic activity of gold nanocrystals employed adenine dinucleotide hydride oxida- tion, which such as myelination.317 Nanomaterials to target immunity3.5 Nanoimmunotherapy applications: Infectious diseases Immunomodulatory have been used to inhibit or attack bac- teria or viruses and treat their associated infections, including therapies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, encephalitis, hep-atitis, Ebola, pneumonia, etc. ( Deng et al., 2018 ;Draz, Wang, Chen, Xu, & Shafiee, 2017 ;Liu et al., ;Vetro et al., et al., 2017 ). Vaccines specific to antigenic bacterial constituents are often used instead of entire microbes in order to enhance immune efficiency, such as protein-based vaccines against Haemophilus influenza type b, diphtheria, or tetanus;still, adjuvants are generally required in association with these antigens toactivate the immune system. DNA vaccines against infectious diseases have shown limited promise for clinical application due to their low effectiveness as well as their safety concerns. In contrast, nano-based systems such asliposomal nanovaccines show strong efficacy antigens and adjuvants to immune cells with improved delivery efficiency, and can be engineered for slow, controlled release of antigen,further increasing APC exposure time and requiring less frequent adminis-tration. Controlled delivery of vaccine/drug from nanoparticles is a desirable approach to design therapeutic strategies against a range of infectious diseases. Nano-based systems can be used to regulate the immune system and may also have germicidal properties. For example, silver nanoparticles display immunostimulatory properties and intrinsic HIV inhibition. Modified silver nanorods have been prepared using PEG or polyvinylpyrrolidone to increaseIgG response and T cell production against HIV ( Liu, Balachandran, Li, Shao, & Jiang, 2016 ). In another study, peptide-based anti-HIV DNA- vaccine-loaded nanofibers were shown to be effectively internalized by APCs, because DNA condensed into nanovectors was protected from deg- radation, thus enhancing DNA entry into cells and vaccine activity ( Tian et al., 2014 ). Nanoimmunotherapy developments present important oppor- tunities to improve disease management in the fight against HIV. HIV destroys the host's immune cells (mainly CD4+and macrophages), and con- ventional therapies such as active antiretroviral therapy can control but typ-ically not remove the virus, so treatment is often lifelong and may causeundesirable side effects, such as damage to the liver and immune system. The ability to modulate immune response while reducing off-target effects is an important characteristic of a nanoimmunotherapy approach.318 Romila Manchanda et al.Cell-mimicking nanoparticles have also been exploited to enhance perfor- mance in complex biological environments, for instance by cloaking nanomaterials with natural cell membranes such as that of RBCs, platelets,and WBCs, thereby minimizing undesirable interactions with immune sys-tem components by fooling them ( Fang, Kroll, Gao, & Zhang, 2018 ). One such nanosystem endowed with anti-HIV properties consisted of PLGA nanoparticles coated with CD4+ T cell plasma membranes. This nano- system specifically bound HIV envelop glycoprotein 120, inhibiting viralinfection ( Wei et al., 2018 ). Researchers have also utilized the intrinsic adju- vant properties of nanoparticles against other viruses, such as the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. For instance, poly ( -glutamic acid) ( PGA)-chitosan nanogel has been applied as an adjuvant against H1N1 influenza virus toinduce virus-specific T cell memory. This adjuvant system was more effec-tive than aluminum compound, a well-known human vaccine adjuvant ( Yang et al., 2017 ). Inorganic and polymeric nanovaccines for delivery of antigen and/or adjuvants have also been designed with improved anti-bacterial infection Pati, Shevtsov, ideal for nanovaccine formulation due to their biocompatibility, ease of preparation, and adjuvant activity. A glycoconjugate-based gold nanovaccine loaded withT-helper OVA stimulated the specific IgG antibody-dependent immuneresponse in S. pneumonia in mice al., 2017 ). Polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles have produced fairly strong host immune responses against tuberculosis ( Bekale et al., 2019 ). Stimulation of APCs using 1,3- -glucan, i.e., curdlan has been explored using various nanoparticles. one study, a1,3--glucan adsorbed chitosan shell, a rifampicin-loaded PLGA core multifunctional immunomodulatory nanosystem was designed to stimulate ROS and cytokine production. Results showed that these multifunctional nanoparticles promoted ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines in humanmacrophages, These studies show that -glucan coated nanoparticles are able to stimulate APCs, but further studies in cells infectedwith M. tuberculosis are required. Pore-forming toxins (PFT), a key virulent component of bacteria, can be eliminated using polymeric nanoparticles. In these studies, RBC membrane vesicles on PLGA usedto remove ), with the PLGA319 Nanomaterials to target immunitynanoparticles providing mechanical stability to these membrane vesicles. A variety of PLGA-RBC membrane sponges have been employed for PFT neu- tralization, which has been effective against , Nanoimmunotherapy translation 4.1 Nanoimmunotherapy: From bench to clinic The principle underlying the combination of nanomedicine and immuno- therapy is the ability to leverage n anomaterial interactions with the immune system in a manner that maximiz es therapeutic efficacy, function- ality, and specificity of these combine d approaches. Ultimately, the goals of a therapeutic strategy are regulatory app roval, clinical translation, and bed- side deployment with high efficacy and low side effects. While many entities show benefits preclinically , few formulations ultimately succeed in clinical trials. Currently, many o ngoing and completed clinical trials are exploring nanoimmunotherapeutics such as metallic and polymericnanoparticles, with varied degrees of s uccess as we describe in this section. An important consideration when deve loping nanoimmunotherapeutics, as with any therapeutic agent, is that systems using FDA-approved mate- rials are likely to more rapidly and successfully translate from the bench tothe clinic, as their biodistributions and toxicity profiles have been extensivelystudied. Most formulations that have advanced into clinical trials employ FDA-approved materials such as lipids or polymers incorporated in vari- ous configurations of liposomal and polymeric nanoparticles. Examples ofmaterials used in nano-based delivery systems for clinical translation includeFDA-approved polymers such ). Many efforts of nanoimmunotherapy focus on cancer treatment. Liposomal immunotherapeutics for cancer applications currently in clinical trials include Lipovaxin-MM vaccine for DC targeting in stage IVmelanoma ( Gargett et al., 2018 ), DepoVax (DPX) containing the tumor antigen survivin and focused on ovarian cancer ( Berinstein et al., 2015 ), and OncoVAX (Id/IL-2) T cell in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab and radiotherapy for treating prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and rectal cancer ( Bonvalot et al., 2017 ). Stimuvax\u00ae, another liposomal based system designed to stimulate the T-cell mediated immune response against cancer cells that overex-press Mucin 1 (MUC-1), underwent three worldwide phase III clinical trials: START (Stimulating Targeted Antigenic Responses to NSCLC), INSPIRE (Stimuvax \u00aetrial In Asian NSCLC Patients: Stimulating Immune Response), and STRIDE (Stimulating immune Response inadvanced breast cancer). Unfortunately, in 2014, the company stopped Stimuvax \u00aeclinical trials due to failure to meet primary or secondary end- points, including survival and time-to-symptom progression ( Kroemer, Zitvogel, & Galluzzi, 2013 ). Gold and recombinant tumor necrosisfactor (rhTNF- ) to treat patients with varied types of solid tumors (such as pancreatic, ovarian and breast cancers, melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma), causing vascular breakdown and stimulating an immune response. Another gold nanoparticle therapy that completed a phase I trial for safetyin 2018 employs CpG oligonucleotides around a gold core, acting as atoll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist to stimulate innate and adaptive immuneresponses against metastatic solid tumors ( https:/ /clinicaltrials. ). There nanoimmunotherapeutic cancer treat- ment beyond liposomes and gold nanoparticles that are being clinicallytested: one is a protein nanogel-based \"backpack\" strategy, with ex vivo modification of T cells prior to adoptive cell transfer. The nanogel is in phase I trials ( https:/ /clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03815682 ) for patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas ( Tang et al., 2018 ). Another is a cancer vaccine (WDVAX) against stage IV melanoma, consist- ing of the patient's own tumor lysate combined with other proteins (GM-CSF and CpG) to elicit DC activation, and PLGA as base carrier mate-rial, for which Novartis has received a license for phase I clinical trials(https:/ /clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01753089 ). A different vaccine approach involves the \"Lipo-MERIT\" vaccine, which is currently being evaluated for safety and tolerability and consists of RNA-lipoplexes created by combining liposomes with various RNA-drug products that arespecifically designed to elicit T-cell responses to four cancer antigens321 to target immunity(NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, tyrosinase and TPTE). The lipoplexes are designed to enhance plasma half-life after IV administration and target sys- temic antigen-presenting cells (APC), and are being assessed advanced malignant melanoma ( https:/ /clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT02410733 ). The use of nanoparticles to promote immune tolerance and regulate immune response is being explored clinically for diseases other than cancer by several companies including Courpharma, Selecta Biosciences, andothers for applications such as pemphigus vulgaris, T1D, multiple sclerosis,celiac disease, and other disorders. Selecta's Selective Immune Tolerance Technology (ImmTOR) is being used to generate DCs and Foxp3 + CD4+T cells in CD8+T cell effector cell acti- vation, and a Phase II clinical trial using this approach is underway to explorethe use of rapamycin and antigen co-loaded PLA and PLGA nanoparticles in treating chronic refractory gout, and is currently in Phase II clinical trials ( Kishimoto & Maldonado, 2018 ). Clinical nanomedicine use remains sparse in cardiovascular therapy, but human trials are beginning to emerge. For instance, second-generation lipid nanoparticles loaded with a siRNA targeted to Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) were studied in patients with high plasmaLDL cholesterol with promising results, including a 70% reduction in cir-culating PCSK9 plasma protein and a 40% reduction in LDL cholesterolfrom baseline relative to placebo. Additionally, long-circulating prednisone- containing liposomes for atherosclerosis accumulated in plaque macrophages in patients, providing proof-of-concept for the potential development ofmacrophage-focused therapies ( Fitzgerald et al., 2014 ;van der Valk et al., 2015, 2016 ;Zhang et al., 2021 ). Two key barriers to successful translation from bench to clinic are strat- ification of patients who will benefit most from specific therapies, and con-trolling immunotoxicity effects. Deployment in clinical practice remainselusive due to the lack of precise strategies to effectively manage potential toxicity, even in cases where the formulation has obtained FDA approval. For instance, checkpoint inhibitor therapies can cause adverse effects includ-ing skin reactions, such as rash and psoriasis, and gastrointestinal tractproblems such as inflammatory colitis ( Postow, & Hellmann, 2018 ). These known shortcomings of immunotherapies must be considered in developing and translating future nanoimmunotherapy formulations for clinical use. However, some of the desirable properties of nanosystems,including versatility of their design, targeting ability, and specificity of322 Romila Manchanda et al.delivery, could help minimize some of these issues. A thorough understanding of nanomaterials in terms of the safety profiles of nanomaterials, as well as their interactions with immune cells, mechanisms of action, and standardizedprotocols for treatment and detection and management of side effects, areall critical to engender successful deployment of nanoimmunotherapies. 5. Toxicology of nanoimmunotherapies In the last 10 years, there have been great advances in our understand- ing of the immunocompatibility of nanoparticles, and how the characteris-tics of nanoparticles change their interaction with plasma proteins andimmune cells to safeguard drug delivery ( Kadam, Bourne, & 2012 ;Petschauer, Madden, Kirschbrown, Song, & Zamboni, 2015 ). This knowledge has greatly enhanced the development of safe and efficaciousnanoimmunotherapeutic platforms. Still, critical concerns remain regardingthe safety of these engineered nanosystems, including their interactions with innate immune subcomponents, which may result in immunological reac- tions and lead to immunotoxicity. Also, repeated stimulation of the immunesystem can intensify the development of allergic and autoimmune diseases.Conversely, uncontrolled tolerance or suppression of the immune system may result in increased risk of infectious diseases and tumor growth. Furthermore, physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles such as theirsize, shape, chemical composition, surface chemistry in relation to charge,area, porosity, etc., are crucial in determining not only efficacy, but alsosafety and compatibility with the immune system. The size of nanoparticles influences overall biodistribution, and nanoparticle size and shape affects their uptake by immune system cells and the subsequent immune response( Liu, Hardie, Zhang, & Rotello, 2017 ), with larger and non-spherically shaped nanoparticles being more easily internalized. Similarly, increasing nanoparticle hydrophobicity results in enhanced immune cell internalization, whereas hydrophilic formulations seem to be less immunogenic. Surfacecharge is another important nanoparticle consideration ( Liu et al., 2017 ); for instance, cationic nanoparticles interact more readily with negatively- charged cell membranes. As our understanding increases in terms of how tailored design of nanomaterials can impact interactions with the immune sys-tem, this can lead to improved safety and compatibility profiles. The most common safety concerns associated with nanosystems include erythrocyte damage, thrombogenicity, cytokine-mediated inflammation, and target immunityShurin, & Shvedova, 2016 ). Some nanoparticles may induce generation of more ROS during the pro-inflammatory stage in cells, which may in turn damage cellular components including proteins, lipids, and the cell mem-brane. Although there is data on the immunomodulatory effects ofnanoparticles, it is not sufficient to fully understand all the mechanisms inplay, and the immunological effects of a given formulation do not necessarily reflect their immunotoxicities ( Engin & Hayes, 2018 ). The lack of standards or specific safety protocols and toxicity guidelines for nanoimmunotherapyalso makes it difficult to interpret the relevance of a given study's observa-tions regarding immune toxicity. It also creates issues in understanding which observations should constitute a concern or trigger further review, or even how to properly and accurately measure/evaluate toxicity. In thelast decade, to improve this situation ASTM and ISO launched the E56and TC229 committees to develop provide guidelines for testing hemolytic properties of nanoparticles, the effect of nanoparticleson the formation of mouse granulocyte-macrophage colonies, evaluation of cytotoxicity of nanoparticles on different types of cells, and testing of contamination of nanomaterials by endotoxins. Although these are helpfulguidelines, there remains much work to be done in developing a suffi-ciently broad set of tests and guidelines that is applicable to overall globalimmunotoxicology, and which can properly assess the interactions of nanoimmunotherapy formulations with living systems, and the potential consequences of this interplay. 6. Conclusion Nano-mediated immunotherapy faces the complex task of tailoring a specific, desirable immune response within the human body, bringing these types of therapies into the realm of personalized medicine. However, manyassociated challenges remain. Although a variety of nanoimmunotherapieshave reached clinical trials, particularly in the area of cancer management, clinical translation remains elusive for most nanoimmunotherapeutic agents. The delicate equilibrium between immune protection and immunetolerance, along with the intricate array of factors that affect nanosystemdelivery, safety, and efficacy, create many challenges for successful transla- tion. Of these factors, nanosystem immunotoxicity and safety are key areas of concern, since nanoparticles typically interact closely with immune cells.Environmentally-conscious have324 Romila Manchanda et al.excellent biocompatibility and sometimes better safety profiles, although more research is required to ensure their utility. A detailed understanding of how a nanosystem interacts with immune components is required in order to select the appropriate platform for pre-cision treatment. Some nanoparticle s are intrinsic adjuvants, so immuno- genicity should be controlled to cir cumvent excessive immune response that may decrease the efficacy of therapy or become maladaptive. Another challenge is successful delivery of a nanodrug to specific immunecell populations. Targeted delivery and controlled release of antigen andadjuvants must often be achieved, and a variety of ligands or intrinsic pro- clivities can be employed to functionalize nanoparticles for precise transportation to a target ( Flores et al., 2020; Kanthi, de la Zerda, & Smith, 2020; Smith et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2021 ). The intrinsic features of nanoparticles such as their size, shap e, surface charge, and hydrophobic/ hydrophilic balance are also crucial factors that influence local delivery and accumulation within a target. Nanopart icle physicochemical characteris- tics influence their pharmacokinetics and may promote or prevent inter-action with biological components (e. g., protein corona formation on the surface of the nanoparticle), which can impact how much of the agent reaches the target site. Systematic st udies are needed to enrich our under- standing of how nanoimmunotherapeutic agents behave in biologicalenvironments, and how we can modulate or tailor that behavior to ouradvantage. The eventual success of translational nanoimmunotherapy also d e p e n d so nt e s t i n gi na d v a n c e dp r e c l i n ical animal models that accurately simulate human illness progression. Va rious established models are effec- tively used to study disease mechanisms, but a major remaining challenge ishow effectively these models can address therapeutic efficacy of a given formulation, so that the potential for cl inical translation can be more accu- rately evaluated. Nano-mediated immunotherapy is a growing area of research for gen- erating novel strategies to treat a variety of diseases, given the immune sys- tem's central role in human health. Although many obstacles lie ahead, exciting clinical developments are also likely approaching as we better learnhow to harness the power of the immune system for therapeutic modulationusing nanotechnology.
