(Yes, even in the winter.) \"Sunburns occur if the skin gets too much sun with minimal proper protection,\" says [Rina M. Allawh](https://www.mainlinehealth.org/find-a-doctor/rina-m-allawh), a board-certified dermatologist in Philadelphia. The majority of sunburns are mild first-degree sunburns that only affect the most outer layer of skin, causing redness and discomfort when touched, she explains. Second- and third-degree sunburns are characterized by intense redness, pain, blistering, swelling, and\u2014sometimes\u2014other symptoms including headache, chills, fatigue, abdominal pain, or even fever, says Allawh. \"These severe sunburns compromise the integrity of the protective skin barrier and the ability of the body to maintain an internal equilibrium,\" she explains. When you have symptoms like blisters, don't rely on home remedies\u2014it's important to seek medical attention. Your doctor can rule out sun poisoning and even prescribe a prescription cream to help with symptom relief. But, for those more common, mild burns, you may wonder if there's anything in your pantry\u2014aloe, vinegar, or oatmeal, for example\u2014that can soothe your skin, stat. The good news: If you're suffering, dermatologists say there are a wide range of home remedies that work to treat sunburn fast. First, cool things down with a cool compress. Whether the burn is on your body or your face, the most important initial step is cooling and protecting the skin, says Allawh. Move to a sun protected area and apply a cool compress to the exposed skin. ...or some ice. You can also wrap ice or a bag of frozen peas in a wash cloth and then apply to the skin. Just note: You should never place ice directly on burned skin\u2014this can cause more pain and further damage. And drink plenty of water. It's always important to hydrate\u2014particularly if you're spending time in the sun\u2014but a sunburn draws the fluid from the skin's surface, says Allawh. Drinking plenty of water not only helps relieve symptoms over time, but it can actually help reduce recovery time, says Allawh. Then, experiment with the following skin soothers: Aloe This is an old standby for good reason. Aloe has calming, anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce redness and increase healing time, says [Dr. Dendy Engelman](https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/dendy-engelman-md), a board certified dermatologic surgeon in NYC. For even more calming benefits, Engelman recommends using [a lotion that also contains cucumber](https://www.amazon.com/Jergens-Soothing-Refreshing-Moisturizer-Ounces/dp/B007676J1O). Apple Cider Vinegar It may sound counterintuitive to apply vinegar to angry, red skin, but [raw apple cider vinegar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RHMA3E2) has anti-inflammatory properties that soothe irritated skin, plus acetic acid to slough off dead cells, says Engelman. If your whole body is burned, try soaking in an apple cider vinegar bath for 10 minutes. This will help restore your skin's pH levels, leaving it feeling cool and soothed, says Engelman. Witch Hazel [Witch hazel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00016WW8Q) has anti-inflammatory and astringent properties that make it great for itches and irritations, says Engelman. It also has a cooling effect that provides instant relief. Add a few drops to your cool compress, or use a soft cotton pad to apply it directly to the skin. The acid will gently exfoliate, while the botanicals nourish and balance. Coconut Oil \"Oil-based products are the best way to add moisture back into the skin because they're so easily absorbed,\" says Engelman. For a sunburn on your face, try [coconut oil](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DS842HS), which not only hydrates, but also has antibacterial properties that help reduce itchiness and calm inflammation, says Engelman. Cold Milk A wash cloth soaked with cold milk not only feels good on warm, irritated skin, but it also has healing properties, says Allawh. Milk contains lactic acid, which may help remove the dead layers of skin associated with peeling and help sunburned skin heal faster, she explains. Oatmeal Oatmeal is commonly used to soothe [eczema-prone skin](https://www.oprahdaily.com/beauty/g29762320/best-eczema-cream/), but it's also a great ingredient for sunburned skin, says Engelman. To get relief, mix oatmeal with some olive or coconut oil before taking a cool shower or bath. Baking Soda If your sunburn is peeling, a baking soda paste or bath may help sooth inflammation and alleviate itching, says Allawh. Mix baking soda with just enough water to form a paste and apply to the affected area, then rinse. Or, sprinkle some in a cool bath and soak. For extra relief, try... A [hydrating body lotion](https://www.oprahdaily.com/beauty/skin-makeup/g29037501/best-body-lotions/) and an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen, can also help reduce redness, pain, and swelling, says Allawh. And if you're really struggling... For a stubborn sunburn, pick up a [1% hydrocortisone cream](https://www.amazon.com/Vanicream-Hydrocortisone-Anti-Itch-Dermatologist-Fragrance/dp/B01CLIZB8Y) at the drugstore, and apply it to affected areas twice daily, says Engelman.
