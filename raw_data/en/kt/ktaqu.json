Herr Max Dessoir drew the originals on the spur of the moment, out of the Baroness von Ravensburg's sight, and taking care that his pencil should move noiselessly. He and the Baron then concentrated their attention on the figure, which the Baroness, sitting at another table, endeavoured to reproduce, after a time varying from 20 to 45 seconds.

The ninety numbers which contain two digits were inscribed on ninety slips of paper, and placed in a bowl. Miss M. Wingfield, sitting six feet behind the percipient, drew a slip at random, and fixed her attention on the number which it bore; Miss K. Wingfield made a guess at the number, and the real number and the guess made were at once recorded in the Table. The slip of paper was then replaced, the contents of the bowl shuffled, and another draw made at hap-hazard. The most probable number of right guesses for accident to bring about in the 400 {ii-654} trials was 4. The actual number of completely right guesses was 27; in 21 other cases the two right digits were given in reverse order: and in 162 others, one of the digits was given rightly in its right place. The probability which this result affords for a cause other than chance is represented by 47 nines and a 5 following a decimal point; i.e., the odds are nearly two hundred thousand million trillions of trillions to 1. It would be a very inadequate statement of the case to say that, if the waking hours of the whole population of the world were for the future continuously devoted to making similar trials, life on this planet would come to an end without such an amount of success, or anything like it, having been accidentally obtained. The next account is from the Rev. Canon Lefroy, Incumbent of St Andrew's, Liverpool. The percipient, Miss \u2014\u2014, is known to Mr. Myers and the present writer. Her bona fides is above suspicion; but her state of health has unfortunately prevented further experimentation. \"1885. \"Early in September, 1884, in Zermatt, I was, through the kindness of Miss \u2014\u2014, permitted to have an opportunity of testing, by personal observation, experience, and evidence, the reality or otherwise of what is, I believe, called telepathy. I am bound to say that when I was informed, and most kindly informed, of what was proposed to be done, the innate scepticism of my nature rose to its highest. \"I was informed that the eyes of Miss \u2014\u2014 would be tightly bandaged, and I saw them bandaged; that in this darkened state, mental or ocular perception\u2014probably the latter [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-655n1');) 1 See p. [48](#ii-48n1ref), note.\u2014would, nevertheless, enable her to read any word written by me on a slip of paper. There might be mistake; there might be literal transposition [? transposition of letters]; there might be delay; but, speaking broadly, I was assured that the word could be discerned. We sat at opposite sides of the table. I was desired to hold the lady's hand. I did so, and while so doing I exerted my will to the utmost, and to the intent that, if possible, the conflict of wills should result in favour of my scepticism. I must, with shame and humiliation, confess that my incredulity and volitional resistance did not hesitate to select a word which my gifted antagonist probably never heard of; and accordingly I defiantly, confidently, and I will add, mercilessly, wrote the name of Terence's old play\u2014Heautontimorumenos. The completion of my word was followed by a prolonged pause. I felt as if breathing was an intrusion, and not a sound was heard. At last the blinded, and I thought the wearied, or at least strained, interpreter said, 'What a long word!' Then a pause. Then as follows: 'Why\u2014two, four, six, eight\u2014there are eighteen letters in that word!' \"Unconsciously my resisting power became less than it was, and it decreased from the moment Miss \u2014\u2014 said, 'What a long word!' Nevertheless, the long pause seemed to give me a chance, and again I gathered up my mind to resolve that detection should be arrested. But very soon this purpose was foiled; the lady calmly said, 'That word has two m's to it; it begins with an h; and I never saw that word before.' I felt very guilty as I observed what I thought were signs of fatigue, and then declared the word was unusual\u2014ill-known, and asked that the bandage might be removed. \"In a few moments I was allowed to try with simpler words. Again the bandage was applied, the word was written, and our hands were clasped. I wrote the word ink. In about one minute the word was read, thus, 'k, n, i; your word is ink.' \"Again I was most kindly allowed to try another word. I wrote toy. In a minute the word was read thus, 'y, o, t; your word is toy.' {ii-656} [2](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-655n2');) 2 The following note, by Mr. Myers, of a trial made in 1884, with the same percipient, exhibits the same curious reversal of letters; which might be compared with the production of anagrams, and of independent and phonetic spelling, in automatic writing (Vol. i., pp. [76](#i-76)-8, and below, p. [665](#ii-665)). \"I asked Miss \u2014\u2014 to try some experiments in thought-transference with her sister. She soon told me that the experiments had succeeded, but with this strange peculiarity, that, when the sister fixed her eyes on some word, Miss K. saw its letters appear in her field of mental vision in reverse order. Miss K. was, unfortunately, very liable to headache, which these experiments quickly induced, and I was only allowed one short series of trials. I placed the word NET behind her, and looked fixedly at the letters. She said that she saw successively the letters T, E, N. I next chose SEA, and she saw A, E, S. I chose a third word, but she saw no mental image, and headache stopped the experiments.\" The experience then closed, so far as this species of discovery was concerned. \"WILLIAM LEFROY, M.A.\" In answer to inquiries, Canon Lefroy writes, on June 17, 1886:\u2014 \"Abercromby Square, Liverpool. \"I believe I wrote the letters under the cover of my left hand. Miss \u2014\u2014 could not possibly descry them. My own inflexible scepticism respecting her power provided, I can assure you, a ready safeguard against anything she might have been disposed to do under the peculiar circumstances of the experiment. I am, to this hour, a most unwilling believer in her possession of some force which revealed what she could not see, and which disclosed what I resolved should be impenetrable.\" Miss Hamilton, of 47, Albert Mansions, Kensington Gore, W., a Member of the S.P.R., sends (in June, 1886,) the following record of an impromptu trial, of the sort which we wish we could persuade more people to make. In such a case as this, contact, though better avoided, can scarcely be held to afford the opportunity for unconscious physical hints. One reservation unfortunately must be made: the record was not drawn up in writing at the time. But Miss Hamilton tells us that the details were then and there carefully gone over, with a view to the present report; and we have several memories to rely on. \"Experiment between Miss Leila Melvill [now Mrs. Lewis Hamilton], and Mr. Lewis Hamilton, September, 1885. \"Miss L. M., eyes lightly bandaged with a silk handkerchief, was 'willed' by Mr. Hamilton. He placed his hands on her forehead, and willed intently that she should read the [printed] words, A Sermon, at which he gazed steadily all the time he willed. She said, slowly, A; then spelled the first few letters of 'Sermon,' and then said the whole word. \"The same evening she read in the same manner these words, County Families. Later on, in November, the same experiment was tried, and she read the unusual words, Chatto and Windus. Each experiment took about three minutes. Amongst the witnesses present were:\u2014 \"MARY C. D. HAMILTON. HAMILTON.\" The agent and percipient also sign the account. In answer to inquiries, Mr. Hamilton writes, on June 25, 1886:\u2014 \"Lansdowne, Farquhar Road, Upper Norwood. (1) \"Had the subject's eyes been unbandaged, she could have undoubtedly seen the words; but not only were they tightly bandaged, but my fingers were placed on her closed eyelids, so that she could not even {ii-657} have opened them, had there been no bandage. On one occasion the words she read were held above the subject's head, so that she could not in any case have seen. [Miss Hamilton independently confirms this.] I may say, however, that in no single case was there any possibility of her having seen the words. The words, and book, or pamphlet, from which they were read, were chosen after her eyes were bandaged, and out of her sight, and they were not whispered from one witness to the other, but shown round. (2) \"In no instance did she fail with me, but when Mr. Hope tried her one evening, she failed, and on another occasion (one) she said almost at once she could not do it that evening. The experiment was tried a good many times, and except for the above, always succeeded. (3) \"For about six months we did not try again, and on the two occasions we have tried lately, she has said she could not do it. We, however, do intend to try again. \"LEWIS HAMILTON.\" The following records of experiments have been sent to us by our friend Dr. Li\u00e9beault, of Nancy, a Corresponding Member of the S.P.R. \"Compte-rendu des exp\u00e9riences de transmission de pens\u00e9es, faites 1885, 3 heures \u00e0 4 heures et demie du soir, chez M. le Dr. Li\u00e9beault, en pr\u00e9sence de M. le Dr. Li\u00e9beault, de Madame S., et de M. le Dr. Brullard. Op\u00e9rateur, M. le Professeur Li\u00e9geois; sujet, Mlle. M., 20 ans.

Hypnotist: Professor Li\u00e9geois; \u00e9tat somnambulisme, pendant lequel elle est en rapport avec tous les assistants. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-657b');)]1. Mlle M., very intelligent and sensitive, is used to being put to sleep, and goes into a somnambulistic trance very quickly, one during which she is in rapport with all those present. \"M. le Professeur Li\u00e9geois la met commande de faire la m\u00eame chose que lui. Alors il se rend \u00e0 une table voisine et triangle puts her into a somnambulistic trance and suggests she remain in rapport with him only. He gives her paper and pencil, and orders her to do the same thing he does. He goes to a nearby table and draws a triangle in an account-book whose raised cover forms a screen between him and the subject, and blocks all visual communication. At once, Mlle M. writes \"Great men.\" The result is thus negative. \"2. En second lieu M. Li\u00e9geois dit au aussit\u00f4t, juger. Le r\u00e9sultat est donc exact. [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-657n1');) 1 The drawings have been sent to us, and entirely accord with Dr. Li\u00e9beault's description. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-657d');)]2. Next, M. Li\u00e9geois tells the subject, still in her trance, \"I am drawing a picture of an object,\" and under the same conditions as before, draws a carafe. The subject says at once \"It's a vase,\" and draws a picture of a square-shaped vase. \"No, not that,\" says M. Li\u00e9geois. Then Mlle M. draws an object having the same shape as the carafe, but distorted, given that her eyes are closed and she is drawing without seeing what she has done. The result is, therefore, correct. \"3. En troisi\u00e8me lieu, 'Je dessine quelque chose,' Mlle.

Li\u00e9geois says \"I am drawing something,\" and sketches a man. The subject, still in her passive state, says successively \"It's a drawing of an ornament,\" after which she starts to make a few marks, and then, after getting a negative reaction, \"It looks like a compass-a tree-a house.\" Outcome negative. At this point M. Li\u00e9geois brings Mlle M. out of the trance with the suggestion that she shall very clearly see the last object drawn once she is awake, and at that moment she is in communication with all those present. \"I don't know,\" says Mlle. M., and a few minutes later, \"It's a head.\" When asked, she draws it in profile. Then she is told that it was a man. \"I say,\" she replies, \"my first reaction was to draw a man, but I was afraid you would make fun of me.\" \"4. Mile. M. restant r\u00e9veill\u00e9e, M.

[ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-658a');)]4. Mlle. M. being still awake, M. Li\u00e9geois returns to his table and draws a square table in proper perspective, with a drawer and knob. Then, after having shown his drawing in silence to each person separately, he puts his two hands on the subject's head and says to her \"Now guess what I have just done.\" After less than two minutes' thought, she says \"It's a table; it is round\u2014well, not quite.\" When asked to draw the table, she slowly draws one exactly like the other and in the same position, including the drawer and the knob. Correct result. \"5. Mlle. M., qui, comme aucun assistant, n'a vu le en rapport M. Li\u00e9geois seul. M. Li\u00e9geois un une Li\u00e9geois petit bureau.' 'Non.' 'Oh, il y ]5. Mlle M., who, unlike the others, has not seen the drawing, is in rapport with M. Li\u00e9geois alone. M. Li\u00e9geois draws a cube. Mlle. M., without being asked, says \"It's a lamp.\" M. Li\u00e9geois puts his hands on her head. \"It's a chair,\" she says. M. Li\u00e9geois stares into her eyes and takes her hand. \"I don't know.\" At that point the drawing is shown to the other persons. \"It's a hat,\" she says. Mlle. M. is put back into a trance. \"I want you to see the drawing,\" says \"It's a small desk.\" \"No.\" \"Oh, it's squares\u2014yes,\" and she draws two squares one above the other. \"No, not that;\" and, as she doesn't get it, after a few minutes, \"What is the object made up of squares?\" \"I don't know.\" \"It's a cube.\" \"Ah, of course; that's what I meant to draw.\" During the course of the experiment, Dr. Li\u00e9bault had added dots to make the cube into a die. Result only fair, therefore. \"6. Mile. M., \u00e9tant toujours en \u00e9tat de sommeil hypnotique, Li\u00e9geois a Enfin elle figure successivement un angle, Andr\u00e9, quand still under hypnosis, M. Li\u00e9geois draws a cross. \"It's a square,\" said Mlle M. This was accurate, for the cross had been drawn inside a square. \"But what is that inside the square?\" asks M. Li\u00e9geois. \"It's a drinking glass\u2014no\u2014a star\u2014no\u2014a triangle. But there are three lines.\" Finally, when asked to let her pencil move without controlling it, she draws, first an angle, then a St. Andrew's cross. Outcome essentially negative. \"7. M. Li\u00e9geois \u00e9crit le mot mariage. Mile. then writes Then she says is the letter?\" \"It's after a few minutes' thought: \"There is an i in the m\u2014a g\u2014another a\u2014an e\u2014an e\u2014there are six letters, no, seven.\" When she had found all the letters and their order, ma iage, she was unable to come up with the letter r. Only after some minutes, when told to try all the consonants, that she finally wrote mariage. Outcome Guaita, au domicile du Dr. Li\u00e9beault (4, rue Bellevue, Nancy), le 9 Janvier, 1886. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-658e');)]Minutes of three remarkable examples of mental suggestion, obtained by MM. Li\u00e9beault and De Guaita, at the home of Dr. Li\u00e9beault (4, rue Bellevue, on and Stanislas De Guaita, author, both now residing at Nancy, attest and certify that we have attained the following results. \"1. Mlle. main appuy\u00e9e au front du sujet, se recueillit un instant, [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-658g');)]1. Mlle Louise L., having been put into a magnetic sleep, was told that she was to reply to a question that would be put to her mentally without use of speech or signs. Dr. Li\u00e9beault, his hand on the subject's forehead, thought for a minute, concentrating his own attention on the question he was planning to ask: \"When will you be cured?\" The subject's lips moved suddenly. \"Soon\", she murmured clearly. We then asked her to repeat for everyone present the question she had intuitively perceived. She repeated it in the same words in which it had been formulated in the mind of the experimenter. This first experiment, performed by Dr. Li\u00e9beault at M. de Guaita's suggestion, was thus entirely successful. A second test gave results that were less rigorous, but perhaps even more curious, as we shall see. \"2. M. de Guaita, s'\u00e9tant mis en rapport [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-659n1');) 1 The questions were not committed to paper till after the conclusion of the sitting, which is unfortunate, as everything depends on their exact wording. 'Peut-\u00eatre,' fut de la est tr\u00e8s significative. On dirait que [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-659a');)]2. M. de Guaita, having achieved rapport with the subject, asked her a different question mentally: \"Will you be back next week?\" \"Maybe\" was the reply. But when asked to inform the persons there of the mental question, she replied \"You asked me if you are coming back next week.\" This confusion in a single word of the sentence is extremely significant. It is as though the girl had \"tripped over\" the sentence as she read the mind of the hypnotist. \"3. Le Dr. Li\u00e9beault, afin Guaita pos\u00e8rent, en silence, main sur le front du qu'il est tout rouge .' refusait de la reprendre, force fut ne se souvient plus de son hallucination.](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-659c');)And the subject immediately forgot her hallucination. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-659b');) ]3. To avoid speaking any suggestive phrase, even in a low voice, Dr. Li\u00e9beault wrote on a scrap of paper \"When Mademoiselle awakens, she will find her black hat has turned into a red hat.\" The paper was passed around among all the witnesses ahead of time. Then Li\u00e9beault and De Guiata silently put their hands on the subject's forehead and produced mentally the sentence they had agreed on. Then the girl, having been told she would find something unusual in the room, was awakened. With no hesitation, she looked directly at her hat, and, with a great laugh, cried out \"That's not my hat; I don't want it. It's the same shape, but the joke has gone on long enough; you must give me my property back.\" \"But what do you see that is different?\" \"You know perfectly well. You have eyes just as I do.\" \"And so?\" It took considerable urging to get her to agree to state what was different about her hat. She still thought she was being teased. After energetic questioning, she finally said \"You can clearly see it is red.\" Since she refused to take the hat, it was necessary to bring her hallucination to an end by telling her it was going to take on its original color again. The doctor breathed on the hat, and, as it had once again become hers as far as she could see, she agreed to take the hat. \"Tels sont les r\u00e9sultats que pr\u00e9sent proc\u00e8s-verbal. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-659d');)]These results we certify as having been obtained through our collaboration, in witness of which we have drawn up the present account. \" [Nancy, ce 9 Janvier, 1886, fait en 15 ans, Mlle. Camille Simon, et cela en pr\u00e9sence de M. L.](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-659g');)I was the only one who touched the subject.\u2014A. A. L.

[80](#i-80)). Mr. Myers and I were witnesses of a similar confluence of suggestions verbally given at Dr. Li\u00e9beault's house, on Aug. 31, 1885. Mr. Myers hypnotised a \"subject,\" and told her that on awaking she would see a baby on his knees. I told her that she would see a cat there. When she awoke she gazed at a hat which was on Mr. Myers' knee, and exclaimed, \" [C'est ni chat ni enfant!\"](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-660a');)That is neither a cat nor a baby! and the mixed hallucination inspired a terror and disgust which lasted for three or four minutes. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-659f');)]We were once very successful with a 15-year-old girl, Mlle. Camille Simon, in the presence of M. Brullard and several others. I gave her the mental suggestion that upon awakening, she would see her hat, which is brown, transformed into a yellow one. Then I put her into rapport with everyone, and I passed around for all to see a note giving my suggestion and recommending that everyone think the same thing. But with my usual absent-mindedness, I ceased thinking about the color I had written down earlier; I had the firm idea that her hat would appear red to her. And, upon awakening her, I told her she would see something that represented our shared thought. Once awake, the girl no longer recognized her hat by its color. \"It was brown,\" she said. After having exmined it at length, she insisted that it really did not look the same, that she could not tell us exactly what color it was, but that anyhow it looked reddish-yellow to her. That reminded me of my absent-mindedness. As it had happened, the witnesses had thought yellow and I had thought red, whereupon the object had appeared yellow and red to the subject once she was out of the trance, which proves that a suggestion may echo the thoughts of several brains. The following experiment, made with the same \"subject,\" and sent to us by Dr. Li\u00e9beault on June 3, 1886, is an interesting example of temporary latency of the telepathic impression. se d'un noir verd\u00e2tre ailes, la queue, et le ventre, et partout ailleurs il [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-660b');) ]I had caused several persons to give the girl the mental suggestion that upon awakening, she would see a black rooster walking about the floor of the apartment. Once awake, and for quite some time afterward (about half an hour), she saw nothing, even though I had told her she would see something. It was then, after half an hour, that the girl went to the garden, and, having incidentally examined my small yard, she ran back to tell us: \"Ah, I know what I was supposed to see: a black rooster. I got the idea when I saw your rooster.\" My rooster is half greenish-black, on his wings, tail, and belly, and elsewhere he is yellowish-white. So here we have an association of ideas, carrying over from a real being to a fiction transmitted by mental suggestion from the persons present. The following record of experiments was kindly sent to us, on April 27, 1886, by Dr. Jules Ochorowicz, ex-Professor Agr\u00e9g\u00e9 of the University of Lemberg, now residing at 24, Boulevard St. Germain, Paris. It is to be wished that the original notes had included a very much more detailed description of the conditions; {ii-661} [2](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-660n2');) 2 Possibly Dr. Ochorowicz will to some extent repair this omission in his forthcoming book, Le Probl\u00e8me de la Suggestion Mentale, in which this record will be embodied. but as corroborative of the parallel but more striking results recorded in [Vol. I., Chap. II.](#i-c2), the present set deserves attention. The first experiments, with cards, were of the type described in [Vol. I., pp. 31-3](#i-31); but though the success obtained told slightly in favour of a cause other than chance, the series was too short to have any independent value. The complete record of the next set of trials is as follows. The percipient was throughout in a normal waking state.

But here, though contact was avoided, the form of experiment\u2014involving movement of the limbs, and sometimes actual movement about the room,\u2014is open to grave objection; as it can never be proved to the satisfaction of persons not present that guidance of some sort was not afforded by unconscious physical signs. The following case of the transference of a name is recorded by M. Ch. Richet. It is one of the sporadic instances which occurred before the time was ripe for placing telepathy on a firm evidential basis. In future, we may hope that similar casual instances will, as a matter of course, be recorded at the moment, (especially by medical {ii-665} and scientific observers,) and forwarded to our London headquarters, or to those of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Psychologie car je Un jour, vers 4 de l'apr\u00e8smidi, j'amenai avec un le mon ami?' (J'\u00e9tais s\u00fbr de ne pas avoir prononc\u00e9 son 'N.' my many studies on lucidity in mesmerized persons did I produce a satisfactory result. It was, indeed, one of my first studies, and it is remarkable, for I was never able to repeat it, even to a lesser degree of approximation. A convalescent girl was put into a magnetic sleep by me, in November, 1872, at the H\u00f4tel-Dieu [hospital in Paris]. One day about four in the afternoon, I brought a young American student friend, Mr. Hearn, with me. Mr. Hearn had never seen the girl. Once she was asleep, I asked my subject: \"Do you know the name of my friend?\" (I was positive I had never said it.) She smiled. \"No,\" she said. Then, as I was insistent, she added \"I don't see it.\" I insisted once more, and she said \"There are five letters.\" \"Well,\" I said, \"what is the first?\" She said softly \"H.\" can't see it.\" After she had tried in vain to see it, I said \"Let's go to the [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-665b');)]The next day I tried other similar experiments with the same subject, but without success. Also later, without success, with other persons. \"C'est pour cela que je ne l'avais pas publi\u00e9e; mais que le les accompagn\u00e9.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-665c');)]That is why I didn't publish, but now that the reality of such thought-transference seems to have been solidly proven I consider myself authorized to reveal it, for it matches a group of facts that appear to have been established, and I was so struck with it at the time that I remember the circumstances surrounding it with absolute precision. The next case is from Dr. A. M. Chiltoff, of Kharkoff, and is parallel to those described Petersburg, in the lodging of M. Greshner, I, in 3 minutes, and at a distance of 4 feet, plunged into sleep M. Drobiazguin, an officer of the Russian navy. The experiment was made in the presence of M. Toumas, M.D. (now Professor at the University of Warsaw), and of many other witnesses. When the 'subject' fell asleep, one of the witnesses wrote on a sheet of paper the (Russian) word 'Bog' (God). Then I took this sheet of paper and put it on the forehead of my 'subject.' To my question whether he can read the word written on the paper, M. Drobiazguin gave an affirmative answer, and then proceeded to pronounce in a dead voice the letters. The first two were read correctly, but in lieu of 'g' he said 'tch.' When I remarked to him that the last letter is guessed incorrectly, he immediately said the true letter. In my opinion this experiment cannot be explained by 'mental suggestion,' for those present expected that the 'subject' would pronounce the right letter, 'g,' and he nevertheless pronounced 'tch.'\" [There is no Russian word \"botch.\" As regards peculiarities of spelling, see [Vol. I., pp. 76-8](#i-76). The independent action of the percipient's {ii-666} mind which such peculiarities indicate affords, according to the reasoning in this book, no ground at all for doubting that the idea was telepathically transferred from one mind to the other.] We owe the following accounts of some experiments in hypnotic rapport to Mr. C. Kegan Paul, who states that he has known the phenomenon of \"community of taste in the mesmeric sleep\" to have occurred several times in the case of this \"subject.\" Mr. Paul writes:\u2014 \"May 27th, 1884. \"I lived at Great Tew, in Oxfordshire, from March, 1851, to May, 1852. When there, the following circumstance occurred, but I am not able to fix the month, further than to say that I think it was in the late summer of 1851. (No. I am now convinced that it was in April, 1852.) \"I had been in the habit of mesmerising frequently Mr. Walter Francis Short, then an undergraduate scholar of New College, who was, without any single exception, the most 'sensitive' person of either sex I have ever known. He usually became what is called clairvoyant, but this always tired him, and I seldom made protracted experiments in this direction. On several occasions I found that a community of taste was established between us, but only once made any experiment with more than one substance, such as a biscuit, or glass of water. \"At Great Tew, with his consent, my two sisters alone being present besides ourselves, I carried the matter further. We had dined in my only sitting-room, and the dessert was still on the table. (I think I am right, though my sister F. doubts.) I put Short to sleep in an arm-chair, which I turned with its back to the table, and Short's face to the wall. There was no mirror in the room. I asked Short, taking his hand, if he thought he could taste what I took in my mouth, and he said he thought that he could. I, still holding his hand, shut my own eyes, and my sisters put into my mouth various things which were on the table. I remember only raisins, but there were four or five various substances tasted. These were all quite correctly described, except that I think there was an uncertainty about the kind of wine. Short, however, had of course been aware of what was on the table, but he could not know, nor did I know, the order in which I was to be fed with these things. \"To carry the experiment further, one of my sisters left the room, bringing back various things wholly unknown to me, which she administered to me having my eyes shut. I remember spices, black pepper, salt, raw rice, and finally soap, all of which Short recognised, and the last of which he rejected with a splutter of great disgust. The experiment only ended when we could think of nothing more to taste. \"I had at that time already left Oxford; Short did so soon after, and our various occupations seldom allowed our meeting. His conviction of my power over him was such that he begged that I would never attempt to place him under mesmeric influence when I was at a distance from him, on the ground that, as he was rowing in the Oxford boat, I might do so when he was on the river. I had once affected him at a distance, under rather singular circumstances, and of course willingly gave the promise. \"C. KEGAN PAUL. {ii-667} \"My sister F. is right in remarking that our four selves were the only persons in the house. My only servant was a woman in the village, who lived close by, and came and went at fixed hours, like an Oxford scout.\" This account was sent by Mr. Paul to his sister, Miss Paul, with the following letter:\u2014 \"In talking with my friend Henry Sidgwick over my experiments in mesmerism many years ago, I mentioned one with Short at Tew, when you and M. were present. He has asked me to write it down, and get if possible your recollections on it. \"The particular experiment was one in which Short, being in the mesmeric sleep, was able to taste what was put into my mouth. If you recollect the circumstance at all, I want you, before reading what I have said, enclosed in another envelope, to write down a statement of what you remember as much in detail as possible\u2014time, place, persons present, things tasted, &c.; then to read my narrative, and to write also how far your recollection, thus refreshed, tallies with mine, and preserve both accounts, even if you find them contradictory; then to send my account and your account and remarks enclosed to M., together with this note, asking her to follow exactly the same plan, and return my statement, yours, and her own to me, together with this note. \"I should like you also to say that you have observed my order of proceeding as indicated above. \"C. KEGAN PAUL.\" Miss Paul replied as follows, on May 27:\u2014 \"On Thursday, April 29th, 1852, my sister and I went to stay with my brother at Great Tew, in Oxfordshire, and Mr. Short joined us at Oxford, and went with us to Tew. As he returned to Oxford on Saturday, May 1st, the mesmeric experiments, which I well remember, must have been on Friday, April 30th, and they were after dinner in the evening. My brother mesmerised Mr. Short, and when he was quite asleep he tried some experiments. \"My brother drank some wine (I think it was port), and we saw Mr. Short's lips and throat moving as if he was swallowing it, and on my brother asking him what he was drinking, he at once said what it was. The wine had been taken from a cupboard and poured out, where, even had he been awake, Mr. Short could not have seen what it was before tasting it.\" \"[I think my own account is the more correct.\u2014C. K. P.]\" \"My sister then got some black pepper from the kitchen and put it in my brother's hand, and on his putting some in his own mouth, Mr. Short at once tasted it, and on my brother asking him what he had in his mouth, he said it was very hot and unpleasant, but was not quite sure what it was. My brother held Mr. Short's hand all the time. \"The only other thing I remember is that on my brother removing his hand after, and substituting my sister's, Mr. Short looked as if in pain, and said the change was unpleasant. \"No one else was in the little cottage at the time. \"F, K. PAUL. {ii-668} \"P.S.\u2014Since writing my account I have read my brother's, and think it very accurate, as, now I am reminded of the soap, &c., I can faintly recollect it, but not clearly, as I do the things I have written down. \"Also I think the dessert had been put away, and the wine taken out again on purpose. \"I remember the date, as I have always written down very shortly the events of each day.\" Mr. Paul's other sister, Mrs. P., writes, on May 29, 1884:\u2014 \"In the year 1852 or 1853, I believe at Bloxham [certainly Tew.\u2014C. K. P.], I remember my brother trying experiments on a friend, Mr. Short, whom he was in the habit of mesmerising. One evening, I saw him mesmerise Mr. Short, and while he was in that state my brother asked for a glass of water or wine, and drank it. Mr. Short appeared as if he was drinking, and swallowed, and made a reply when asked what it was; but the experiment I remember best was, after my getting some pepper, and giving it to my brother, he put some into his mouth, and Mr. Short looked as if in pain, and said, 'Hot.' Then I took his hand, and his face changed, and I think he said, 'Nasty.' I know he seemed to dislike the change from my brother's touch; but although I know there were other experiments, it is so long ago that I cannot quite recall them. \"M. E. P. \"P.S.\u2014Since writing the above I have read my brother's narrative, which is, I think, substantially correct.\" The Rev. W. F. Short writes to Mr. Podmore:\u2014 \"The Rectory, Donhead St. Mary, Salisbury. \"June 12th, 1884. \"DEAR SIR,\u2014Stock tells me you would like my account of some mesmeric experiences of mine at Great Tew in the year' 52. You are very welcome, but 32 years may have impaired my memory for the details, and I should like Kegan Paul to see the account before any use is made of it. \"I had come up to New College by accident a week before the time, and finding college empty accepted an invitation to pay Paul, then curate of Great Tew, a visit. One night, I think the Thursday following, he mesmerised me, and made, I believe, some successful experiments in the 'transference of taste'; but of these, as I was in a deep sleep, I can say nothing. When I was in due time awakened, he said, 'We tried to get you to visit New College, but you said it was all a guess, and would tell us nothing.' I answered, 'I seem to have dreamt of New College Junior Common-room, and to have seen B. and G. sitting at a small round table drawn near the fire, with the lamp on the large table near them, playing at cards.' It was agreed that I should test the truth of this on my return to Oxford on Friday (one day before men in general came up). On entering college I met B., and said, 'You up? Are there any other men come?' 'Oh, yes; G. and so-and-so,' &c. 'Were night at 10 (?)?' 'Yes.' 'Who else was there?' 'Oh, the whole lot of us. No, by 10 everyone was gone but I and G.' 'Where were you sitting?' 'At a small table close to the fire, it was so cold.' {ii-669} 'With the lamp on the big table near you?' 'Yes, drawn close to us.' 'Then I will tell you what you were doing. You were playing cards.' 'How odd! We weren't playing cards, but G. was showing me tricks on the cards.' \"I have always thought this a thoroughly good case, too exact to be a mere coincidence, and I think tolerably accurate even in the words used, but those who do not, like myself, believe in clairvoyance [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-669n1');) 1 This may very probably have been a case of telepathic clairvoyance ( [Vol. i., pp. 368-9](#i-368)), conditioned by the hypnotic trance, but also by the pre-existing relation between Mr. Short and the friends whom he saw (p. 162). will probably set it down to a happy guess. \"I have not for many years had any experience of mesmerism, but after this, for some years, I saw a great deal of it, and have no more doubt of its reality, even in its higher phases of inducing clairvoyance, &c., than I have of my own existence. \"I doubt whether B. would remember this (I don't think G. ever heard of it), but I would write to him if you like it, only I am rather overworked just now.\u2014Believe me, yours very truly, \"W. F. SHORT.\" Mr. Short writes, on Feb. 18, 1886:\u2014 \"My friend B. remembered nothing of the circumstances (naturally enough), though I feel perfectly sure it took place.\" Mr. C. Kegan Paul writes, on June 16, 1884:\u2014 \"I am sorry to say I do not remember much about the clairvoyance part of the experiment with Walter Short, though I remember the community of taste vividly, and have described it to Mr. Sidgwick. \"Short became clairvoyant on several occasions under my mesmerism, but I do not recall the details with certainty. On the evening in question I only remember that on trying some experiments Short said he was tired, and wished to be wakened. I do not remember his mentioning his 'dream' or that I heard afterwards how nearly correct it had been. It is probable that he did mention the dream, but that I paid little attention to it, being full of the first experiment, and that as I only saw him occasionally, and we did not exchange letters, I never heard the verification.\" In the following cases, though they are in a sense experimental, the experiment was not directed to the particular result obtained. They are parallel to those recorded in Vol. I., pp. [78](#i-78) and [84](#i-84); they illustrate thought-transference of the \"underground\" sort, both agent and percipient being unconscious of the idea which nevertheless is pretty clearly shown to have passed from one mind to the other otherwise than through the recognised sensory channels. We have reason to think that this form of transference is not extremely uncommon; and these specimens may serve to elicit further records. Mrs. Wingfield (mother of the ladies mentioned above, p. {ii-670} [653](#ii-653)) 13, 1886, Mr. Tatham [of 2, Cambridge Gate, W.] was writing automatically, but not very legibly. He wrote a word twice, which some of us tried to read, but could not. He said he thought it was Phoebe, or something like it. Some minutes afterwards Miss Wingfield, who was sitting at the other side of the room, wrote automatically, 'Who is G. Norby?' We none of us knew this name, and asked why the question was written. We were told 'because he wanted to tell something about an accident,' or words to that effect. The subject then dropped, and the writing was at an end. \"Some half-hour or more afterwards, Mr. M. W. took up Mr. Tatham's paper and looked at it, and said, 'Why! this is G. Norby.' And when we examined the letters carefully we found it was so. Therefore Mr. Tatham and Miss W. were both influenced to write the same name independently of each other, [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-670n1');) 1 If this were certainly the case, the incident could not have been included in the present work. But it is quite conceivable that Miss Wingfield's production of the name was due to its latent existence in Mr. Tatham's mind. as at the time Miss W. wrote, 'Who is G. Norby?' she had not seen what Mr. Tatham wrote, and we none of us had any idea of such a name. There were six persons present beside Mr. T. and Miss W., none of whom had ever heard the name. \"E. A. WINGFIELD, \"PERCY TATHAM.\" \u00a7 2. The following is a transitional case, akin to those recorded in [Vol. I., pp. 103-9](#i-103); but it differs from that group in the fact that the agent remembers his own direct share in the occurrence, and appears to have been reciprocally affected. We owe the case to Mr. H. P. Sparks (of Overbeck Villa, Woodstone, near Southampton,) and Mr. A. H. W. Cleave (of 28, Vardens Road, New Wandsworth, S.W.,) who at the time were fellow-students of naval engineering at Portsmouth. Personal acquaintance has completely confirmed the impression made on me by the letters of these gentlemen, that they had observed the phenomena, which were a complete surprise to them, with intelligence and care. They were unaware of the remarkable interest of their results; and Mr. Sparks addressed me in the first instance, not so much to supply information which, for aught he knew, might be of a common enough type, as to ask for advice about hypnotic experimentation in general. He did not know to what address to write; but acting on a dim recollection of a newspaper notice of our objects, he boldly launched a letter into space, which by good luck reached me after a certain amount of peregrination. His account, received in January, 1886, is as follows:\u2014 \"H.M.S. 'Marlborough', Portsmouth. (685) \"For the last year, or for about the last 15 months, I have been in the habit of mesmerising a fellow-student of mine. The way I did it was by simply looking into his eyes as he lay in an easy position on a bed. This produced sleep. After a few times I found that this sleep was deepened by making long passes after the patient was off. [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-671n1');) 1 In conversation, I learnt (as I expected) that during the trance Mr. Cleave was to a considerable degree insensitive to pain, and that, on waking, he had no memory of any actions that he had been made to perform, or of what had passed around him. Then comes {ii-672} the remarkable part of this sort of mesmerism. [Mr. Sparks then describes his 'subject's' ability to see, in the trance, places in which he was interested, if he resolved to see them before he was hypnotised; but there is nothing to show that these visions were anything but purely subjective.] However, it has been during the last week or so I have been so surprised and startled by an extraordinary affair. Last Friday evening (January 15 th, 1886) he expressed his wish to see a young lady living in Wandsworth, and he also said he would try to make himself seen by her. I accordingly mesmerised him, and continued the long passes for about 20 minutes, concentrating my will on his idea. When he came round (I brought him round by just touching his hand and willing him, after 1 hour and 20 minutes' trance) he said he had seen her in the dining-room, and that after a time she grew restless, and then suddenly looked straight at him and then covered her eyes with her hands. Just after this he came round. Last Monday evening (January 18th, 1886) we did the same thing, and this time he said he thought he had frightened her, as after she had looked at him for a few minutes she fell back in her chair in a sort of faint. Her little brother was in the room at the time. Of course, after this we expected a letter if the vision was real; and on Wednesday morning he received a letter from this young lady asking whether anything had happened to him, as on Friday evening she was startled by seeing him standing at the door of the room. After a minute he disappeared, and she thought that it might have been fancy; but on the Monday evening she was still more startled by seeing him again, and this time much clearer, and it so frightened her that she nearly fainted. \"This account I send you is perfectly true, I will vouch, for I have two independent witnesses who were in the dormitory at the time when he was mesmerised, and when he came round. My patient's name is Arthur H. W. Cleave, and his age is 18 years. My own is 19 years. A. C. Darley and A. S. Thurgood, fellow-students, are the two witnesses I mentioned. \"H. PERCY SPARKS.\" Mr. Cleave writes, on March 15, 1886:\u2014 \"H.M.S. 'Marlborough,' Portsmouth. \"Sparks and myself have, for the past 18 months, been in the habit of holding mesmeric s\u00e9ances in our dormitories. For the first month or two we got no very satisfactory results, but after that we succeeded in sending one another to sleep. I could never get Sparks further than the sleeping state, but he could make me do anything he liked whilst I was under the influence; so I gave up trying to send him off, and all our efforts were made towards my being mesmerised. After a short time we got on so well that Sparks had three or four other fellows in the dormitory to witness what I did. I was quite insensible to all pain, as the fellows have repeatedly pinched my hands and legs without my feeling it. About 6 months ago I tried my power of will in order, while under the influence, to see persons to whom I was strongly attached. For some time I was entirely unsuccessful, although I once thought that I saw my brother (who is in Australia), but had no opportunity of verifying the vision. \"A short time ago, I tried to see a young lady whom I know very well, and was perfectly surprised at my success. I could see her as {ii-673} plainly as I can see now, but I could not make myself seen by her, although I had often tried to. After I had done this several times, I determined to try and make myself seen by her, and told Sparks of my idea, which he approved. Well, we tried this for five nights running without any more success. We then suspended our endeavours for a night or two, as I was rather over-exerted by the continued efforts and got severe headaches. We then tried again (on, I think it was, a Friday, but am not certain), and were, I thought, successful; but as the young lady did not write to me about it, I thought I must have been mistaken, so I told Sparks that we had better give up trying. But he begged me to try once more, which we did on the following Monday, when we were successful to such an extent that I felt rather alarmed. (I must tell you that I am in the habit of writing to the young lady every Sunday, but I did not write that week, in order to make her think about me.) This took place between 9.30 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday night, and on the following Wednesday morning I got the letter which I have enclosed. I, of course, then knew I had been successful. I went home about a fortnight after this, when I saw the young lady, who seemed very frightened in spite of my explanations, and begged me never to try it again, and I promised her that I would not. \"I must now tell you our method of mesmerism. I lay on my bed, with my head raised on two pillows, and Sparks sat facing me about three feet off on a chair. The lights were made low, and then I watched his eyes intently, thinking in the meantime of the young lady whom I wanted to see. After a short time (about 7 minutes) my sense of hearing left me, and I could see nothing but two eyes, which after a short time disappeared, and I then became senseless. (When we first experimented I could never get farther than this state, and it was only after repeatedly trying that I did so.) I then seemed to see (indistinctly at first) her face, which gradually became plainer and plainer until I seemed to be in another room altogether, and could detail minutely all the surroundings. I told Sparks, when I came round, what I saw, who was with the young lady, and what she was doing, all of which were verified in her letter. \"A. H. W. CLEAVE. The two witnesses of the experiment last described write as follows:\u2014 \"I have seen Mr. Cleave's account of his mesmeric experiment, and can fully vouch for the truth thereof. \"A. C. DARLEY.\" \"I have read Mr. Cleave's statement, and can vouch for the truth of it, as I was present when he was mesmerised and heard his statement after he revived. \"A. E. S. THURGOOD.\" The following is a copy, made by the present writer, of the letter in which the young lady, Miss A. \u2014\u2014, described her side of the affair. The envelope bore the postmarks, \"Wandsworth, Jan. 19, 1886,\" \"Portsmouth, Jan. 20, 1886,\" and the to you? Please write and let me know at once, for I have been so frightened. \"Last Tuesday evening, I was sitting in the dining [room] reading, when I happened to look up, and could have declared I saw you standing at the door looking at me. I put my handkerchief to my eyes, and when I looked again, you were gone. I thought it must have been only my fancy, but last night (Monday), while I was at supper, I saw you again, just as before, and was so frightened that I nearly fainted. Luckily only my brother was there, or it would have attracted attention. Now do write at once and tell me how you are. I really cannot write any more now.\" \"[Signature of Christian name.] It will be seen that Miss \u2014\u2014 mentions Tuesday as the day of her first hallucination; whereas both Mr. Sparks and Mr. Cleave mention Friday as the day on which he first seemed to obtain a vision of the room where she was; and though, in a letter written on March 21st, Mr. Cleave expresses uncertainty on this point, and inclines to the view that his first vision of the room occurred on the Tuesday, \"as I waited for a day or two to see if I should get a letter before I tried again\" on the following Monday, it is impossible to set aside the earlier statement. But in conversation, both he and Mr. Sparks expressed their decided opinion\u2014which accords with what would be naturally inferred from their letters\u2014that Tuesday must at any rate have fallen within the five days running on which trials were made, before the break; and the first incident therefore gives valuable confirmation to the second. Mr. Cleave's omission to write as usual to Miss \u2014\u2014 on the Sunday was perhaps an error of judgment; as it leaves it open to the objector to say that the non-receipt of a letter on Monday morning so wrought on her mind as to conjure up a spectral illusion, to which she had become predisposed by her experience of the previous week. Mr. Cleave explains that though he might naturally enough have imagined Miss \u2014\u2014 to be in the dining-room at that hour, it would have seemed to him more probable, had he made a guess at the scene, that other elder members of the family should also be present, than that she should have been alone with her little brother\u2014which is so far an argument for supposing his vision to have been of the telepathically clairvoyant sort, and not a mere subjective picture. But the nature of his percipience is, of course, {ii-675} a separate question; [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-675n1');) 1 If the case was truly reciprocal, it seems clearly to exemplify the connection of the power to act telepathically with an abnormal extension of the agent's own susceptibility. See pp. [161](#ii-161)-2 and [309](#ii-309)-10. the prime fact in the case is the hallucination produced by his agency. Miss \u2014\u2014, it will be seen, was so seriously disturbed by what occurred that she has requested him not to repeat the experiment. Her feeling is natural enough\u2014it is just one of the natural conditions that \"psychical research\" has to reckon with. Every department in the exploration of Nature has difficulties of its own; and it would be strange if a study that deals with living human material were an exception. That the particular form of obstacle here again encountered (see [Vol. I., p. 109](#i-109)) may make the accumulation of evidence for the rarer psychical phenomena a slow process is probable enough; but that the prolongation of our search should have already brought us a single fresh instance of this rarest type is really a fact of the most hopeful significance, and one which would alone amply vindicate the plan of wide and public inquiry that we have adopted. The next account is perhaps even more remarkable, as the agent was in a normal state. We owe it to Mrs. Russell, of Belgaum, India, wife of Mr. H. R. Russell, Educational Inspector in the Bombay Presidency. \"June 8th, 1886. (686) \"As desired, I write down the following facts, as well as I can recall them. I was living in Scotland, my mother and sisters in Germany. I lived with a very dear friend of mine, and went to Germany every year to see my people. It had so happened that I could not go home as usual for two years, when on a sudden I made up my mind to go and see my family. They knew nothing of my intention; I had never gone in early spring before; and I had no time to let them know by letter that I was going to set off. I did not like to send a telegram, for fear of frightening my mother. The thought came to me to will with all my might to appear to one of my sisters, never mind which of them, in order to give them a warning of my coming. I only thought most intensely for a few minutes of them, wishing with all my might to be seen by one of them\u2014half present myself, in vision, at home. {ii-676} [2](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-675n2');) 2 Note by Mr. Russell:\u2014\"I.e., she was at home, and saw her people, in thought.\" I did not take more than ten minutes, I think. I started by Leith steamer on a Saturday night, end of April, 1859. I wished to appear at home about 6 o'clock p.m. that same Saturday. I arrived at home about 6 o'clock on the Tuesday morning following. I entered the house without anyone seeing me, the hall being cleaned and the front door open. I walked into the room. One of my sisters stood with her back to the door; she turned round when she heard the door opening, and, on seeing me, stared at me, turning deadly pale and letting what she had in her hand fall. I had been silent. Then I spoke, and said, 'It is I. Why do you look so frightened?' when she answered, 'I thought I saw you again as Stinchen' (another sister) 'saw you on Saturday.' \"When I inquired, she told me that on the Saturday evening, about 6 o'clock, my sister saw me quite clearly entering the room in which she was by one door, passing through it, opening the door of another room where my mother was, and shutting the door behind me. She rushed after what she thought was I, calling out my name, and was quite stupefied when she did not see me with my mother. My mother could not understand my sister's excitement. They looked everywhere for me, but of course did not find me. My mother was very miserable; she thought I might be dying. \"My sister who had seen me i.e., my apparition) was out that morning when I arrived. I sat down on the stairs, to watch, when she came in, the effect of my real appearance on her. When she looked up and saw me, sitting motionless, she called out my name, and nearly fainted. My sister has never seen anything unearthly either before that or afterwards; and I have never made any such experiments again\u2014nor will I, as the sister that saw me first when I really came home had a very severe illness afterwards, caused by the shock to her nerves. \"J. M. RUSSELL.\" Mrs. Russell wrote to ask her sister (Fr\u00e4ulein Hoist, of 7, Wohler's All\u00e9e, Altona, Holstein) if she recollected the occurrence, and has copied an extract from her sister's reply, of which the following is a translation:\u2014 \"Of course I remember the matter as well as if it had happened to-day. Pray don't come appearing to me again!\" Fr\u00e4ulein Hoist declines, however, to give an independent account, on the ground of dislike to the subject. I proceed to some more hypnotic cases. The following is an apparently genuine, though isolated, case of the telepathic influence of will on a hypnotic \"subject,\" who however was at the time in a normal state. (Cf. [Vol. I., pp. 89-94](#i-89).) The further experiment with the same \"subject\" recalls the cases in [Vol. I., p. 96](#i-96), and above, pp. [334](#ii-334)-6. We received the account in May, 1886, from Mr. E. M. Clissold, of 3, Oxford Square, W. \"United University Club, \"Pall Mall East, S.W. (687) \"In the year 1878 (I believe), there was a carpenter (Gannaway) employed by me to mend a gate in my kitchen garden, when a friend of mine (Moens) called upon me, and the conversation turning on mesmerism, he asked me if I knew anything about it myself. On my replying in the affirmative, he said, 'Can you mesmerise anyone at a distance?' I said that I had never tried to do so, but that there was a man now in the garden upon whom I could easily operate, and that I would try the experiment with this man, if he (Moens) would tell me what to do. He then said, 'Form an impression of the man whom you intend mesmerising in your mind, and then wish him strongly to come to you.' I very much doubted the success of the enterprise, but I followed out the suggestion of my friend, and I was extremely astonished to hear the steps of the man, whom I wished to appear, running after me; he came right up to me and asked me what I wanted with him. I must explain that my friend was walking with me previously in the garden, and that we had seen and talked to the {ii-677} man whom I subsequently mesmerised, but that when I wished him to come to me I was out of his sight, behind the garden wall, some 100 yards distant, and that I had neither by conversation nor otherwise led him to believe that I proposed to mesmerise him. \"My friend (Moens) is dead; the man Gannaway I have not heard of for more than seven years; but I have this day written to him, and asked him, if he remembers the incident alluded to, to write to me, and in his own language describe the scene. I may tell you that I have not supplied him with any of the above details, but have left him (if he can) to tell his own story. \"E. M. CLISSOLD.\" Mr. Gannaway writes back, in a letter which Mr. Clissold has forwarded to us, that he remembers being often mesmerised by Mr. Clissold, and he recalls some incidents of his experiences; but he does not recollect this particular occasion. One sentence of his letter is as follows:\u2014\"I remember, in the dining-room, when you made me think the same as you were thinking about, and I told you what you were thinking of.\" Mr. Clissold explains that this was an occasion when the Hon. Auberon Herbert was present, and he thus describes it:\u2014 \"June 1, 1886. \"Gannaway was mesmerised, and stood in one corner of my dining-room. Herbert sat at the table, and wrote on a paper a subject on which he wished me to think. Gannaway instantly told me, when I asked him, what the thought was about. Herbert wrote:\u2014 \"'1. I see a house in flames. \"'2. I see a woman looking out of a window. \"'3. She has a child in her arms. \"'4. She throws it out of the window. \"'5. Is it hurt?' &c., &c. \"Gannaway became much excited, as he appeared to witness these scenes acted before him. I am conscious that if there had been mala fides on my part, there was nothing in the experiment; but it was quite honestly conducted, and we were all of us very much surprised at the wonderful accuracy with which Gannaway interpreted my thoughts.\" I wrote to Mr. Auberon Herbert, asking him if he remembered participating in an experiment in thought-transference, made with Mr. Clissold's \"subject,\" Gannaway, in which the ideas transferred related replied:\u2014 \"Ashley Arnewood recollection is as follows; some of the details have escaped me. I thought of a house on fire. Gannaway (a carpenter, I think), on my asking him what I saw, answered quite rightly. I then asked him again what I saw, and he answered quite rightly, 'Fire-engine coming up.' Then the conversation went on (I have shortened it). I. 'Ah! something has happened! what is it?' G. 'A horse, belonging to the fireengine, has fallen down.' (Quite right.) My memory is quite distinct up to this point as to the questions and answers, though I cannot exactly remember the part Gannaway and Mr. Clissold took respectively. I {ii-678} remember very distinctly I thought of and asked these questions, and I believe it was Gannaway himself who answered them directly to me. The next point was that, in answer to what I saw, he said they were throwing feather-beds out of a top-storey window\u2014this also was perfectly right\u2014but on this point my memory is not so clear as on the first three points. I have as clear and positive a memory as a man could have about the three first points, (1) fire, (2) fire-engine, (3) horse falling down. They were all quite fairly asked, and quite fairly answered; and I believe I might add to them the fourth point, 'the feather bed' but I cannot speak positively on this. Then comes a curious point. I imagined an entirely different scene\u2014I cannot recall it, but it was to do with a wood\u2014and his power seemed to fail entirely. He made quite wrong answers. I have no doubt about the truthfulness of the whole proceedings. One night I had mesmerised him, and told him he was in a boat, and attacked by a shark. If I had allowed it, he would have almost battered himself to pieces in striking with both arms upon the floor, where he thought the shark was. [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-678n1');) 1 It is of course important to distinguish this phenomenon (which is of a very ordinary type, and is merely of interest here as indicating the reality of the hypnotic state,) from the telepathic result before described. He was an extraordinary man. It was enough, when you knew him, to look in his eyes to have influence over him. Kindly tell Mr. Clissold I most fully corroborate his statement as far as I know it. \"AUBERON HERBERT.\" Another gentleman who was present on this occasion was Mr. A. T. T. Peterson, of Arnewood Towers, Lymington, who believes that it was he who drew up the programme of the experiment. His account is as follows:\u2014 \"June 24th, 1886. \"I drew out a programme in writing of what I wished the operator to think without speaking, in order to try the mere power of the operator over the patient. On this occasion Herbert was the operator, Gannaway the patient. Programme.\u2014A fire-engine with two horses galloping on a public road. One of the horses falls down; gets up again, and on they go. A house on a rising ground on the left on fire. A woman in her night-dress, with a baby in her arms, imploring for help from the first floor. People are throwing beds out of some of the windows of the rooms, which are taken to opposite where the lady was. The child is thrown out and caught all right. The woman jumps out, and is caught and saved. \"This paper I handed to Herbert, requesting him not to say a word, which request he obeyed. He put Gannaway into trance, and Gannaway acted the part [of spectator, presumably,] to the very letter. \"A. T. T. PETERSON.\". [Mr. Peterson goes on to describe another equally successful experiment where the picture transferred was a fishing-scene. Possibly this preceded the failure which Mr. Herbert mentions.] It is in connection with hypnotism that the most striking telepathic results have been obtained, in the recent rapid development of \"psychical research\" among French men of science. The {ii-679} cases here given were reported to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Psychologie Physiologique towards the close of last year, and were published in the Revue Philosophique for February and for April, 1886. The observations themselves, and the circumstances of their publication, mark a distinct step in the scientific recognition of telepathic phenomena on the Continent. The first report\u2014Note sur quelques Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de Somnambulisme\u2014is from Professor Pierre Janet, of Havre, a Corresponding Member of the S.P.R. (688) docteur Gibert, of a well-known physician of Le Havre, Dr. Gibert, I was able to spend two weeks observing certain curious phenomena associated with somnambulism. ... \"Le sujet sur la campagne, que nous d\u00e9signerons sous le nom de Mme. B. a eu, autant du l'occasion de l'observer. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-679b');)]The subject of these experiments is a good country woman whom we shall call Mme. B. She has always been in good health as far as can be determined, and in particular, when in her normal state she presents none of the signs of hysteria. Except she has been subject since childhood to episodes of natural somnambulism, during which she can speak and describe the singular hallucinations she appears to have. Her character in ordinary life is straightforward, simple and above all very timid. Though her understanding seems quite accurate, Mme. B. has no education, she cannot write and can barely spell out a few letters. Various physicians have already tried to experiment on her, but she has always refused their offers. It is only thanks to M. Gibert's request that she agreed to come and spend several days in Le Havre, from September 24 to October 14, 1885, and it was during this short stay that we had the opportunity to observe her. \"Il est assez facile de mettre Mme. B. en il suffit pour cela de la serrant l\u00e9g\u00e8rement pendant quelques instants.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-679c');)]It is fairly easy to put Mme B. in a state of artificial somnambulism; all that is required is to hold her hand and squeeze it gently for a few seconds. The usual symptoms of deep hypnotic trance presented themselves, including complete insensibility to light, sound, and pain. \"N\u00e9anmoins il est un genre d'excitation auquel Mme. parvient pas \u00e0 le Si que le magn\u00e9tiseur place sa main \u00e9tendue \u00e0 une petite distance au-devant du corps.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-679d');)]Still, there is a type of stimulus to which Mme. B. remains sensitive during the trance. The person who has put her under, and he alone, has the power to bring about at will a partial or general contracture. He need only induce extension in a finger, and it remains as stiff as a piece of wood; no one else can bend it. If then the hypnotist touches, even slightly, the contractured finger, it relaxes at once. To bring about generalized contracture, the hypnotist need only place an outstretched hand a little bit in front of her body. Other persons could not produce these effects in the slightest degree; and in several other ways the person who had hypnotised the subject retained, during her trance, a quite peculiar influence over her. After about 10 minutes of deep sleep, Mme. B. would wake into a somnambulic state, in which she was completely sensible to impressions, and could answer questions. veille. Au lieu le monde, quelquefois avec esprit.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-680a');)]But her character, as has been frequently seen, is no longer at all the same as when she is awake. Instead of being simple and shy, Mme. B. suddenly becomes very bold, lively, willful, and fully inclined to make fun of everyone, sometimes wittily. From this stage she could be wakened to the normal state by the person who had hypnotised her, but by no one else (see [Vol. I., p. 88, note](#i-88n1ref)); if not wakened she soon relapsed again into the state of deep sleep. The first phenomena suggestive of \"psychical\" influence presented themselves in the process of hypnotisation. \"M. Gibert tenait un jour la main mais il mani\u00e8res quelque extraordinaire que cela paraisse, est ici tout \u00e0 pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante, \u00e0 un tel point qu'elle peut remplacer toutes les autres. Si on presse la de Mme. B. sans songer \u00e0 l'endormir, on n'arrive [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-680b');)]M. Gibert one day took Mme. B.'s hand to put her asleep, but he was visibly distracted and thinking of something else besides what he was doing. No trance resulted. The experiment, which I repeated in various ways, proved that to put Mme. B. to sleep, one had to concentrate deeply on the order one was giving her to fall asleep, and that the more the experimenter was distracted, the harder it was to bring on sleep. This influence of the hypnotist's own thought, extraordinary though it may seem, is entirely primary here, to such a degree that it may exclude all others. If one presses Mme. B.'s hand without thinking of putting her under, one does not succeed in bringing about a trance, and, inversely, if one thinks of putting her under without pressing her hand, one succeeds perfectly. Experiments of this sort were often repeated; but it is impossible, as M. Janet fully recognises, absolutely to exclude the hypothesis that the hypnotisation was due to some suggestion of the purpose in view, unconsciously conveyed by gesture, or attitude, or mere silence and appearance of expectation. This objection would not apply to other cases in which M. Gibert, without warning, and at a moment then and there fixed on by M. Janet or another friend, produced a distinct effect on the subject from another part of the town\u2014the fact being immediately verified by M. Janet; who on one occasion found that the \"subject,\" on feeling the impulse to sleep, had only prevented herself from yielding to it by putting her hands in cold water; and on two others, found her in a deep trance from which only M. Gibert could wake her. On the last of these occasions, M. Gibert, at a distance, further willed three times, at intervals of 5 minutes, the performance of certain actions during the trance, which the entranced \"subject\" began to execute, though obviously rebelling against the impulse, and ending with a laugh, \" [Vous ne pouvez pas ... si rattrape.](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-680c');)\"You can't ... if you are distracted even a little, little bit, I come back. \"Mais les suggestions mentales, car ce mot me para\u00eet ici bien \u00e0 sa peuvent faites sur le r\u00e9veil. Le genre: aucun mot il approcha son celui de Mme. B. pendant le sommeil l\u00e9thargique, voir l'effet de cette suggestion qui devait s'ex\u00e9cuter entre 11 cette femme manifeste plus grande l'a pas n\u00e9gative elle sort et continue plusieurs fois \u00e0 la cuisine au salon sans d'ailleurs. ne de plateau\u2014pourquoi veut-on chacun de ces messieurs.' que mental suggestions, which seems to me to be the proper term here, can be conveyed to Mme. B. in another way, with even more success. One has little success, as we have said, when one orders her to carry out the suggestion immediately, during her sleep. Success is greater when one orders her mentally to carry out an act later, some time after she wakes. On October 8, M. Gibert made a suggestion of the following type: without speaking a word, he brought his forehead near hers while she was in a lethargic sleep, and for a few moments he concentrated on the order he was giving her. Mme. B. seemed to feel pain and gave a moan. The sleep did not seem to be disturbed in any other way. M. Gibert told no one what order he had given, but merely wrote it down on a piece of paper, which he put into an envelope. The next day, I returned to see Mme. B. and to observe the effect of the suggestion, which was supposed to be carried out between eleven o'clock and noon. At 11:30, the woman exhibits great excitement, leaves the kitchen she was in, and goes into another room, where she carries off a drinking glass; then, overcoming her shyness, she brings herself to enter the salon, where I was, and, greatly upset, asks whether she had been called. When I reply in the negative, she goes out, and then repeatedly goes up to the salon from the kitchen, though without bringing anything. She did nothing further that day, for she was soon put to sleep by M. Gibert at a distance. Here is what she said during her trance: \"I was shaking when I came to ask you if I had been called\u2014I had to come\u2014it wasn't easy with that tray\u2014why am I being made to carry drinking glasses\u2014what was I to say, then\u2014I don't want you to do that\u2014I had to say something when I got there.\" Upon opening the envelope, I saw that M. Gibert had told Mme. B. the day before \"to offer a glass of water to each of these gentlemen.\" Here again we must admit that the experiment was not a total success. The suggestion was not carried out; but can it be denied that it was understood, at the least? \"Voici maintenant une Gibert et moi, de faire la suggestion suivante: 'Demain \u00e0 midi fermer \u00e0 clef les portes de la maison.' J'inscrivis la suggestion sur un papier que je gardais sur moi et que je ne voulus communiquer \u00e0 personne. M. Gibert fit la suggestion comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment en approchant son front de celui de Mme. B. Le lendemain quand j'arrivai \u00e0 midi moins un quart je trouvai la maison barricad\u00e9e et la porte ferm\u00e9e \u00e0 clef. Renseignements pris, c'\u00e9tait continua le que avait eu aussi son influence. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-681a');)]Now here is a more significant experiment. On October 10, M. Gibert and I agreed to give the following suggestion: \"Tomorrow at noon, close and lock all the doors of the house.\" I wrote the suggestion on a piece of paper and kept it upon my person without showing it to anyone. M. Gibert gave the suggestion as was done earlier, by bringing his forehead close to that of Mme. B. The next day, when I got there at a quarter before noon, I found the house closed and the front door locked. I found out it was Mme. B. who had just closed it. When I asked her why she had done this unusual thing, she replied: \"I was feeling very tired, and I did not want you to come in and put me to sleep.\" M. Bernheim and M. Richet have already spoken of the subjects who invent reasons for themselves in order to explain an act carried out under the influence of a hypnotic suggestion. Mme. B. was then very agitated. She continued to wander in the yard, and I saw her pluck a rose and then go to the mailbox near the front door. These acts have no importance in themselves, but it is curious to note that they were precisely the acts we had briefly considered telling her to carry out the day before. We had decided to give her a different order, to close the doors, but the thought of the first had presumably occupied M. Gibert's mind while he was giving the command, and that thought had also had its influence. \"Voici une troisi\u00e8me exp\u00e9rience qui ne m\u00e9riterait pas lendemain \u00e0 midi et de faire deux fois le tour du jardin. Le lendemain elle fut tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9e \u00e0 mais n'ouvrit pas de parapluie. Je l'endormis peu de temps apr\u00e8s pour calmer une agitation qui devenait de plus en plus grande. Ses premiers mots furent elle n'avait pas voulu ouvrir par un beau temps de peur de para\u00eetre ridicule. La suggestion avait au n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e enti\u00e8rement.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-681b');)]Here is a third experiment that would not be worth including, given its lesser success, but it is still interesting, for it shows to what extent the subject is capable of resisting these mental suggestions. On October 13, M. Gibert orders her, mentally as usual, to open an umbrella and to walk around the garden twice with it, at noon the next day. The next day, she was very agitated at noon, and she went around the garden twice, but without opening an umbrella. I put her to sleep shortly afterward, to ease her constantly growing agitation. Her first words were these: \"Why did you make me walk all around the garden\u2014I looked stupid\u2014at least if it had been yesterday's weather, let us say\u2014but today I would have been totally ridiculous.\" That day it was quite fine, and the day before it had rained a great deal. She had not wanted to open an umbrella in good weather, out of fear of seeming ridiculous. The suggestion was at least understood, if not fully carried out. In April, 1886, Mr. Myers and Dr. A. T. Myers had the opportunity of witnessing some further experiments made with this \"subject.\" [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-682n1');) 1 A fuller account of these experiments will be found in Part X. of the Proceedings of the S.P.R. The times at which the trials were made were always chosen without premeditation. It is true that Mme. B. had come to Havre for a few weeks for the purpose of hypnotic experiments, and may therefore have had a general idea that attempts to influence her from a distance were likely to be made; but the closeness of the coincidences, coupled with the fact that she is not liable to go into spontaneous trances at other times, makes it in the highest degree improbable that the results were due to accident. (1) \"In the evening of April 22, 1886,\" says Mr. Myers, \"we dined at M. Gibert's, and in the evening M. Gibert made an attempt to put Mme. B. to sleep at a distance (from his house in the Rue S\u00e9ry to the Pavilion, Rue de la Ferme), and to bring her to his own house by force of will. At 8.55 he retired to his study; and MM. Ochorowicz, Marillier, Janet, and A. T. Myers went to the Pavilion, where Mme. B. was staying, and waited outside in the street. At 9.22 Dr. Myers observed Mme. B. coming half-way out of the garden-gate, and again retreating. Those who saw her more closely observed that she was plainly in the somnambulic state, and was wandering about and muttering. At 9.25 she came out (with eyes persistently closed, so far as could be seen), walked quickly past MM. Janet and Marillier, without noticing them, and made for M. Gibert's house, though not by the usual or shortest route. (It appeared afterwards that the bonne had seen her go into the salon at 8.45, and issue thence asleep at 9.15: had not looked in between those times.) She avoided lamp-posts, vehicles, &c., but crossed and re-crossed the street repeatedly. No one went in front of her or spoke to her. After eight or ten minutes she grew much more uncertain in gait, and paused as though she would fall. Dr. Myers noted the moment in the Rue Faure; it was 9.35. At about 9.40 she grew bolder, at 9.45 reached the street in front of M. Gibert's house. There she met him, but did not notice him, and walked into his house, where she rushed hurriedly from room to room on the ground-floor. M. Gibert had to take her hand before she recognised him. She then grew calm. \"M. Gibert, before hearing Dr. Myers' statement, said that from 8.55 to 9.20 he thought intently about her; from 9.20 to 9.35 he thought more feebly; at 9.35 he gave the experiment up, and began to play billiards; but in a few minutes began to will her again. It thus appeared that his visit to the billiard-room had coincided with her hesitation and stumbling {ii-683} in the street. She may, however, have hesitated merely because she was not sure of the way. (2) \"On April 23, M. Janet lunched in our company, and retired to his own house at 4.30 (a time chosen by lot) to try to put her to sleep from thence. At 5.5 we all entered the salon of the Pavilion, and found her asleep with shut eyes, but sewing vigorously (being in that stage in which movements once suggested are automatically continued). Passing into the talkative state, she said to M. Janet, ' [C'est vous qui m'avez fait dormir \u00e0 quatre heures et demi.](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-683a');)'You are the one who put me to sleep at four-thirty. The impression as to the hour may have been a suggestion received from M. Janet's mind. We tried to make her believe that it was M. Gibert who had sent her to sleep, but she maintained that she had felt that it was M. Janet. (3) \"On April 24 the whole party chanced to meet at M. Janet's house at 3 p.m., and he then, at my suggestion, entered his study to will that Mme. B. should sleep. We waited in his garden, and at 3.20 proceeded together to the Pavilion, which I entered first at 3.30, and found Mme. B. profoundly asleep over her sewing, having ceased to sew. Becoming talkative, she said to M. Janet, ' [C'est vous qui m'avez command\u00e9e.](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-683b');)'You are the one who ordered me. She said that she fell asleep at 3.5 p.m.\" Writing from Havre on June 18, 1886, M. Janet gives the following brief summary of the results obtained in the particular experiment of inducing \"sommeil \u00e0 distance,\" during this visit of Mme. B. to Havre:\u2014 \"Ne parlons pas des suggestions de sommeil faites par en se tenant devant le ou m\u00eame assez certain que le sujet ne soit pas du tout pr\u00e9venu. Il ne s'agit ici que des exp\u00e9riences tent\u00e9es de loin, de chez M. Gibert ou de chez moi, c'est-\u00e0-dire, \u00e0 500 m\u00e8tres au moins du pavilion o\u00f9 se Mme. B. dans M. Gibert, sont au nombre de 21 pendant ce second s\u00e9jour de Mme. B. au H\u00e2vre. Je ne compte pas un essai fait au milieu apr\u00e8s de Le [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-683c');)]Let us not speak of sleep suggestions made mentally while in the presence of the subject, or even in another room of the house. One is never adequately certain that the subject has received no warning. We treat here only experiments attempted at a distance, from M. Gibert's house or from my own, in other words, from at least 500 meters from the house where Mme. B. was. The experiments carried out in these conditions during Mme. B.'s second stay in Le Havre, either by M. Gibert or by me, number 21. I omit one test carried out in the middle of the night in bad conditions. Let us consider as failures all the experiments in which the subject was not found asleep when we entered the house, and even those in which the subject took more than 15 minutes to go to sleep after the moment of the mental suggestion. The number of these failures was 6, and each may be given a precise explanation. To be retained are 15 precise, complete successes, or else 15 extraordinary coincidences, depending on whether one wishes to view them in the first way or in the second. The next record is from M. J. H\u00e9ricourt, of 50, Rue de Mirom\u00e9nil, Paris. (689) \"L'observation que rapporte \u00e0 laquelle je l'a et faciles \u00e0 comprendre. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-683d');)]The observation I am reporting here dates from 1878, at which time I informed my friend M. Charles Richet of it. He kept it faithfully and prudently in his files, for easily understandable reasons. \"Il ou h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-683e');)]The subject is a young woman of twenty-four, Spanish, a widow with a five-year-old daughter. Despite the most detailed examination, no hysterical, personal, or hereditary flaw was discovered. M. H\u00e9ricourt easily succeeded in hypnotising Mme. D. on the first trial. {ii-684} \"J'endormais Mme. D. avec une facilit\u00e9 ce contact ni du regard: il suffisait de vouloir, tout en m'abstenant de esp\u00e8ce de qui p\u00fbt trahir mon conversation anim\u00e9e au r\u00e9sultat \u00e0 obtenir. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-684a');)]I put Mme. D. to sleep more easily every day. Indeed, after some two weeks of this special training, I could reach this result without need of touching or eye contact. All I needed was to will, while abstaining from any sort of gesture that might reveal my intent. Though she might be in lively conversation in a group of several persons, while I was off in a corner showing the most complete indifference, still I soon could see her, as I willed it, fighting against the sleep that was overcoming her, then submitting to it entirely, or else picking up the thread of her conversation again, according to whether I myself continued or ceased to apply my thought to the desired result. \"Et m\u00eame imaginables des magn\u00e9tiseurs de de mon impuissance. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-684b');)]Further, I could stare at my subject, take her thumbs or wrists, and use all the imaginable passes used by professional magnetizers: if it was not my will to put her to sleep, she remained perfectly wide awake, and persuaded of my lack of power. [Translator's note: The context shows that the masculine gender here refers to mon sujet, i.e., Mme. D., the subject of the passage as a whole.] \"Mais fut encore obtenu. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-684c');)]But soon, I began not merely to produce the effect from the far end of the room, but to attain the same result from one room to another, from one house to another, in a street at a greater or lesser distance. \"Les vint Mme.

I was in my office one day (I was then living in Perpignan), and I had the idea of putting Mme. D. to sleep. I had every reason to believe she was at her home, which was in another street at about 300 meters' distance. I was in any case far from believing such an experiment could succeed. It was three in the afternoon. I began to walk back and forth, thinking very intensely of the result I sought, and I was absorbed by this activity when I was called to see patients. Their cases were urgent, and so I momentarily forgot Mme. D. Anyhow, I expected to see her about four-thirty on the public promenade. When I got there at that time, I was quite surprised not to see her there, but it came to me that my experiment had perhaps worked after all. And so, about five, just to be sure, intending to avoid compromising anything and to put things back to normal, in case there had been any disturbance, I concentrated on awakening my subject just as vigorously as I had concentrated on putting her to sleep earlier. \"Or, ayant eu l'occasion de voir fait son absence la Vers faisaient de plomb, et journ\u00e9e\u2014au \u00e0 ce moment, Mme. D. me dit qu'elle n'avait eu conscience que d'\u00e9prouver un [ {ii-685} [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-684e');)]I had occasion to see Mme. D. in the course of the evening, and here is what she told me, in absolutely spontaneous fashion, without my having made any allusion to her earlier absence. About three o'clock, while she was in her bedroom, she had suddenly been overcome with an uncontrollable desire to sleep. Her eyelids were like lead, and her legs could not hold her up\u2014she never slept during the day\u2014she barely had strength enough to go into her salon and to fall onto a couch. Her servant, having then come in to speak to her, found her (as she put it later) pale, cold to the touch, motionless, as though dead. Understandably frightened, she had begun to shake her mistress vigorously, but without managing to do any more than get her to open her eyes. At that moment, Mme. D. tells me, she was aware only of a raging headache, which apparently went away suddenly about five. That was the exact moment when I had been concentrating on awakening her. \"Ce r\u00e9cit ay ant \u00e9t\u00e9 spontan\u00e9, je aussi probantes que possible, je ne mis pas Mme. D. au courant de ce que j'avais fait, r\u00e9sultats. ces suivant. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-685a');)] class=\"hidetrans\">As this statement was a spontaneous one, I repeat, there was no more room for doubt: my attempt had surely succeeded. So that I might renew it in the strictest possible conditions, I avoided telling Mme. D. what I had done, and I undertook an entire series of experiments, with a number of witnesses who agreed to set the conditions and verify the results. Among these persons, I will mention the medical officer and a captain of the battalion of which I was then the assistant medical officer. [Translator's note: chasseurs then were either light infantry or light cavalry.] All of these experiments may be assimilated to the following type. \"\u00c9tant dans un salon avec Mme. D., son \u00e9tat normal, et se moquant de mon insucc\u00e8s. Un instant plus tard, ou obtenu. pour la d\u00e9monstration. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-685b');)]While I was in a salon with Mme. D., I would tell her I was going to put her to sleep from an adjoining room, while keeping the doors closed. I went into the other room and stayed there for a few minutes while concentrating on keeping her awake. When I came back, there was Mme. D., in a normal state, and joking about my failure. Then, a moment later, or on another day, I would go into the same adjoining room, giving some reason or another, but this time in the firm intention of producing sleep; and after barely a minute, I obtained perfect results. No other form of suggestion besides the mental can be proposed here, since expectation, put into play in full force during the first experiment, was entirely ineffective. The conditions of these experiments, each of which serves as control for the other, are worthy of attention because their simplicity and their value constitute a sort of schema for use in demonstration. \"Mme. D. pr\u00e9tendait que, toutes les fois que et qui me d\u00e9terminait \u00e0 y mettre fin. De fait, apres convention pr\u00e9alable, si je voulais que Mme. D. descend\u00eet de chez elle, je n'avais qu'\u00e0 m'arr\u00eater dans une en donner l'ordre mentalement. Je ne tardais pas \u00e0 la voir arriver, et toujours elle me disait que sa lui avait indiqu\u00e9 ma pr\u00e9sence.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-685c');)]Mme. D. claimed that whenever I thought of her she felt a sharp pain in the precordial region\u2014the same pain she felt when our sessions of somnambulism had gone on too long, and which led to my bringing them to an end. In fact, on prior agreement, if I wanted Mme. D. to come down from her house, I had only to pause in a nearby street and give her that order mentally. I always saw her coming immediately, and she would always tell me that the pain around her heart had revealed my presence. The next account, from Dr. E. Gley, of 37, Rue Claude Bernard, Paris, records some observations of his friend, Dr. Dusart, (published in the Tribune Medicate in May, 1875), on a girl of 14, whom he found suffering from obstinate hysterical attacks, and for whom he easily procured sleep by a simple hypnotic process. (690) \"J'avais observ\u00e9 que, quand, en faisant des passes, je me laissais distraire par la conversation des parents, je produire un sommeil de II fallait donc faire une large savoir. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-685d');)]I had observed that if I let myself be distracted during my passes by the conversation of relatives, I never managed to produce a proper sleep, even after a long period of time. It was seen that the intervention of my will played a large role. But would the will be sufficient without the aid of any exterior manifestation? That was what I determined to discover. \"A cet effet j'arrive un jour avant et, m'assieds alors malade, laquclle avait la face tourn\u00e9e vers la porte personnes sans personne se f\u00fbt l'ordre mental du sommeil, le Dr. et toujours crier et s'agiter, je m'assieds et j'attends que Dr. me donne le signal. Aussit\u00f4t celui-ci donn\u00e9 et l'ordre devant le feu.' [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-685e');)]To that end, I arrived one day before the time agreed upon the day before, and, without looking at the patient, without any gesture, I gave her mentally the order to awaken. I was obeyed at once. As I willed it, the delirium and the outcries began. Then I sat down in front of the fire, with my back to the patient's bed. She was turned toward the door of the room. I spoke with the others there, without seeming to pay any attention to Mlle. J.'s cries. Then, at one point, without anyone having noticed what was happening within me, I gave the mental order for sleep, and sleep occurred. More than one hundred times, this experiment was carried out, with various differences. The mental order was given on a sign from Dr. X., and the effect was always the same. One day I arrived when the patient was awake and in total delirium. Despite my presence, she continued to cry out and to struggle. I sat down and awaited the signal from Dr. X. The moment it was given, and the order formulated, the patient fell silent and went to sleep. \"Did you know I had been here for some time?\" \"No, sir; I realized you were here only when I felt myself going under; that was when I was aware you were sitting by the fire.\" \"Je donnais chaque retourner sur peut-\u00eatre mon ordre serait entendu, malgr\u00e9 la distance, puisque ordre dormir et n'y e\u00fbt ici qu'une simple coincidence. Pour en avoir coeur net et ne laisser prise \u00e0 day, as I was leaving, I gave the order to sleep until a specified time on the next day. One day, I left without remembering this precaution. I was 700 meters away when I realized it. As I could not return, I told myself that perhaps my order would be heard despite the distance, since orders given at a distance of one or two meters were carried out. As a result, I formulated the order to go to sleep until the next day at eight o'clock, and I went on my way. The next day, I arrived at 7:30. The patient was still asleep. \"How can it be that you are still asleep?\" \"But, sir, I am obeying you.\" \"You are mistaken; I left without giving any order.\" \"That's so; but five minutes later, I clearly heard you tell me to sleep until eight. And it's not eight yet.\" This being the time I usually chose for her, it is possible that habit had brought about an illusion, and that the whole thing was a mere coincidence. To clear my conscience and eliminate all doubt, I ordered the patient to sleep until she received an order to wake up. \"Dans la journ\u00e9e, (7 en donnant du [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-686b');)]During the day, I had a bit of free time, and decided to complete the experiment. As I left my home (7 kilometers away), I gave the order to awaken. I noted the time as two o'clock. On my arrival, I found the patient awake. Her parents, on my recommendation, had marked the exact time of her awakening. It was strictly the time at which I had given the order. This experiment, repeated several times, at different times of day, gave the same result every time. \"Mais voici qui para\u00eetra plus concluant encore. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-686c');)]But here something even more decisive. 1er janvier, je suspendis mes une direction oppos\u00e9e et me trouvant \u00e0 10 kilometr\u00e8s de la malade, je me demandai si, malgr\u00e9 la encore possible de me faire ob\u00e9ir. Je d\u00e9fends \u00e0 [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-686d');)]On January first, I ceased my visits and ended all contact with the family. I had heard nothing more of them by the twelfth, when, during my errands, I was headed in an opposite direction and was located some 10 kilometers from the patient. I began to wonder whether it was possible, despite the distance, the ending of the relationship, and the intervention of a third party (since the father was by then magnetizing his daughter), for me still to be obeyed. I forbade the patient to go let herself be put to sleep. Then, half an hour later, I came to think that if by some exceptional chance I had been obeyed, that could harm the poor girl. I cancelled the order and forgot about it. \"Je fus fort surpris, lorsque le lendemain, \u00e0 6 heures matin, chez moi un expr\u00e8s portant une lettre du p\u00e8re de Mile. J. Celui-ci me disait que la veille, \u00e0 je l'avais permis. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-686e');)]I was greatly surprised when, the next morning at six, I received at home an express letter from the father of Mlle. J. He informed me that on the day before, the 12th, at ten in the morning, he had been unable to put his daughter to sleep without a long and very painful struggle. Once asleep, the patient had stated that if she had resisted, it was on my order, and that she had gone to sleep only when I permitted her to. \"Ces d\u00e9clarations quelques d\u00e9tails circonstanci\u00e9s.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-687a');)]These statements were made in the presence of witnesses whom the father had had sign the notes containing them. I have kept this letter, whose contents were only later confirmed by M., with a few circumstancial details. \u00a7 3. I come now to the spontaneous cases. The following seems to be an instance of casual spontaneous transference of an idea; and strikingly exemplifies the latency of the impression, and its emergence after several hours, which has been so frequently noted in the course of this work. Mrs. Lethbridge, of Tregeare, Launceston, Cornwall, 1886. (691) \"In December, 1881, my husband was slowly recovering from a severe illness; and one afternoon, about 5 o'clock, I went into his study, where he had gone for 2 or 3 hours, to see if he wanted anything. Finding him asleep in his armchair, I left him, and having some village lending-library books to sort, I went into the small room where they were kept, called the 'box-room' (in a distant part of the house), to do so. There, to my surprise, I saw our gamekeeper's dog, Vic, curled up. On seeing me she rose, wagged her tail, turned half round and lay down again. This dog had never been inside the house before, which was the reason of my surprise at seeing her where she was. However, I turned her out of doors, and there I thought the matter ended. I am quite sure I did not mention the matter to my husband. \"He went to bed very early that evening, and had a most restless night, talking a great deal in his sleep. While fast asleep he related the whole occurrence of 'Hawke's dog, Vic,' actually being found in the box-room, even describing the animal's behaviour, rising, turning half round and lying down again. Next morning I asked my husband if he had dreamt? 'No, not that he knew of.' If he had not dreamt of Vic? 'No, why of Vic?' Then I asked him if by any chance he had heard where Vic had been found the previous evening?' No. Where?' And when I told him, he was extremely astonished, just because the dog had never been known inside the house before, and the box-room was on an upper landing. Subsequently I related to him what he had said in his sleep, but he evidently had not the slightest recollection of it. \"MILLICENT G. LETHBRIDGE.\" In answer to inquiries, Mrs. Lethbridge adds:\u2014 \"I am glad my account interested you, and regret extremely that it cannot be corroborated, for I fully understand the necessity in investigations such as yours to obtain perfectly trustworthy evidence, and free from intentional or unintentional exaggerations or inaccuracies. My dear husband died about 16 months ago. On receiving your letter I tried to find out whether he mentioned the occurrence in his diary, but unfortunately the diary of that year (1881) was left behind in England. {ii-688} \"From mine, which I succeeded in finding, written at the time, I copy out the following brief notice, dated Dec. 14th, 1881. 'Baron talked a great deal in his sleep last night, and curiously enough he described how the terrier was found curled up on the mat in the box-room, which actually happened yesterday, probably for the first time in the terrier's life, for I was so amazed at finding the dog in so unusual a place that I called the children to see it. But the strange part is this, Baron was asleep in the study at the time, and no one had told him of the occurrence. Of this I am quite sure.' \"I mentioned the occurrence to several people at the time, but as it happened 5 years ago, I doubt if any of them would recall it quite accurately.\" [Mr. Lethbridge's complete forgetfulness is clearly a strong indication that the news of the occurrence had not reached him in any normal way\u2014e.g., by overhearing the children speaking of it.] The following experiences belong to a class whose force, in the cumulative proof of telepathy, is comparatively small\u2014the class of mere impressions, without any sensory affection; but they are in themselves well-evidenced cases, the records of the impressions having been carefully written down before the news of the corresponding event arrived. The narrator is Mr. J. C. Grant, of 98, Cornwall Gardens, S.W.; from whose very full journal they were copied by the present writer. Mr. Grant desires that the names of the persons mentioned shall not be printed; but says that \"the fullest information is open to private inquiry.\" The instance which was second in date is given before the earlier one, as being more complete, and is the only one to which I have attached an evidential number. (692) Entry in diary for April 11, 1882. \"A very strange thing happened to me last night. It has happened once before. After being asleep some little time, I was wakened up, quite quietly and with no dread or horror, but with the absolute and certain knowledge that there was a 'presence' in my room. I looked everywhere into the darkness, implored it to appear, but to no effect; for though I have the gift of 'feeling,' I have not that of 'sight.' I felt certain, in fact was told by it, that it was to do with Bruce [Christian name]. I thought it was his father\u2014I was sure it was: I thought he must be dead. [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-688n1');) 1 Mr. Grant explains this sentence as follows:\u2014\"I knew his father to be very seriously ill, which no doubt was the reason why my thoughts took this direction.\" All this took place in about a couple of minutes or so; and as I saw I could see nothing, I got up, struck a match, lighted the candle at my bedside, and looked at my watch. It was just 14 minutes past 12 o'clock. I then put out the candle; but all feeling of the presence had gone. It had spoken as only a spirit [2](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-688n2');) 2 See [p. 48, note](#ii-48n1ref). can speak, and then had passed away. I did not get to sleep for a long time, and was very unhappy for poor Bruce. ... I {ii-689} have been quite out of sorts all day for poor old Bruce, to whom I wrote this morning. Told M. and R. of my feeling and experiences of the night.\" [The entry for April 12 mentions a conversation with Mr. and Mrs. M., in which Mr. Grant remembers that he described the occurrence.] Entry for April 13. \"In afternoon went over to my aunt M.'s, had a long talk with her, told her and J. and others all about my presentiment. I have not heard from poor Bruce yet.\" Entry for April 14. \"Up early, at half-past seven\u2014expecting a letter. The letter has come, as I expected\u2014deep black edge; but it is not his father, but his brother, that has died, poor old E., date and all, on Tuesday. ... I wrote to him this morning. I will not tell him of my strange meeting of Tuesday morning or Monday night. ... Witnesses to this strange pre-knowledge of mine: Mrs. R., my housekeeper; Mrs. C., my aunt; J., my cousin (Captain C.); other cousins, Mrs. M. and Mr. M., Mr. H. R., and Mme. G. So you see [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-689n1');) 1 The journal, though a private one, is in many parts written as if addressed to an imaginary reader. I am not without my authorities, besides my written journal.\" Entry for April 15. \"Wrote a long letter to my father, giving him what news there was, and telling him about my queer experience.\" The following is a copy, made by the present writer, of a letter written to Mr. Grant by Mr. M., on June 3, 1886:\u2014 \"We distinctly remember your telling us about the strange circumstance that took place before [2](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-689n2');) 2 The wording of this letter, and Mr. Grant's expressions above, illustrate what I have more than once remarked on\u2014the common tendency to describe what are really telepathic impressions, coinciding with or closely following real events, as prophetic and premonitory. See [p. 535, note](#ii-535n1ref), and p. [569](#ii-569). the death of one of your friends. The details have escaped our memory, but we remember that it was a case of premonition, which was afterwards verified. \"C. W. M.\" The date of death appears in the Times obituary as April 10, 1882. This was Monday, not Tuesday; and probably Mr. Grant assumed that the day on which his friend heard of the death was the day of the death itself. The death, which took place in China, can only have fallen within 12 hours of his experience if it occurred in the few hours preceding midnight. Mr. E. T. R., who died, was an intimate friend of Mr. Grant's, but not so intimate as his brother Bruce. \"Entry in diary for Wednesday, Dec. 10, 1879. (Mr. Grant was at the time in Southern India.) \"Yesterday I had a peculiar sensation. When I say yesterday, I mean last night. ... I have as it were an inner eye opened. I had a sort of unconscious feeling that, if I were to wish it, I could see some strange visitant in the chamber with me\u2014someone disembodied. [Here {ii-690} follow some words of description which, though general and not distinctive, apply perfectly to the particular person who, as it turned out, died at the time, and would have applied equally naturally to only a small group of persons. Mr. Grant has what appear to me valid reasons for withholding the clause from publication.] I forced the idea from me, and fell into a troubled sleep.\" Entry for Dec. 11. \"Went in afternoon to the library; thence to C.'s. Hear by telegram, while there, of the death of my uncle, Mr. C., on Tuesday. Wonder if that had anything to do with my feelings the night before last.\" We find in the obituary of a leading newspaper that the death took place on Dec. 9, 1879. Mr. Grant states that he had had no idea that anything was the matter with his uncle. I have studied in Mr. Grant's diary the full record of a third case, which was even more remarkable than the first, as it included the peculiarity that, for some time after his first impression, he felt forcibly impelled to draw the figure of the person who died. The case was made the more striking to me by the fact that Mr. Grant was so certain that the death (the, time of which he had only very vaguely learnt) must have coincided in date with his impression, that he had actually not taken the trouble to verify the coincidence. He left it to me to find in the Times obituary\u2014as he confidently foretold that I would\u2014that the death (which was quite unexpected) occurred, thousands of miles from the place where he was, on the day preceding that on which the entry in his diary, relating his impression of the previous night, was written. The impression of that night did not, however, bear distinct reference to the particular person who died, but was a more general sense of calamity in the family. Certain reasons which at present make it desirable not to publish the details of this case may in time cease to exist. Mr. Grant writes, on May 31, 1886:\u2014 \"Except on these three occasions, I have never, to the best of my recollection, had any feeling in the least resembling those described.\" To pass now to examples where the senses were concerned\u2014the following is an auditory death-case of the ordinary type. The narrator is Mrs. Evens, mentioned above (pp. [176](#ii-176) and [344](#ii-344)). (693) In 1885, Mrs. Evens filled up a census-form (p. [7](#ii-7)) with the information that about September, 1858, in the early hours of the night, she, experienced an auditory hallucination representing the voice of a \"most intimate and deeply attached friend. She died suddenly that night. The lady was French. We had been very intimate, and she had frequently mesmerised me for neuralgia. We had been parted for more than a year\u2014she in France and I in England. I had been to sleep, but woke as if I were called. I sat up, saw nothing, but heard distinctly, in the well-known and beloved voice, 'Adieu, ma ch\u00e9rie' (her name for me). {ii-691} It was not till a week after that I heard of her sudden and quite unexpected death (she not having been ill) on that night. At the time, I had no feeling of surprise or fear. I may mention that only during the last year I heard, in an indirect manner, that, under the pressure of great horror, she was supposed to have committed suicide.\" In reply to inquiries, Mrs. Evens writes:\u2014 \"Oldbank, Enniskillen. \"December, 1885. \"I was staying in a country house, but not with (at that time) very intimate freinds, [sic] and I cannot feel sure that I mentioned the circumstance. I shall be writing to one of them soon, and will ask if she remembers my speaking of it at all. The recollection, except as to precise date, is as vivid in my mind as ever\u2014the tone of the voice, as of one not stationary, but leaving the room by the door, [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-691n1');) 1 I have mentioned ( [Vol. i., p. 573](#i-573)) how frequently visual hallucinations, alike of subjective and the telepathic class, present this feature of movement. which was on the left side and near the head of my bed; and likewise the words, distinctly spoken. I left France in 1857, and my friend died in 1858. It was the year before my marriage, and I was then a girl of 20. I had no terror, or even surprise; but equally little when I heard of her sudden death, which I seemed to have foreknown. As to the hour, I gathered that it must have been tolerably simultaneous with the death. We did not go to our rooms till 11 ever in that house. I had the sensation of being awoke out of my first sleep. My friend was found dead and cold (in her house in Alsace) between 4 and 5 in the morning. Having led a wandering life since my marriage, I have kept no letters of so long ago. The circumstances of the loss of my beloved friend, and my firm belief inker desire to take leave of me, are both indelibly impressed on my memory. I wish, for the sake of science, my details were more satisfactory. \"I was a parlour boarder from '55 to '57 (inclusive) at the Ch\u00e2teau Giron, then a large and well-known school. Mme. H. was one of the principals; the friendship between us was of a very close and unusual kind. She was just the sort of woman whose 'will' once more to see a dear friend would triumph over almost any difficulties, as I always believe it did. \"AGNES EVENS.\" In reply to further inquiries, Mrs. Evens adds:\u2014 \"In my own mind I always associate the hearing of the voice with a Sunday night. You will say this is unreliable, and so it is, but I find that in the recollection of my domestic events, births, deaths, &c., my recollection of the day of the week, with its associations, is more reliable than that of the date. \"As to any other [auditory] hallucinations, the only one I can remember is the sound of music unusual in character, &c., but it took place when I was worn out with nursing and grief, and I have always assigned it to an abnormal condition of the nervous system, associated with a time of such sorrow that I can hardly bear to go back upon it. \"I seemed not so much to be awoke by the voice as to wake to hear it. I had no doubt as to whose it was; it produced the effect of a passing, not stationary, voice; the words, distinctly uttered, were 'adieu, ma ch\u00e9rie.' I heard yesterday from the friend with whom I was staying at {ii-692} the time. She says, 'We both' (herself and sister) 'well remember about your friend Mme H., and what a terrible attack of neuralgia you had just at the time when she died.' I had forgotten this latter circumstance. It would account in some measure for the want of distinctness in my recollections.\" We have procured from the Registrar at Rappoltsweiler an official certificate of the death, which states that it occurred at 2 p.m., on Sept. 5th, 1858. This was a Sunday\u2014which confirms Mrs. Evens' recollection. The death must have preceded her experience by at least 10 hours. The next case, also auditory, is apparently one of direct reproduction of the agent's sensation. (See cases 267-270.) It is from Mr. J. G. F. Russell, of Aden, Aberdeenshire (the narrator of case [196](#c196)). The agent was a near relative who had been making a long stay with Mr. and Mrs. Russell. {ii-693} \"32, Upper Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, W. \"December 18th, 1885. (694) \"On Wednesday, December 2nd, 1885, I was woke up at night, between 12 p.m. and 2 a.m. (as far as I can recollect), by hearing myself distinctly called from a small passage outside my bedroom door; the voice seemed to come from just outside the door itself. I got up, fearing Mrs. Waller, in the adjoining room, was ill, but, as the calling of my name was no longer repeated, I did not then disturb her. (There is no door of communication between the rooms, the wall is solid, and a gigantic wardrobe is against it.) Next morning I asked her if she had called me during the night; but she declared she had slept 'like a top,' and had never thought of me or anyone else. I did not mention the incident to her sister (who had just left us after a long visit), but she (Mrs. Waller) did, on returning to the country. I enclose what Miss Young wrote to me, solely from her sister mentioning to her my having questioned her. The dates correspond exactly; it was the first night of Mrs. Waller's visit. \"J. G. F. RUSSELL.\" The following is the extract from Miss Young's letter to Mr. Russell:\u2014 \"I will tell you something that has struck me rather. The two nights my sister was with you in London were very disturbed nights to me; you were continually in my dreams, and one of those nights I found myself sitting up in bed, having woke myself up by calling you loudly by name. When she came back she told me you had asked her one morning whether she had called you in the night, as you had distinctly heard your name. I wish I could remember which night it was. I have an impression it was the first. \"BLANCHE YOUNG.\" Mr. Russell (who gave me the account viv\u00e2 voce on December 16th, a fortnight after the occurrence,) has explained that the wall between his room and the next is so thick that even a very loud cry in one would be almost inaudible in the other. He has never had such a hallucination on any other occasion. The following cases are visual. The first is from Mr. Teale, of 50, Hawley Road, Kentish Town, N.W. \"June, 1886. (695) \"In 1884, my son Walter was serving in the 3rd King's Royal Rifles Regiment, in the Soudan. The last we had heard from him was a letter informing us that he was about to return to England, which he expected would be about Christmas time. Things were in this position on the 24th October, 1884, when on returning home in the evening, I said, (noticing my wife looking very white,) 'Whatever is the matter with you?' and she said she had seen Walter, and he had stooped down to kiss her, but owing to her starting he\u2014like\u2014was gone, so she did not receive the kiss. \"After that we had a letter from the lady nurse at Ramleh Hospital to say that the poor boy had a third relapse of enteric fever; they thought he would have pulled through, but he had been taken, and when we had that letter, it was a week after he died. But the date when the letter was written corresponded with the date of the day when Walter appeared, which was on the 24th October, 1884. [When Mr. Teale used these words, he had not referred to the letter, and was under the impression that it had been written on the very day of the death, which (as will be seen below) was October 24.] \"My son Frederick, Selina, and Nelly were in the room, but none of them saw Walter; only Fred heard his mother scream, 'Oh!' and Fred asked her what was the matter. I thought, having heard many tales of this kind, I would set it down; so I put the date on a slip of paper. He was in his regimentals, and she thought he had come on furlough to take her by surprise\u2014knowing the back way; but when she saw he was gone, and the door not open, she got dreadfully frightened. \"FRED. J. TEALE.\" Mrs. Teale herself died in April, 1886, after an illness due in great measure to the shock of the bereavement. Mr. Teale has shown me the letters which were received during August, September and October, 1884, respecting his son's condition. A letter, dated August 20, which the son dictated and signed, states that he is in hospital, down with enteric fever. The next letter, dated September 7, which was similarly dictated and signed, states that he has had a very serious illness, but is much better, and hopes soon to be home. The next letter, dated October 12, from Sister Thomas, states that he had had a bad relapse a fortnight previously, but \"is getting on very nicely now.\" This was the last letter received before October 24. In a letter dated October 52, Lieutenant W. H. Kennedy states that the death had taken place on the preceding day; and in a letter dated October 28, Sister Thomas states that the death occurred about 2 o'clock p.m., on Friday, October 24. This date has been confirmed to us by an official communication from the Depot at Winchester. In conversation, Mr. Teale explained to me that his wife's experience took place between 7 and 8 in the evening\u2014which would be between 7 and 8 hours after the death. She was at the time sitting at the table, talking. The son who was present is at a distance; but Miss Teale {ii-694} showed me how the persons in the room were placed, and described to me how she saw her mother start, and heard her exclamation. Mr. Teale is certain that his wife never experienced any other visual hallucination; and he says that she was of anything but a brooding temperament, and was not at the time anxious about her son. His note of the date of the vision was on the back of an envelope, which he carried in his pocket-book. He thought that this envelope was lost; but was kind enough, at my request, to make a search, which brought it to light. The envelope, which lies before me, bears his address, and the post-mark London, N., Feb. 22, 84; the pencil note on the back of it is 24-10-84. The next case is from the Rev. R. Markham Hill, of St. Catherine's, Lincoln. \"June 17, 1886. (696) \"On the evening of Easter Sunday, about 8 or 9 years ago, I think, I was just beginning my supper, feeling very tired after the day's work, when I saw the door opening behind me. [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-694n1');) 1 See [p. 612, note](#ii-612n1ref). I was sitting with my back to the door, but could just see it over my shoulder. I may also have heard the opening, but cannot speak with certainty upon this point. I turned half round, and just had time to see the figure of a tall man rushing hastily into the room, as if to attack me. I sprang up at once, turned round, and threw the glass, which I held in my hand, at the spot where I had seen the figure, which had disappeared in the act of my rising. The disappearance had, however, been too sudden to arrest the act of throwing. I then realised that I had seen an apparition, and I immediately connected it with one of my uncles, whom I knew to be seriously ill. Moreover, the figure which I saw resembled my uncle in stature. Mr. Adcock came in, and found me quite unnerved by the occurrence; and to him I related the circumstances. I don't remember telling him that I connected the vision with my uncle. The next day a telegram came announcing my uncle's death on the Sunday. My father was summoned to my uncle's death-bed unexpectedly, on the Sunday evening as he was sitting at supper, and the death must have coincided in time with what I saw. \"R. MARKHAM HILL.\" The Rev. H. Adcock, of Lincoln, writes:\u2014 \"June 16, 1886. \"I called on my friend, the Rev. Markham Hill, one evening, and found him apparently in an exhausted condition in an arm-chair; he told me, before I could ask for any explanation, that he had just seen the figure of his uncle standing opposite to him against the wall, behind a piano; that he lifted up a glass from the table, and was about to throw it at him, when the figure vanished. He said he felt convinced that he should very shortly hear of his uncle's death. It was only the following day, or the day after, that he showed me a letter received that morning informing him that his uncle had died on the day when the appearance took place.\" In conversation, Mr. Podmore learnt from Mr. Hill that he was alone at the time. He has had no other visual hallucination in his life, unless it were an experience which impressed him in somewhat the same way as this one, but which may well have been merely a case of mistaken identity. {ii-695} Mr. Adcock explained that the above incident must have occurred about 12 years ago. He cannot remember whether it was a Sunday evening. We find from the Register of Deaths that Mr. Hill's uncle died on April 5, 1874, which was Easter Sunday. [It would be difficult to account for the hallucination here as due to anxiety respecting the uncle's condition. If a person's mind, from brooding over the condition of a sick relative, is led to evolve a phantasm of that relative, we should certainly expect the appearance to be recognised; and we should not expect its character to be at once unfamiliar and formidable. It will be seen that the two accounts differ as to whether the glass was actually thrown.] The next example belongs to the \"borderland\" class. It is one of the cases where the agent's bond of connection has apparently been with someone who was in the percipient's company at the time of the experience, rather than with the actual percipient. (Cf. Nos. [242](#c242) and [355](#c355).) The narrator desires that his name may not appear, as the family of the agent, whom he has already assisted liberally, might base on the incident described a sentimental claim to further favours. \"June 12, 1886. (697) \"There can be no doubt whatever that there is some transmission for which no explanation has yet been given by the savants. \"I am a practical business man, and look upon all theories of Spiritualism, &c., as so much humbug that only deludes weak-minded people. But at the same time, I recently had an experience of a most extraordinary character, which I should scarcely have believed if related to me of anyone else, and the plain facts of which I will give as they actually occurred. \"I had in my employ a clerk who contracted an illness which incapacitated him from regular attendance at his duties. He was absent about six months in 1884, and, on leaving the hospital, as I found that he was unable to resume his regular work, I agreed with him that he should come to the office whenever he felt able to do so, and that I would pay him for the work so done. This arrangement continued for some months; then, at the beginning of April, 1885, he had to stay away altogether for two or three weeks. He seemed in fair general health, but he was troubled with a diseased ankle-joint, which prevented him from getting about. I was in no anxiety on his account, however, and had no apprehension of any serious illness. My wife, who knew Mr. Z. from seeing him occasionally at my private house, did not even know that he was absent from the office at this time. \"On the night of the 27th-28th April, I was wakened by my wife calling out convulsively, 'There is someone looking at you.' Though by no means timid as a rule\u2014a practical woman, not subject to nervous fancies of any kind\u2014she was much disturbed and terrified. She jumped out of bed, and turned up the gas. Finding no intruder in the room, and all the doors locked, she got back into bed; but she was shivering all over, {ii-696} and it was some time before I succeeded in quieting her. The clock in the hall struck 1 during this disturbance. \"In the morning we referred to the incident, and I told my wife she must have been suffering from nightmare. \"Later on that day, news was brought to my office that poor Z. had passed away in the night. When I got home in the evening, my wife met me as usual at the door, and I said to her, 'I have some sad news to tell you.' Before I could say more she replied, 'I know what it is; poor Z. is dead. It was his face which I saw looking at you last night.' \"I afterwards learnt, from a man who lodged in Mrs. Z.'s house, that he had died just at 1 o'clock in the morning of the 28th, and that in the delirium which preceded his death, he called upon me to look after his wife and children when he was gone.\" Mrs. B., the percipient, writes:\u2014 \"I have read this paper through, and the contents correctly describe what transpired. I was awake, when I saw the face. I have never experienced any similar occurrence.\" [The last sentence is in answer to the question whether she had experienced a hallucination of the senses on any other occasion.] We have verified in the Times obituary the fact that Z. died on April 28, 1885. Mr. Podmore has examined the clerk whom Mr. B. despatched to make inquiries of the widow on hearing of the death,\u2014i.e., on the afternoon of April 28\u2014and who has since heard Mrs. B. narrate her experience. So far as he could recollect, Mrs. Z. told him that Z. died about 1.30 a.m., certainly at an early hour in the morning. He did not remember to have heard anything about the dying words, &c. The following is a \"borderland\" case of the ordinary type. The percipient, Emma Burger, has been for 6 years in the service of our friend and colleague, M. Ch. Richet, and has his most complete 1886. Radstadt, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 Br. mariage \u00e9tait convenu. Emma B. partit le 1 chez Madame d'U., ou elle \u00e9tait alors en La sant\u00e9 de o\u00f9 avait toutes En et n'avait la sant\u00e9 de son fianc\u00e9. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-696a');)]Emma Burger, aged 24, born at Malsch near Radstadt, had become formally engaged to marry M. Charles Br. in Paris. The marriage had been agreed to. Emma B. left on August 1st for Mme. d'U.'s home in Usrel (Corr\u00e8ze), where she was in service at that time. M. Charles Br. was in good health, or at least he appeared entirely healthy. In any case, the marriage had been arranged, and Emma B. was in no way concerned about her fianc\u00e9's health. \"Quelques jours apr\u00e9s son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Usrel, ou Emma B. re\u00e7ut une lettre de Charles, lui apprenant [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-696b');)]A few days after she reached Usrel, on August 7 or 8, Emma B. received a letter from Charles, letting her know that he was leaving Paris for a few days in the Ardennes on family business. \"Le 15 ao\u00fbt, jour de la f\u00eate de Sainte alors \u00e0 Usrel. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-696c');)]On August 15, the Feast of the Assumption, Emma B., who was not devout, felt a great sadness, and shed abundant tears during the pilgrimage that then used to occur at Usrel. \"Le soir de Madame d'U. A c\u00f4t\u00e9 de son lit \u00e9tait la petite porte d'un escalier de service, porte masqu\u00e9e par le rideau du de sorte personne qui dans devait se {ii-697} lever et \u00e9carter le rideau du bas du lit pour voir qui entrait par l'escalier. Voici le r\u00e9cit que m'a fait E. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-696d');)]That same evening, August 15, E. was sleeping as usual in a small dressing room adjoining Madame d'U.'s room. Beside her bed was the small door to a back stairway, hidden by the bed-curtain, so that anyone in the bed was obliged to get up and pull the curtain away from the foot of the bed to see who was coming up the stairway. Here is the story as E. told it to me. \"'Vers onze heures et demie du s'ouvrait. Je me suis mise \u00e0 genoux sur soulever le personne ne alors que Il \u00e9tait debout, son chapeau et sa canne \u00e0 la main droite, de la main gauche tenant la porte entr'ouverte, et restant dans l'entreb\u00e2illement de la porte. II avait un costume voyage\u2014son costume habituel. clart\u00e9 traits, physionomie, et le d\u00e9tail de son costume. Il avait une figure souriante, m'a une porte et qui s'en va. [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-697n1');) 1 This way of describing the sense of a door closing is of interest, suggesting a vaguer form of what in other cases has appeared as a distinct part of the hallucination. See [p. 612, note](#ii-612n1ref); and compare d'U., je lui eu un cauchemar.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-697a');)]About eleven-thirty at night, I had just gone to bed. The servants were not all in bed yet, for one could still hear sounds in the house. Madame d'U. was in bed in the next room with her door open. I then heard a very slight sound, as though the door of the small staircase were being opened. I knelt in my bed to raise the curtain and warn the person who was coming in that Madame d'U. was in bed and not to make any noise or go through her room. Then I clearly saw Charles Br. in person. He was standing in the open door, with his hat and cane in his right hand, holding the door partly open with his left hand. He had on his usual traveling costume. There was a night-light in the room, but I was so surprised that I did not think to wonder whether it gave enough light to explain the extreme clarity with which I saw his features, his looks, and the details of his clothing. He was smiling, and he looked at me without speaking, without crossing the threshold. I was unable to suppose that it was not Charles himself, however improbable his sudden appearance in Usrel was, and so I spoke sharply to him. \"What are you doing here? Madame d'U. is here. Get out! Get out!\" As he was silent, I repeated, \"What do you want? Get out! Get out!\" Then he answered very calmly, with a smile: \"I have come to say goodbye. I am off on a trip. Farewell!\" At that moment, Madame d'U. was awake in the next room, and reading in bed. She could hear me speaking, and she said to me \"What's the matter, E.? Are you having a dream?\" But instead of answering her, for I still thought Charles Br. was really there with me, I said to him, in a lower voice this time, \"Go away, go away!\" And then he disappeared, not suddenly but like someone who goes off and closes the door behind him. Only then, as Madame d'U. asked again, more insistently, did I answer her: I pensai Br. venu me surprendre, et je me mis \u00e0 ne pas lui avoir demand\u00e9 pas de la presence formelle, en chair et en os, de Charles Br. \u00e0 la porte de ma chambre. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-697b');) ]I was fully awake, since I had just gone to bed and had not yet fallen asleep. I remained awake for a while, thinking that Charles Br. had come to surprise me. I was sorry I had not asked him where he was taking a trip to. But I didn't worry about it excessively, and after some time I fell calmly asleep, without imagining in the least that it had been anything except the physical presence of the flesh-and-blood Charles Br. at the door of my room. \"'Le lendemain matin je fus fort \u00e9tonn\u00e9e de ne parler de Charles Br. Je qu'on jouait sorte de finis quand il \u00e9crira. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-697c');)]The next morning I was greatly surprised that no one mentioned Charles Br. I thought someone was playing games with me. Finally I decided I would ask if someone had been brought into my room. I was assured that was not the case; I was teased about my dreams; and I finally came to think that I had had a dream, or rather, somewhat illogically, I avoided thinking about the several improbabilities the visit involved. I said to myself that I would know the truth when he wrote to me. \"'Le lendemain, 18 [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-698a');)]The next day, August 18, about nine in the morning, I received this letter: \"'\"MADEMOISELLE,\u2014Monsieur C. vient de recevoir par d\u00e9p\u00eache t\u00e9l\u00e9graphique la nouvelle de la mort de M. Charles Br. Il est mort le 16 du courant. Nous nous joignons \u00e0 vous pour le regretter. [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-698b');)]Mademoiselle,\u2014Monsieur C. has just received a telegram announcing the death of M. Charles Br. He died the 16th of this month. We share your grief. \"'\"PERRIN, Concierge. \"'\"26, Rue Marignan, Paris. \"'\"le y a une erreur; que la lettre a nuit du 15 au 16 ao\u00fbt, d'une maladie du coeur que tout le s'\u00e9tait ant\u00e9rieurement traduite par aucun [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-698c');)]You may well imagine that I was stupefied by this letter. Since then, I have learned that Charles Br. died during the night of the 15th of August, from an unsuspected heart condition that had not previously been revealed by any symptom. We have made repeated and urgent applications to the Maire of the commune where the death occurred, for a copy of the Acte de D\u00e9c\u00e8s, but have received no reply. The Vicomtesse d'Ussel wrote to us on April 1, 1886, that Emma Burger was in her service in the summer of 1875, at Corr\u00e8ze, and slept in a room adjoining her own; but she does not remember hearing of the incident. She remembers noticing, however, towards the end of the stay, that Emma Burger was in distress, and learning afterwards that this was due to the death of some one about whom Emma had never told her. The percipient has had in her life two hallucinations representing a person whom she knew to be dead. But the first of these did not occur till 9 years after the incident above described; and they can scarcely therefore be regarded as diminishing the force of the coincidence. The following is a copy made by M. Richet of a letter written to Emma Burger by a friend, Madame Aurousseaux, who heard from her of the vision before the news of the death arrived. \"Vous me demandez si je me fianc\u00e9.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-698d');)]You ask if I remember your dream. I remember as if it were today. I remember perfectly our Assumption-day pilgrimage, and everything you told me about your dream, and also what you told me about your fianc\u00e9. On May 13, 1886, M. Richet writes:\u2014 'Pour ce vous donner d'int\u00e9ressants d\u00e9tails. J'ai pu faire venir chez moi la personne qui a eu la confidence de Emma Burger avant que la mort de Charles Br. soit une de Madame d'U. Le lendemain matin, elle a dit e'est vrai.\" [ [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-698e');)]I can give you some interesting details about the case of Charles Br. I was able to see the person in whom Emma Burger confided before his death was made known, and here is what she told me. \"On August 15, Assumption Day, Emma was not herself. She was sad, but trying to act happy; she seemed almost crazy that day. That evening, there was a big dinner, but since Emma was maid to one of the children, she dined in the child's room with me; I was a wet-nurse at that time. Then, about ten, we each went to bed in our own rooms, and the baby slept with me in mine. Emma slept alone in a little room next to Madame d'U's big room. The next morning she told Jeanne, the Countess d'U.'s chambermaid, \"You sent somebody to see me last night.\" Jeanne laughed, and it was then that Emma told me she had had a very happy dream, in which she saw her fianc\u00e9 in her room, and that when she had awakened, she felt very sad and could not sleep the rest of the night. Then I said to her \"Hush, you are crazy,\" and we all made fun of her. But she said \"I am sure it was he who came, and you can't make me change my mind. Tease me all you want, but I am sure it is true.\" \"'JEANNE AUROUSSEAUX, \u00e0 Tragny, fianc\u00e9.'\" [ Translation]P.S. I have just shown the letter I am writing you to Emma Burger, for I questioned Aurousseaux in Emma's absence. She approves the letter entirely, but says only that instead of being happy she was very oppressed, though not worried, and it was after she was teased so much that she answered back, \"Why yes, I was very happy to see my fianc\u00e9!\" The following is a collective case. It will be seen that we have no proof that the second witness independently recognised the figure; at the same time, the way in which the figure disappeared, if correctly remembered, tells strongly against the hypothesis of mistaken identity. The narrator is Mr. Amos Beardsley, M.R.C.S., of Grange-over-Sands, Lancashire. He had sent us a shorter account in 1883. \"June 28th, 1886. (699) \"From 1845 to '50 I lived between the villages of H\u2014\u2014 and L\u2014\u2014, in Derbyshire. The landlord of the chief hotel in L\u2014\u2014 had a farm just opposite my house, from which I used to get my supplies of milk and other dairy produce. I had also been called in on one occasion to attend his wife in illness. One evening, probably in August or September, I had been out with my boy, John Howitt\u2014a connection of the poet, William Howitt\u2014hunting for moths, and was returning home about 9 p.m., as far as I can remember. We had just passed a railway cutting which crossed the road, or rather which was intended to cross the road; for the cutting\u201416 or 20 feet deep\u2014had been brought within a few yards of the roadway on either side, but had not yet been carried through it. Just after passing this part I turned round, and saw, as I thought, E., the owner of the farm referred to, crossing the road\u2014having apparently just come in by a footpath on the right\u2014in the direction of a corresponding footpath a little lower down on the left. I had noticed that the cutting had been carried right through the footpath, so that passengers would have to make a d\u00e9tour, and thinking that E. was probably not aware of this, and might run some risk of falling down the embankment, I sent the lad after him, to warn him of the danger. The lad ran off at once; the distance was not more than 100 yards or so; but when he got to the stile, the man was nowhere to be seen. He could not have got clear away in that short interval; but we searched the cutting to see if he had by any ill-chance fallen down there. There was nothing to be seen; and after spending about half an hour in a fruitless search, we returned home. {ii-700} Next morning, Howitt came to me with a scared face to tell me that E. had fallen down dead the night before, about 9 p.m., just after he had offered to make a blasphemous wager. \"That is all the story. I could not, and did not, for a moment doubt my recognition of E.'s figure. My eyesight is good, and I think it hardly possible that I could have been mistaken. Why the apparition should have come to me I cannot say, unless, perhaps, the dying man's thoughts turned instinctively towards me as a doctor. I have never had any hallucination of the senses,\u2014unless this apparition was one.\" We find from the Register of Deaths that E. was found dead in his bed, from heart-disease, on July 25, 1847. Dr. Beardsley does not profess to have gathered the circumstances of his death from eye-witnesses; and the imagination of neighbours would be likely to exaggerate the suddenness with which the supposed punishment followed on the transgression. Mr. Podmore has questioned Mr. John Howitt, now butler at the ShipBuilding Yard Board Rooms, Barrow. He has no real independent memory of the incident, though when Mr. Podmore repeated Dr. Beardsley's account, he said, \"Now you seem to bring it all back to me.\" He was only 14 at the time. Dreams, as has been so often pointed out, being a specially weak class of evidence, it was not my intention to give any further specimens in this chapter; but at the last moment some records have been received which claim admittance. The force of cases where a dream exactly reproduces the thoughts of a person in the dreamer's vicinity is so much increased by their multiplication in the experience of the same two persons, that the following additional instance, from the narrators of case [90](#c90), needs no apology. Mrs. Fielding writes:\u2014 \"Yarlington Rectory, Bath, 19th May, 1886. (700) \"I sleep badly, and on Monday night it was 2 o'clock when I slept. I had, for half-an-hour before going off, fixed my mind upon every turn and corner of my girlhood's home (where I have not been for above 20 years) in Scotland. My father, a squire, had a neighbour squire, called Harvey Brown. In my whiling away the night, I dwelt upon him, and his house and family, particularly. My husband knew him only by name, but of course, knew my home, and loves it as much as I do. He and I awoke at 6. Before a word of any kind was said, he said to me, 'I have had such a strange dream about Harvey Brown, and been at the old home, wandering about it.' What made it seem stranger is that Harvey Brown is a man we never spoke of in our lives, or for 20 years have ever thought of, till Monday night in idleness I went over old meetings with him; and I was wide awake and my husband asleep; he had slept heavily all the night after a 12 mile walk; so there was no possibility of my leading his mind near Scotland, in any conversation even, before he slept. \"JEAN ELEANORA FIELDING. \"J. M. FIELDING.\" The chief interest of the next case depends on the repetition of the dream. I have implied ( [Vol. I., p. 358, note](#i-358n1ref)) that distinct repetition on {ii-701} several successive nights, though by no means unexampled, is very decidedly rare, in dreams of purely subjective origin; and the repetition in a case of telepathic origin may fairly be taken as an indication of that special intensity which is shown also in other ways\u2014notably often by the exceptional sense of reality surviving into waking hours (see case [482](#c482)). I do not, however, number the account, as the closeness of the coincidence cannot be completely determined. The narrator is Dr. Gibert, the leading physician at Havre, who was concerned in de 84 ma m\u00e8re, portes de distance deux du matin, au milieu son ma m\u00e8re r\u00e9veille en criant, 'L'oncle [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-701a');)]The event took place in the spring of 1849.

We were living at La Monnaie, in the country just outside Geneva, 4 kilometers from the old man's dwelling. He was in perfect health. During the Sunday night, two days after his visit, at two in the morning, while asleep, my mother awoke crying \"Uncle is dead! I can see him lying with his arms outstretched!\" My father tried to reassure her, but no one got any more sleep that night. \"Le lundi, mon p\u00e8re nous [Translation](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-701b');)]On Monday, my father told us about my mother's dream, and we found it comic, telling him that if Uncle were dead, someone would have come to let us know.

Monday night, at the same time, my mother woke again, and cried as before \"Uncle is dead!\" Finally, on Tuesday night, the same scene. On Wednesday, my father, who was a justice of the peace, asked me to go to Petit Sacconex with him, in order to convince my mother that her triple dream was nothing but a dream. We had scarcely reached my uncle's house when we were told that the old man had not been seen for three days. His small, isolated house was shut up completely. My father pried off a shutter, and we saw the old man lying in the kitchen. We got in by way of the stables. The poor fellow was lying dead with his head in the fireplace, face down, arms extended. I was about to lift him when my father pointed out to me that his skull had been smashed. He had been murdered. The murderer was captured, sentenced to death, and executed. After his sentencing, he made a complete confession. He had killed the old man Sunday between noon and one. Thus my mother's dream had occurred twelve or thirteen hours after the crime. \"DR. GIBERT.\" We have procured from the D\u00e9partement de Justice et Police, at Geneva, a copy of the Proces-verbal made by the official who inspected the scene of the crime immediately after the murder was discovered, and who received on the spot the evidence of M. Gibert p\u00e8re. This document completely confirms Dr. Gibert's account of the murder, and of the discovery of the body lying face downwards on the hearth\u2014the arms however, not \"\u00e9tendus,\" but \"raccourcis sous l'estomac\"; but it shows that his recollection is not correct as to dates and days. The murder was discovered about 6 p.m. on Thursday, November 9, 1848; and M. Gibert p\u00e8re stated that he had made the visit to the house, which led to {ii-702} the discovery, on hearing that his uncle had not been seen by the neighbours since the Tuesday evening. It seems probable therefore that the murder was committed on the Tuesday night. [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-702n1');) 1 If, as Dr. Gibert says, the murderer made a full confession, it is probable that some record of the hour of the murder exists. But we cannot obtain any information as to such a confession, either from official sources or from the leading Geneva newspaper; and the Secretary of the D\u00e9partement de Justice tells us that the man always persisted in his denial, and that the hour remained doubtful. He adds, \" [On a suppos\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait le soir.](javascript:toggleLayer('tii-702');)\"We assumed it was evening. It may fairly be supposed that Dr. Gibert is at least as likely to be right in his statement that the dreams fell on the nights immediately preceding the discovery, as in his statement of the particular days of the week on which they fell\u2014since his recollection of the days of the week is connected with his recollection, proved incorrect, as to the day on which the murder fell; and this hypothesis is somewhat favoured by his recollection that there was an interval of more than a day between the last visit of M. Borel to the Giberts' house and the first dream. It is not improbable, therefore, that one of the dreams very closely coincided with the murder. But after this dream there would be room for only a single repetition\u2014on the Wednesday night. The next two cases illustrate the point so often emphasised\u2014the psychological identity of dreams and waking phantasms\u2014in a rare and interesting way; a telepathic impression taking effect first as a dream, and afterwards as a hallucination. In the first of the two cases there was an interval of a good many hours between the two experiences. [2](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-702n2');) 2 Compare case [659](#c659); and also case [283](#c283), where the hallucination preceded the dream. For cases where a hallucination has been itself repeated after an interval, see [p. 237, note](#ii-237n1ref). In the second case, the visual hallucination was apparently a prolongation of the dream-image into waking moments (see [Vol. I., pp. 390-1](#i-390)); but the waking experience included a further feature\u2014a hallucination of hearing. The following account was obtained through the kindness of Mrs. Walwyn, of 9, Sion Hill, Clifton, Bristol, who has known the narrator from a boy. \"February 24th, 1886. (701) \"'I dreamed that Maggie, my sister-in-law, had been taken seriously ill. The next evening, when I went into the dining-room to have my usual smoke previous to going to bed, just after I entered the room, Maggie suddenly appeared, dressed in white, with a most heavenly expression on her face. She fixed her eyes on me, walked round the room, and disappeared through the door which leads into the garden. I felt I could not speak; but followed her. On opening the door and outside shutter nothing was to be seen. I vouch for the truth of this. \"'H. E. M.'\" Mr. M.'s mother writes to Mrs. Walwyn:\u2014 \"H. and his wife were in England in the autumn, and returned on the 9th November. They had been visiting the parents in L.\u2014General and Mrs. R. They left the next younger sister apparently in her usual health. On Friday, the 20th, she was at the theatre with friends. At 1 a.m. she {ii-703} was seized with violent internal pains; these continued all day, but no danger was apprehended till 4.45 p.m., when she became insensible, and at 5.15 all was over. The cause of death, 'perforation of the stomach.' On the Saturday night H. dreamt that Maggie had been taken dangerously ill; the next evening when he went into the dining-room as usual to have his smoke previous to going to bed, just after he entered the room Maggie suddenly appeared to him. [Mrs. M.'s description of the appearance exactly coincides with her son's account.] \"He told me in the morning what had happened. I tried to persuade him it was only an optical delusion, but he knew better. Why the apparition should have come to H. is most extraordinary, for he was not in the least superstitious, nervous, or fanciful. The only way we can account for it is that the telegram which the General sent off on Sunday never reached us, and it was actually Wednesday, the day of the funeral, before we heard the sad news, and she might have known this and come to tell us that she was gone. \"R. L. M.\" We find from an obituary in the Leamington News that Miss R. died on 21st November, 1885, and that she \"remained perfectly conscious until 5 o'clock, when she suddenly collapsed and died in a quarter of an hour.\" The final case is from Mr. M. S. Griffin, San Remo, Weymouth. {ii-706} {ii-707} \"May, 1886. (702) \"I have been requested to give an account of an odd coincidence which occurred some three years since. (I am no believer in spirits, and believe the following was the result of illness.) I was in the tropics, and, at the time I mention, laid up with fever, when one night I had a dream about an old lady friend of mine. I woke up suddenly, and thought I saw her at the foot of my bed, and the strange part was I thought I heard her speak. She seemed to be dressed in white. I told this to a friend, who only laughed at me and said I was ill, but at the same time, he put down the date and hour. A few mails after, I heard of the old lady's death, at the same date and hour. I have no belief in spirits whatever, but this was a fact.\" In answer to inquiries, Mr. Griffin supplied the following fuller account. \"June 15, 1886. \"At the time of the occurrence, June, 1882, I had been in Jamaica for about 18 months. I had been ill with country fever, but was convalescent, though still very weak. I was sleeping in a room next that of a friend, with the door open between. I had a dream, in which my mind went back to old times when I had seen much of the lady I mentioned; and then I became aware that she was dead, in a room which seemed to be near me, and that I wanted to get to her; and as this thought flashed across me, I seemed to see her. Then I woke with a sudden start, and distinctly saw her standing at the foot of my bed, dressed in white, and with the hands by her side. The face was extremely distinct, and quite unmistakeable. Had a real person been standing in that place, I certainly could not have distinguished the features, as it was {ii-704} a dark night. [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-704n1');) 1 See [Vol. i., pp. 462 (note)](#i-462n1ref) and [551](#i-551); and compare case [698](#c698), above. The figure plainly pronounced my name, 'Marcus,' once, and then gradually disappeared as I watched it. It remained visible a sufficient number of seconds for me to be keenly aware that I was awake; I felt quite clearly, the former experience was a dream, then I woke, and now this is a waking reality. After the disappearance, I called out, and my friend came in. I described the whole experience to him, and he was sufficiently impressed with it to notice the time\u2014which was a few minutes past midnight, June 11th\u2014and to note the occurrence at once in his diary. The next morning he and others laughed at the matter, but could not but be impressed by its reality to me. \"About three weeks afterwards, I received a letter from a daughter of my friend, informing me of her mother's death in England, on June 11th, soon after 5 a.m. My friend and I calculated the difference of longitude, and the hours corresponded to within a few minutes. I had no idea of the lady's being ill, and had neither been anxious about her nor thinking about her. In conversation with the family, two years later, they told me that a few minutes before her death she said, 'Tell Marcus I thought of him.' I may mention that this lady had, three years before, nursed me through a dangerous illness; and I had a warm affection for her. \"I do not recollect on any other occasion in my life experiencing the continuation of a dream-image into waking moments; nor have I ever had a hallucination either of sight or hearing. \"MARCUS SOUTHWELL GRIFFIN.\" Mr. Griffin kindly allowed me to copy the following sentence from the letter which announced the death:\u2014 \"Alphington. \"June 17, 1882. \"Mother died on St. Barnabas' Day [i.e., June 11], at 5.20, and was buried on the Thursday following, June 15th, 1882.\" We have verified the date of death in the Register of Deaths. The next letter that Mr. Griffin received made it quite clear that the 5.20 was a.m.; and in conversation with the family since, the death was described to him as having taken place before breakfast. [Mr. Griffin has now no separate recollection of the date of his vision. He had an idea that the death had been on June 15, not having looked for some time at the letter in which it was announced, where it will be seen that June 15 (the day of the funeral) is the only day of the month mentioned, the day of the death being otherwise described. The \"June 11\" in the foregoing account was added after he had referred to this letter. But there can, I think, be no reasonable doubt that he is justified in his conviction that his vision took place on June 11. He can hardly be wrong in his recollection that he and his friend made a careful computation of the longitude, with a view to ascertaining how close the coincidence was; and that they specially noticed a slight discrepancy. (The difference of longitude being about 73\u00bd\u00b0, the time of the death would correspond with about 12.30 a.m., not 12.10 a.m.; so that if the two times are quite accurately given, Mr. Griffin's experience preceded the death by about 20 minutes.) Now persons who took this amount of trouble with regard {ii-705} to the hours, may fairly be assumed not to have made a gross blunder as to the identity of day; even if Mr. Griffin is mistaken (which there is no reason for supposing) in his recollection that the means for establishing the identity of day were there in black and white before them. It is to be hoped that the diary has been preserved, and that the evidence will in time be completed by our obtaining the entry. The friend who made it is at present in America, and Mr. Griffin has written to him, but doubts whether the last address given will now find him. He is sure, he thinks, to have news of him before very long. I may mention that Mr. Griffin's mother told me that her son gave her a full description of the occurrence on his return to England, not very long after it took place.] I naturally cannot convey to others the full effect of Mr. Griffin's viv\u00e2 voce description. Though he had not attributed any scientific importance to the incident, he impressed on me that his own experience, taken alone, and quite apart from the facts which he learnt afterwards, was to him absolutely unique\u2014by far the strangest and most perplexing thing that had ever happened to him. It gave him precisely the same vivid feeling of astonishment that the sanest of my readers would receive if they looked up from this page, and saw a friend standing palpably before them, who gazed at them, addressed them, and then vanished into air. As regards the coincidence, Mr. Griffin will allow me to add that the view expressed in his first account\u2014namely, that his own illness was a sufficient explanation of his experience, and that the coincidence therefore was accidental\u2014is not that which he now holds. I pointed out to him (as so often in the course of these pages) that the theory of accident which would be the reasonable one if the particular experience in question stood alone or nearly alone in our generation, becomes unreasonable when the case is only one of a large class; and I can only hope that others may agree with him in finding this argument as just as it is obvious. Here I must stop. Cases continue to reach us which may claim a place in a future collection; but time is needed for inquiry into their details; and the limits of space proposed for the present work have already been overpassed. To those whom it may have interested, its last word must be a reminder that to them we look for vigorous aid in the accumulation of further facts, which may confirm or modify our conclusions. {ii-724} {ii-725} TABLE OF NUMBERED CASES. |IN COLUMN IV.| |A Auditory. ||M = ||O = Olfactory. | |E = Emotional. ||S = Sensation pain, | = |IN V.| |H = Husband. ||w = Wife. | |F = Father. ||m = Mother. | |S = Son. ||d = Daughter. | |B = Brother. ||s = Sister. | |U = Uncle. ||a = Aunt. | |N = Nephew. ||n = Niece. | |C = Cousin (male). ||c = Cousin (female). | |G = Grandfather or Grandson. ||g = Grandmother or Granddaughter. | |FR = Friends. |[1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-707n1');) 1 It has not been possible to draw the line between acquaintance and friendship with precision.

Cases 88 and 90 have been omitted in reckoning the percipients, it being doubtful which of the two persons concerned was the percipient, and which the in reckoning the agents. [This and the following superscript refer to the same footnote. \u2014Ed.] percipients, 370, or 42 per cent., were males, and 512, or 58 per cent., females. Of 708 [1](javascript:toggleLayer('ii-723n1a');) 1 Where the same person has been concerned on more than one occasion as percipient or agent, each such experience has been reckoned for the purpose of the calculation as a distinct case. Cases 88 and 90 have been omitted in reckoning the percipients, it being doubtful which of the two persons concerned was the percipient, and which the agent; and in reckoning the agents. [This and the preceding superscript refer to the same footnote. \u2014Ed.] agents, 448, or 63\u00b73 per cent., were males, and 260, or 36\u00b77 per cent., females. The preponderance of female percipients cannot be assumed to indicate any superior susceptibility in that sex to telepathic impressions (see above, p. [3](#ii-3n1ref), last sentence of first note). The preponderance of male agents is probably to be accounted for by the fact that men are more liable than women to accidents and to violent deaths, and that a larger proportion of them die at a distance from their nearest relatives and friends. Analysing the results of column V, we find that, out of 830 cases, the agent stood to the percipient in the relation of Parent or child in 193 cases, or 23\u00b73 per cent. Brother or sister in 122 cases, or 14\u00b77 per cent. Husband or wife in 52 cases, or 6\u00b73 per cent. Cousin, uncle, &c. 75 cases, or 9\u00b70 per cent. Friend in 263 cases, or 31\u00b77 per cent. Acquaintance in 89 cases, or 10\u00b77 per cent. Stranger in 36 cases, or 4\u00b73 per cent. It will be seen that only in 47 per cent. of the cases is any blood-relationship known to have existed between the parties; and since in many cases the relatives of the percipient will have naturally belonged also to the circle of his intimate friends, it seems reasonable to conclude that consanguinity, as such, has little if any predisposing influence in the transmission of telepathic impressions. It may be suggested that the comparative infrequency of such transmissions between husbands and wives is probably due to the fact that it is commoner for married persons than for blood-relations to be together, when one of the two dies. It is noteworthy that, out of 36 cases in which the agent was a stranger to the percipient, no less than 15 are collective cases in which an intimate friend of the agent was one of the co-percipients, and may be held to have constituted the link between the agent and the stranger percipient. On the other hand, it is possible that the examples that have been given of telepathic affection by strangers show somewhat less than the true proportion; as there may be cases belonging to this category which for evidential purposes must be dismissed, the fact of coincidence, which alone could distinguish them from purely subjective hallucinations, having been unsuspected and unknown.
