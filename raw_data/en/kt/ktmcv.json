Naturopaths assess the whole person, taking into consideration physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of the individual. Gentle, non-invasive techniques aregenerally used in order to stimulate the body's inherent healing capacity. A number of different approaches are used. Diet and Nutritional supplements, botanical medicine, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, hydrotherapy and lifestyle counseling are the mainstays of naturopathic medicine. Individual diets and nutritional supplements are recommended to address deficiencies, treat disease processes and promote health. The benefits include increased energy, increased gastrointestinal function, improved immunity and general well being. Botanical Medicine is a plant based medicine using herbal teas, tinctures, capsules and other forms of herbal preparations to assist in the recovery from injury and disease. These compounds are also used to boost the body's immune system and preventdisease. Homeopathy is a form of medicine based on the Law of Similars- that is the use of tiny extremely diluted doses of the very thing that causes symptoms in healthy people.These minute doses of plant, animal or mineral origins are used to stimulate the body's ability to heal itself. Homeopathy is a powerful tool and affects healing on a physical and emotional level. Asian Medicine includes acupuncture, as well as the use of botanical formulas and dietary changes to eliminate disease and balance body functions. Acupuncture refers tothe insertion of sterilized needles through the skin into underlying tissues at specificpoints on the surface of the body. Sometimes moxa (a compressed herb in the form of a stick) is burned over an acupuncture point to help relieve symptoms. Botanical formulas may be given in the form of pills, tinctures or decoctions (strong teas) to be takeninternally or used externally as a wash. Herbal formulas may include shell, mineral, animal and plant materials. Dietary advice is based on traditional Chinese medical theory. Hydrotherapy refers to the use of hot and cold water applications to improve circulation and stimulate the immune system.
