Introduction Coriander is an amazing herb that is used for culinary and medicinal purposes. From the oldest times it is known in the Mediterranean region, Africa and the Middle East, central Asia, India and China.1 The old Greeks, Egyptians and Romans were familiar with it. Pliny (Plinius), the famous Roman historian, tells us that \"the best coriander came from Egypt'\".2 It is also very popular in Latin America, and it is getting more appreciated in the West. It appears under many names because of its use in many places and times. From the old Sanskrit name kustambari, many modern versions are derived such as the Indonesian kutumbar and the Tamil kotamali. There is another reference from the Persian geshniz being the basis for the central Asian names. In Arabic it is known as kzbara. Most of the European names originate from the Latin coriandrum or the Greek corianon. In English coriander leaves are often referred to as cilantro and the fruits as coriander. The fruits are also known as seeds. Coriander is also found under the names Indian parsley or Chinese parsley because of the close resemblance to its cousin parsley.1 In India it is known as dhanya or dhanyaka, which means \"the rich one\".3 It deserves its name because of its many culinary and medicinal uses. For culinary purposes, some regions prefer the fruit and others, the leaf. Most of the people like the taste of the fruit and would describe it as warm, nutty and spicy. Some even find an orange-like quality. The leaves are appreciated by almost everyone in Asia and Latin America, and they are described as fresh, green, tangy and even citrusy. Central and Northern Europeans are on average not very fond of the taste and would describe it as soapy, like burnt rubber, or even like crushed bed bugs. Coriander is very good in bringing together the aromas of different spices. That is the reason why it is found in spice mixes even in regions where it is not used separately.1 It is less known that a very deep knowledge was used in designing the curry and spice blends in which coriander is an important component. The intention was to balance and heal.4 Using food as medicine is an important idea of Ayurveda and other systems that developed from it. Another use is in preparing medicines for an amazing variety of health problems with studies confirming the old knowledge and opening new possibilities. The treasure of the \"rich one\" is immense, and it is very exciting to explore it. 2. Botanical description The botanical name is Coriandrum sativum. It is classified in the family Apiaeceae, formerly known as Umbeliferaeae.5 This family is also known as the carrot family and has many important members, such as anise, asafetida, caraway, celery, dill, fennel, and parsley.60 -Parts used - Fruit and fresh leaves. -Description: Coriander is an annual with erect stems, 1-3 feet high, slender and branched. The lowest leaves are stalked and pinnate, the leaflets roundish or oval, slightly lobed. The segments of the uppermost leaves are linear and more divided. The flowers are in shortly-stalked umbels, five to ten rays, pale mauve, almost white, delicately pretty. The seed clusters are very symmetrical, and the seeds fall as soon as they are ripe. They are quite round like tiny balls. They lose their disagreeable scent on drying and become fragrant. The plant is bright green, shining, glabrous and intensely fetid. Gerard describes it as follows: \"The common kind of Coriander is a very striking herb. It has a round stalk full of branches, two feet long. The leaves are almost like the leaves of the parsley, but later on become jagged, almost like the leaves of Fumitorie, but a great deal smaller and more tender. The flowers are white and grow in round tassels like Dill.\" Cultivation: \"Coriander likes a warm, dry, light soil, though it also does well in a somewhat heavy soil... It is sown in mild, dry weather in April, or in the wormer month of March.\" \"As the seeds ripen, about August, the disagreeable odor gives place to a pleasant aroma and the plant is then cut down with sickles and when dry the fruit is threshed out.\" The parts used are: the fruit and sometimes the fresh leaves for salads and soups. The fruit (so-called seeds) are of globular form, beaked, finely ribbed, yellowish brown, 1/5 inch in diameter, with five longitudinal ridges, separable into two halves (the mericarps), each of which is concave internally and shows the broad, longitudinal oil cells (vittae). The seeds have an aromatic taste and when crushed, a characteristic odor.2 This plant is a native of the Mediterranean region and is intensively grown in India. It is cultivated in all the states and is an important subsidiary crop in the black cotton soils of the Deccan and south India and is also important in North India.6 \"The coriander grown in Russia and central Europe (var. microparcum) has smaller fruits less, than 3 mm, and contains more essential oil than the oriental variety ( var.vulgare), which is greater than 3 mm and is cultivated for fruits and leaves.\" 1 Constituents- Coriander fruit contains about 1 percent of volatile oil, which is the active ingredient. It is pale yellow or colorless, and has the odor of Coriander and a mild aromatic taste.2 Terpene alcohols are the main component and up to 80 % goes to linalool. 7 Its essential oil consists of linalool called coriandrol (60-70 %), geraniol and borneol .8 oil also has anethole, (Williamson 2003) 3. The fruit yields about 5 percent of ash and also contains malic acid, tannin and some fatty mater.\"2 Drayaguna Vijnana, the Gana classification coriander according (pungent), is ushana Kapha dosha. Karma trishnanigrhena (thirst depressant) It is used in fevers, loss of appetite and indegestion. Parts used are fruits and oil. Dose 1-3 g. 9 Formulations based on Dnayaka Medica we will find that \"Dhanyaka is astringent, bitter and sweet in taste, cardiac tonic, digestive stimulant and carminative. It cures casa (coughing), trt (morbid thirst) and chardi (vomiting). It is useful for the eyes. Green kustumbari (dhanyaka), when used in different ways, imparts good taste, fragrance and cardiac tonic property to various excellent types of vegetables. The dried kustumbari is sweet in vipaka and unctuous. It cures trt (morbid thirst), daha (burning) and aggravated doshas. It is slightly pungent and bitter.

Benefitted organs are the bladder and stomach. It is carminative, aromatic and diuretic.8 According to Sebastian Pole, the virya (energy) is cooling (leaves) and warming (seed). Its Ayurvedic actions are dipana (appetite stimulant), amapacana (toxin digester), sulaprasamana (aleviates sluggish appetite), trshaghna (alleviates thirst), hot skin Kurt Schaubelt states, \"Because of the high linalool content, this oil is tonifying and strengthening. In addition, a series of coumarin compounds together with linalool provide a mild euphoric effect.\" 7 4. Uses \"Coriander seeds are a good household remedy for many pitta disorders, particularly those of the digestive tract or urinary system.\" 13 They can be used together with burdock seeds, which have similar indications.14 \"This popular Indian curry ingredient is also an invaluable medicine; it soothes an irritated digestive system and cools any burning sensations in the body. Its sweet aroma subtly lifts the spirits. Dhanyaka is a proper noun also meaning rich.\" It is used in dosages 1-30 g/day or 3-15 ml/day of a 1: 3@45 % tincture. It is often used with sugar to increase the anti-pitta effect. 3 Digestion. Coriander seed is an excellent remedy for promoting Pitta digestion as it enkindles agni but does not aggravate acidity.

It included turmeric, cumin seed, coriander, ginger, asafetida and chili pepper along with garlic and onions saut\u00e9ed in ghee (clarified butter).4 The basis of Indian curry is three important spices: cumin seed which is heating, carminative and with a strong spicy flavor; coriander seed which is cooler and has a milder spicy flavor and turmeric root, pleasantly bitter and only slightly spicy tasting, imparts a golden color to the food. It has liver detoxifying, blood moving and digestive properties.

Contraindications and interactions with drugs and minerals According to Pole, \"There are no known contraindications and drug-herb interactions for Coriander. The herb is very safe.\" 3. Dr. Schnaubelt also states that there are no known contraindications. 7 So coriander is considered to be a very safe herb, but there is some advice on avoiding the coriander essential oil in the first three months of pregnancy due to its mildly stimulating effect. 40 Many members of the Apiaecae family, formerly known as Umbelliferae (or the carrot family), are more prone than other species to causing allergic reactions. Among them is contact dermatitis due to handling or local application. This can sensitize to other members of the family. Aside from coriander, members of this family are carota).44 In some cases there is interaction between vitamin supplements taken in high doses and drugs or minerals. That interaction can work in two ways. Drugs and minerals can lower the vitamin absorption and reduce its serum levels, or increase its metabolism and excretion. In those cases it is good using plants that contain the vitamin that is deficient.45 Another way of interaction is when the vitamin or mineral can raise the drug or mineral serum levels or reduce their effect. Many people take mineral supplements, and interactions with drugs are documented. Consumption of herb sources that contain the mineral is not going to cause the same effect, but it has the potential of exacerbating it (when a supplement is used). Herbs are an adequate source of minerals when high potency mineral supplements cannot be used due to drug interactions. Mineral elements have a toxic potential when used in excessive quantities. This is a point that goes in favor of using natural sources of mineral ingredients instead of high concentrations of mineral inorganic supplements. 46 Cilantro leaves are rich in calcium. 47 Calcium as carbonate has interactions with some drugs and minerals. Documented in human studies, cilantro lowers the serum level or effects of levothyroxine, and in the case of tetracycline leads to insufficiency. Drugs that lower the calcium serum tetracycline and viomycin. 48 The leaves of this beautiful herb are also rich in iron. 49 It is documented in human studies that iron lowers the serum level or effects of doxycycline, levodopa, methacycline, methyldopa, minocyclyne, and thyroxine, effect. It lowers trientine without causing insufficiency. Drugs that lower the serum iron levels leading to insufficiency are caffeine, calcium carbonate, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, trientine and vitamine 50 Digoxin, gentamicin and viomycin lower the magnesium, causing insufficiency, as proven by studies in humans. 51 It is also a source of potassium. Acetazolamide, carbenicillin, carbenoxolone, cephalothin, clindamycin, gentamicin and levels or efficiency, causing insufficiency. Spironolactone causes an increase to toxic levels.52 This herb has a hypoglycemic effect. It lowers the glucose level in the blood. Insulin-dependent diabetics (type I) who take coriander have to monitor their blood glucose level not only because of the need to prevent high glucose level, but also to be able to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. It is possible to have insulin shock as a result of the combined actions of the insulin and the hypoglycemic herb.43 8. Conclusion Coriander is a herb well known since ancient times in vast parts of the world from the Mediterranean basin to India and China. Both its dried fruits and the fresh leaves with the stem known as coriander and cilantro, respectively, are used for culinary and medicinal purposes. Even the culinary applications have a medicinal background. They were originally designed to balance the food and facilitate digestion. As part of the food, the herb is also useful for controlling bad breath and is a source of vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, calcium and iron. Different cultures have different preferences between the seeds and the leaf, and the number of applications is huge. The purely medicinal use is also very developed with a big variety of problems that are treated and many different formulas and ways of preparations. Corainder is considered to be very safe. The most widely-known use is for digestive problems where it improves the digestion, stokes the agni (digestive fire) without aggravating pitta and increasing acidity. It is very useful for flatulence, gripping and bloating. Another well known use of coriander is for urinary tract problems that are connected with burning urination and infections. It is a mild diuretic, great for the task because it will not overwhelm the kidneys with excessive activity. It is also strengthening to the urinary system. Kidney stones are prevented with a kidney flush with coriander. Its diuretic property will be useful in treating edema and high blood pressure. Coriander has a detoxifying action for various toxins, which, interestingly, is used for poisoning with metals. It is also cleansing to the liver and cleans the fat and necrosis in it. Coriander is effective in simple cases of gall stones. Most herbs that act on urinary tract stones will have an effect on gall stones when coriander is used as a carrier to conduct their action to the liver. Studies are proving its great ability in treating bacterial and fungal infections and parasites. The traditional use is in eye infections, colds, food preserving and parasites in children. Coriander has hypoglycemic action (reducing blood glucose), which makes it very useful in diabetes. It is proven to lower the \"bad\" cholesterol and triglycerides. In the long list, coriander also helps with excessive or insufficient menstruation, allergies, skin problems, burns, baldness, measles, nose bleed, increasing blood flow, treating thirst and working as an insect repellant. When we consider coriander's proven uses, the studies opening new avenues for applications, as well as its safety, the inevitable conclusion is that this formidable herb, coriander, rightfully deserves its name dhanyaka, which means \"rich\" or \"wealthy\". It can also be said that we are immensely enriched by it. 9. End Notes 1. Gernot Katzer's Spice Pages, Gernot Coriander.

Department of Pharmacology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Abstract Background & objectives: Coriandrum sativum (CS), has been widely used in traditional systems of medicine for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the mechanism of action for its antiarthritic effects is not clearly known. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the antiarthritic activity of CS in rats in two experimental models. Methods: The antiarthritic activity of CS seed hydroalcoholic extract (CSHE) was evaluated in adult Wistar rats by using two experimental models, viz. formaldehyde and Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced arthritis. The expression of pro- inflammatory cytokines (predominantly contributed by macrophages) was also evaluated. TNF- level was estimated in serum by ELISA method. TNF-R1, IL-1 and IL-6 synovium was immunohistochemistry. Results: CSHE produced a dose dependent inhibition of joint swelling as compared to control animals in both, formaldehyde and CFA induced arthritis. Although there was a dose dependent increase in serum TNF- levels in the CSHE treated groups as compared to control, the synovial expression of macrophage derived pro-inflammatory cytokines/cytokine receptor was found to be lower in the CSHE treated groups as compared to control. Interpretation & conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the antiarthritic activity of CSHE may be attributed to the modulation of pro- inflammatory cytokines in the synovium. In further studies CSHE could be explored to be developed as a disease modifying agent in the treatment of RA.

Action of Coriandrum sativum of Piracicaba, University of Campinas-UNICAMP, 13414- 903 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil. Abstract The efficacy of extracts and essential oils from Allium against Candida spp. isolates from the oral cavity of patients with periodontal disease. The most active oil was fractionated and tested against C. albicans biofilm formation. The oils were obtained by water-distillation and the extracts were prepared with macerated dried plant material. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration-MIC was determined by the microdilution method. Chemical characterization of oil constituents was performed using Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). C. sativum activity oil upon cell and biofilm morphology was evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The best activities against planktonic Candida spp. were observed for the essential oil and the grouped F(8-10) fractions from C. sativum. The crude oil also affected the biofilm formation in C. albicans causing a decrease in the biofilm growth. Chemical analysis of the F(8-10) fractions detected as major active compounds, 2-hexen-1-ol, 3-hexen-1-ol and cyclodecane. Standards of these compounds tested grouped provided a stronger activity than the oil suggesting a synergistic action from the major oil constituents. The activity of C. sativum oil demonstrates its potential for a new natural antifungal formulation.

Antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils against bacterial and fungal species involved in food poisoning and/or and Immunology, Bucharest, Rom\u00e2nia. Abstract: The currative properties of aromatic and medicinal plants have been recognized since ancient times and, more recently, the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils has been used in several applications, including food preservation. The purpose of this study was to create directly comparable, quantitative data on the antimicrobial activity of some plant essential oils prepared in the National Institute of Research-Development for Chemistry and Petrochemistry, Bucharest to be used for the further development of food packaging technology, based on their antibacterial and antifungal activity. The essential oils extracted from L.) were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against eleven different bacterial and three fungal strains belonging to species reported to be involved in food poisoning and/or food decay: S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis clinical isolates. The majority of the tested essential oils exibited considerable inhibitory capacity against all the organisms tested, as supported by growth inhibition zone diameters, MICs and MBC's. Thyme, coriander and basil oils proved the best antibacterial activity, while thyme and spearmint oils better inhibited the species. Anti-anxiety activity of Coriandrum sativum assessed using different experimental anxiety models.

Abstract Interest in alternative medicine and plant-derived medications that affect the \"mind\" is growing. The aim of present study was to explore the anti-anxiety activity of hydroalcoholic extract of Coriandrum sativum (Linn.) using different animal models (elevated plus maze, open field test, light and dark test and social interaction test) of anxiety in mice. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) was used as the standard and dose of hydroalcoholic extract of C. sativum fruit (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) was selected as per OECD guidelines. Results suggested that extract of C. sativum at 100 and 200 mg/kg dose produced anti- anxiety effects almost similar to diazepam, and at 50 mg/kg dose did not produce anti-anxiety activity on any of the paradigm used. Further studies are needed to identify the anxiolytic mechanism(s) and the phytoconstituents responsible for the observed central effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of C. sativum. aromatic, herbaceous annual plant, is well known for its use in jaundice. Essential oil, flavonoids, fatty acids, and sterols have been isolated from different parts of C. sativum. The plant has a very effective antioxidant profile antilipid peroxidation due to its high total phenolic content with the presence of constituents like pyrogallol, caffeic acid, glycitin, etc. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was aimed at investigating the hepatoprotective activity of C. sativum against carbon tetrachloride extract was found to be rich in alkaloids, phenolic compounds and flavonoids, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting showed the presence of iso-quercetin and quercetin. C. sativum signifies hepatoprotection by reducing the liver weight, activities of SGOT, SGPT, and ALP, and direct bilirubin of CCl(4) intoxicated animals. Administration of C. sativum extract at 300 mg/kg dose resulted in disappearance of fatty deposit, ballooning degeneration and necrosis, indicating antihepatotoxic activity. CONCLUSION The results of this study have led to the conclusion that ethanolic extract of C. sativum possesses hepatoprotective activity which may be due to the antioxidant potential of phenolic (Coriandrum sativum): action.

Abstract The effect of the administration of coriander seeds (Coriandrum sativum) on the metabolism of lipids was studied in rats fed a high fat diet with added cholesterol. The spice had a significant hypolipidemic action. The levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides decreased significantly in the tissues of the animals of the experimental group which received coriander seeds. Significant increases in beta-hydroxy, beta-methyl glutaryl CoA reductase and plasma lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase activity were noted in the experimental group. The level of LDL + VLDL cholesterol decreased while that of HDL cholesterol increased in the experimental group compared to the control group. The increased activity of plasma LCAT, enhanced hepatic bile acid synthesis and the increased degradation of cholesterol to fecal bile acids and neutral sterols appeared to account for its hypocholesterolemic effect.
