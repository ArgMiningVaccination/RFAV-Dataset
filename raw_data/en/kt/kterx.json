Inflammation refers to your body's process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections, injuries, and toxins, in an attempt to heal itself. When something damages the cells, your body releases chemicals that trigger a response from your immune system. Chronic inflammation can cause autoimmune disorders, such as Lupus or Chron's, where your body attacks healthy tissue. Exposure to toxins, like pollution or industrial chemicals. Untreated acute inflammation, such as from an infection or injury. Other factors that contribute significantly to inflammation is poor diet and stress. What about stress? - Working too much, over doing it - Poor diet - Lack of exercise - Environmental factors - Emotional distress - Not taking care of yourself - Injury, trauma - sometimes inflammation is a good thing when there's been trauma to the body. However its important to quickly reduce the inflammation so the body can heal and get well Try to avoid these \"foods\" when grocery shopping: - Refined carbohydrates, such as white bread and pastries - Hot chips and other fried foods (often fried in canola oil which is GMO) - Margarine - Soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages (including some alcoholic drinks) - Red meat and processed meat (hot dogs, sausages) - Corn syrup - Packaged foods with ingredient and numbers on the ingredients list you don't understand - Drive-through foods Other foods that may contribute to inflammation in the body for some people may include: - Gluten (proteins trigger the immune system to jump into action, causing inflammation). This inflammation can affect the body's organs and soft tissue. However sometimes, its the pesticides, herbicides or other chemicals used in the processing of certain grains which can cause gluten sensitivity. - Dairy - Soy - Corn - White sugar An anti-inflammatory diet is rich in good oils, fats, omega's and antioxidants... - Olive oil, flaxseed oil - Green leafy vegetables (such as spinach, kale, and collards) - Nuts - Tumeric, ginger - Fatty fish (like salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines) - Fruits (such as avocado, strawberries, blueberries, cherries, goji berries, pineapple, papaya) - Raw unprocessed honey - Coconut - Tomato - Bone broth - Ghee - A rainbow of fruits and vegetables Try to eat as organic and local as possible. In season fruits and vegetables are also important. Certified organic can be expensive so if you cant source it, make sure you thoroughly wash your food. Or better yet start a little vegie garden and grow what you can at home. How can Chinese medicines and Acupuncture for Inflammation help? Acupuncture stimulates your body to help your own body to make its own medicine, like giving your internal healing response a 10-20% boost. The pins spark your resources; what nature gave you and continues to give you. Acupuncture and the other branches of Chinese medicine (nutrition, herbs, massage, heat therapy and exercise) restore homeostasis and keep the body functioning at an optimal level. When the body is functioning at an optimal level, we're far less likely to get sick, and far more likely to recover quickly when we do get sick, inflammatory conditions included. Read more here about Traditional Chinese Medicine as a health modality [here:](https://tanyakeamwellness.com/chinese-medicine-sunshine-coast/) Autoimmune conditions are a chronic condition so healing is a longer process, the same way it took a long time for the autoimmune markers to show up in the first place. Never the less, we can balance your immune system with acupuncture and herbal medicine, dramatically help with nutrition specific for you as an individual and guide you to manage lifestyle factors to reduce autoimmune markers or better manage the symptoms. If you think you may have inflammation happening in your body or have been diagnosed with an autoimmune condition, please [contact us](https://tanyakeamwellness.com/acupuncture-near-me-contact-me/) today to discuss how we can help you at our Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine clinic on the Sunshine Coast.

In Winter it is recommended to consume less cold and raw food as it harsh on our digestive system to process, which is a balmy 36.5 degrees inside. Putting something the temperature of the fridge in a nice warm coldren stomach, first takes energy to warm it before it can digest it. This can lead to fatigue, bloating, and loose bowel movements. In late Autumn and Winter we opt for: - More warming foods such as soups and stews to warm us up from the inside! - Smoothies are generally not recommended in Winter at all as they are too cold. However putting a wonderful twist on the conventional fruit smoothie so that is warming not only for our digestive system but designed to benefit the lungs and relieve coughs. The main ingredient, pears, is highly valued in Chinese medicine as the fruit that is most beneficial for coughs. What does Autumn and Winter bring? You guessed it, coughs! Pears are \"sweet, slightly sour, and cool.\" They \"generate fluids\" but also \"dissolve phlegm,\" so they are ideal for treating dry coughs, a hoarse voice, thirst and agitation in general. Our second key ingredient is almonds which is also a great dairy alternative in smoothies. Almonds have similar properties to apricots in Chinese medicine, with apricot seeds being used as one of the key medicinals for treating coughs. Almonds are not as potent as apricot seeds (which have some mild toxicity and shouldn't be consumed on a regular basis), but they do have some similar properties - moistening the lungs, relieving coughing and wheezing. That makes them the perfect complement to pears in this smoothie. This recipe is specific for almond milk which helps resolve phlegm, so don't switch it up for dairy milk as dairy is more phlegm forming. Chinese Medicine Cough Recipe (Spiced Pear Smoothie with Almonds and Chia) Serving size: About 1-2 Ideal for high speed blender Ingredients 1 Pear (room temperature) \u00be-1cup Almond Milk (how thick do you like it?) 10 natural Almonds (soaked overnight in water if possible, otherwise raw is fine) \u00bc-1/2 teaspoon Garam Masala spice Dash Cayenne pepper or Cinnamon (to keep the digestive system warm) 1 tablespoon Chia Seed (can be soaked in almond milk prior for 15 minutes to turn into a jelly) 1-2 teaspoons Manuka honey NO ICE ! Directions Blend all ingredients until smooth. Enjoy! Take care this Winter, there has already been many colds and influenza floating around.

In [Chinese philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy), yin and yang describe how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, [interconnected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interconnected), and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. Many tangible [dualities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism) (such as [light and dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_and_dark), fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. Yin qualities include: Darkness, moon, feminine, shade, quiet, inward Yang qualities include: Light, sun, masculine, brightness, loud, outward Example include: Night (yin) and day (yang) Yoga exercise (yin) and boxing exercise (yang) Yin represents the energy that is responsible for moistening and cooling bodily functions. When this energy is depleted your body begins to show signs of \"heating up\". This is not a true heat such as a fever, but rather a lack of the moistening and cooling functions that are necessary to maintain a healthy balance. Women are more yin, while men are more yang - for example yin is all of the fluids in the body for women (breast milk, menstruation, vaginal discharge/lubricant) - men don't have this. Men do have some yin qualities, as well as women having some yang qualities. This post is focused on yin foods, thus nourishing the body and rebalancing conditions. These can include dry skin, menopausal hot flushes, tendon and ligament tightness or flaccidity, vaginal dryness, lack of breast milk production, low libido, insomnia, feeling low, scanty menstruation, hot hands and feet, constipation, dull headaches or anxiety. Why is your yin imbalanced? Well, lots of reasons - genetics, age, stress on the body, trauma, blood loss, excess sexual activity, recreational drug use, too many yang hot foods, poor diet and lifestyle to name a few. Nutrition is a simple way to balance yin and yang. Yin foods are cool and expanding; Yang foods are warm and contracting. Think of a shell of iceberg lettuce (Yin), and now a chunk of beef steak (Yang), and you will instantly recognise this meaning. Foods to nourish Yin include: - Grains: barley, millet - Vegetables: alfalfa sprout, artichoke, asparagus, kelp, mung bean sprout, pea, potato,seaweed,string bean, sweet potato, tomato, water chestnut, yam, zucchini - Fruit: apple, apricot, avocado, banana, lemon, lime, mango, mulberry, pear, persimmon, pineapple, pomegranate, watermelon - Beans: adzuki, black beans, black soya, kidney, lima, mung - Bean Products: tofu - Nuts and seeds: coconut milk, sesame seed, black sesame seed, walnut - Fish: fish in general but especially clam, fresh water clam, crab, cuttlefish, oyster, octopus, sardine - Meat: beef, duck, goose, pork, pork kidney, rabbit - Dairy: cheese, chicken egg, cow's milk, duck egg - Herbs and spices: marjoram, nettle - Oils and condiments: honey, malt, Common supplements: Ginseng, royal jelly Examples of every day foods that can be used to build yin, include: - Fruit smoothies with honey and banana or a fruit salad - Fish dishes with coconut milk - Omelettes with cheese - Asparagus and egg salads with sesame seeds - Tacos made with Kidney beans and topped with a small amount of cheese - Baked Potato stuffed with tofu with soya sauce and sesame seeds. - Pork and apple dishes - Miso soup with tofu and seaweed Foods to avoid: - Stimulating foods such as the following will only further deplete yin: caffeine, alcohol, sugar and strongly heating, pungent spices. Note: Like yin tonifying herbs, yin building foods have a tendency to congest the digestive organs and promote stagnation if large amounts are consumed. It is therefore important to consume small quantities frequently rather than large helpings irregularly. Such as a large portion if a fish coconut curry late at night is not ideal as it will sit in your stomach, stagnate and not digest properly before bed. Thus a small portion between 5-6pm is more ideal as there is more time before you go to bed to digest it. Also, It's not to say that yang foods you already consume such as roast chicken, other types of fish, coffee, tea, black pepper etc are to be completely avoided. Remember yin and yang balance each other out, are contrary forces that are actually complementary, [interconnected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interconnected), and interdependent of each other. Other yin tips: meditate; eat more fresh fruit and [salads](http://www.chienergy.co.uk/macrobiotic-salads.htm); drink more water, [teas](http://www.chienergy.co.uk/macrobiotic-teas.htm) and juices; wear pastel colors; wear loose, flowing clothes; stretch; get out into nature; listen to relaxing music; light candles at night.

[ ](https://tanyakeamwellness.com/the-benefits-of-fitness-in-spring/) by [Tanya Keam](https://tanyakeamwellness.com/author/tannyhoo/) | one of the most fittest and healthiest places in Australia. We often have triathlon events, surfers at Noosa, runners on Alex hill, mountain climbers on Ngun Ngun, dog walking at Kawana and health cafes popping up everywhere. Who wants to stay inside on a sunny weekend? NO ONE! Spring is the season of regeneration and growth and connects to the liver organ. The days become longer and we want to spend more time outside, especially living on the beautiful Sunshine Coast! Here are some tips and strategies fitness wise and to support liver health: From a Western medicine perspective, the liver is a very important organ that stores blood, produces bile, processes toxins and aids in our immune function. From a Chinese medicine perspective, it also has a major influence on the smooth flow of energy (life force) to move throughout our bodies. When something blocks this energy flow such as lack of exercise, stress, pent up emotions or an unhealthy lifestyle; the liver becomes agitated/blocked/stuck, which can lead to symptoms such as irritability, insomnia, PMS, tight muscles, mood swings, digestive discomfort, pain in the body and headaches. So what can you do to your liver energy/life force to flow smoothly in the face of every day activities? Exercise: The best way to get your energy moving is to move! Different types of exercise suit different people. Some people do really well with vigorous exercise such as long runs or high intensity interval training (HIIT), while other people are more suited to slower, gentle forms of movement such as walking or yoga. I have personally found a mix of both types of exercise to be beneficial. If the gym is a bore, then find something you enjoy, it might even be a group fitness class where you can meet new people. This spring I'm into swimming, yoga, running and resistance exercises. Get those endorphins flowing !!!! Diet: It is important to eat foods that will cleanse and improve overall liver function. Sour flavours belong to the liver/gallbladder function. Having a squeeze of lemon in warm water first thing in the morning invigorates the liver to get moving for the day and vinaigrette dressings can be added to salads. Leafy greens such as kale, lettuce, spinach and chard support liver detoxification pathways. Artichokes contain a flavonoid which is a strong antioxidant - meaning prevention and cleansing of free radical damage to cells. Try to reduce the amount of dairy, alcohol, greasy and deep fried foods, and excessive salt. Manage stress - Stress plays a part in all of our lives, and a small amount is healthy, but its just how we manage it all that counts. Dealing with issues, conflict in relationships, pent up emotions, work situations etc. Seek professional support if needed but otherwise have a 'self care' approach to your day to day lives. Rest when you need to, have health treatments such as acupuncture or massage, exercise, take moments to be in nature and soak up some vitamin D, express how you feel, plan your day and week ahead. It's the little things that count. See you in the pool! Take care, TK x [Tanya Keam Wellness](http://www.tanyakeamwellness.com/) is an experienced health clinic in Nambour on the Sunshine Coast.

[ ](https://tanyakeamwellness.com/winter-nutrition/) by [Tanya Keam](https://tanyakeamwellness.com/author/tannyhoo/) | gives us numerous mental, physical and nutritional tools to help us maintain balance all year round. There is much focus around the seasons of the year, where each of our organs are associated with each season. Winter is of the Kidneys and Bladder which rule water metabolism and maintaining homeostasis, a dynamic continual rebalancing. Winter is also the most 'yin' time of the year - yin is dark, cold, slow, with inward energy, compared to Summer which is light, hot, quick, with expansive qualities. Some people feel quite energised by Winter, going snowboarding and being out in the chilly weather bush walking. While others retract, stay inside and can feel low in mood from the lack of light and physical activity. Imbalances that can occur during the winter months include: - Lower back pain - chronic or acute - Knee pain and weakness - Urinary retention or frequent urination - Fatigue and shortness of breath - Vertigo or dizziness - Sexual problems - vaginal dryness, premature ejaculation, low libido - Anxiety, low mood and excessive fear - High blood pressure and/or headaches - Inflexibility and resistance to change Foods that are beneficial during the Winter months include: Root vegetables, winter greens, mushroom, apple, pear, potato, squash, citrus fruits, kidney bean, black sesame seed, dark leafy greens, chicken, lamb, tempeh, whole grains, miso, unrefined sea salt, bone broths (organic). Chinese medicine dietetic philosophy suggests that we embrace native foods, locally grown, and organic and/or chemical free where possible. Take time to sit down and enjoy your meal. Tips to stay well this Winter: - Take time to listen to your body and recharge - Eat warming foods such as lamb and root vegetable stew, tempeh with leafy greens, miso soup or a kidney bean dish - Keep hydrated with neutral temperature water and warming teas - Keep warm - especially the upper back, neck and lower back - Practice self acceptance - acknowledge emotions (such as fear), reflect, judge yourself less so that you can move forward (Spring is followed by Winter - the season that bursts with life) - Don't be afraid of your darker side - write things down in a journal without analysing - Receive acupuncture to support the Kidneys and Bladder and maintain wellness Exercise wise, we all do less during the cooler months as it is a time to rest and revitalise our kidneys, which is why some animals hibernate. Nature is at rest, and in this rest replenishes itself. By eating well, regular exercise, paying attention to our bodies and harmonising ourselves to the seasons, we can stay healthier and prevent illness. Once we feel good and are maintaining a level of wellness that we all strive for, it allows us to enjoy the cooler months, whether its indoors or hitting the waves (with a wetsuit!). Thus, Winter is the perfect time to look inward, reflect on ourselves, practice writing or other practices such as yoga, pilates or tai chi.

[ ](https://tanyakeamwellness.com/autumn-living-seasonally-with-chinese-medicine/) by [Tanya Keam](https://tanyakeamwellness.com/author/tannyhoo/) | is the season that follows the long and hot days of summer, where the days become shorter, the nights a little cooler, presenting us with earthy coloured falling leaves to prepare for the coming winter. With the change in temperature, especially the summer humidity that we experience in Queensland Australia, the air signals us to start putting away the summer frocks and get out warmer jackets and scarfs. We also begin to harvest and gather brightly coloured foods of the new season, such as pumpkin and squash. Chinese medicine is very much focussed around the seasons of the year. We go from the relaxed and carefree attitudes of Summer to the more serious and introspective energies of Autumn. In Autumn we move from the external, expansive nature of Summer to the internal, contracting nature of Autumn. It is a good idea to finish up projects you've started in spring and summer and frolic in the rewards, a bit like the planting of seedlings in the veggie patch that have been harvested. In Chinese medicine, Autumn is associated with the lungs and colon. The energy of the lungs are colon are about \"letting go\", in all aspects of our life so that we can make room for new experiences that will help us to learn and grow. Imbalances that can occur during Autumn can include : Dry skin, lips and throat Stiff upper back and neck Allergies, allergic rhinitis and sinusitis Weak immunity Sneezing and running rose Lack of vitality Itching Dry or phlegmy cough Constipation Asthma Skin conditions flare up, such as eczema Sitting with sadness/grief for longer Tips for staying well during Autumn : Practice breathing exercises Let go of negativity in your life Walk outside Reorganise, clean and declutter Recognise sadness/grief Brush your skin with a dry soft brush Acupuncture and cupping are helpful to prevent illness (colds and flu that are common in autumn) and to assist your body to recover quickly Wear a scarf and jacket to protect your neck and back from the wind Nutrition is a large part of Chinese medicine - to eat seasonally. Foods that are beneficial in Autumn: Garlic, Sweet potato, Ginger, Onion, Cabbage, Rice, Cinnamon, Cardamon, Leek, Miso, Navy beans, Almonds, Asparagus, Walnuts, Pear, Olives, Cauliflower, Yoghurt, Apples, Celery, Broccoli, Apricot, Sourdough, Sauerkraut, Cloves, Squash, Pumpkin The best way to stay well according to Chinese medicine, is to learn about the nature of each season and to live in harmony with its spirit. If we are living in harmony with the world around us, the Autumn around us, we see that nature is a powerful system of slowing down and contracting, preparing to rest, so its good for us to mimic this. Sleeping a little longer, eating less cold foods and instead more warming and nourishing foods, like stews and soups, and paying extra attention to our internal lives. The time of the lungs and colon is about self worth, to give ourselves some extra attention and self love. Perhaps that yoga class you've been meaning to get to for months can now fit into your schedule. To breathe To nurture To let go.

Some people are lactose intolerant which means their body has an inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and to a lesser extent dairy products (cheese, yoghurt, butter etc), causing side effects. In most cases, symptoms include abdominal bloating and cramps, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea, rumbling stomach or vomiting. 2. Allergic reactions to dairy 3. Dairy is considered a food that can cause inflammation in the body 4. Ethical reasons behind the production of dairy products 5. Dairy causes digestive discomfort, bloating or loose stools even though they aren't lactose intolerant Dairy alternatives are very popular these days and can include: Almond Milk Almond milk is a great substitute for milk in every aspect of cooking and baking as well as over cereal, in smoothies or in your morning coffee/cuppa. Creamy, usually just a little sweet, high in vitamin E and other essential nutrients, and more alkaline than other nuts. Almond milk is almost always found in with the other non-refrigerated boxed beverages. You can also use other nuts such as cashews, brazil or hazelnuts as a nut milk. These dairy-free milk alternatives are usually not soy-free however, as they almost always contain soy lecithin. You can avoid soy by making your own milk at home! Half a cup of almonds (or other nuts) - soaked in filtered water overnight in the fridge 3 cups of filtered water Pinch of salt 2 dates 1/4 teaspoon vanilla essence or vanilla bean Blend on high for 1 minute in a good blender Strain the liquid through a nut bag or clean mesh cloth Refrigerate and consume within 3 days You can make smaller batches if you know you're not going to get through it all Coconut Milk Prepared from fresh coconut meat (flesh), coconut milk is a great option for richer dairy-free dishes. Although it is high in fat and saturated fat (their good fats!), coconut milk is a delicious way to add creaminess to any number of dairy-free dishes. I wouldn't recommend in your tea or coffee but it goes great in curries, puddings, dairy-free whipped cream or desserts and with your cereal or granola. Coconut meat can also be made into a yoghurt and flavoured with fruit. The yoghurt is very thick and creamy. Rice Milk Rice milk is generally thinner in consistency than nut milks or soy milk, and it has a lighter, sweeter flavour that is perfect for using with cereal or in coffee/tea. While rice milk works well in baking recipes, for using in dairy-free sauce recipes it generally requires some sort of binding or stabilising agent such as agar flakes, eggs, flour or anthem gum. I would recommend to use rice milk in coffee, tea, smoothies or own its own. Soy milk Soy milk is made from the soy bean and are a complete protein source and a dietary staple in many cultures. It is one of the richest of non-dairy milk alternatives next to coconut milk, contributing density through fat, fiber and protein while still free of cholesterol and saturated fats. Excellent for baking, cooking, in a glass or over cereal, soy milk is an easy way to add protein and dimension to your recipes. Soy contains phytoestrogens called isoflavones that may mimic the activity of the hormone estrogen in your body. I would recommend avoiding soy if you have a tendency toward high oestrogen and if you do consume soy, go for non-genetically modified (non-GMO) and certified organic. Perhaps rice or nut milk would suit you better, or just mix it up.

It contains tens of trillions of micro-organisms, including at least 1000 different species of known bacteria with more than 3 million genes (150 times more than human genes). Microbiota can, in total, weigh up to 2 kg. One third of our gut microbiota is common to most people, while two thirds are specific to each one of us. In other words, the microbiota in your intestine is like an individual identity card. Why is it important? While each of us has a unique microbiota, it always fulfils the same physiological functions and they have a direct impact on our health: It helps the body to digest certain foods that the stomach and small intestine have not been able to digest. It helps with the production of some vitamins (B and K). It helps us combat aggressions from other microorganisms, maintaining the wholeness of the intestinal mucosa. It plays an important role in the immune system, performing a barrier effect. A healthy and balanced gut microbiota is key to ensuring proper digestive functioning. What does pH in the body mean? pH stands for power of hydrogen, which is a measurement of the hydrogen ion concentration in the body. The total pH scale ranges from 1 to 14, with 7 considered to be neutral. A pH less than 7 is said to be acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic or alkaline. How does this affect our health? When we eat acid-forming foods, our body works to bring our blood pH back into balance by releasing alkaline-rich minerals into our bloodstream (e.g. calcium, phosphorus and magnesium). If we are not eating enough alkaline-forming foods, then our body has to pull these minerals from our bones, teeth and organs. This can compromise our immune system, cause fatigue and make us vulnerable to viruses and disease. How do we keep the pH balanced to prevent illness and disease? Maintaining an approximate 80% alkalinity and 20% acidity diet is the best way to maintain wellness. Acidic foods (alcohol, refined sugars, coffee, fast foods, chocolate, red meat, fish, dairy) are foods that are associated with disease. A highly acidic diet creates a favourable environment for yeast, fungus, abnormal cells and even parasites to multiply and grow. Alkaline foods (most fruit and vegetables such as leafy greens, lemons, citrus fruits, berries, broccoli, cabbage, nuts, herbal tea) are foods which maintain and prevent disease from occurring in the body. What are intestinal parasites? Even the word \"parasite\" sounds terrible. Like a villain, living off the goodness within you! Eeek! Parasites infect the [gastro-intestinal tract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastro-intestinal_tract) of humans and other animals. They can live throughout the body, but most prefer the intestinal wall. Means of exposure include: ingestion of undercooked meat, drinking infected water, and skin absorption. What's the plan to get them out of you ASAP!? Antibiotics are advised for intestinal parasites from your GP. However there are other options and/or in combination: Firstly, the 4 R's: 1. Remove the micro-organisms that shouldn't be there, as well as toxic foods (acidic) you shouldn't be eating 2. Replace/restore the nutrients, bacteria, intestinal flora (pre and probiotics) 3. Repair the cell on every level 4. Relaxation! - Stress, anxiety etc Remove - Many qualified health practitioners can sort a digestive cleanse for you, using anti-microbials which first rid the body of the unwanted organisms. This can be a long haul as the organism will continue to reproduce. Including colonics - a colon enema cleanse which literally involves flushing the colon with water and herbs. Removing foods that have inflammatory properties will aid the whole process - wheat, gluten, soy, dairy, sugar, alcohol, fructose. Replace/restore - In addition to the above digestive cleanse, probiotics are taken at the same time to restore the yummy gut flora. Probiotics can be taken in tablet form, yoghurt, kombucha (a fermented herbal tea - see my how to make kombucha post) or fermented vegetables. I would recommend all of the above, except for dairy during the cleanse. Maintaining a diet that is 80% alkaline will create an unhappy environment for the parasites as they enjoy the acidity. Repair - Additional supplements and herbs can be prescribed for you which will improve your overall health, aside from probiotics etc. Such as immune support which is a common imbalance to get parasites, worms etc in the first place. Seeking treatment from a qualified practitioner such as Chinese medicine would be ideal. Relax - A key rule in life, not just for intestinal upsets. Regular exercise, sleeping well, good emotional-mental health, breathing deeply etc. Note: Intestinal parasites can be missed in stool samples, so ask your doctor for 2 or 3 samples to do a week a part just in case. Following up with stool tests 3 and 6 months after being diagnosed is ideal. They will most certainly want to survive in you! You may think \"oh gosh it will be such a long process to rid these parasites\" ... but your whole digestive system will have improved and I will guarantee you will learn more about your health, diet and lifestyle in the process !!
