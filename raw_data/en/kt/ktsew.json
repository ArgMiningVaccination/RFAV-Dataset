Some dierent types ofTCMhavesmalldierencesinappearance,makingithardtodistinguishthemfromeachother.Atpresent,thedispensingof TCM is still largely the man-ually [2], so misidentication of TCM is pharmacists have diculty in ensuringthat no identication errors occur in their heavy workload.Medication errors caused by misidentication of TCM canaectthehealthofpatients.AsChina'spopulationcontinuestogrowandageatanacceleratingrate,ithasbroughtabout anincreasingdemandforTCM,whilethetraditionalmodel of TCM personnel has a long cycle, and development islagging behind the advancement of modern medical tech-nology. Although the development of TCM is now stronglysupported by the Chinese government, there is still ashortage of professionals in TCM. (\"_he continuous devel-opment of deep learning in recent years seems to bringopportunitiesforthedevelopmentofTCM,withresearchinTCM diagnostic models [3,4], TCM toxicity componentprediction [5], and research [6], which alsoprovides new methodologies for TCM modernization. In this article, we use the mainstream target detection algorithmsrepresentedbyFasterRCNN,SSD,andYOLOv5to train and test by constructing a TCM dataset in VOCformat. Experiments show the potential of target detectiontechnology to assist pharmacists with dispensing andverication. (\"_he main contributions of this study are thefollowing: (i) (\"_here are few attempts to introduce deep learning into TCM recognition, and this study explores theintroduction of target detection into TCM recog-nition,whichisacrossoverstudyintheeldofdeeplearning and TCM.Hindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2022, Article ID 9220443, 9 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9220443(ii) (\"_here are few publicly available TCM image data- sets, we have taken a large number of TCM images and completed manual labeling, and we will openup the datasets we have collected and labeled forevaluation testing in subsequent studies.

It provides a reference for subsequent studies. 2.Related Work 2.1.LiteratureReview. Previous studies of medicinal plants identication mainly focused on image classication by articially [7], Mareta [8], medicinal plants images by extracting thevariability in supercial features such as color, shape, ortexture of medicinal plants by dierent classiers. (\"_his kindof method could achieve satisfactory results, but as wementioned above there are many types of TCM, so themanualsettingoffeaturesislimitedbytheexperienceofthedesigner, the environment, and the location of the object,which leads to the lack of robustness of the features. Inaddition, the use of the manually setting features leads to alarge computational eort of the model, and these de- ciencies reduce the application scenarios and scope of the method Due to the continuous development of deeplearning, Convolutional neural networks (CNN) haveachieved outstanding results in computer vision classica-tion and have been applied in many disciplines. CNN ischaracterized by the addition of convolutional layers andpooling layers; the new network structure can be formedbased on dierent combinations and architectures of theconvolutional layers and the pooling layers. In recent years,researchers have successively proposed a series of excellentdeep learning models based on CNN, such as AlexNet (2012), VGGNet (2014), ResNet (2015), Inception (2015), DenseNet (2017), and so on, which have all performed wellinvariousvisualrecognitioncompetitions.Forthersttime,theAlexNetmodel[10]usesCNNforvisualtasksincomplexsituations, replacing the Sigmoid function with the ReLuactivation function, and preventing overtting problemsthrough dropout and image enhancement methods.VGGNet [11] and GoogleNet [12] improve the recognitionaccuracy of the model by continuously deepening the net-workstructure,GoogleNetintroducestheInceptionmoduleto reduce the number of parameters and increase the width of the model. By adding the residual module, ResNet [13] solves the problem that the error rate of the model does notdecreasebutincreaseswhenthenumberofnetworklayersisgreatly deepened and achieves a higher accuracy rate.DenseNet [14] is based on ResNet to connect all the layerswith the dense connection, which reduces the number ofparameters and makes the network more ecient. Atpresent, some scholars have used CNN for the classicationandrecognitionofChinesemedicine-relatedimages.Huanget al. [15] proposed a network model that can be used toidentify Chinese Herbal Medicine Leaves by improving theAlexNet model. Sun, et al. [16] used the VGG16 model toclassify 95 Chinese herbal medicines with an average ac-curacy of 71%. (\"_he DenseNet-based recognition modelproposed by Xing, et al. [17] could classify images of 80Chineseherbalmedicineswithamaximumrecognitionrate of97.3%.Liu,etal.[18]usedGoogLeNettoclassifyimagesof 50 Chinese herbal medicine plants under complex back-ground conditions, the accuracy of TOP-1 was 62.8%. Inaddition, a few studies used multiple models to compareresults, Marwaha, et al. [19] used VGG16, MobileNet,Xception, and Inceptionv3 to classify the microscopic im-ages of the two herbal plant powders with the highest ac-curacy of 96.4%. Azeez, et al. Resenet, MobileNet, and Inception-Resenet v2to classify and identify 5 kinds of herbal plants, with anaverage accuracy rate of up to 95.5%. Tan, et al. used dierent vector machinesand K-means clustering algorithms, the highest recognitionaccuracyoftheCNNmodelis99.35%,whichissignicantlyhigher than that of traditional detection and classicationmethods.Huetal.[22]proposedtoapplymultitasklearningto recognize Chinese herbal pieces pictures, and this studycombined deep learning model and traditional features toimprovemodelaccuracy,andalsoachievedexcellentresults.Multitask learning enabled the model to have the ability tohandle multiple tasks simultaneously, but for TCM recog- nitionthereseemstobenoneedtoapplymultitasklearning, and as mentioned earlier, the manual design of features islaborious and relies on the designer's experience. From the research mentioned above, it can be seen that deeplearninghasshownexcellentperformanceinthevisualtask of TCM detection, the current related research mainlyfocusesontheclassicationofTCM,thatis,determiningthecategoryoftheobjectbasedontheinformationintheimage.Generally speaking, there are still many challenges andlimitationsinapplyingdeeplearningmethodstotheeldofTCM image processing. For example, in the actual scene of TCM pharmacies, TCMs are often used in combination, which means that multiple TCMs are likely to be present atthe same time. When the type and number of recognitiontargetsareuncertain,ifwewanttoknowthespeciclocationofthetargets,theclassicationmodelaloneisnotenoughtodeal with the actual problem. Target detection requiresidentifying targets in an image and determining their lo-cationandclass.(\"_herefore,targetdetectionismorepracticalthan targetclassication inwork, whichprovidesabasis forthe development of automated equipment to assistpharmacists. Girshick et al. designed the RCNN based on CNN [23], which made a great improvement in the target detectioneciency of the model, and this technique has been de-veloped rapidly on this basis. In recent years, many targetdetection models such as Faster RCNN, SSD, and YOLOhave appeared in the eld of target detection, and they havebeen widely used in many detection problems [24]. (\"_hecurrent target detection algorithms are usually divided into2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinetwo categories, a two-stage-detector represented by Faster RCNN and a one-stage-detector represented by SSD andYOLO. (\"_he advantages between the two are dierent: thetwo-stage-detector can achieve higher accuracy, but thegeneration of target candidate regions will slow down thespeed; While the one-stage-detector can maintain a certain accuracy while not needing to generate target candidate regions rst, the detection network can directly predict theobject category and position, which has obvious advantagesin detection speed. In previous studies, the application of atwo-stagemodelorone-stagemodeltransferlearningtothescope of TCM has mainly focused on TCM diagnosis[25,26], and there is no research on its application to imageprocessing of TCM for the time being. (\"_he accuracy of the model is an important metric to determine whether the model can assist the pharmacist'swork.Secondly,inabusyhospitalscene,whetherthemodel can complete real-time detection is not negligible. (\"_he calculationofthedeeplearningnetworkmodeltakesalotoftimetogetthepredictionresults,andtheroleofthemodelinthe daily work of the pharmacist is limited. Accurateidentication of TCMs and rapid determination of theirlocation are key technologies of the model. But we have notfound any relevant research yet, so how to apply targetdetection technology to the work of pharmacists has re-search signicance and potential application value. 2.2. Target Detection Algorithm. Faster RCNN [27] uses a region proposal network (RPN) instead of selective search, which saves the time required for detection and realizestarget detection. (\"_he detection process is mainly after theimage is feature extracted through the CNN, the RPNgeneratescandidateregionsofdierentsizesateachpositionoftheextractedfeaturemap,andnally,theRegionProposalis ltered by the Softmax function. (\"_he region of interestpoolingisusedtointegratethefeaturemapoftheCNNandthe Region Proposal generated by the RPN, and then the classication is performed to conrm whether it is the detection target, and the position of the target is obtainedthrough regression. Liu et al. [28] proposed the Single Shot MulitBox De- tector (SSD) target detection algorithm in 2016. SSD anchor mechanism of Faster RCNN and the structure in which target YOLO algorithm. network of on VGG16. (\"_he fully connected layersFC6 and FC7 are replaced with Conv6 and Conv7, the dropout layer and FC8 layer are removed, and adds some newconvolutionallayersfortheextractionandpredictionofmultiscale feature maps. (\"_he advantage of multiscale is thatfeature dierent sizes dierent emphases onpredicting objects. Large-scale feature maps generally con-tain more detailed information and focus on predictingsmall objects. Small-scale feature maps contain more globalinformation and focus on predicting large objects. Redmon et al. [29] proposed a regression-based target detection algorithm YOLO (You only look once) in 2016.YOLOprovidesanewideafortargetdetection,thatis,usinga simple structure of the convolutional network to directlycomplete the feature extraction, classication, and regres-sionoftargetdetection.YOLOdividestheentireimageintoseveralgridcells,usesthecenterofeachgridasthecenterofthe bounding box to directly predict, and then eliminates bounding boxes with low probability through a threshold. (\"_his method signicantly reduces the number of repeatedcalculations.ComparedwiththeRCNNseriesofalgorithms,YOLOhasbetteroverallperformance.Itrealizestheend-to-endtargetdetectionprocessusingaCNN,andthedetectionspeed is faster. (\"_he YOLO series has been updated manytimes [30], and now it has launched the YOLO v5 version,which is an improved target detection network based v4 [31] by Ultralytics LLC that YOLO v5 [32] can greatlyincreasethespeedofmodelcalculationswithalmostnoloss of accuracy, and provides an ONNX framework to convert between dierent models, which can be deployed to em-beddedandmobilephones.(\"_hemainstructureofYOLOv5is similar to YOLO v4. As can be seen from Figure 1(a),YOLO v5 incorporates the Focus structure in the rst layerof the backbone network. Suppose the input image size is4\u00d74\u00d73, after slicing operation and channel concating operation, it becomes a 2 \u00d72\u00d712 image, and then sends the 2\u00d72\u00d712 feature maps to convlutional layer to get the output. (\"_he Focus structure is added to transform the high-resolution imageinformation from the spatial dimension tothechanneldimension,whichmaximizesthepreservationof the input information and reduces the input size, which is benecial to improving the speed of training networks andinference. YOLO v5 references the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) in the backbone and neck sections, as shown inFigure and 1(e), YOLO v5 uses CSP structure with residual components isused in the backbone network for feature extraction, whilethe CSP structure in Neck uses convolutional operationsinstead of residual components. (\"_he CSP structure aims todividethefeaturemapintotwoparts,onepartcontinuesthe convolutionoperationtoobtaindeeperfeatureinformation, andtheotherpartisconcatedwiththefeaturemapaftertheconvolution operation. (\"_he this design in-clude: reducing computation, improving inference speed,reducing memory cost, and ensuring accuracy. Spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) layer is added at the end of the backbone network due to the inconsistent size of theinput images, which would increase the computation andconsume a lot of training and inference time if reshapeoperation is performed on each image. (\"_he SPP layer, asshowninFigure1(f),goesthroughdierentsizesofpooling layers to get the pooled output. (\"_he pooling kernel size and step size change adaptively according to the dierent imagesizes during the maximum pooling, and the output of1+4+16 dimensions is obtained after theSPP layerfor anysize of the feature map so that the size of the feature mapinput to the backbone network is no longer limited. Inaddition, the SPP layer plays an essential role in separatingcontextual features.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3In the Neck part of the network, YOLO v5 uses Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Path Aggregation Network (PANet). FPN is one of the more popular feature fusionmethods that can be predicted separately on multiscalefeature maps. (\"_he FPN algorithm is divided into two paths, one is bottom-top and the other is top-down, using a horizontalconnection.AlthoughtheFPNstructureaddslesscomputation, this structure eectively fuses semantic features and low-leveltexture contour features, making full use of the features ofdierent layers. YOLO v5 takes reference from PANet and adds a bot- tom-top feature pyramid structure after the up-sampling ofFPNforfeaturefusion.DierentfromPANetwhichusesthe shortcut connection when fusing two feature maps, YOLO v5 fuses features by concating. After three dierent con-cating operations, three feature maps of dierent sizes areobtained, and then the CSP structure and convolutionoperationsareaddedseparatelytomakepredictionsoneachof the three nal feature maps. (\"_he structure of FPN can extract strong semantic fea- tures from top-bottom, while the structure of PAN canextract strong positioning features from bottom-top. (\"_hismethod of fusing the feature maps of dierent layers of theconvolutional neural network is more benecial to feature extraction. 3.Methods 3.1.TCMDataset. SincethereisnopublicbenchmarkTCM dataset yet, we manually collected and labeled 2352 images, thenexpandedthemto23520imagesbydataaugmentation,including Mirror flip, horizontal flip, rotation, contrastenhancement, ane transformation, mosaic enhancement,and divided the training set, validation set, and test setrandomly according to the ratio of 6:2: 2. (\"_he dataset covers 100 kinds of TCM images (shown in Figure 2). Considering the practical needs of the work, thedataset also includes some partially occluded, overlapping,multitarget and low-resolution images of TCM to t thepractical application scenarios to increase the robustnessand generalization ability of the model. Unify the format ofthe dataset to the POSCAL VOC2007 format applicable to the three algorithms of Faster RCNN, SSD, and YOLO v5. We use the labelimg tool to mark the images, including thecategory and bounding box position information of thetarget to be recognized. 3.2. Models Training. (\"_he experimental platform congu- ration of this article the anchor selection, the anchor size of ourdataset is obtained by k-means clustering instead of usingthe default anchor of the coco dataset. (\"_his approach allowsthe network to converge faster and learn the features of the images in our dataset better. (\"_he parameters that the net- work can learn to update include convolutional kernelparameters and bias parameters, but not Hyperparameter.Hyperparameters are manually set parameters that need tobe specied before training and testing the network. Basedon the experience of a large number of previous experi-ments,weanalyzedandcomparedtheoptimalvaluesoflossconvergence, precision, and recall of the experimental re-sults, and nally decided on the choice of hyperparameters.(\"_he initial learning rate of the weights is set to 0.001, andeachbatchcontains64pictures.Momentumissetto0.9,and the weight decay coecient is set to ratio of 6:2:2. In the process oftraining the model, the current constructed model is testedin each epoch using validation set to get the loss and ac-curacy.

(\"_he experimental results show that our trainedmodel performs well on the test set without overtting. 2)Whentraining themodeliteratively, we set upanearlystop mechanism to measure the performance of each iteration. When the validation loss starts to increase, the training ofthe model is stopped to prevent overtting. 3) We increasethenumberoftrainingsamplesthroughdataaugmentation,includinghorizontalflip,anetransformation,Mosaicdataaugment, etc. Using dropout to increase regularization intraining the model can also prevent overtting. 3.3.

(\"_heexperimentrecordedthe values of Precision, Recall, and mAP of the three models at dierent Epochs. It can be seen in Figure 3 that, with the increase of Epochs, the metrics of the three models are alsoincreasing, which means that the detection eect of the net-work model is better.

(\"_he results ofthese metrics showed that the YOLO v5 model out-performed both the Faster RCNN and SSD on the sameTCM dataset. Our experimental results are similar to thoseofotherstudiesthathaveappliedtargetdetectiontomedicalimages. For example, Zhao et al. [33] proposed the use of YOLOv5andSSDforthereal-timedetectionofbloodcells.

In order to visualize the recognition eect of Faster RCNN, SSD and YOLO v5 on TCM mentioned in this paper, we randomly selectedsamples from the test dataset in the three algorithms forcomparison. As shown in Figure 6, the YOLO v5 network can detect the missed targets of Faster RCNN and SSD, whichismoreadvantageousindealingwiththeproblemsofsmall target detection and target occlusion, and can com-plete the detection task well in practical scenarios.
