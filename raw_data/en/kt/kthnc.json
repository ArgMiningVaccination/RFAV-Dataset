People often \"isolate\" a symptom or categorize it into one area, for example: \"I have acne, I should see a dermatologist\" or \"I have high cholesterol, I should see a cardiologist\". When we do this, we have completely disregarded that the body is ONE cohesive system that functions as many moving parts working together. One imbalance, will also have cascading symptoms affecting other areas of your body and health. This supports the idea of looking at everything as a whole, hence \"holistic medicine\". Together we will take an in-depth look at your whole system through a series of testing modalities. Your cardiovascular system, hormones, endocrine glands, organ functionality, digestive system, skin, neurotransmitters, blood chemistry, energy meridians, cellular toxicity, food sensitivities, mitochondrial function, nutrition, heavy metals, pathogens, emotional wellbeing, emotional identities, sleep, inflammation, energy, mood, weight and more will be analyzed. This 360 degree assessment provides the whole picture, allowing us to address your imbalances with a cohesive plan over three or more months. Financing and/or payment plans are available as medical insurance companies do not cover natural medical treatments at this time.
