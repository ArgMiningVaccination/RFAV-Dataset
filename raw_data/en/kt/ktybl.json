Naproxen reduces pain in joints and muscles. The brand name for this is Vimovo. It is only available on prescription. How esomeprazole works Esomeprazole is a 'proton pump inhibitor'. Proton pumps are tiny substances that make acid to digest food. Esomeprazole temporarily stops these pumps working.

It may take up to 4 weeks for esomeprazole to work properly. You may still have symptoms during this time. The dose of your medicine depends on your condition. Your GP may increase or decrease your dose. You might only take esomeprazole for a few weeks or months. But it will depend on your illness. You may need to take it for longer, even for many years. You can get lower strength esomeprazole from a pharmacy. If you don't get any relief from heartburn and acid reflux symptoms after 2 weeks, talk to your GP. Check if you can take esomeprazole Esomeprazole can be taken by most adults. Children should only take it on prescription. It may not be suitable if you: - have ever had an allergic reaction to other medicines - have liver problems - have a glucose, sucrose or lactose intolerance - are taking a medicine containing nelfinavir, for HIV infection Pregnancy Esomeprazole isn't recommended during pregnancy as there's no firm evidence it's safe. If you're pregnant it's better to treat your symptoms without taking a medicine. Your GP or midwife may suggest eating smaller meals and avoiding fatty and spicy food. They may also suggest raising an end of your bed so that your chest and head are above your waist. Your GP may recommend a different medicine if you are pregnant. Breastfeeding You should not take esomeprazole if you are breastfeeding. Esomeprazole may pass into breast milk, but we don't know for sure. Your GP may recommend a different medicine if you are breastfeeding. Contraception and fertility Esomeprazole doesn't affect any type of regular contraception including the combined pill. It may reduce the effectiveness of one type of emergency contraception called ellaOne (ulipristal). There is no reason to believe esomeprazole reduces fertility. How and when to take it Always take esomeprazole exactly as your GP has told you. It's usual to take it once a day in the morning. You can take it with or without food. If you take esomeprazole twice a day, take 1 dose in the morning and 1 dose in the evening. Swallow tablets whole with a drink of water. If you have problems swallowing tablets, you can put them in a glass of water. Stir until the tablet breaks up and drink straight away. If your child is under 12, their GP will prescribe granules which come in sachets. Mix granules with some water and drink straight away. If you forget to take it If you take esomeprazole once a day, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Do this unless it's less than 12 hours until your next dose. In that case skip the missed dose. If you take it twice a day, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's less than 4 hours until your next dose. In that case skip the missed dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Side effects of esomeprazole Most people who take esomeprazole do not have any side effects.
