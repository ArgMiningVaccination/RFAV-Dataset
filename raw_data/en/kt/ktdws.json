She was a childhood survivor of a concentration camp. She spoke very seriously, very gravely about her problems, rarely smiled and got right to the point. Initial Intake: June, 2003 Susanna: \"If home, on the weekends, I sit in the house. No matter what I do, I get panic attacks, and I want to die; I don't want to live. During the week, I'm fi ne - doing things. My momma said I'd scream at night 'Momma, Momma!' and would come to her bed. I remember a childhood nightmare where someone was coming to kill us. Every night that is all I could remember, I was living that dream, maybe there was blood there, too. That may have been the start of the panic - that dream. \"Then I got taken away to a concentration camp. I was eleven when they took me away from my momma. My momma and sister went to another camp. Every year I was sick, didn't know how I could still walk. We had nothing. Then they substituted me for another child and got me out. At the end of May, I went to the camp where my sister was; I couldn't fi nd my momma. After a time we all came together again. I didn't have any panic attacks all that time until the 1960s. \"In '59 I came to America. At night I'd wake up and have this feeling of being scared to death. Then I'd doze off in the living room, and the same feeling would repeat - fi ve years like that. Then in '65 I had a panic attack in Europe - at night. The next day I was scared and shaking. Took sleeping pills, and was so dizzy and panicky from those pills. \"At 7 p.m., I calm down. \"When my husband died [16 years ago], he died at 11 p.m. Ever since then, I wake at 11 p.m. exactly. \"There were a lot of problems with my husband - he was drinking, and lying too much. ... I loved him when he was sober, hated him when he was drunk. He is gone, and he loved life; I should be gone, too. \"A year ago I bought everything to commit suicide. I can't shake that awful feeling. Why am I scared? Why am I scared of sitting by myself? \"I'm scared to death, and I don't know what I'm scared of. When I got panic attacks at a friend's house, I would mow the lawn to keep busy. I was panicking waiting for my neighbor to come to my house. Or I'd walk around and around in the house, to keep moving, until 7 p.m. \"Several years ago my son moved away and I was alone. Then is when it got real bad. The weekends are bad if I have to be alone in the afternoon. \"If this (points to chest and throat) doesn't open here, if that starts then I know. If it tightens up, I want to open it. When that starts I get depressed and don't want to live. What for? I'm old enough, my kids are gone.\" Can you tell me about the rst panic attack? \"I woke up at night, my whole body feeling funny like something was going to happen. I'd doze off and it would come again. That scary feeling, it's weird. It is a different scared ... it is like you are on top of a hill and you are the only one in the whole world, that is how it feels. If I do something it is OK, but when I relax that is when it happens.\" Do you have any physical sensations during panic? \"Shaking, and suffocating. I have tightness in the center of my chest and in my throat. Even after the attacks, the tightness remains. If I get depressed, that is when it happens. It only happens on the left side of the neck or the center of the sternum. It is like a spasm; it comes suddenly, like when I have it in the house. Then I don't want to go into the house, because it reminds me. If I have an attack in one place and then go to that place again, I panic. I tell myself I'm stupid and childish, but it doesn't do any good.\" When is it particularly bad? \"I wake up day and night, can't eat and just want to die. I'm always thinking about how to commit suicide without my son fi nding me. I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't want to be scared anymore.\" Do you have any fears, anxieties or phobias? \"Claustrophobia.\" Can you tell me about your relationship to animals? \"Horses. I've always had recurring nightmares about horses; they always chase me. They were always so big. I can't get away and I can't get out. They force me up against the stall. They never get me but it is very close - I fi nally get away. I'm afraid of horses.\" Are there foods that make you sick, or that you don't like? \"Milk I gave up a long time ago, and ice cream. I used to have headaches or nausea from milk.\" [Thinking of Lac equinum (mare's milk):] Are you fastidious? \"I'm a neat freak. Everything has its place; everything has to be dusted. They call me 'the one who always cleans.' I make my bed every day. I always clean up someone's house (a neighbor's).\" Can you tell me something about your sleep? \"I wake every 1.5 to 2 hours. It also takes me a while to fall asleep. I can't stop looking at the clock. By 4 a.m., I am usually awake if I don't take something .\" Can you tell me about your appetite? \"It's fi ne, I eat every two hours. I eat a lot of food. I have breakfast at 8 a.m.; at 10 a.m., I have some nuts and fruit; at noon, I have my big dinner; at 2 p.m. I have fruit; and at 5 p.m. I eat my supper and some fruit again.\"Homeopathic remedy for Panic Disorder: A case study Authorized Signature: Date: 69\u0015;DGBClient Conta Ct any?69\u00156EEGDK 6A/ \u00b0 Ad approved as is \u00b0 Corrections needed Client will supply a correct ad file \u00b0\u00caChanges desired Client authorizes NDNR to make changes indicated; design fee applies.Fax Back To: (480) 275-7712Look over your project and check for errors; spelling, address, telephone #'s, copy or content.

T o l l e C a u s a mJune 2007 NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW 1\u0018ND Comments This may be a case of post-traumatic stress disorder from the concentration camp, something she was able to manage for a time by being occupied and around others. When she lost her husband and her son moved is when the panic began in earnest. In my experience, any of the mammal milks can be very healing for patients. Of course, fi nding the simillimum will have the most profound improvement with a more sustained effect. Between a seminar I attended with Dr. Massimo Mangialavori, an Italian homeopath, and my own successful cases, I have learned that the consistent themes for mammal milks are: Marked reaction to milk - either physical symptoms from milk or emotional feelings (they can love or hate dairy) Headaches are a common pathology for patients needing milk Rxs Diffi culty growing up or developing a separate identity from family members Symptoms that gravitate to one side or the other - sometimes switching sides Indecision (stems from not having individuated) Marked attraction or aversion to the mammal they require (this is common, though not necessary). My rationale for Lac equinum in this case: Repeating dreams of horses and fear of them Aggravated by milk Restlessness and fastidiousness (Lac equinum) Lac equinum has an affi nity to the lungs and breathing diffi culties Issues with time and pace (watching the clock, or eating every two hours) - peculiar to Lac equinum Industrious - very important for Lac equinum Burden and responsibility for others (regularly volunteering to clean her neighbor's house). Plan: Lac equinum 200C, Q12 hrs x 2 (dry), extra envelope to hold. Follow-Up (5 weeks after initial dose), August 2003 Susanna: \"I'm doing much better. I've only had mild anxiety three times. I sleep better. My neighbors were gone for nine days and I didn't have to leave the house. I must be much better, because there was a fi ght and apparently I slept through it. My neighbors said the walls were shaking. Usually, I'd hear everything and I'd never go into that deep a sleep. That was a surprise to me; I couldn't believe it.\" You were getting episodes of panic sitting in your house by yourself. How is that? \"Now I can sit there. I don't have to get on the phone or leave. I don't get so anxious, nothing like it used to be - 70% improvement.\" You were waking frequently and watching the clock? \"I woke up only twice with anxiety.\" You were also waking too easily? \"Still waking easily, but now able to fall back to sleep.\" You had claustrophobia? \"I did sit in a car for a ride and was fi ne instead of being panicky. It used to be I felt this way even in my own house. I had this panic only once. I used to have it a lot, every day.\" Tightness in chest and throat? \"I had it maybe two times. It is a lot better .\" \"My stomach is better, too. Before, even when drinking only water, 20 minutes later I'd get stomach pains.\"When you gave me those little pellets, I thought it was a cruel joke. But I felt something after I took that medicine. For two weeks or so, I felt ... like something is working in my head. Not sleepy, but something relaxing. I can't explain it. Like something was working in my head, calming or relaxing me.\" Assessment Good response; physical symptoms were improving as well as the panic. She called a week later saying she was slipping slightly into panic. I told her to dissolve some pellets of Lac equinum 200C in water and take a teaspoon once per week. I saw her again mid-September 2003: Susanna: \" I'm much better. I can handle it now better when I'm at home. This last weekend I was home and I did OK - no panic. In the afternoon when I'm alone, I don't get this 'have to do something' feeling.\"I checked her baseline again to see if she was continuing to improve. She said the tightness in her chest/throat was better. Her sleep was also improved from last visit - less waking and easier to fall asleep. She also confi rmed her claustrophobia was still improved: \"I always had to be thinking about what I was going to do the next morning before going to sleep, because I wanted to get out of the house to not be alone. A friend asked me recently, \"What are you doing tomorrow?\" And it was Saturday! That was my worst day and I hadn't even thought about it. It is so good to feel good!\" Epilogue Patient left a voice mail, May 2004: \"Hi, Dr. Shannon, I'm doing fine, I've had none of your medicine since the second week of March.

Otherwise, she'd had no recurrence of panic. Often, homeopathy is much more effective than conventional drugs. The results become self-sustaining, and the patient's global health is also significantly increased. T o l l e C a u s a m Tim Shannon, ND is in private practice in Portland. He specializes in the treat- ment of mental, emotional and behavior- al health. He uses classical homeopathy to treat a wide range of mental health complaints: ADHD, OCD, PMS, autistic spectrum, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, PTSD, bi-polar, schizophre- nia, etc. Dr. Shannon lectures at NCNM as well as to the local community on a variety of mental health complaints. NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW october 2007 10Vis Medicatrix Naturae Violence in Teens TIm SHANNON, ND Violence in teenagers is difficult to treat for many reasons. One is because teens often resist treatment. In addition, in teens or adults, there is often a great deal of denial and self-justification that makes get- ting an accurate assessment difficult. Interestingly, some of my most violent patients have been quite charming. Often, they will deny any problems or minimize them incredibly. Despite having seen this phenomenon repeatedly, I can still be fooled by the teen until the parent tells me what is happening. Of course, there also are those patients for whom the violence and maliciousness are more apparent. In many of my cases, I first see the teen separately. Then, after I've obtained what- ever useful information I can, he or she is excused to the waiting room. It is often when the parent(s) comes in that a more realistic picture begins to form. Case Study The following case was unique in that the patient spoke openly about his violence/ rage. In addition, he was under treatment by a local psychiatrist. Many of these patients are either sent to a \"boot camp\" or are put on a variety of drugs. This patient had a long history of both. The off-label use of antipsychotics is common for violence and rage in teens. \"Martin\" was originally put on pre- scription drugs and sent to boot camp because of various episodes of violence towards his mother. In one instance, he grabbed her by the throat and slammed her against the wall, choking her. His brother was there and got Martin away from her. Similar violent acts happened frequently enough that his mother sought help from a psychiatrist before bringing him to see me. I first saw Martin in March 2003. He was 15 years old and being managed on 20mg citalopram hydrobromide and 1.5mg risperidone QD. Martin measured 6'2\" and weighed 232 pounds. He started right off discussing the main issues: \"When really young, I was an an- tagonist at school, started fights, cussed at teachers. After parents divorced, I got worse. At age 8 my Dad died. Instead of just cussing at people, I got into lots of fights. I've always been really good at ma- nipulating people to get my way. \"I was at a treatment center, got worse, then went to detention center. I then went to another treatment center in the south, really rough for first six months. After that, things began to click, I started doing better. They diagnosed me with PDD [Pervasive Developmental Delay] and ODD [opposi- tional defiance disorder]. \"In most areas I do above average except socially with peers. I was having a really hard time with peers - but good with adults. I want to have a good job, social standing.\" More? \"Lately at school, I have a guy who I hang out with; we both have behavioral problems, good friends, but treat each other like crap. Others look at us and say, 'Wow, they are jerks.' Girls will comment about how rude we are to each other, and we will tell them it's none of their business. If I feel threatened, I lock into a mode where I throw up defenses and attack and attack when people are in control of me, where they give me orders and tell me what to do. But I don't have relationships with them. \"I want to take swing lessons and learn martial arts. I work out every day.\" Physical health problems? \"I was 250 pounds before I went to the rehab center. I had been laying around all the time. But not feeling well, because I used to be so fat. Asthma? \"Up until 10, I could run without asthma problems. Then I stopped being athletic and got fatter, started bulk- ing up. Then the asthma came.\" Problems when younger? \"I used to throw up a lot - not to do with what I ate. If I was sad, or sometimes I'd just throw up, or if angry - in other words, if intense emotions happened, I'd vomit.\" What interests you about the mili- tary? \"I'm not a huge patriot, now more interested in the experiences - like I could travel the world, do things that most people don't do. Also allow me to get into the CIA, which is what I really want.\" CIA? \"I want an ordered life, and a rea- sonably high secure income. Working for the government, you get crazy benefits. I'm not so interested in the spy operation, though I do want to work in a clandestine way, but more interested in the muscle work.\" Temperatures? \"I like it tolerance.\" Dentist? \"Doesn't bother me.\"I excused Martin to the waiting room, and invited in his mother. Here is her accounting: \"Throughout his life, a tendency to be rigid in his thinking. It is difficult to get him to shift, long term. His difficulties: He doesn't have a softness. We discussed something about hav- ing long-term relationships. He said, 'I don't want long-term relationships. That is not who I am.' That concerns me highly ... because he is a very hypersensitive person, very loving person, and has a big heart. He loves little kids. He is the protector spirit. But when he gets in this place ... I'm not sure if it's a de- fense mechanism. He's not successful making human connections. He more often identi- fies with adults, but still plays with Legos. I believe he is very loving. If not successful with that, he withdraws, gets a hard edge.\" Hypersensitive? \"He couldn't have any tags in his clothes, didn't like any wrinkles, couldn't have much touch on him. Sounds, or tones of voice. He always has been a tone-of-voice kid. It wasn't just what you said, but also your tone of voice. He may think I'm mad at him if I'm not careful; gets defensive very easily about the tone I use. The gabapentin settled him. It can also be in relation to his binge eating; he'll vomit it all up after 20 minutes.\" Mother's milk? \"For a while, he had difficulties, he'd throw up a lot. I nursed him until he was almost two. Sometimes he'd give up on eating; after we'd intro- duced it, he'd nurse for four days in a row, and lose interest in eating. He was an all- consuming, high maintenance kid. \"We couldn't get him to realize that something was enough unless you physi-cally picked him up and took him out of the situation. He couldn't have things not his way; he'd keep driving at it. If some kid decided to change to another game, he'd be trying to rope that kid to do what he was interested in. You couldn't cue him or redirect him or distract him; you'd have to physically remove him. He was too demanding for his friends, they couldn't tolerate him for long. \"He has always been rather large, and his anger intimidates people. He could always get himself in a lot of trouble.\" Fears/Phobias? \"When he was born, we lived in the woods. Didn't do it with his brother, but every other male that came up that driveway, he'd shriek or scream. We knew it was going to be a man at that door. And we didn't have many people visiting; this was before he was one year old. We couldn't ever figure out how he knew they were coming. He was initiating this severe reaction without any sounds that we could hear.\" Sleep? \"Difficulty going to sleep, or awake for hours after everyone else was asleep. Most of his life, until 10, he slept with me or his Dad. For a while, he'd want to be in his room, but it would be up and down all night. He'd wake up at night, and say 'momma,' or he'd say 'I had a dream.' \"If he can get a guy to wrestle with him ... something about being very physical. Still chews on ice. He used to chew on his shirts and ruin them, right around the neck line.\" Case Notes When I first saw this patient, I thought of Cuprum: He was not just violent, but he had a hero instinct and considered himself a protector. He was very concerned about injustices and wanted to right them. Mar - tin's mother described Martin as having a big heart and being sensitive. One thing that helps differentiate Cuprum from other met- als is that the patients often have two sides to them: They can have a violent aspect as well as a more sensitive side. Martin wanted to learn martial arts and swing dancing. Physically there were also numerous expres- sions of contraction to confirm Cuprum - cramping, teeth grinding, etc. In a class that Massimo Mangialavori gave on differentiating metals, his pre- cise Cuprum profile helped me to get to Cuprum with confidence for this patient. In addition, the repertory supported Cuprum as a possibility (see Table 1 on p. 11). When I initially saw Martin, his vio- lence was being controlled very success - fully by the risperidone. That made it dif-ficult to assess if the Cuprum remedy was working. There were changes that looked promising, but it was hard to be certain. In addition, Martin himself became discour - aged, as he didn't feel any significant changes. The patient and mother discontin- ued treatment in Fall 2003. They returned for treatment in August 2005. Martin was completely off the anti- psychotics; he was 17 years old and trying to get his record clean so he could get into the military. He said the military wouldn't take him if he was dependent on drugs. August 2005 Martin: \"I've been having trouble sleeping - mostly getting to sleep. Can get to bed at 12 but won't fall asleep until 3, just laying there doing nothing.\" What else is of concern? \"I'm pretty irritable with my mom; not so much with others, mainly with my mom.\" More? \"All she is interested in talking to me about is, 'you haven't done this and not done that,' so I'm always irritable when she talks to me.\" Irritable? \"I'll be snappy, I don't care, don't want to hear it, don't want to talk to her. Generally , I'm rude.\" (Patient is physically larger then when I saw him last). \"I keep get- ting hives, like on the palms of my hands.\" Anything else? \"The skin on my feet will peel and callous, and get a rash more often than normal. It is really frequent, large sections of the bottom of my feet will just peel off. If I grab some and pull, a whole layer of skin will come off.\" Anxiety or depression? \"Definitely do get anxious, not depressed.\" In particular? \"Mostly about how others think of me, or what their opinion is about me, am I saying the right thing, doing the right thing.\" Current meds? \"Only escitalopram oxalate. About three months ago, I decided I wanted to join the army. They won't take you with drugs, but without anything I got really, really depressed.\" Depressed? \"I wouldn't leave the house, just lay around in a pair of shorts, just read and sleep. Just wouldn't leave.\" Singing/music (double checking for Cuprum)? \"Oh yeah, love to sing, espe-cially more obscure things, like musicals, gospels, old folk songs, etc. I like a lot of the songs from the '60s, the peace songs. I have these two aspects, anger and violence, Some of my most violent patients have been quite charming ... Despite having seen this phenomenon repeatedly, I can still be fooled by the teen until the parent tells me what is happeningoctober 2007 NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW 11Vis Medicatrix Naturae ers, like Martin. I had him take Cuprum bro- matum 30c QD for four days in a row. He returned for a follow-up one month later. Follow-Up, September 2005 Martin: \"When do I get more of that miracle medicine!? I'm sleeping a lot better. My sleep is very restful and contented. The days I took the remedy I was not sleeping as heavily as I usually do. It has been great. Not needing any drugs to fall asleep. Also, my mood has been more calm. Don't know if that was part of it. The hives and acne are still there. Acne is not such a problem, but the hives are a bit of a bother, sometimes my hands get really itchy and itch until I get blisters.\" (Pt shows some vesicles that have been broken open.) Anything else? \"I've been so much more active. Did two hours of martial arts last night, not so tired. In the past, I'd have been so exhausted. I've also gone on some good bike through his arms, back, all through his belly . He also does this demanding talk. If he wants something and I won't get it for him, he'll just get in my face and talk and talk at every level, will dominate with every conversation, with force - a driven conversation.\" Case Discussion I used this follow-up to confirm my original theory that this could be some kind of cuprum. In addition, I prompted him with several questions to confirm a cuprum salt. He confirmed the concept of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as well as the idea of paranoia that someone is behind him. Mangialavori has stressed that frequent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a common expression in bromium salts. This helped me to consider that the remedy could be Cuprum broma-tum. In bromatum, the patient can have this fixation with the past or things behind him, and similar to iodatum, they can be overeat-ian Angels is a group of teenagers who are vigilantes. They patrol the streets and use their martial arts skills to protect civilians.] Mom's input, biggest concern? \"That he is having a hard time focusing to get things done. He is incredibly messy and ... focuses enough to get himself to work, but has to make calls to get to school. Also, he is irritable with me, super easy. I can't talk it out with him. I just have to ignore him, be quiet, get out of his way. \"He hasn't been brushing his teeth for several years. Goes back and forth complain- ing that he needs some kind of dental care. Something is hurting in his mouth. He is grinding. Then has a tendency to get hooked on one variety of food. Ate 50 cans of a specific brand of noodle soup in two or three weeks. \"The stretch marks, when he put on so much weight; got up to 320 last year. His stretch marks are severe, really severe, all and music and enjoying singing. It's harder during times when I'm with alpha males, but now a lot easier for me being around more flexible people. Now I can sing or dance, a lot more easy for me. Used to be totally uncomfortable with crying in public, but now it's not a problem. I also like the teen 'chick flicks,' go see those by myself. I used to have lots of problems with it, 'til I became fine with who I am.\" (Case Note: The above information helped me to confirm that the patient prob- ably did require some type of cuprum salt, so I began to ask a number of questions to help with the differential.) Ever have much D\u00e9j\u00e0-vu (thinking of Bromium)? \"All the time - used to get it a couple times per day. Be sitting talking with someone, and 'whoa, I've done this before.' \" Can you sleep with your back to the door (Bromium)? \"I was really paranoid about crimes being committed around me, feel that someone would break into our house and steal something or kill us. I couldn't sleep with my back to the door. It was so extreme that I would have to switch my head so that I could lay on the other side. If walking late at night by myself, I'm scoping out people, like wondering if they are a threat.\" More? \"Is someone going to blow up a building? Or is someone going to see me walking alone on the street and shoot me? Or, if someone is walking behind me, I will definitely want to check over my shoulder. A lot of that has been helped by my joining the guardian angels patrol.\" Guardian angels? \"We are a neighbor - hood thing, started in New York in 1979.

They exist in food (vegetables, fruits and herbs) but research indicates their presence has been diminished by modern farming methods, new plant varieties and by food processing techniques. Our modern diet delivers about 2mg of salvestrols per day compared to about 12mg a hundred years ago. Salvestrol dietary supplements can help maintain good health by achieving the level of salvestrols present in our historical diet. When disease is present, dramatically higher levels of salvestrols can be metabolised. Salvestrol Professional (hydrophilic) is distributed through the body via general circulation while Salvestrol Gold (lipophilic) is distributed via the lymphatic system and by crossing from cell to cell.

My energy has definitely increased. I don't crave sweets as much, either.\" Focus for school? \"I seem to be accom- plishing more. Things are definitely moving a lot more. Not relying on Mom for rides as much, doing more busing, more independent.\" Irritability? \"There is much, much less irritability. My mom and I argue with some things, more normal I think.\" Mother's input: \"His sleep was better immediately. He'd been staying up for all hours of the night. He has been recover - ing with his irritability much quicker. He still has a pretty severe defensiveness. His responses are still very intense. I think he goes into that emotional abusive space, it is so intense. But with the rest of the world, he seems to be recovering or not even going there - beautiful. Clear improvement in both sleep and defensive- ness with others.\" And his relationship with you is about the same? \"It is not worse. When it is just he and I, yes he is still very angry, defensive. It is like the adolescent who wants to show he is a man, but if he hurts himself he cries like a baby because you didn't get there soon enough - he seems like that to me.\" Anything else of note? \"His skin seems pretty cleaned up. He's a lot more willing to eat decent food. Before he was wanting to go out and eat fast food all the time. He was not a fan of fresh fruit until now.\" Case Notes, November 2005 Since the patient was doing well after four doses of 30c, I decided to let him be and give a bottle of Cuprum bromatum 30c (liq- uid) to hold onto for problems that might arise. This turned out to be a mistake. The patient's sleep declined about two months after the initial doses. He got frustrat-ed and drank the whole bottle of the remedy . He became very edgy and dangerous after this. In one of his episodes, he got so angry that he kicked out the back windows of his mother's car. Then went upstairs in the house and threw things out his window. It was an incredible tantrum. He cried afterwards and called his counselor. I didn't know it at the time but the amount of the remedy given can make a difference. I've seen this phenomena in several bipolar and violent cases now. Not knowing that he'd been overdosed, I had him take some 30c twice a week. But this also didn't work. He became extra irritable just after the doses and would wake up with stomach cramps and violent vomiting. Because of this, I had him hold off on any fur - ther dosing the entire month of December. His mother called in January 2006 say- ing he had been doing well in December, but had become aggressive. So I had him take a Q3 (similar to LM3) daily and sched - uled to see him in March 2006. Follow-Up, March 2006 How are you doing? \"I'm doing really well. The acne has almost completely gone away. Other than the little remaining acne, everything else has been really good. Mom and I have had fewer conflicts. I'm more easygoing. Better able to focus my energy and accomplish things. I changed school to an independent study program.\" Getting along better with your mom? \"Yes, definitely. Still having our snippets, but they are more friendly. I'm not so mean and rude. Now we are joking about it more, the dynamic has changed.\" What has your mom said about it? \"She hasn't, but usually would say I'm hurting her feelings, and so on, that was on a regular basis, that hasn't been happening much at all.\" Guardian Angels? \"I do it but defi- nitely not as regularly.\" Any instances where lost temper and got a bit physical? \"Definitely not since January. I've definitely lost my temper, but not where losing control of myself.\" Is there something you are aware of about things changing? \"I'm definitely more at ease, and more empowered about how I'm in control of myself. When I was younger, I definitely had that feeling of being the slave to my emotions. Not feeling that way at all. Late January, I was a little de- pressed, wanted to just lay in bed, but got out and did things and was exercising. That was very good to feel that way. When I feel upset about things, I don't have to act negatively, can do other things. Also things that would have irritated me much stronger definitely irritate me on a much smaller level.\" Sleep? \"I'm sleeping, it is really resolved. Especially since exercising regularly, gener - ally up by 7 or 8 and going to sleep early .\" Other issues you're concerned about? \"No, feel things are going well, keep doing what I'm doing.\" D\u00e9j\u00e0-vu? \"That doesn't happen much anymore. It used to be a frequent occur - rence, now I can't remember the last time that happened.\" Cramps? \"I think there was one week- end, but it was because of overexercising, some cramps in lower legs.\" On guard watching out for threats? \"Definitely going much better, partly because I can pick them out right away. Even when I'm out with the Guardian Angels, I worry much less. Also, I can watch horror movies, which before I never could do. I would have nightmares. Now, I realize they are more comical than anything else.\" Martin left for overseas a few weeks after this follow-up. His mother told me he took some of his remedy with him and has used it on various occasions PRN (for cramps, sleep issues, etc.). I asked her in May 2007 how he was and she said he is still doing great over - all. He's currently stationed in Afghanistan. I've seen a good number of teens with this type of violence. There are, of course, many remedies where violence is expressed. In my experience, the precise remedy will quickly resolve the violence and help the pa- tient to mature and begin to flow with life.

NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW June 20088Vis Medicatrix Naturae a case of adolescent Self Harm TIm SHANNON, ND Patient: A 16-year-old girl, conventionally beautiful, thin, petite, with black and red hair, wearing a black mini skirt and fishnet stockings. She was referred by a female col - league (partially because the patient preferred a male homeopathic physician) and was seeking help for depression, anxiety and self harm. Initial Appointment, May 2004 (Patient): My mom wanted me to come in for help for my depression and anxiety. More? It began in seventh grade. I was very isolated and stressed. In ninth grade, I realized I was clinically depressed, and in tenth, started self-injury. I have social anxi- ety and blush often, feel constant stress, and use cutting and bruising as an outlet. More? I'm trying to stop self-injury, but still want to do it when anxious. I'm ner - vous often, panic-attacky, and get extremely stressed in front of people. I'm fine with a select group, but uncomfortable in groups, especially if I'm the focus. I can't control it, I get obviously nervous, blush and shake. It's a huge problem - I can't do anything. I go to great lengths to avoid giving a speech or to get out of going to a party, and if people pressure me, I'll end up cutting. Example? I got pressured to do a speech, I didn't want to, but they kept badgering me, so I skipped school and cut myself in the bathroom. Worst-case scenario? Suicidal.When you actually do a speech? I'll get up there, sometimes it goes okay, other times I blush, my lips shake, my heart races and I talk too fast, and am horribly depressed afterwards, and can't forget it; things from long ago still bug me a lot. Seventh grade? I felt isolated, had lots of embarrassing moments and was really, really shy. People teased me about it. I felt awkward and uncomfortable. I got home- schooled in eighth grade because I wouldn't go back. Ninth grade was no better. I lost a big support in my life, for a while I thought that was making me depressed. Support? My best friend moved and didn't keep in touch; he didn't seem interested, it was a big blow. I had no other friends. In seventh and eighth grades, I could still have fun. After he left, I became unmotivated, quiet and depressed. In ninth grade, I kept being sad, but realized it wasn't about that anymore. Grade now? Eleventh. Most difficult now? The anxiety. I can't hide it. If I knew I'd never blush, I wouldn't be as crippled. It keeps me from doing stuff, restricts my life. The depres- sion is related - I can't go out when feeling vulnerable and depressed, I don't want everyone to see. I can't appear weak in any way - being nervous is weak. Appearing weak? In eighth grade, I liked not being girly, I shrank away from girly things ... slumber parties, wearing pink. I also didn't want to look girly. It's al- ways bugged me that I'm physically small. I don't want to appear weak, vulnerable, girly, helpless, na\u00efve. More? If someone implies I'm weak, comments about me being short, blushing or unable to lift something, I'll go dead silent, get depressed and occasionally think suicidal stuff. I can't control it, really bothers me.Fears/Anxieties/Phobias? I've always been scared of deep water, of not being able to get away, of something swimming underneath me. I'm afraid of the dark, of public speaking. Deep water? I hate the feeling of floating, of not seeing what's under water, being unable to get away fast, feeling helpless. I have lots of dreams of things swimming underneath me and I can't get away; or dreams of trying to run, but not fast enough; or trying to punch or kick but not fast enough; and people laughing at me because I can't hit hard enough. Animals? My favorite animal is a hawk; I've always liked bats, too. I also like big cats. Fireflies and jellyfish are interest- ing. Hawks and bats are the big ones. About hawks? Hawks are fierce-look- ing, fascinating. I like that they're preda- tory and dangerous. Animals averse to? I'm fascinated by dangerous ones, typical ones are boring. Nervous habits? I chew the skin around my fingernails, a lot. I rip at them and they bleed. Appetite? Recently, the past year it hasn't been there. I don't have an appetite. Nothing sounds good, I've no will to eat. If stuff sounds good, I have no problem eat- ing. I don't gain weight. Hypersensitive to sound, light, odors or touch? If music I don't like is playing I will want to explode. Occasionally , if something rubs against my skin, I can't get to sleep. Speaking up for yourself? I'm not very good about that. People used to think I was mute. Physical health problems? A lot of headaches, I don't drink enough. Headaches? Usually one-sided; or it's on both sides of my head, like a vise squeez-ing, and I can't concentrate on anything. Sleep? Don't get enough; I stay up too late. Waking? I hate getting up, not a morn - ing person. Dairy? No problems with milk, I've always liked it - drink some every day. Feeling isolated? I don't connect eas - ily. I felt isolated from fourth grade 'til last year. I don't connect well with girls. They have traits I really dislike, they value dif- ferent things. I don't understand how most girls think, don't enjoy the same things, have a different sense of humor. I feel com - petition with them. Competition? Her outfit looks better than mine, her hair ... but I don't show it. I can't have girlfriends, I feel inferior. I'm more aggressive than most girls. I value my tomboyish side, but I'm getting physically aggressive, hurting people, but not mean- ing to. I'm friends with this freshman; if he bugs me, I push him, choke or kick him. Sort of playfully, but I enjoy that I can hurt him. Once or twice I choked him, and made his mouth bleed. I'm physical - if someone reaches out to me, I'll grab their hand. I can't help it. I enjoy it, but don't mean to hurt anyone. I hit people playfully, but too hard. Dreams under water? In one, I could see miles down. The water was clear, it was nighttime, there were giant sea snakes, manta rays, whales and sharks. Mostly I can't see the things, which is worse. Throat? The first sign I'm getting sick. At one point I was soprano in choir, the highest rank. In the second year, I had left vocal cord paralysis and couldn't reach the high notes, nothing came out. They said it would go away, but it didn't. It cut off most of my range, I still can't sing very loud. Jealous? I'm very jealous, insecure about everything about me, jealous of ev-eryone that looks the way I want to look. Envious? Of people who socialize eas- ily, of people who can interact. I'm smart, but get competitive with people who do better than me. Jealousy from boyfriend? It makes me uncomfortable. I'm insecure, I don't need much to convince me of the worst. Hobbies? Writing is my passion. I write almost every day. I've filled eleven journals over four years. I'm extremely self- critical. I just finished a short story - I'm proud of it. Decision making? I'm indecisive; big decisions tend to stress me out. Hot or cold? Cold fingers, sometimes toes. I have Raynaud's syndrome. Some - times, in winter, holding a cold glass makes my fingers cold, numb, yellowish. Some - times my pinky goes numb and yellow when looking for something in the fridge. Fears? I've always been fascinated by the things I'm scared of. Hemorrhage? I tend to bruise and scar easily, and have bruises with no idea where I got them. Bruises? Usually barely visible, pink- ish or yellowish. Allergic? My skin, to most sunscreen and lotions, some soaps. I get a rash - itchy, bumpy, red - that doesn't last. I sunburn easily. Menses? They are regular, started in ninth grade, normal. Problems? Had horrible PMS for a while last year; my period would start and I'd be fine. Depressed? I'm hopeless, sensitive, an- gry and easily upset about everything. Then, I felt completely hopeless, but as soon as my period came, I felt better. It was dramatic. Dreams? I used to have lucid dreams. It was amazing, I could do whatever I wanted. If trying to run away from mon - sters, I'd disappear and then wake up. I want to be able to control things more. When home by yourself at night? I used to think about someone lying in wait in the house. Food? I like meat in general. I'm not a picky eater, I will try anything. No favorite. Flavors you like? Spicy - lightly spicy things. Sweet stuff doesn't appeal to me at all. Feel appreciated? I feel pretty appreci- ated by those I'm close to, those who matter. Abandonment issues? Yeah. With that guy (who left in ninth grade) I felt extreme-ly abandoned, because he left and didn't seem to care. It took two years to get over. Fear of dark? It is ominous. When I'm really tense, the fear manifests as a guy in the room. Negative experience? Sometimes when scared of the dark, I listen to music, and imagine the singer protecting me. Critical? I don't judge people very June 2008 NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW 9Vis Medicatrix Naturae always works. In a May 2006 meeting, she couldn't remember the last time she hit her - self. She came back into treatment recently for irregular menses and PMS. A single dose of 10M resolved both. Her mother is also very pleased with her progress. September 2005 Patient adjusted to college quickly, with sur - prising ease. She was confronted by another student and put down in a harsh way. After this, she punched herself. Describes moods as stable and happy, feels more \"resilient.\" Appetite is stronger than ever remembers. Waking is \"really easy.\" Recognizes self- harm behavior as addiction. Assessment: Patient still doing very well. One episode of self harm, from ex-tenuating circumstances. Summary The patient has done well to date (early 2008). She has used the Agki-p for colds, sore throats and stressful situations, and it when depressed, it is always about me. I have this creepy habit when depressed; I have ideas of getting shot, stabbed or of stabbing myself, like a movie playing in the background. I don't even have to be feeling awful, but think about stabbing or shooting myself in the temple, or stabbing myself in the stomach. It repeats over and over, espe- cially if thinking about a bad, embarrassing memory, but it's comforting. Is this morbidity familiar? It's always been there. Worse recently? Yes, I never dreamed horrible things like this. Also, I'm over - whelmingly empathetic, it's almost crip- pling. I feel all negative emotions of others, it's been worse lately. Wear black? Colors clash with my hair. I feel better mentally wearing black. It isn't even my favorite color. Favorite? Bright red orange, like fire. Biggest concern? Blushing, it makes me scared of socializing. When alone? I do self injury. First it was scratching, but I couldn't break the skin. I felt weak, so I got a better knife and made really deep [cuts]. It's just a stress or anger release. I punch myself, but always feel like I'm not doing a good enough job. I gave myself a horrible black eye. Cut yourself? I cut my right thigh mostly, or left wrist, but only when I want people to see. When angry, I punch myself. I go into the bathroom and hit my head really hard. I think bruises and cuts are really pretty. I admire the cuts or bruises I make, I really like how it looks. I think scars are beautiful, memories, like a scrapbook. Assessment: It became clear that Palladium was off. So I began to consider a snake. In particular, Elaps (bashful, persecution, icy cold hands, biting self, etc.) looked likely. I gave Elaps (coral snake) LM2 daily. September 2004-April 2005 Improved bashfulness, wavering improve- ments with self-destructive urges, little change in sleep or appetite. Assessment: There were some good improvements, so I continued Elaps for approximately eight months. However, in April 2005 she came to an appointment with a black eye she'd given herself and she had been cutting on her left wrist. I questioned Elaps at this point, as the deepest issue - the self harm - was not improving significantly. So I prescribed a single dose of Agkistrodon piscivorus (Agki-p) 1M. Agki-p is the venom of the cottonmouth snake. The proving for Agki-p notes incredible violence and morbidity, so I thought it might be a bet- ter match. May 2005 Patient happy, able to stop urge to cut or punch herself which, she says, is a \"mira - cle.\" She is going to bed earlier, has more energy, has stopped wearing only black clothing. Assessment: Agki-p 30c once per week (a few pellets in 1oz dropper bottle, four drops per dose). July 2005 Patient reports minor morbid impulses, no longer feels shy, estimates being 300% more confident. Assessment: Continue Agki-p 30c once per week.harshly. I'll bristle in someone's defense. I'm pretty much nice to everyone. Someone compliments you? I re- spond positively. It's rare, so I remember it, it means a lot to me. Mother's input: Loss of appetite, especially in the morning. Likes variety, quickly tires of foods. Doesn't sleep well or enough. Not able to sleep until 2 or 3 a.m. Compulsively chews on fingers. Exceedingly low self-esteem and self-con- fidence. Hopeless outlook on life, doesn't have motivation in school, because she doesn't think she'll be around for long. Urge for cutting, a fight all the time not to do it, whether cutting or punching herself. An ongoing struggle day in and day out. Broadly applied social anxiety, doesn't want to do anything that in- volves others. Gets tense and adamant about not wanting to be around people. Fears/doubts her ability, doesn't want to learn to drive due to a fear of looking stupid. Sensitive about people thinking she is young, or ignorant. Started fall- ing apart in adolescence. Seventh grade, was a happy kid. Is bright, gorgeous, but doesn't know it. Wakes up in a smolder - ing ruin. An amazing writer. A lot of her poetry is dark, with slashing and knives. Writes poetry all the time, very gifted artist. Her writing is puzzling. Just finished a disturbing story - two compan-ions in a sculpture gallery smash it up, destroy a sanctuary. A staunch atheist, strict about it. Very sarcastic. Doesn't like girls, doesn't want to be around them. Hangs out with guys. Last guy friend, she enjoyed physically wrestling - it felt good to show her strength. Kicks them in the shins. Has red hair and wants to change the color of her eyes, with contacts. Is in major agony that she's short, too little. Traumatized by her size. If someone says she's sweet, she's hurt and angry. A dis- connect if anyone thinks of her positively - misreads situations. Never been afraid of bugs, usually fascinated if there's a snake in the yard; she'll want to catch it. Assessment: Patient given various potencies of Palladium for three months, which appeared to help for a time. Her bashfulness and appetite improved, but not the self harm. August 2004 (Patient): The only change is really vivid dreams, really violent nightmares. I had a nightmare four nights in a row. They are creepy, scary, violent or despairing, and lots of gruesome, graphic images of people I care about. My boyfriend was in my backyard, with his hands almost cut off and his legs cut off - I knew it was a suicide. Another was a friend beheaded in my backyard - along with two other anonymous people. In another [dream] I found my boyfriend in bed with a black eye and bloody mouth. The most recent one was of two guys torturing or shooting this woman. It was horrible. After those nights of violent dreams, my mom gave me Rescue Remedy, and they stopped. I didn't even want to go to bed for a while. It's weird, because for years I didn't have any nightmares.

Patient is sweet but reserved. (Physician) Know why you're here? No. Things scared of? Swimming les- sons. I don't like holding my breath, I don't like putting my head under water for a long time. Something else that scares you? My brother. He rubs my hair, picks me up, pushes me really high on the swing, which I don't like, or just that I don't know what he'll do. Animals? I like alligators, dinosaurs, eagles. Favorite one? Probably alligators. I like how they bite people's feet off, how they are in water and out of water at the same time, like turtles. Sleep okay? I go to sleep at 8:30 p.m., I fall asleep around 11 p.m. I just lie in my bed, wait to go to sleep, think about different stuff. Dream? I remember like 20. When I was six [years old], I dreamt I was at an amusement park, each kid was taking what they wanted. Then we were in the line to go home. We were on this bridge, one of my friends said we have to be still, but I didn't listen. Then this monster jumped out of the water and bit my head off, but I could still see. I was about to fall into the creek, then I woke up. You and your brother fight some- times? Yeah. Are you cautious or more of a risky type? I just like to jump out there even if I don't know if it is safe. Lots of friends? Yeah. Do you prefer a certain tempera- ture? I like to be colder more than warmer. Music? It is my least favorite thing in school. (Patient's mother): He is a bright fellow. He is here because he's having a really hard time with his temper and is fairly rigid. He gets fixated on clothes, like a favorite sweatshirt, and will wear it for four or five weeks. He was in the principal's office for punching another kid in the eye and for punching a girl in the chest. He doesn't follow limits very well, he's reluctant to do what he's told. He's very short tempered. He is very organized, makes his bed, gets upset if someone opens a closet door without closing it, if he doesn't have control over things. He has a sacred space, it is very important for him. The violence, short temper and rigidity are issues. It's been hyped up the last few weeks. He got stepped on by his brother by accident, and he was very dramatic about it. Early on in his life, he was a head banger. He is not commonly talkative. Does really well one on one, and has a hard time with groups. More examples of anger, vio- lence and destructiveness? In the morning, when we ask him to do simple things (like get up, get dressed, come upstairs), and he'll yell \"No!\" or \"I'm not ready!\" Or he'll ignore us, and after a third or fourth request, he'll start yelling. When angry he can call us names. He says things to adults that are very strongly worded, like 'shut up,' or 'you can't make me.' He even spit in my face once. He has a very strong sense of what is fair. If his brother has more ice cream then he has, he'll throw an hour-long tantrum until he gets his way. He is quick to hit; he's bitten children, scratched and kicked. If there is some chaos, or people ganging up on him, he doesn't cope very well. He hit his best friend, a girl that he adores, pretty hard because he was jealous of the other kids playing with her. She was hurt, crying and upset. For a long time he couldn't show remorse, empathy or concern, he couldn't make eye contact with her, or apologize. Sympathy/Empathy? Not so empathetic. I experience him as a deeply passionate person, and caring, but not so expressive. If he's responsible, if he's injured someone, he is unable to make that shift. If his brother or an animal is injured, he's there to help. Clothing? He doesn't like wearing tight clothes, gets very attached to clothing. Jealousy? It translates into what he considers to be fair. If you do something for the other child, he assumes it will be done for him, too. When he was really little, he didn't like a lot of touch. Is he an audacious child (look- ing to confirm Rx)? Definitely. He's working on his image to be a prankster, to mimic his older brother. He wants to one- up his older brother. Competitive? Definitely. He loves charts and wants records, stars on how he's done. Ambitious? Yes. Headaches? No. Appetite? Fine, but limited to pizza and pasta. Scared of? He's been taking swim- ming lessons for several months; he's afraid of drowning, he brings it up quite often. Senses? He can be oversensitive with all of them.

Oct Ober NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW 11Vis Medicatrix Naturae acuity of hearing. He can detect tiny sounds that no one else hears. Baseline: 1) Violence/hitting: once per week2) Obstinate: multiple times per day 3) Irritable/sullen with changes 4) Insistence to wear same clothing for weeks 5) Fear of drowning and swimming Assessment & Comments During the intake, I wondered if this could be a case of Alligator mississippiensis (Alli-m in Figure 1 on Page 12). The remedy had recently been proven by Dr. Todd Rowe. Over the years, I've noticed that some cases that require an animal remedy will either hate, fear or admire the animal they require. Of course, there needs to be more than a like or dislike of an animal to choose a remedy. In this case, I saw there were some themes common to reptiles that I have seen before, such as: jealousy and competitive - ness, audacity (audacity and disrespect for authority is more true for Lachesis, Bothrops and T-rex), averse to tight clothes, lacking empathy and a tendency to being more intellectual - a bit cold. Another theme common to reptiles is an identification with the \"dark\" side. In this case, the patient's interest in alligators was curious. He said he liked that they can bite people's feet off. Also, the dream of a monster from the water biting off his head ... He seemed quite pleased with himself while relating these images. Another \"soft\" confirmatory was his fear of drowning. Again, sometimes patients who require certain animal medicines will have either an attraction or aversion to the environment where the animal lives. So I decided to trial him with a single dose of 30C, given in the office at the initial consult. Besides the case fitting the above themes, I also repertorized the case. I had previously read about a cured case of this remedy. All this research supported my hypothesis that perhaps this child could require this new medicine. Plan: Single dose of Alligator missis - sippiensis 30C. Case note: Two weeks later, the parents told me during their other son's follow-up appointment that the boy had clearly im- proved, that there had been no aggravation and that his teachers had also commented on how much better his behavior had been. April 2007 After the dose? (Mother): It immediately had an effect on the things we were looking at. He wasn't hitting or using curse words as much. He even had more flexibility with clothing, and no significant negative behavioral encounters with the teacher or kids at school. Overall there is a sense of him be - ing more cooperative, but there are other power struggles. He used some strong language, especially after a weekend when he was with a lot of other children. Compared to before the Rx? He was clearly better for a time after the dose, but he has regressed some. When he's angry it is striking, almost frightening. His backtalk has an intense feeling behind it. It had abated after the Rx, so when it resur - faced it was noteworthy.Baseline: 1) Violence/hitting: About half what it was.2) Obstinate: Much better, once a day or every other day. 3) Irritable/sullen with changes: half as frequent. 4) Insistence to wear same clothing for weeks: He has some favorite clothes and gets really upset if they are not available. 5) Fear of drowning and swimming? (Patient): I'm not as scared, I just don't like doing it. Assessment and Plan: A good but waning response. Repeat dry dose, 30C, split - one dose in a.m., one dose p.m. June 2007 Feel different? (Patient): I've been acting different. In school I've not been punching as much. It is really good at home, I've not had one single fight with my brother. Sleep? Good. I used to go to sleep at 11 p.m., now going to sleep at 9 p.m. Anything else different? No. How is he doing in general? (Mother): Markedly improved, just the last week slipped a bit. There is a sense of maturity, being clear about his own abilities. The issues about him being uncooperative, inflexible, short tempered - all those areas have improved. They still occur, but he is definitely more amenable, more spontane- ous at helping at home. I think it has been enormously different. Isolated? We noticed with friends and groups, he was always on the outside, had a hard time connecting with a dialog or interacting - more doing parallel play. Now he's able to take turns, tell stories and lis- ten; it's more of a two-way street. It seems to have markedly improved and correlates with just after the last doses. Baseline 1) Violence/hitting: Two or three incidents since last time. Something different about those episodes? It seems like they are a reaction to provocation, rather than him provoking. 2) Obstinate: Still some of that, mouthiness sometimes. That might happen three or four times a week now; it used to be more like several times per day. 4) Insistence to wear same clothing for week: Has not changed a whole lot. 5) Fear of drowning and swimming: (Patient): Now I'm not really nervous, I just don't like the drills, but swimming is pretty fun. Feel different about being in water? (Patient): Yeah. (Mother): That is definitely better. Assessment and Plan: Good effect so far. Mother is concerned with the ap-proaching summer because of his fragility around transitions. I gave him a single dry dose of 200C. August 2007 Summary Comments: The patient was doing well, but three weeks prior to this follow-up he be-gan to regress. In this time he had an encoun- ter with an older boy. The boy was asking him to do some inappropriate sexual things. It was unclear whether it was due to this incident that came out about this older boy or other stressors in the summer. But the patient began to lash out more and was beginning to have some difficulty falling asleep. Most of his baseline symptoms showed regression.

NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW Oct Ober 2008 12Vis Medicatrix Naturae in a split dose - one dose in the a.m. and one in the p.m. of the same day . Fall 2007 Case Note There were multiple missed communica-tions between the parents and me. During this time, the patient began to act out with violence, rudeness and oppositional behav- ior. It was hard to determine the cause, but it might have come from further contact with the boy in the neighborhood who was acting out sexually with the patient. Many attempts to coordinate a different type of dosing failed. Finally , I sent the parents a single dose of 200C in the beginning of October. The parents phoned me one month later that he was definitely improving again, though he seemed a bit apathetic. His mother was concerned about him due to his apathy. Just before Christmas he was beginning to show more rudeness and backtalk - though very little physical violence. I then gave a single dose of Alligator mississippiensis 1M. February 2008 (Mother): He has trouble falling asleep, goes to bed at 8 p.m., still awake until 10 or 10:30 p.m. Had this difficulty with falling asleep since third grade. Otherwise, he's doing well, more flexible. He's been cooperative, more focused. The 1M helped? Yes, it made a huge impact. It was two weeks after. It was given on December 16, and right after Christmas he began doing really well. With the short temper and obstinance he's much better. At school he's not great, though I think some of it has to do with school. He's much more flexible and open. He's also more affectionate. The last few months there has been family stress. And he's been really empathetic. He's been very huggy, a wonderful thing for him. The last 1M didn't help with the sleep? No, it is several nights a week he's struggling. How often? Three or four nights a week. If he goes to sleep on his own, he tosses and turns. Can't go to sleep without his brother in the bed. Some change? There was the sexual stuff in summer with the neighbor, that had an impact. Anger? He can still be belligerent, but now he's reachable. There is also so much less of the angry expressions. Assessment and Plan: Sounds like a good response. They may need to use the Rx for sleep difficulty , but may also be able to use melatonin. No doses for now, wait and watch. May 2008 Wearing same clothes? (Patient): I like to wear the same clothes about three times a week. (Mother): He has his favorites, if asked he'll change his clothes now. He will even wear dress-up clothes, that is big for him. Mother (after patient has left room): The last dose worked great. He's become a bit short-tempered again, but not anywhere to where he was in the beginning. There were a few comments from his teacher, that he was not as well focused. Overall, he's enor - mously improved, much more empathic, spontaneous ... Partner and I have had some rough spots lately. She's been more emo- tional, he's been spontaneously going to hug her and try to take care of her. This empathy is really new for him - only after treatment began. He's also asserting himself more with his brother, in a mature way. They had an awesome interchange about one week ago. They were arguing, and he showed a wonderful ability to go from reactivity to being reasonable. Both of them have really changed on their respec- tive remedies. But overall, he is showing less and less of the angry reactiveness. Overall he has his two feet on the ground more and more now. There is enormous change in him overall. He's using his words much more, instead of violence. Assessment: It sounds overall like a good response. Both parents are very happy with the results. All the baseline symptoms are either a great deal better or resolved. However, his sleep issues could use a bit more support, so I gave another 1M single dry dose. Given the overall good response, I told the mother that we are done with formal appointments. RVBMJUZ\u0001t\u0001JOOPWBUJPO\u0001t\u0001FEVDBUJPOWhy did I choose the GI Effects Stool Profile?

Intake Rubric NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW December 20088Vis Medicatrix Naturae homeopathic treatment of environmental sensitivities TIm SHANNON, ND Today many patients seek help for environmental sensitivities. This is true for adult patients as well as for children. In addition, many consider that toxicity is partly responsible for the increase in childhood developmental and cognitive disorders. This is not just about mercury and autism. It also appears that vaccines may be contributing to the whole range of behavioral, cognitive and social problems we are seeing in our children. As a consequence, every manner of detoxification is being brought to the fore - protocols of the past, as well as newly cre- ated cleansing strategies. Like any therapy, some patients benefit greatly, some less so, some derive no benefit, and some patients are simply too sensitive. Homeopathy offers an alternative for patients with environmental sensitivities. The intention is to reduce patients' hy- persensitivity. Over time many patients find they can tolerate smells, plastics, fluorescent lights, etc. The idea is that environmental sensitivities, in many cases, are similar to allergies. They are an over-defensiveness of the entire immune system, so the goal is to bring down the overall hypervigilance of the system. This allows the entire system to finally come to rest and respond to environmental stress in a more robust manner. The fol- lowing case is offered as one example. \"Cindy,\" July 2007 Cindy: I think I'm environmentally sick. I have been allergic to cats since childhood. I had a childhood with frequent chronic ear infections and tonsillitis. One year I lived with my grandmother who had no pets, and that was the only year that I did not have tonsillitis or allergies. I am allergic to dogs, birds and sheep, too. Insignificant medical history prior to 30 y.o. I developed positional vertigo after a neck injury at age 30. I had a neck adjust-ment at age 40 from my husband and the room spun. I used to fall down when walking. At its worst, I just spin. I can't lie flat on my back tilting the head back. When I would have vertigo, I would fall to the right. The whole right side of me didn't work. When that would happen, I would get a rash, pustular vessels on the elbows. I don't get that anymore. I would panic when I had it because I could not function. I've never felt so vulnerable in my life. I was non-functional. The episodes would last for days. The baseline vertigo has never gone, even now. I tell where I am at through visual acuity rather than ear. If the street- car is turning and I can't predict the turn beforehand, I just spin without the visual reference. In the theater, keeping my head tilted back is very bad - feels swimmy, and squeamish. I think the chemical sensitivity is the hardest thing for me, though. It came about over a period of years. I had a reaction to penicillin at the same time as vertigo. I got pinpoint rash. Animals made it worse. Then I had the Hep B vaccination series; took two shots and got very sick. Had to be off work both times and refused the last shot. Then I noticed more springtime allergies. My husband and I have been to- gether 14 years. I moved into his house and he had pets. I thought I was getting flea bites because I had itchy pinpoint spots. Then I moved into food sensitivities [patient cites a long list of food sensitivities]. We bought a new bed eight years ago and I slept on it one night and my husband's lips were blistered. After that, I noticed that I felt antsy , anxious and nervous around some plastics and latex. I started getting a rash un- der the skin - it starts red and itchy and then turns hemorrhagic. At the dentist, when using rubber dam, my lips swell. We moved to a house three years ago and made some renova- tions. Within 24 hours, I began to experience neurological symptoms: upper respiratory congestion, nervous feeling inside, shakiness. Now, I can't go into the local health food stores because they are not well ventilated. Plastics cause the worst reaction. Plas- tics make me feel like I am going to have a seizure. My brain goes on fog and I can't process thoughts. I feel faint as if I was go - ing to pass out. It is a very bizarre feeling. It also happens in other grocery stores. (Dr. S): Fogginess remind you of something? No. I have seriously looked into this and I can't figure out why the world has become a challenging place to me. I think I am wired for anxiety and depression. My grandmother at 90 had psychotic depression when my mother moved 40 miles away. Can you navigate the world with these reactions? I can't stay in my daughter's home because of laundry soaps. Anxiety around this phenom- enon? I feel weary dealing with it and I feel isolated. I was a very social person and my sociability is impacted by this. That is isolating. I feel weakened by it. I've looked at it from a lot of different levels - I've meditated, had Reiki, had homeopathic care, qi gong ... it's weird. A family member molested me when I was young - a huge breach of trust. I feel I have faced what the issues were. I am feel-ing comfortable in myself and who I am. Now we are going to go to the next layer, whatever this is. Fears? Dogs when young, being alone. I was always very small - I had dogs attack me, roosters attacked me and horses bit me. When I was three, I realized that I was going to have to take care of myself. I felt very low in the pecking order. I had a very challeng- ing childhood, and realized that I needed to be in control and watch out for myself. I didn't feel that I bonded with my mother because of her postpartum depression. When hurt, my mother didn't respond. I had a sense that people weren't watching out for Authorized Signature: Date: 69\u0015;DGBCLIENT CONTA CT any?69\u00156EEGDK 6A/ \u00b0 Ad approved as is \u00b0 Corrections needed Client will supply a correct ad file \u00b0\u00caChanges desired Client authorizes NDNR to make changes indicated; design fee applies.Fax Back To: (480) 275-7712s\u0000Look over your project and check for errors; spelling, address, telephone #'s, copy or content.

I enjoy helping people. I have tried to integrate these two parts of myself. Maybe the fear came and that was the vulnerable, scary place. Armor? Protecting my vulnerability. I reject you before you reject me. The armor - ing up is getting big when you feel small. Self-protection. Support? I can do okay on my own, but support is very important. I felt guilty as a kid when I was sick - felt ashamed that my system was not functioning as well as other people's. Support is very important, that I would not be treated as a hysteric or that all this was in my head [tearful]. Foods? Flavorful. Indian food. I like spicy. Pickles. Sauerkraut. I prefer salty food to sweet food. Headaches/back problems? Don't have a lot of pain. I have aches and muscle spasms, but not pain. They tend to be tight and spasmy. Baseline: Overreaction to being around plastics Reaction to dogs and cats Reaction to laundry detergent, per - fumes, chemical smells Anxiety of flare-up in new places, couple times a weekPositional vertigo (a constant back- ground symptom)Depression about condition Assessment: After some study, I thought this case could require a remedy from the Asteraceae family. I attended a seminar with Massimo Mangialavori several years ago. He mentioned that certain remedies in this family, such as Arnica and Helian-me down and stood on my chest and pecked at my face and eyes. The surgeries I have had in the past have been emergen- cies. I get sick one day and have pain and my system starts shutting down and boom! I've had to have a hysterectomy. Because of a number of traumas, on some level, I am probably waiting for the next shoe to drop. How do you see the world? Shit happens. I have also felt that when I've really felt frightened, I have a sense of the need to investigate and look into myself. I feel most of the solutions for my problems are in here. I need someone out there to be a guide. Homeopathy has the deep cure. There is something for me to grow and learn from here. Whatever there is to it, I am not afraid - I just want to know. I was afraid to be alone in our house. My husband would go to India. I felt helpless - an odd sense of vulnerability to the unex- pected - stark terror. I do not know where it comes from. Imagining that someone would come in the house - a male. I feel small. This started with the sense of feeling so little that all these things could get me. What would this man do? Felt like they would just kill me. Death at the hands of someone else - and not death, but being tortured. Feel too little to fight back, or run away. Felt powerless as a female, and that was another issue for me. I have not felt safe as a female. Men have power. I wanted to armor up and get the power my father had. Being a woman didn't get you much - being a woman was being a victim. I was a scrap-per as a kid. I had a lot of bravado. Career life? I knew as a nurse I could go anywhere I wanted. It had flexibility and respect. I went into psych to try and Problems with delivery? Got somewhat eclamptic when age 35 with son. I was starting to get high blood pressure, and herbal tea helped. With my daugh- ter, they did a spinal tap and had forceps delivery. Both children were posterior, and I had about 8-10 hours of active labor. Lots of back pain. Postpartum? I was very young. Had a lot of body image problems. I did not want to get married. After my daughter, I was not into being a parent - I wanted to fulfill my life. My son was colicky after three weeks of age. No specific problems - I was delighted to have an opportunity to do a better job. Warm/cool? Used to really love heat, but now I have Hashimoto's so I don't tolerate heat or cold. I was on bioidentical hormones for ten years and slowly went off over the last two years. Trust? I used to not trust others until I realized that I must trust myself to trust others. I believe that people are basically good. The world is a good place - all my needs have been met. Dairy? I get hives on my chest. Headaches? I had migraines in college. After age 22 I did not have them anymore. I think it was hormonally based. I might have had one after the birth of my son, when he was two months old. Physical energy? I had a lot of energy most of my life. With allergies, I feel tired and wasted. Mostly 7-8/10. I like it that way, so when I feel challenged with allergies, it is a drag. Hypervigilance? All my life I have been hypervigilant. I can't really point to why - other than the rooster who knocked me - was emotionally neglected. My sense was that you had better keep your eyes open and protect yourself. I felt vulnerable. Felt unsafe? My dad was an alcoholic and my mom was a stay-at-home mom and probably angry at dad. I remember wak- ing and hearing my mother yelling at my father when he arrived home drunk. Food was on the table, but no love. I did not know my father even loved me. Responsibility? V ery responsible, I do the right thing. I broke many rules in college, but as an adult, it's important to do it right. Responsibility as child? I was a rule-breaker, the black sheep. I told them what was going on, demanded, objected, asked and pointed my finger. I was afraid to go to sleep as a child. I had the same dream until I had my tonsils out: an alligator getting me. A lot of green and some red. I was afraid of going to sleep because of the dream. I was choking. Sensitivity? Senses are balanced, except smell. It's hyperacute. I do not know when it changed - it was not always that way. Menses? Had a total hysterectomy due to fibroids at age 45. As a young person, I had heavy periods and cramps. I always wanted my period, it was the badge of courage because of being small. I was not recognized for my age. Period authenti- cated my growing up. Menarche at 15. Regular period with heavy flow: 5-7 days, a couple of days with large clots and cramping. Cramping mainly during period. Heavy flow lasted only for a couple of days, then started to subside. Clots were darker. No odor. When ovulat- ing, would have abdominal pain. Children? Got pregnant in college.

The Leader in Neurotransmitter Testing & Nutritional Solutions Have you tried neurotransmitter testing? NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR NEWS & REVIEW December 200810Vis Medicatrix Naturae She had this to say: \"I took a dose on Tuesday, May 27. That afternoon, I felt bet- ter without flare of any symptoms. Moods were better. Prior to the dose I was feeling down, isolated and lonely. This all really dissipated with the dose. This is such a dramatic shift from when we began. Within 15 minutes of taking the dose I felt a sense of calm, almost sleepy, relaxation instead of that observing tension. The first night I was a bit observant until after midnight and then slept well the rest of the night. I also had a good night's sleep last night. Yester - day there was a subtle sense of well-being.\" The definitive positive response to the tincture lasted about one week, so I had her take a drop of the tincture diluted in water once per week. She remains in treatment, but has commented that she no longer has allergic reactions to cats or dogs; little to no reaction around plastics; her vertigo has diminished markedly; and all the other baseline symptoms have maintained good improvement. At the last follow-up, she stated the changes overall since the begin- ning of treatment have been incredible. We are still working together to reduce sensitiv- ity further, but for the most part, after one year of treatment Cindy has had marked improvements in all baseline symptoms, with many being entirely resolved. use a mask around my computer, now I don't have to anymore. 2. Reaction to dogs and cats: Improved more. Was at a friend's home on Mother's Day; they have two cats. I was able to be in that house without a huge reaction; had some minor reactive airway trouble afterwards. 3. Reaction to laundry detergent, per - fumes, chemical smells: Improved. I went to a place in the midst of people loaded with laundry products, and was able to be there without the reactive panic, that electric feel- ing, the out of control. 4. Anxiety of flare-up in new places, couple times a week: Still very good. I don't have fears now of going to new environments. My life has opened up in so many ways, I'm so pleased. The world is my oyster. 5. Background vertigo: I think it is much better than it was before. It still has an underlying presence, but it does seem better. I was able to look up for two hours at a show without the vertigo. 6. Depression about condition: Gone. I don't have a condition. Assessment, Plan and Epilogue At this point the patient was doing very well. However, I felt we could see greater improvement on her vertigo. She had also developed some depression that she attrib- uted to her altering her thyroid meds. I recommended we trial a bit of a different dosing strategy that I have seen work well with sensitive patients. Often, patients can be more easily managed by using the botanical tincture of their remedy rather than a potentized dose. So I had her take a dose of her remedy in tincture format.Had other treatments? Some, but not for the environmental issues. I have been seeking treatment for the anxiety, and the enormity of it has been the last two years. This feels significant? It has ad- dressed what feels to be root issues, dialed down the anxiety, reactiveness, etc. The vertigo is anatomical. It is from riding a bike, looking down and some neck and up- per back issues. I feel that is more anatomi- cal injury related. My muscle issues have improved as well. They are not as dis- abling; I used to get more muscle spasms when doing exercise. Baseline 1. Overreaction to being around plastics: That has gotten better. Within 24 hours after the ag- gravation resolved, I felt a clear improvement. 2. Reaction to dogs and cats: Still there, but does seem to have changed. I have much less reaction now, able to tolerate that without feeling the panicky feelings. The emotional fight-or-flight has greatly diminished. 3. Reaction to laundry detergent, perfumes, chemical smells: That has reduced as well. I took my son to the airport, his clothes had been heavily perfumed. I was able to deal with that without horrific feelings. It is now at levels that I can live with, not the threat it was before. 4. Anxiety flare-up in new places, couple times a week: It has reduced. I'm not always anxious if I have to go out and be exposed. Now I feel I can be exposed and will deal with it if it happens; no dread about going out, and if exposed reaction is much milder. 5. Background vertigo: Same. 6. Depression about condition: That is absolutely better. That's a different feeling. Not as limiting in my mind; I don't feel as apologetic about it, or that it looms larger than I do. Assessment: I told her it looks good; need more time to confirm. Watch and wait; may need to re-dose on low potency. Summary: Sept 2007-March 2008: The patient had a return of many of her symptoms after the 30c dose wore off. Given her sensitivity, I decided to trial her with a 2x of Chrysanthemum for a time, using liquid diluted doses. Even with this low dosing, she would have improve- ments mixed with brief worsening of her symptoms. As we worked, aggravations diminished and the case was managed well with the 2x potency for several months, adjusting the frequency of the dose as needed to manage the case without causing aggravations. The symptoms in the baseline relat- ing to hyper-reaction around plastics, animals and chemical smells all steadily and progressively improved. She found more freedom, and the intensity of her reactions diminished. While she would still react to exposures, she found the re- actions to be less severe. The background vertigo was still present, but getting better. The depression about her condi- tion decreased as her condition began to improve. The patient had a follow-up in May 2008 and saw more improvements on all baseline symptoms: Baseline 1. Overreaction to being around plastics: Improved remarkably. It is improved since seeing you last. I'm amazed. I used to have to thus, share similar aspects. Massimo only teaches from first-hand knowledge, and from case studies of patients who have had deep healing for a minimum of two years using one precise remedy. His knowledge of Asteraceae remedies is extensive. In respect to this case, there were several themes that confirmed the family according to Massimo: Integrity/Wholeness Dignity Vulnerability/Armored Hypochondriasis/Invulnerable In other cases I've seen that required remedies from this family, they often show up as patients who decompensate later in life. They are often relatively successful, sophisticated and physically healthy until mid-life or older. Many are runners or athletic, and they often eat very conscien- tiously (integrity). Once they decompen - sate and receive their \"wound,\" they often become hypochondriacs (overly focused on health/disease/toxicity). In addition, they are often patients who are more identified with being productive and more \"male\" in their identification. They tend to spend much of their life iden- tifying with the concept of being invulner - able, nothing hurts, they are strong and robust - think of Arnica \"sends the doctor away.\" But this is partly an armor that helps them deny the concept of being vulnerable - their greatest fear. Once that vulnerability can no longer be denied, they swing the other way - fear/anxiety about their health. What struck me about this case was the emphasis on the fear of being murdered, of someone entering her house, almost a fear of persecution. Also there was the fear of letting down her guard and falling asleep. These are all symptoms that came out in the new proving of Chrysanthemum leucanthe- mum (Oxeye Daisy). Some pertinent rubrics: FEAR to go to sleep FEAR of being attacked FEAR; something terrible will happen FEAR; of violence Imagination the body is brittle DREAMS; robbers DREAMS; of persecution WATCHFULNESS Plan: The patient was given a single dose of Chrysanthemum leucanthemum 30c; she took the dose on July 21, 2007. September 10, 2007 What has changed? [The remedy] has helped. Rashes on my skin are almost non-existent - remarkable. Anxiety has been reduced. I had quite a reaction the first week after the dose; my allergies really kicked up. The plastics also really kicked up. In fact, the whole picture, felt like a healing crisis, really blossomed. Since that time, things have improved. More? The dizziness is about the same as before. The aggravation started about 24 hours after the dose. Then after 7 to 10 days it subsided. That is when the skin rashes resolved; I felt an improved sense of well-being; energy was improved. Positive feeling in general. Well-being? I felt very depressed before, powerless to these external things to my environment that were threatening to my physical being. That sense of threat went away. The fear of being a burden to people because I have this condition eased. How long with these issues? Cats and dogs - a lifetime. The anxiety, not until the last three or four years. Perfumes for years and years. biochemicalTim Shannon, ND is in private practice in Portland. He specializes in the treat- ment of mental, emotional and behav- ioral health.
