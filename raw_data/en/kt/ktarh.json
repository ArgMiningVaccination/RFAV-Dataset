We are pleased to bring you our Cancer Care Program's 2010 annual report, which covers the time period from July 2009through June 2010, and highlights the program's many accomplishments during this period. As one of our leading programs and a center of excellence, cancer care at Stony Brook successfully blends our three core strengths: clinical excellence as exemplified through our pioneering procedures and nationally known physicians; basic and translational research that advances the understandingand practice of medicine; and top-flight medical education, in which we train the next generation of physicians and provide a pipeline of doctors to the surrounding communities. This report presents an overview of our comprehensive services, showcasing not only our core disease management teams but also all the other departmentsand people who collectively make our cancer program so extraordinary.Throughout the report we also have focused on achievements of the past year, including research breakthroughs, pioneering diagnostic and surgical procedures, new treatment protocols, and recently acquired state-of-the-arttechnology. We have also included statistics on the number of new patients and diagnoses for many of the areas. As in years past, 2010 was marked by innovation, growth, and expansion. Stony Brook's Cancer Care Program recruited a half-dozen nationally known physi-cians, was the first on Long Island to offer several new procedures, expandedour patient support and community services, and continued to earn the recog-nition of credentialing bodies and our peers. It's an aggressive pace for growth,but it is all part of our mission: To provide the best comprehensive care for today's patient with cancer, while striving to understand the causes of cancer inorder to prevent the disease and to develop more effective methods for curingit. This report shows the strides we made in fulfilling our ambitious mission.

In addition, in June 2010, in response tooverwhelming community need, we created Stony Brook Long Island Children's Hospital. Designed to serveall of Long Island, it is the first children'shospital in Suffolk County. AlthoughStony Brook Children's currently existsas a \"hospital within a hospital,\" futureplans include a new facility. A Leader and an Innovator. Stony Brook consistently embraces the next genera-tion of technology, often being the firston Long Island, the state, or even thecountry to acquire advanced equipmentand technology. Many Stony Brookphysicians are leaders in their fields, notonly pioneering new techniques and pro-cedures but also serving as consultantsand mentors/trainers to area physicians. Our Priorities Reaching Out to the Community. Highly committed to improving the health of its community, the Medical Center established and funds the First Respon-der Program in eastern Long Island, andprovides nearly 1,000 education andhealth-related programs annually. StonyBrook has adopted a patient and familycentered care initiative that partners the patient/family unit with the medicalteam with the goal of better outcomes,improved communication, more in-formed decision making, greater patientsafety, and higher patient satisfaction. Promoting Education and Research. The Medical Center continues to train medicalprofessionals through the University'sSchool of Medicine and the Health Sciences Schools\u2014Dental Medicine,Health Technology and Management,Nursing, and Social Welfare. On the research front, Stony Brook physician-scientists participate in clinical trials, national studies, and community-basedprojects. Approximately 10 percent ofStony Brook's adult patients (and 85 percent of pediatric patients with cancer)participate in clinical trials, as comparedto the two percent national average. Focusing on Quality. Overall, patient satisfaction and safety scores havesteadily increased. Mortality rates havedecreased Hospital-wide for the past fiveyears, one of the fastest declines in thenation. The Quality Assessment ReviewBoard and the Patient Safety Councilcontinue to help Stony Brook further improve clinical quality, processes,safety, and outcomes. Awards and Recognition Stony Brook's efforts to provide excellentclinical care and an exceptional patientexperience has resulted in dozens ofawards from local, state, and national organizations.

He has received multi-ple grants from the NIH and will helpgrow the field's translational research.Cancer Care at Stony Brook University Cancer Center A Message from Cancer Program Leadership Theodore G. Gabig, MD Professor and Chief , Division of Medical Hematology/Oncology; Cancer CommitteeChair; and Associate Director for Adult Clinical Programs, Stony Brook University Cancer Center Robert I. Parker, MD Professor and Vice Chair of Pediatrics for Academic Affairs; Director, Pediatric Hematol-ogy/Oncology; and Associate Director forClinical Trials and Pediatric Clinical Programs,Stony Brook University Cancer Center Rose C. Cardin, RN, MSN Associate Director of Nursing and Operations, Cancer Services Michael Hayman, PhD Professor, Molecular Genetics and Microbiol-ogy, and Associate Director for Research,Stony Brook University Cancer Center2010 Cancer Program Leadership SEVERAL years ago, Stony Brook University Medical Center adopted thephrase \"Home of the Best Ideas in Medi-cine\" to sum up the essence of what weare about. While the sentiment reflectsthe Medical Center as a whole, it couldeasily have been inspired by the cancerprogram alone. Not only is our Cancer Care Program founded on the very best ideas in medi-cine, but in some cases it is the originatorof these very ideas that are changing howcancer is diagnosed, treated, and managed. This reflects our overall goal of creating a world-class cancer program. To a patient it may mean many things: goodoutcomes, comprehensive services, patient-centered care, access to clinicaltrials, and use of the most state-of-the-artdiagnostics, procedures, and protocols\u2014all of which we deliver. But to us, it alsomeans striving to understand the causesof cancer in order to prevent the diseaseand to develop more effective methodsfor curing it. It means providing an integrated framework for care and promoting multidisciplinary and transla-tional research, ensuring that resultsfrom the research bench are quickly in-corporated into more effective therapies. Yes, we are committed to delivering high quality care to Suffolk County and thesurrounding Long Island communities,but we are equally committed to makingsignificant strides to advancing cancercare for all patients. Physician Recruitments Seventeen Stony Brook physicians havebeen named to New whom arein Stony Brook's cancer program. Stony Brook continually seeks out the most expert physicians, many of whomhave national and even international reputations. Physicians who have recently joined Stony Brook's CancerCare Program include:long-term relationships with patients. This provides continuity of care andhelps avoid many of the potential prob-lems associated with fragmented care. The Advantages One of the major advantages of the treatment approach of the Disease Man-agement Teams at Stony Brook is accessto basic research and clinical trials\u2014something many of the team membersthemselves may be involved in at anygiven time. This gives patients moretreatment options, as well as access tothe latest protocols and state-of-the-art interventions. In addition, because Stony Brook has a pioneering minimally invasive surgeryprogram and one of the most technologi-cally advanced radiation oncology pro-grams in the region, patient treatmentregimens\u2014whether surgery, radiation,or both\u2014truly are state-of-the-art, withall the accompanying surgery, the minimally invasivetechniques, including leading-edge robot-assisted surgery, can result in faster recovery times, fewer complications, lessbleeding, and less trauma to the surgerysite. In the case of radiation oncology, because of advanced positioning soft-ware and technology, patients receive amore highly targeted radiation dose withless damage to the surrounding tissuesand organs. Medical oncology specialistswork with surgeons and radiation oncolo-gists to offer the most advanced optionsin systemic and targeted chemotherapy. The teams also have developed quality dashboards with benchmarks that arecontinually reviewed for opportunities to improve patient care specific to theirpractice and interest, and develop newdashboard items measured against nationally established evidence-basedbenchmarks.registered nurses and nurse practition- ers with specialized cancer training, ther-apists, social workers, and other medicalprofessionals. Patients are assigned aNurse Navigator, who facilitates schedul-ing, coordination of services, communi-cation among team members, problemsolving, and matching patients to avail-able clinical studies. Physicians partici-pate in ongoing Tumor Board meetings,where each patient is presented for stag-ing and treatment planning. (For moreon Tumor Boards, see page 37.) Individualized Treatment Plans The multidisciplinary approach begins when a patient enters the program with a cancer diagnosis or suspected cancer.Based on diagnostic studies, staging,medical and family history, lifestyle, and other factors, an individualized man-agement plan is created. During treat-ment, the team confers frequently andupdates the plan when warranted. Theteam follows the patient along the contin-uum of care, providing follow-up, educa-tional materials, referrals to communityresources, and support groups. Becausethe team is directly involved with all aspects of care, members often establishAT STONY BROOK University Medical Center, cancer care is compre-hensive, multi-faceted, and multidisci-plinary\u2014relying on not just one depart-ment or individual, but upon the jointefforts of many working together seam-lessly toward the same goal: deliveringthe best possible outcome in the most compassionate, patient-centered way. Stony Brook's 12 site-specific, multi - disciplinary Disease Management Teamsprovide a coordinated approach to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Patients receive comprehensive cancer services across the full spectrumof care. It is delivered efficiently, offeringa sense of continuity and comfort. Thisapproach has another benefit as well:contributing to outcomes that exceed national benchmarks. Disease Manage-ment Teams also participate in commu-nity education, screenings, and early intervention\u2014all to provide the best care. The Team Teams consist of combinations of oncologists with cancer subspecialties,surgeons, medical hematology/oncol-ogy physicians, radiation oncologists,pathologists, radiologists, researchers, A Team Approach to Care From right, Michael Pearl, MD, Marlo Dombroff, RPA-C, and Sylvia Macco, RN, discuss care plan with patient. Delivering the best outcomes with compassionate care THE CANCER CARE PROGRAM 5 4A MESSAGE FROM LEADERSHIPPatient Care Support \u0081 The Cancer Care Program continues its focus on Patient and Family Cen-tered Care, a hospital-wide approachwhere the vital role of the family is encouraged to help ensure the healthand well being of all patients\u2014with thegoal of creating partnerships amonghealthcare practitioners, patients, andfamilies to enhance the quality andsafety of healthcare. A key componentof this is the Partners in Care AdvisoryCouncil where members work with thehealthcare team to improve patient andfamily satisfaction; serve as a vital linkbetween the Hospital and community;offer suggestions to Hospital leaders;and serve on committees related to patient care, safety, and satisfaction. \u0081 In efforts to continue to build a culture and commitment to patient safety, Patient Safety Fridays was initiated, inwhich the Hospital's leadership team\u2014including close to 200 people from thelevel of manager on up\u2014joins together every Friday to look at safetyand regulatory issues aimed at makingimprovements. Friday mornings arededicated to education and tracer activity, while the afternoon is devotedto unit- and service-based safety andquality activities. When issues havebeen identified, the team engages in aunited effort to rapidly resolve them. \u0081 Our nurses are committed to compas- sionate and seamless service during allphases of treatment along the cancercare continuum, and beyond. This is particularly evident in PediatricHematology/Oncology, and in pro-grams to support children with cancerand their Programs include\"Children Helping Children,\" It Forward ACTS\" (Athletes, Courage, Teamwork andSupport) that connects local universityand high school athletes with pediatriconcology patients; and the \"School Re-Entry Program\" that helps cancerpatients and their families, classmates,and teachers cope with the challengesof returning to school following cancerdiagnosis and treatment. One shining example of the commitment of our on-cology nurses is Debra Giugliano, RN,CPNP , CPON, Pediatric Debra to all ofthese programs\u2014in fact, she receivedthe top honor of Long Island's \"Nurseof Excellence\" award from the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council. Technology and Treatments A First-Ever Surgery. Surgical oncologist Kevin Watkins, MD, for the first timeanywhere, used irreversible electropora-tion (IRE), a minimally invasive surgicaltechnique also known as the NanoKnife \u00ae to treat pancreatic cancer. IRE uses elec-trical fields to poke holes in the tumors.Benefits include extreme precision, mini-mal damage to healthy tissue, and faster recovery times. While IRE is currentlyapproved for ablation of soft tissue, andis used to treat lung, liver, and kidney tumors as well, Dr. Watkins hopes to establish protocols to demonstrate thetechnique's utility and safety. Minimally Invasive Techniques. The Upper Gastrointestinal and General Oncologic Surgery Group is expandingthe use of minimally invasive surgery forcomplex GI tumors and other diseases.Led by Philip Bao, MD, Surgical Oncol-ogy, the group focuses on treatment andmanagement of malignant and benign tumors of the liver, pancreas, esophagus,and stomach using standard, laparo-scopic, and robotic surgical techniques. Surgical Advances. One of the most re- cent advances in the surgical treatmentof thyroid cancer available to patientstreated at SBUMC is minimally invasivevideo-assisted thyroidectomy, which usessmaller incisions than the traditional thyroidectomy and results in smallerscars and less post-operative pain. Robot-Assisted Surgery Milestones. Stony Brook's surgical oncologists are among the very few nationwide performing robotic pancreatico-duodenectomy, known as the Whippleprocedure, to remove pancreatic tumorsand other types of GI tumors. Last year,they performed the region's first roboticWhipple for treating pancreatic cancer. Education On-Site Medical Training. In conjunction with Stony Brook University, we offerresidencies in 19 medical specialties, and 26 fellowships, including training of nine medical hematology/oncologyfellows and three surgical fellows in thepast year. Continuing Medical Education (CME). Clinicians are offered CME through ourcancer conference case presentation se-ries. In addition, Stony Brook physiciansplay a key role in educating area clini-cians through grand rounds, symposia,conferences, and published papers. Research Leading Scientific Investigation. In con- junction with the clinical programs, theCancer Program conducts basic and clin-ical research into the causes, prevention,treatment, and cure for cancer. As an academic medical center, we have the resources to support and advance inves-tigation and study. The School of Medi-cine and the Department of PreventiveMedicine actively participate in research efforts and provides core support.THE CANCER CARE PROGRAM 7 6A TEAM APPROACH TO CAREtion to the entire breast. Partial breast radiation via 3D conformal radiotherapygiven in a series of 10 treatments overfive days is also provided. This can beused with select patients with left-sidebreast cancer, where minimizing radiationdoses to the heart and lung is critical. Novel Chemotherapy. Oncologists are using standard and novel chemotherapyregimens\u2014as well as new combinationsthat can dramatically improve survivalrates. The program can also connect patients with resistant tumors to phase II experimental agents. Clinical Trials. Stony Brook participates in a range of clinical trials and basic research. The TAILORx Trial (Trial Assigning Individualized Options forTreatment) looks at genetic profiling oftumors to determine which patients needchemotherapy. Basic research projectsaim to gain a greater understanding ofthe biology of the breast and developleading-edge treatments.Breast Cancer Management Team OVERVIEW The only comprehensive academic program of its kind on Long Island, the Breast Care Program treatsover 450 new patients with breast can-cer annually with the most advancedtreatment available. At the Carol M. Bald-win Breast Care Center, located in theCancer Center outpatient facility, breastimaging specialists perform over 8,000mammograms and 2,000 sonograms ayear. The program makes available ahighly specialized genetic counselor forwomen who may have inheritable breastcancer. Women also have access to acomprehensive lymphedema evaluationand treatment program. The Breast Care Center has been a pio- neer in many ways, including being thefirst on Long Island to offer digital mam-mography and being one of only sevencenters in the world equipped with a to-mosynthesis machine. This experimentaltechnology, which produces 3D mammo-gram images ideal for women with densebreasts, is still in the testing stage. StonyBrook's breast cancer surgeons special-ize in breast conservation surgery andwere the first on Long Island to offer the less invasive sentinel node biopsy. Highlights Groundbreaking Certification. The Breast Care Center was the first in NewYork State to earn full accreditation bythe National Accreditation Program forBreast Centers. During the review, theCenter met or exceeded all 27 standards. Leading-Edge Radiation Treatments. Stony Brook's breast surgeons and radiation oncologists are using the newMammoSite \u00aeradiation system. This involves temporary implantation of a de-vice into the lumpectomy cavity, whichcan then assist in delivering full lumpec-tomy radiation in five days instead of thetraditional six weeks of external radia-Members of the Breast Care Team with Program Director Brian J.

For advanced abdominal cancers,the group offers new modalities such as heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy(HIPEC) for carcinomatosis. Palliative Care. If the disease cannot be eradicated, the team strives to palliatethe patient's symptoms and improve thequality of life. The team tracks the qual-ity of life of cancer survivors to updatethe approach used. The team works withthe Medical Center's Survivorship andSupportive Care Program.Gastrointestinal, Upper, and General Oncology Management Team Team Members Surgery: Kevin Watkins, MD, Team Leader, Chief of Upper Gastrointestinal and General Oncologic Surgery; Philip Bao, MD; MD O. Mankes, MD; Carl Tack, MD Radiation Roger Keresztes, The Upper Gastrointestinal General Oncologic ManagementTeam focuses on the diagnosis and man-agement of cancers or potential cancersof the esophagus, stomach, pancreas,bile ducts, small intestine, and liver. Thegroup is dedicated to completing mini-mally invasive surgery for complex gas-trointestinal (GI) tumors. Team leaderKevin Watkins, MD, brings years of experi-ence in surgical oncology to the teamwith a focus on management of liver, biliary, pancreatic, gastrointestinal, andesophageal lesions. The multidisciplinaryteam involves physicians who provide direct diagnostic and therapeutic care,surgery nurse specialists, and ancillarysupport staff who ensure that patientsachieve the maximum benefit from their therapies. Highlights Diagnostics. The team strives to provide state-of-the-art diagnostics and works tobuild programs for the early recognitionof tumors and other abnormal conditionsof the upper gastrointestinal tract. Staging. A critical step in the management of upper GI cancers is accurate staging, which allows the teamto distinguish patients with operable andinoperable disease. This may be done via endoscopic ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT) scan,and positron emission tomography(PET) scanning. Surgery. Surgery is the mainstay of therapy and is curative in 25 percent to40 percent of highly select patients whodevelop resectable metastases in theliver and lung. Improved surgical techniques are utilized by Stony Brook'sexperienced surgical specialists. Minimally Invasive Techniques.

With Dr. Margaret McNurlan in the Department of Surgery, researchers areinvestigating the role of inflammation inthe metabolic dysfunction associatedwith obesity and, particularly, in the development of endometrial cancer. In 2009, nearly 100 patients were enrolled in intramural studies. Education. The Division of Gynecologic Oncology provides didactic and clinicaleducation for medical students, residentphysicians, nurses, and physician assistant students in the Hospital and ambulatory settings. By participating in local, regional, national, and international GrandRounds, the members of the Divisionprovide continuing medical education(CME) for physicians in many special-ties. They also provide valuable informa-tion to the community on prevention, diagnosis, and management of gynecologic cancers through a range of support groups and lecture series.2009, Dr. Pearl performed 292 surgical procedures\u2014196 major and 96 minor. In preparation for surgery, patients andfamilies receive a packet of educationalmaterials. A library of books and videotapes is also available. Chemotherapy. The Division of Gynecologic Oncology has extensive experience administering intravenous,oral, and intraperitoneal chemotherapy.In 2009, the Division administered 277 chemotherapy cycles. The multidis-ciplinary team includes physicians, aclinical pharmacist, a physician assistant,and chemotherapy-certified nurses. Radiation. The Gynecologic Oncology Management Team works closely withthe Department of Radiation Oncologyto develop treatment plans and placebrachytherapy devices. Research. The members of the Division conduct clinical and basic science re-search. Dr. Pearl is the principal investi-gator for the Gynecologic OncologyGroup, a national research organizationfunded by the National Institutes ofHealth to provide patients with access tocutting-edge therapy. At any given time,approximately 25 chemotherapy trialsare available for women with a variety ofgynecologic cancers. In 2009, 54 patientswere enrolled in Gynecologic OncologyGroup protocols. OVERVIEW The Gynecologic Oncology Management Team treats cancers of theovary, uterus (endometrium), cervix, vulva,and vagina, as well as in the peritoneumand fallopian tube. Together, these cancers account for 13.3 percent of thenew cancers afflicting women annually inthe United States. Although substantialstrides have been achieved, gynecologiccancers still account for 10 percent ofcancer deaths annually in women. The Division of Gynecologic Oncology, directed by Michael L. Pearl, MD, FACOG,FACS, is the only academic subspecialtygynecology oncology practice in SuffolkCounty. Board certified in obstetrics andgynecology and in gynecologic oncology,Dr. Pearl is a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-gists and the American College of Surgeons, as well as a member of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists. The Division members have three overlapping goals: to provide comprehensive, multidisciplinary care for women with known or suspected gynecologic cancers, as well as for thosewith complicated gynecologic surgical and selected pre-invasive conditions; toconduct research into the developmentand treatment of these cancers; and to educate healthcare professionals and thepublic about gynecologic cancers and pre-cancerous conditions. In 2009, there were 2,441 office visits and 420 new patients. Because the Divi-sion is directly involved with all aspectsof patient care, long-term relationshipswith patients may be established, providing superb continuity of care. Highlights Surgery.

Thyroid cancers are highly curable withappropriate staging and treatment. Forprimary head and neck cancers, the twomajor goals are controlling the diseaseand maintaining a good quality of life. Highlights Treatment Options. Patient treatment plans for thyroid cancer can include advanced radiation therapy modalitiesusing external beam, radioiodine, andThyrogen \u00ae. For early stage head and neck cancer, the teams may utilize singlemodality treatment, for example surgery,endoscopic laser, or radiation. Thesehave the benefit of shorter hospital stays and good functional outcomes.Later Stage III and some Stage IV cancers are typically treated withchemotherapy and radiation. Surgical Advances. One of the most recent advances in the surgical treatment of thyroid cancer available to our patients is minimally invasivevideo-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT),which uses much smaller incisions thanthe traditional thyroidectomy and results in smaller scars and less post-operative pain.

The modalitiesthat are used include the most current diagnostic testing, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation, new drug development in clinical trials, and stemcell transplantation. Stony Brook's Bloodand Marrow Stem Cell Transplant Pro-gram is the only program in SuffolkCounty that is specifically designed forpatients receiving stem cell transplanta-tion, both autologous and allogeneic. Team members involved in the transplant process meet weekly to discuss each patient's treatment plan, as well as the medical and psychosocial issues involved. They work closely together toensure that each patient's needs are met and that the complex transplant procedure is carried out seamlessly. Oncology-certified nurses coordinate theLeukemia/Lymphoma Bone MarrowTransplant Services and serve as pointpersons to provide support for the patientand family during the entire process. Highlights New Faculty. Michael W. Schuster, MD, the former Director of Bone Marrow andBlood Stem Cell Transplantation at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, was recruitedas the new Director of Bone Marrow andStem Cell Transplantation and Director ofHematologic Malignancies. Dr. Schusterhas been principal investigator for morethan 150 clinical trials and has worked extensively in the areas of stem cell transplantation, oncology new drug development, and the treatment of cancercachexia. With the recruitment of Dr. Schuster and his team, Stony Brook hasmade a major commitment to the BoneMarrow and Stem Cell Transplantationprogram, which includes building a newwing for the program that will greatly expand capacity.

To ensure continuity of care, theteam created a patient network databasewith information on visits and dates ofskin examinations and screenings, avail-able to the Melanoma Management Team.Community Screenings and Outreach. The team held its fifth annual skin screening at the Cancer Center in 2009.Other outreach initiatives by the team of physicians and nurses included highschool health education classes and participation in the Medical Center'sKids Health and Safety Expo. New Clinic. Adam Korzenko, MD, Department of Dermatology, developeda skin cancer clinic at the Cancer Center to expand treatment of patientswith skin cancer. It is coordinated withthe melanoma clinic led by ColettePameijer, MD, of the Department of Surgical Oncology.Melanoma Management Team Team Members Surgical Oncology: Colette Pameijer, MD, Team Leader; Barbara Smith, NP; Claire Smith, RN, Nurse Navigator; Patricia Pugliani, PhD, Research Manager Dermatology: Evan Jones, MD, Chair, Department of Dermatology; Peter Klein, MD; Adam Korzenko, MD; Deborah Deierlein, NP Pathology: Frederick Miller, MD Radiology: Elaine Gould, MD Radiation Oncology: Edward Valentine, MD Medical Hematology/Oncology: Andrzej Kudelka, MDOVERVIEW The Melanoma Management Team is dedicated to the comprehensive management of patients with the deadliest form of skin cancer, melanoma. This includes education, community awareness,screening, and access to clinical trials.Most patients are first evaluated throughthe Department of Dermatology. In 2009there were more than 13,000 outpatientvisits. Some patients with earlymelanoma can be managed exclusivelythrough the Department of Dermatology.Those needing lymph-node sampling or skin grafting are evaluated by the Department of Surgical Oncology. Morethan 90 percent of patients withmelanoma are treated with surgeryalone. Patients with advanced or recurrent disease have their cases reviewed at the Tumor Board meeting to establish optimum treatment. All patients are entered into a melanomadatabase, which tracks patient popula-tion and outcomes. The average annual incidence of melanoma in Suffolk Countyis 158 cases per year, which makesStony Brook the major melanoma treatment center on Long Island. Highlights Clinical Trials. The team strives to have clinical trials available to all patients.Some are national (e.g., the Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group), and othersare Stony Brook's own. Currently, StonyBrook has high accrual rates into its psychosocial and tumor profiling studies. Advanced Treatment. Stony Brook offers isolated limb infusion for recurrentmelanoma that is limited to an extremity.In this procedure, the arm or leg withthe recurrent melanoma is isolated from the rest of the body by a tight Nurse Navigator Claire Smith, RN, (left) with Edward Valentine, MD, and Colette Pameijer, MD THE CANCER CARE PROGRAM 15 14 A TEAM APPROACH TO CAREMalignant Melanoma of the Skin Site Survey Malignant melanoma of the skin is a serious form of skin cancer. The incidence rates of melanoma have been increasing, with incidence among young white women aged15 to 39 increasing at a rate of 3% per year since 1992, andincidence among white adults ages 65 years and older in-creasing at a rate of 5.1% for men and 4.1% for women, over the past thirty years according to the American CancerSociety. Estimated new cases in 2010 for melanoma of theskin is 68,130, and estimated deaths occurring frommelanoma in 2010 is 8,700. Changes in social habits, suchas sun tanning, and changes in the earth's ozone layer maycontribute to this increased incidence. Public awareness of the importance of sun and ultraviolet light protection is increasing through outreach and educationefforts. Improvements in methods for detection and diagnosisand in the treatment of melanoma of the skin are ongoing. Inthe U.S. the incidence rate of melanoma among Caucasiansis ten times higher than among African Americans, andhigher among men than women, 60% vs. 40%, respectively.The patient population at Stony Brook University MedicalCenter parallels national data. The age at diagnosis rangeswidely, from teens to the ninth decade, with a peak in thesixth decade regionally and nationwide. The majority of peo-ple diagnosed with melanoma have early-stage disease. The treatment for most patients with melanoma is surgery. A sentinel lymph node biopsy may be recommended in patientswith localized early-stage melanoma who have certain highrisk features in their melanoma. For patients with more advanced stage melanoma, systemic treatment protocols are considered. Radiation therapy may be offered for treatment of advanced stage IV disease; clinical trials areavailable at SBUMC as well. The Melanoma Disease Management Team has adopted measures for its Cancer Quality Dashboard based on nationally accepted standards of care. Report cards provide transparent performance metrics to administrativeleadership and identify opportunities for actions to improvepatient care. In 2009, the team tracked performance of melanoma surgical margins of excision compliance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, anddocumented findings in the operative report in the patientrecord. The findings demonstrated 100% compliance. Survival rates for patients with in situ and Stage I at diagno- sis is favorable in the 90% range, with survival declining foradvanced stage disease. The overall survival calculated atSBUMC and according to the NCDB nationwide and the NYgeographic region for all stages is in the 80% range.Malignant Melanoma: New Cases New cases by yea r at SBUMC f rom 2000 to Cases 180% 160%140%120%100% 80%60% 40% 20% 0% 2000 2001 2002 2003 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Malignant Melanoma: Race/Ethnicity Stony Brook U niversity Medical Ce cases vs. Natio nal Ca ncer Data Base (NCDB), USA = 294,289, a nd 15,760 diagnosed i n 2000-2007 90%80%70%60%50%40%30%20%10% Ce nter (SBUMC) = 608 cases vs. Natio nal Ca ncer Data Base (NCDB), USA = 294,289 nosed (2000-2007) 35%30%25%20%15%10% 5%0% Stage 0 in si tu S tage 1 S tage 2 S tage 3 S tage UnknownSBUMC NCNB NYMalignant Ce nter (SBUMC) = 610 cases vs. Natio nal Ca ncer Data Base (NCDB), USA = 294,289 Metric 2009 Performance at SBUMC is measured for quality and accountability.

Research. Ongoing laboratory research includes investigating the mechanism oftumorigenesis for neuroblastomas andbrain tumors; studying the late effects of cancer therapy, focusing on the development of bone mineral loss duringtherapy (this study encompasses one of the largest groups of such childrentreated for childhood cancer); and studying children with bone marrow failure diseases such as Fanconi anemia. Support Services. The team support serv- ices, including the parent support group,Our Little Heroes, and specialized siblingand bereavement programs, are open toall Suffolk County families, regardless ofwhere they receive treatment.Pediatric Oncology Management Team OVERVIEW Stony Brook's Pediatric Oncology Management Team has been atthe forefront of using a multidisciplinaryapproach to treat cancer. With the highest patient satisfaction scores at theMedical Center, it has become a modelfor other departments, who have seen increases in their scores after adoptingthe care paradigm. Since the PediatricOncology Program began in 1991, theteam has treated more than 500 childrenwith malignant tumors. In 2009, theteam had 2,000 inpatient visits and3,600 outpatient visits. In addition, approximately 50 percent of the childrenin Suffolk County with childhood tumorswere treated at Stony Brook; two-thirdsof these patients were enrolled in clinical trials and other investigational therapies.Stony Brook's rate of clinical trial participation is equal to or greater thannational statistics, and its disease-specific cure rates remain at or abovethe national benchmarks for major child-hood cancers such as acute leukemia,brain tumors, lymphoma, neuroblastoma,Wilms tumors of the kidney, and boneand soft tissue sarcomas. Highlights Program Expansion. This past year, a multidisciplinary team of physicians andnurses, under the leadership of M. YasarCeliker, MD, was established to overseethe often complex treatment of childrenwith brain tumors. This Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Team includes representativesfrom pediatric oncology, neurosurgery,radiation oncology, and nursing.

This includes initial diagnosis, staging, treatment, and follow-up care.When patients are referred to the team,their cases are discussed at a multidisci-plinary conference and a treatment planis developed in accordance with NCCN OVERVIEW Soft tissue tumors encompass a wide variety of tumors thatarise most commonly from fat, muscle,or connective tissue anywhere in thebody. They are uncommon, and accountfor only 1.5 percent of cancer cases inthe U.S. each year, which translates intoapproximately 8,600 cases annually. Sarcomas arise most commonly in theextremities, with 15 percent arising in the retroperitoneum.

The Cytogenetics Laboratory is certified by the Children'sOncology Group for the analysis of chromosomal abnormalities in childhoodleukemia. Through this lab, state-of-the-art molecular genetic and chromosomalstudies are available to Stony Brookphysicians to assist in disease diagnosisand the identification of appropriatetreatments. Quality of Life Initiatives. The comfort and quality of life of Stony Brook's pa-tients remain priorities in the provisionof care. Consequently, we dedicate resources to maximize the on-therapyand off-therapy quality of life for our patients. These include: \u0081 Camp Adventure, a sleep-over camp, sponsored by the American Cancer Society, is for children with cancer andtheir siblings. Typically, 30 to 40 percent of all children who attend this camp annually come from StonyBrook; last year, Stony Brook sent 47 of the 152 campers (21 patients and 26\u0081 PlayFit-StayFit, developed by faculty of the Stony Brook University School ofAllied Health Technology and manage-ment school of Physical Therapy,helps children regain physical abilitiesupon completion of cancer therapy.The goal is to for children to reclaimtheir pre-cancer level of physical abil-ity and activity and to then maintain ahealthy, active lifestyle as an adult. \u0081 The Late Effects/Long-Term Follow-Up Program is being developed to meetthe ongoing needs and monitor thehealth status of children who have com-pleted cancer therapy as they move intoand through their adult years. It is wellrecognized that survivors of childhoodcancer encounter difficulties of bothmedical and social nature. Under the direction of Laura Hogan, MD, the pro-gram is being designed to recognizethose needs early and intervene to minimize their impact on adult life. Itwill employ national standards for fol-low-up of childhood cancer survivors.siblings). Stony Brook's involvement in this program runs deep. Several of thecamp counselors are \"graduates\" of theStony Brook program. Staff membersare regular volunteers at the camp, in-cluding both RNs and NPs who serveas medical support to ensure that allchildren continue to receive their med-ications during camp week. Dr. RobertParker is the consulting oncologist forthe camp and a regular on-site volun-teer. In addition, Stony Brook Univer-sity Medical Center is the facility identi-fied for patient transport in the case ofa serious illness or the need for moreintensive diagnostic tests. \u0081 The Sunrise Day Camp, sponsored and actively supported by the PediatricHema tology/Oncology program, is dedicated to children with cancer andchronic blood disorders. Staff from StonyBrook work with the day camp to facili-tate patients' participation in camp andongoing treatment during camp times. radiation, and placement of chemothera- peutic agents into the bladder. Some patients may be candidates for creationof a new continent bladder made fromthe intestine that allows full restitution ofurinary function. Robot-assisted surgerymay also be an option for appropriatecandidates who require removal of thebladder (cystectomy). During diagnosticcystoscopic surgeries, the team usesleading-edge optical coherence tomogra-phy (OCT) technology to help diagnoseand stage bladder cancers earlier. New Approaches to Kidney Cancer. For adult kidney cancer treatment, the teamprovides open and laparoscopic radicalnephrectomy and partial nephrectomy.Patients with advanced disease can receive immunotherapy with cytokines,such as interleukin-2, and other agents.In addition, new oral agents such as sunitinib and sorafenib that target vascular endothelial growth factor receptors are available to patients with advanced disease. Patients with kidney insufficiency may have \"nephronsparing\" surgery (partial kidney removal) to preserve kidney function. Clinical Trials. The Urologic Oncology Management Team participates in anumber of clinical trials and basic research including investigating novelagents such as alefacept, optimizingtreatment with new agents currently being used in clinical practice, identifying cancer markers in the urothelium, and investigating the role of environmental toxins, specificallydiesel fuels, in bladder cancer. \u0081 Victor Romanov, PhD, and visiting scientist Galina F .

This study is supported bya research award. \u0081 Dr. Romanov and Terry Whyard, MS, Research Associate, have studied therole of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)in bone and lymph node metastasisand are investigating the role of PSA in metastatic cell motility, invasion, andproliferation, as well as the regulationof PSA secretion and activity by bonecomponents. \u0081 Wayne and Dr. Romanov are co-investigators in aristolochic acidnephropathy (AAN) and its associatedurothelial cell cancer, supported by a program project grant from the Urologic Oncology Management Team Team Members Surgery: Wayne Waltzer, MD, Team Leader and Chair, Urology; Howard L. Adler, MD, Director, Prostate Care Program; Rahuldev S. Bhalla, MD, Director, Roboticsand Radiology: Shenhong Wu, MD, PhDOVERVIEW The Urologic Oncology Management Team provides comprehen-sive care for all genitourinary malignan-cies, including cancers of the prostate,urinary bladder, adult kidney, and testis.Care ranges from screening at-risk indi-viduals to treating those with advanceddisease and providing access to clinicaltrials for patients with malignant tumors. In 2009, Stony Brook's Department of Urology was again ranked among the top 50 in the nation by U.S.News & World Report (August 5, 2009). In 2007, the Hospital became the first in SuffolkCounty to acquire the da Vinci \u00aeS HD Surgical System, the most technically advanced robot system available.Rahuldev S. Bhalla, MD, a nationally recognized robotic surgeon, has developed the robotics program in urology and has performed more than400 robot-assisted surgeries to date. He continues to investigate new techniques and instrumentation. Community education also is an impor- tant focus of the team. In 2009, the outreach team provided approximately1,300 men free prostate screeningsacross Long Island, with a special focuson the high-risk groups in the AfricanAmerican and Hispanic communities. Highlights Prostate Cancer Management Options. As a leader in the management ofprostate cancer, Stony Brook offers robot-assisted, open, or laparoscopic surgery; radiation therapy with externalbeam and/or radiation seed implants;cryotherapy; hormonal therapy; and investigational therapies. Leading-Edge Treatment for Bladder Cancer. Bladder cancer treatments include local surgical resection, bladderpreservation using chemotherapy andTHE CANCER CARE PROGRAM 21 20 A TEAM APPROACH TO CARENational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). Target tissues for aristolochic acid (AA) arethe renal urothelium of theupper urinary tract (renal andureter). In humans, the effects of thisnephrotoxin, when ingested orally, are manifested in so-called Balkan endemic nephropathy. Ureters are being used by Dr. Romanov to isolateand culture primary urothelial cells. Functional genomics (microarray andmicro RNA) studies on these culturedcells are then performed followingtreatment of these cultures with AA.These studies have been reported atnational and international meetings. Dr. Romanov also is involved in NIEHSPPG research designed to identifygenes responsible for susceptibility toAAN. He and Tom Rosenquist, PhD,Department of Pharmacology, have developed a mouse model of AAN that mimics all aspects of the humandisease. Using inbred strains of mice,they have identified quantitative traitloci conferring sensitivity to the toxin. This advance has enabled thedemarcation of human genes responsible for AAN. \u0081 Shenhong Wu, MD, PhD, is currently investigating the optimal and safe useof new agents, including bevacizumab,sorafenib, and sunitinib in kidney can-cer, prostate cancer, and other cancers. Dr. Wu's studies have been published in national journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Association(JAMA), Lancet Oncology , and the Journal of the American Society ofNephrology and reported at major medical conferences.Kidney and Renal Pelvis Cancer Site Survey Kidney cancer develops most often in people over 40. Risk factors that increase a person's chance of developing the disease and have been associated by research with the onset of kidney cancer are smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, long-term dialysis, gender, Von Hippel-Landausyndrome, and occupations related to workplace exposure to certain chemicals. Most people with these risk factors do not develop kidney cancer, and most people who do develop the disease have no risk factors.Concerns about risk should be discussed with the person's physician with appropriate surveillance scheduled. Cancer that forms in the tissues of the kidneys in adults includes renal cell carcinoma that forms in the lining of the tubules in the kidney that filter theblood and remove waste products, and renal pelvis carcinoma that forms inthe center of the kidney where urine collects. In children, kidney cancer includes Wilms' tumor, which usually develops in young children. Treatment includes surgery and may also include chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

A site survey of these patients first encountered atSBUMC in 2000-2007 demonstrated a higher onset in thefourth and fifth decade than the national average of the sixthto the seventh decade, indicating that SBUMC clinicians areseeing patients diagnosed at a younger age than the nationalaverage. There is a higher incidence among males comparedto females both at SBUMC and nationally. More than 50% ofpatients with kidney and renal pelvis cancer are diagnosedwith localized tumors. Tumor spread to each of the otherstages/categories of regional tissue, regional lymph nodes, or distant metastatic sites occurs in 12% to 18% of patients.The primary treatment is most often surgery. Chemotherapyand immunotherapy may have a role in the treatment of individual kidney cancer patients and this is determined byconsultation with oncology specialists who evaluate each indi-vidual patient in the light of available standard or emergingtherapies. Patient outcomes at SBUMC are relatively in linewith national statistics. Factors that affect five-year survivalinclude the stage of the disease at diagnosis, treatmentmodalities utilized, and the patient's other medical conditionsas determined at the time of initial diagnosis and evaluation.

The Upper Gastrointestinal and General OncologicSurgery Group performed a pancreaticprocedure using a new minimally inva-sive surgical technique called irreversibleelectroporation (IRE) that selectivelykills tumor cells. This is the first use any-where of IRE tumor ablation to treat pan-creatic cancer, a typically fast-growing andfatal cancer. From a local disease stand-point, the IRE \"cellular surgery\" met allexpectations. Plans to develop nationaltrials are being made to demonstrate theeffectiveness of IRE in pancreatic cancer. Robot-assisted surgery milestones. Our surgical oncologists are among fewnationwide performing robotic pancre-atico-duodenectomy\u2014the \"Whipple pro-cedure\"\u2014to remove pancreatic tumorsand other types of GI tumors. Last year,they performed the region's first roboticWhipple for treating pancreatic cancer.This invasive procedure offers postoperative pain, less scarring,fewer complications post-surgery, andearlier discharge. It may also help pa-tients heal quicker, which may be crucialif undergoing additional treatment. Laparoscopic-assisted resection. The Department's colorectal surgeons in a prospectiverandomized trial comparing laparoscopic-assisted resection versus open resectionfor rectal cancer. They also published astudy evaluating the responsiveness ofsurgery residents to of disposable abdominal trays in ahybrid simulator to perform a seven-step standardized technique. Results showeda significant decrease in operating timeand anastomotic leak rate. The trainingis now integrated into Stony Brook's surgical residency program. Expanded high-risk screening program. Breast surgeons at the Carol M. BaldwinBreast Care Center expanded surveil-lance care for women at increased risk ofdeveloping breast cancer. This compre-hensive screening program offers expertgenetic counseling and screenings withthe most sophisticated technologies. Reconstructive surgery advances. The program in breast reconstructive surgeryprovides the most sophisticated care. The Department has been reorganizedwith the appointment of a new directorcommitted to using the latest surgical advances and conducting leading-edge research. The Carol M. Baldwin Founda-tion for Breast Cancer Research awardedthe Department a grant to evaluate mini-mally invasive imaging techniques thatmeasure blood flow in skin during recon-structive breast surgery following mastectomy. Knowledge gained will helpminimize complications with breast re-construction, enabling more patients to becandidates for immediate reconstruction. Novel approaches. Colorectal surgeons have performed a number of TAMIS(transanal minimally invasive surgery)procedures, which facilitate the resectionof large rectal tumors in select patientswho would otherwise require a radical operation. Surgeons in the Division ofOtolaryngology now offer patients expertise in endoscopic, minimally invasive skull base surgery and pediatrichead and neck surgery.Program Leader: Todd K. Rosengart, MD, Chair, Department of Surgery OVERVIEW Surgeons in the Depart- ment of Surgery offer the highest degreeof specialization and expertise. Recogniz-ing the relationship between volumesand outcomes, each surgeon focuses ona specific area of cancer, which has ledto a department composed of highly spe-cialized subspecialists. Surgeons workclosely with Medical Hematology and On-cology and Radiation Oncology to providemultimodality approaches to cancer\u2014often collaborating to design and imple-ment new protocols for treatment. Implementation The Department has been at the forefrontof using minimally invasive surgical tech-niques, including laparoscopy and robot-assisted surgery. It also has expertise inadvanced diagnostic techniques, such assentinel node biopsy for staging breastcancer and malignant melanoma. Sur-geons serve as members and leaders ofthe Disease Management Teams and Tumor Board conferences. They are partners in over 50 protocols approved bythe Medical Center's Institutional ReviewBoard, including the American College ofSurgeons Oncology Group, National Sur-gical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project,Cancer and Leukemia Group B, and National Institutes of Health-funded re-search on consent for tumor bank tissues.Surgeons are the primary collaboratorswith pathologists in Stony Brook's TumorTissue Bank, a valuable resource that willhelp facilitate future cancer biomarkerdiscovery, increase diagnostic accuracy,improve the ability to predict clinical out-comes, and develop treatments that canbe tailored for individual patients.Essential to the Team SurgeryAdvancing the Standard of Care Through Specialization, Leading-Edge Techniques, and State-of-the-Art Technology offers services for autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantationfor leukemia, lymphoma, and multiplemyeloma. Research initiatives. Clinical trials are open for every major cancer site and include treatment for prostate, breast,and colon cancers; glioblastoma multi-forma; and aggressive malignant astrocy-tomas. Research includes developmentof a system for detecting new cancer cellmarkers and for isolating cancer cellscirculating in the blood.

This year, one of the linear accelerators was upgraded withthe RapidArc \u00aedelivery system with on board imaging capability (OBI). RapidArcradiotherapy technology is a major advance that improves radiation doseconformity while significantly shorteningtreatment times. RapidArc delivers treatments two to eight times faster than conventionally delivered dynamictreatments today and with increased precision\u2014a winning combination thatenables physicians to improve the stan-dard of care and treat more patients. The OBI upgrade from Varian Medical Systems offers Image Guided RadiationTherapy, which allows clinicians to useadvanced imaging techniques to verifypatient position and tumor position at thetime of treatment. Knowing the exact location of the tumor allows clinicians toreduce the volume of tissue irradiated,targeting only the tumor and sparing thesurrounding normal tissue. Irradiating less normal tissue reduces the toxicity of radiotherapy which, in turn, improvesthe patient's quality of life. In somecases, improved targeting may make itpossible to deliver higher radiationdoses to the tumor and thereby increasethe likelihood of local tumor control. Residency and training programs. The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Radiology, has a two-yearresidency program in medical physics.Residency training is now a requirementfor licensing as a medical physicist. With Stony Brook University's School of Health Technology and Management,the Department also trains medicaldosimetrists, qualifying them for certification. Research initiatives. Research focuses include cooperative group clinical trials(the Department is in the RTOG), development of software and hardwareto advance radiation treatment techniques, and, in conjunction withBrookhaven National Laboratory, investigating clinical applications ofheavy ion radiation beams.Program Leader: Allen G.

Onesuch beneficiary of ACS funding wasStony Brook's Kenneth Kaushansky, MD,Senior Vice President, Health Sciences,and Dean, School of Medicine, who was supported at the beginning of his career with a $90,500 Junior Faculty Research Award. For more than 25 years, the American Cancer Society has been a strong part-ner of SUNY Stony Brook in the areas ofpatient services, support, and research.Since the early 1980s, the American Cancer Society has funded 93 grants totaling $13,670,416 to researchers atSUNY Stony Brook. The ACS is currently funding three grants at Stony Brook totaling $1,875,000.Grant Highlights Symposia Cancer Center Symposium The Cancer Center, along with the Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, held its second symposium April 27, 2010, titled, \"Cancer Stem Cells, Differentiation and Metastasis.\" Organized by Michael Hayman, PhD, and Howard Crawford,PhD, the symposium was attended byapproximately 200 area physicians andscientists. The event featured interna- tionally renowned experts in cancer and cell biology. As a result of the event's success, future cancer researchsymposia are planned.Dorothy Lane, MD, (center) and residents La-Shaun Elliott (left) and AbrahamThengampallil THE CANCER CARE PROGRAM 35 34 BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCHExamples of Published Research The Stony Brook Tissue BankInvestigators in the Department of Urology, in collaboration with the Department of Medicine, have publishedresearch that has expanded the currentknowledge base for prostate cancermetastasis and may eventually lead to the development of new treatments for trialsin humans. Other investigators in the De-partment, working with the Departmentof Surgery, have published research thatdemonstrates the utility of urine telomerase activity as a screening tool for prostate cancer, with future studiesplanned to investigate the potential bene-fit of this as a first-line screening test. Established in 2004 in the Department of Pathology by the Medical Center and the School of Medicine, this facilitybanks normal, abnormal, and malignanttissue specimens and serums to supportthe discovery of molecular diagnostics and markers of disease progression. The laboratory is directed by surgicalpathologist, Youjun Hu, MD, and as-sisted by experienced researcher GayleLark. Dr. Hu works closely with cancer surgeons to obtain tissue specimens under informed patient consent. The Cancer Clinical Trials Office Program Leaders: Robert I. Parker, MD, Medical Director for Clinical Trials; PatriciaHentschel, NP , Administrative Director for Clinical Trials; Research Patricia DelliBovi, RN, Kim Lyktey, RN, and Carol Martin,RN; Administrative Assistant Lydia Reveron The overarching goal of the Stony Brook University Cancer Center Clinical TrialsProgram is to provide patients with themost innovative treatments for cancer.Clinical trials offer patients access to themost promising treatments for manytypes of cancers, and patients in clinicaltrials are among the first to receive newtreatments before they are commonlyavailable. Patient participation in clinicaltrials is vital to advancing treatments for specific cancers, as this is the onlymechanism by which the effectiveness of new treatments and new drugs can be determined. In fact, all of the most effective standard cancer treatmentshave come about because of their initialtesting in clinical trials. Because it is widely recognized that patients who participate in clinical trialsexperience outcomes that are at least asgood, and generally better, as those for patients who are not enrolled in trials,Stony Brook patients (who qualify) aregiven the opportunity to participate inthe Clinical Trials Program. All clinicaltrials conducted at the Stony Brook University Cancer Center are managedby experienced physicians who carry outthese treatment trials on patients with regard to maximum safety and comfort. The Cancer Clinical Trials Office assists Stony Brook University CancerCenter investigators in developing andcompleting scientifically valid clinical trials in an organized, cost-effective, andmethodologically sound manner. Majorareas of responsibility include protocolactivation and coordination, liaison withregulatory agencies (including the Institutional Research Review Board,NIH, FDA and pharmaceutical companies), treatment safety monitoring, data management, and the provision of research nursing support. The physician-investigators of the Stony Brook University Cancer Center are involved in a number of interdisciplinary,multicenter, clinical trials groups including the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), the Children'sOncology Group (COG), the AmericanCollege of Surgeons Oncology Group(ACSOG), the National Surgical Adju-vant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP),Cancer and Leukemia Group B(CALBG), the Gynecologic OncologyGroup (GOG), and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). The Cancer Center Clinical Trials Officeplays a critical role in these activities. In addition, the office coordinates physician-initiated in-house therapeutictrials and phase I, II, and III pharmaceu-tical-sponsored research trials. Patientsreceive information about availability of cancer-related clinical trials throughformal mechanisms that includebrochures and pamphlets, Web sites, patient information packets, the patientlibrary, patient support group seminarson clinical trials, research coordinator,and the Nurse Navigators. Quality and Standards Working to Meet and Exceed Nationwide Quality Standards Implementation Qualified researchers, administrators, and clinicians utilize de-identified cancer registry statistics for research,education, grant writing, administrativeplanning, cancer quality dashboards, andclinical outcomes measurements. participation in Web site andthe Commission on Cancer's NationalCancer Data Base annual call for data, aswell as other special studies, contributesto the national database to foster research and analysis for advances in health management. The registry participates in providing data on nationalquality metrics for adjuvant breast andcolorectal cancer. For collected data to meet specific quality standards, continuous quality assessments are performed via electronically programmed coding edits,by physician advisor review, and by NewYork State Central Cancer Registry andNational Cancer Data Base electronicedit programs for data quality. Physicianadvisors review 10 percent of analyticcases in the database for accuracy incoding collaborative staging and treatment. The staff participates in theappropriate continuing education andprofessional association activities. StonyBrook also hosts conferences and workshops, most recently the Long Island Cancer Registrars AssociationSpring Education Seminar in June 2010. Stony Brook University Medical Center's annual cancer incidence tables and sitespecific surveys are posted on its Website at StonyBrookMedicalCenter.org/ Whitehead,CTR, Abstractors OVERVIEW The Cancer Registry electronically stores case records on alltypes of tumors entered into a database.Case ascertainment includes search andanalysis of all inpatient, same-day-stay,and emergency room admissions, as wellas all ambulatory and clinic encountersand physician practice visits for cancercare. The database contains 46,820 tu-mor records. Epidemiologic data and an-nual follow-up are maintained on 34,577analytic cases in the active database, ref-erenced as of January 1, 1993, for follow-up and outcome analysis. Data is main-tained in accordance with national stan-dards. Security procedures are in placefor confidentiality and disaster recovery. Since its inception in 1984, Cancer Reg-istry has played an integral part in the interdisciplinary cancer care teams bycollecting relevant information, providingstatistical summaries, and disseminatinginformation about cancer program stan-dards to clinical, research, administra-tive, and education faculty. Staff providesinput at cancer conferences and commit-tee meetings, and work to meet the insti-tution's responsibility for Department of Health-mandated cancer reporting.Cancer Registry New Cancer Patients at Stony Brook University Medical Center 2000-2009 Trends Source: Stony Brook University Medical Center Cancer Registry data base all accessions.Year 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 New Patient %)Audrey Hassett, CTR, Cancer Registry Abstractor THE CANCER CARE PROGRAM 37 36 QUALITY AND STANDARDS2009 Cancer Site Distribution at Stony Brook Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY Patient Type, Gender, and AJCC TNM Stage Group PRIMARY SITE TOTAL PATIENT TYPE GENDER AJCC TNM STAGE GROUP New Re-tx Male Female 0 I II III IV Unk N/A ALL SITES 2863 2103 760 1232 1631 259 815 535 324 393 80 457 ORAL CAVITY 41 29 12 26 15 1 6 9 3 18 4 0 L I P 2 2 0 2 0 1010000T O N G U E 1 8 1 2 6 1 2 6 0322830O R O P H A R Y N X 2 2 0 1 1 0010100H Y P O P H A R Y N X 3 1 2 2 1 0020100OTHER 16 12 4 9 7 0 3 3 1810 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 327 221 106 182 145 9 59 56 61 103 16 23 E S O P H A G U S 2 1 1 1 1 0 1 9 2 0473610STOMACH 34 23 11 24 10 0 6 5 6 6 0 11COLON 73 46 27 31 42 1 18 12 6 30 4 2RECTUM 52 40 12 32 20 1 11 8 20 10 1 1ANUS/ANAL CANAL 5 4 1 0 5 1 0 1 2100 LIVER 39 22 17 31 8 0 8 4 12 8 6 1PANCREAS 61 43 18 26 35 6 6 13 3 28 3 2OTHER 42 32 10 19 23 0 6 6 9 14 1 6 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 369 287 82 197 172 0 112 24 80 130 11 12 NASAL/SINUS 4 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 1102 L A R Y N X 1 3 1 0 3 7 6 0621301LUNG/BRONCHUS 350 275 75 187 163 0 106 22 78 126 10 8OTHER 2 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0011 BLOOD & BONE MARROW 146 70 76 89 57 0 0 0 0 0 0 146 LEUKEMIA 96 50 46 60 36 0 0 0 0 0 0 96MULTIPLE MYELOMA 33 16 17 18 15 0 0 0 0 0 0 33OTHER 17 4 13 11 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 17 B O N E 1 1 0 0 1 0010000 CONNECT/SOFT TISSUE 23 18 5 14 9 0 11 0 7320 SKIN 172 158 14 103 69 48 79 20 16 5 3 1 MELANOMA 167 155 12 102 65 47 77 19 16 5 2 1OTHER 5 3 2 1 4 1 2 1 0010 BREAST 548 450 98 3 545 117 225 113 49 31 13 0FEMALE GENITAL 230 129 101 0 230 59 90 15 30 18 6 12 CERVIX UTERUS 75 29 46 0 75 42 12 7 6710 CORPUS UTERUS 82 66 16 0 82 0 52 2 12 6 3 7O V A R Y 4 3 2 4 1 9 0 4 3 02 041 14 1 3V U L V A 2 5 8 1 7 0 2 5 1 7 421001OTHER 5 2 3 0 5 0 2 0 0111 MALE GENITAL 306 200 106 306 0 0 8 251 14 24 9 0 PROSTATE 290 186 104 290 0 0 0 249 8 24 9 0T E S T I S 1 5 1 3 2 1 5 0 0726000OTHER 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0000 URINARY SYSTEM 158 128 30 108 50 25 80 17 12 18 5 1 BLADDER 62 42 20 47 15 17 17 11 4 10 3 0KIDNEY/RENAL 91 82 9 58 33 4 62 6 8821 OTHER 5 4 1 3 2 4 1 0 0000 BRAIN & CNS 156 123 33 55 101 0 0 0 0 0 0 156 BRAIN (BENIGN) 13 11 2 7 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 13BRAIN (MALIGNANT) 34 27 7 17 17 0 0 0 0 0 0 34OTHER 109 85 24 31 78 0 0 0 0 0 0 109 ENDOCRINE 242 205 37 82 160 0 105 15 39 16 2 65 THYROID 177 158 19 55 122 0 105 15 39 16 2 0OTHER 65 47 18 27 38 0 0 0 0 0 0 65 LYMPHATIC SYSTEM 102 52 50 50 52 0 40 14 13 27 8 0 HODGKIN'S DISEASE 14 6 8 4 10 0 4 6 4000 NON-HODGKIN'S 88 46 42 46 42 0 36 8 9 27 8 0 UNKNOWN PRIMARY 34 26 8 13 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 34OTHER/ILL-DEFINED 8 6 2 4 4 0 0 0 0017 This report includes all patients first encountered in 2009 at SBUMC.OVERVIEW A key component of the Cancer Care Program and integral to patient management at Stony BrookUniversity Medical Center, Tumor Boardmeetings provide a valued forum for theexchange of information, consultation,and collaboration. Cases are presentedfor diagnostic assessment of prognosticindicators, clinical and pathologic staging, consultation, review of treatmentguidelines and clinical research protocols, treatment planning, re-treatment and review of outcomes,and educational purposes during allphases of care. Clinical staging, molecu-lar markers, existing prognostication methods, and nationally recognized patient management guidelines and clinical trials are referenced in treatmentplanning and outcomes assessment. Tumor Board meetings also provide opportunities to participate in researchprotocols and to consider new and emerg-ing standards for patient management. Implementation Multidisciplinary departmental and site-focused Tumor Board meetingsTumor Boards were held each week at Stony Brook University Medical Center in 2009 and2010. Physicians representing diagnosticradiology, pathology, surgery, and medical oncology participated in ongoing facility-wide conferences. Otherparticipants included representativesfrom pulmonary medicine, dentistry,nursing, pain management, social work,pharmacy, nutrition, physical therapy, speech and hearing, cancer registry, and clinical trials research. In addition,faculty, residents, interns, fellows, andstudents in all specialties attend and participate in discussion relevant to clini-cal education. Tumor Board case clinicalpresentation series offers AMA Category1 CME credits to eligible attendees. ment priorities that directly affect patient care. The program fosters a work environ-ment that encourages the creation, as-sessment, and redesign of processes andsystems, with each staff member of theCancer Services team playing a role. Implementation Because cancer program standards demand that patients receive care andoutcomes comparable to nationwidestandards, Stony Brook University Medical Center developed a CancerServices Dashboard and Cancer Services Balanced Scorecard. Using input from the Cancer Committee, the Cancer Leadership Group, the site-focused Disease Management Teams,and other cancer services professionalstaff, data are collected on selected indi-cators and compared to benchmarks.The Medical Center also reviews na-tional guidelines, such as those providedby the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, College of American Pathologists, and Commission on Cancer, and select benchmarks for quality monitoring.
