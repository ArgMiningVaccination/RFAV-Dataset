Don't second-guess yourself \u2014 those busy thoughts that arise in your mind when you're meditating are good things. Everyone goes through this when they meditate. Everyone. You might think that a mind that won't calm down is a lost cause when it comes to meditation, but you're wrong. I wanted to offer some consolation and encouragement for those who get discouraged by their meditation practice, wrongly assuming that it isn't working. If you're struggling to meditate because there are 'too many thoughts' and you are so caught up in them, this is actually a sign that you're on the right track. Your mind needs to move through the thoughts that are lingering at the forefront in order to finally find stillness. This can be a long journey depending on the number of thoughts that need to be processed. The detoxification in your mind may require more time and effort. It can also be affected by your ability to cut through the ego-mind to stillness. We all have a mind with thoughts fluttering around in it. It's human. Don't deny your humanity in search for something beyond. You can't transcend by rejecting basic traits of yourself. You must embrace them. Any meditation practice will include a phase of clearing, and you have to start somewhere. You can't be expected to find enlightenment on the first attempt. Thoughts and Emotions in Meditation are Signs of Detoxification Your mind is full of emotions and thoughts on a daily basis, and not all of them are properly processed at the time they first show up. Some of them get stuffed into a back corner of the mind and aren't fully dealt with. These are likely the thoughts and emotions that come back to haunt you when you are meditating. "}
