Active immunity to a disease can happen in two ways, either by getting the disease or through getting a vaccine that prevents that illness. Adverse event Any health problem that happens after a shot or other vaccine. An adverse event might be truly caused by a vaccine, or it might be pure coincidence and be caused by something else. An adverse event may be mild, moderate, or serious. There are different types of adverse events: - True reactions to the vaccine, such as side effects and allergic reactions. - Side Effect- Any health problem shown by studies to be caused by a vaccine. Like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. Usually vaccine side effects are minor (for example, a sore arm where a shot was given or a low-grade fever after a vaccine) and go away on their own within a few days. - Allergic reaction -A response by the body that occurs in some people when the immune system overreacts to a harmless substance known as an allergen. - Unrelated health problems. These are experiences that would have occurred even if the person had not been vaccinated. They happen after vaccination but are not caused by the vaccine. - Health problems that cannot be related directly to the vaccine. The cause of these events is unknown, and there is not enough evidence to say whether they are caused by a vaccine.

Aerosol transmission (or airborne transmission) The spread of a disease through the air through tiny aerosol particles. COVID-19 aerosol particles get breathed out in a fine mist when an infected person talks or breathes, and they may be breathed in by other people. Allergic reaction A response by the body that occurs in some people when the immune system overreacts to a harmless substance known as an allergen. Allergens may be pollen, certain foods, latex, mold, insect stings, eggs, or certain vaccine ingredients. There may be many symptoms of an allergic reaction ranging from mild to serious, such as itchy eyes or nose, swelling, rash, trouble breathing, or, in some cases, anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis An immediate and severe allergic reaction to a substance, such as food or a vaccine. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include breathing trouble, loss of consciousness and a drop in blood pressure. This condition can be deadly and needs immediate medical attention. Antibiotic A substance that kills or slows the growth of bacteria and is often used to treat infection. Antibiotics will not prevent or treat viruses such as COVID-19. Antibody A protein made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances from outside of the body, such as viruses or bacteria. Antibodies protect the body from disease by attaching to the substance (such as COVID-19 viruses) and destroying them, which stops them from infecting the body's cells. Asymptomatic Not showing any symptoms or signs of disease or illness. Some people without any symptoms can still have and spread COVID-19. Clinical trial A research study in which volunteers receive a new vaccine or other treatments so that scientists can evaluate how well it works. In addition to taking the drugs or treatments being tested, participants may help measure results by reporting on how they feel and by allowing healthcare providers to conduct follow-up exams that might include blood tests or other testing. Clinical trials are carefully designed, reviewed, and completed. The principal investigator is the person in charge of the trial. He or she is a scientist who is an expert in what the trial is about. The principal investigator takes the lead in designing a clinical trial, choosing the research team, and carrying out the study. Other scientists called investigators are part of the research team. Before a drug is tested in a clinical trial, considerable research is done in a laboratory in developing the drug and testing whether it can protect against the virus or not. Clinical trials typically take place in three stages. Phase 1 trials usually involve a few dozen people and are designed to observe whether a vaccine or drug is safe. Scientists give the vaccine to a small number of people (often 15 to 30) to confirm that it works to make the immune system become active to address the virus. Phase 1 trials aim to find the best dose of the drug or vaccine with the fewest side effects and to determine if the vaccine is safe enough to continue testing. Phase 2 trials, involving hundreds of people, allow researchers to try out different doses and gather more measurements about the vaccine's effects on the immune system. Scientists give the vaccine to hundreds of people split into groups, such as children and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. These trials further test the vaccine's safety. Phase 3 trials, involving thousands or tens of thousands of volunteers, determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine or drug by waiting to see how many people are protected from the disease it is designed to fight. Scientists give the vaccine to thousands of people and wait to see how many become infected, compared with volunteers who received a placebo (a substance that does not contain the vaccine). These trials are randomized, which means they are put into trial arms (either receiving vaccine or placebo) by chance. Randomization makes sure that the people in the trial arms (groups) are alike, so that scientists know that the results of the trial are due to the vaccine and not due to differences between the people in the trial arms. These trials can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus, measuring what's known as the efficacy rate. Phase 3 trials are also large enough to reveal evidence of relatively rare side effects. The data from clinical trails are generally published in medical journals after \"peer-review\" i.e., other experts. In general, when an article goes through peer review provides more confidence in the integrity of the study and the data. It is therefore important that there is complete transparency about data from clinical trials to ensure confidence in the vaccine or any drug for that matter.

Within community spread, there is no clear source of the infection (such as a history of travel or connection to a known case). Coronavirus A family of viruses that mostly cause respiratory illnesses. Coronaviruses cause COVID-19, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), among other illnesses. They get their names from the crown-like spikes (coronas) that appear on the virus under a microscope. COVID-19 The name of the illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 stands for \"coronavirus disease 2019.\" Demographics The characteristics of a population. These may include the percentage of the population of different ages, sexes, race/ethnicities, education, employment, residence, and geographic location. Droplet A small drop of liquid, such as those of mucus or saliva that are expelled (sprayed out) into the air when a person coughs or sneezes. Droplet transmission The spread of a disease such as COVID-19 by the spread of droplets. Droplets are expelled when an infected person coughs, talks, or sneezes. Transmission occurs when these droplets land in the nose, throat, or eyes of another person. Foreign substance A substance that comes from outside of the body, such as a virus or bacteria. A foreign substance in the body's tissues may be recognized by the immune system, resulting in an immune response that causes the body to defend itself against the substance. Herd immunity (also called community immunity) A situation that occurs when a large enough number of a population is immune to an infectious disease (either through already having had the disease or through vaccination) to limit or stop the spread from person to person in that area, even among those who do not already have immunity. Immune system The immune system protects the body from infections, viruses and diseases. It is a network of cells that forms a system in the body responsible for fighting disease. Its primary role is to identify foreign substances in the body (bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites) and develop a defense against them. If the substance enters the body again at a later time, the immune system can remember and repeat this response. Immunity Protection against a disease. Immunization The process of being made immune or resistant to an infectious disease, typically through receiving a vaccine. Immune response The response made by the immune system to defend itself against a disease or pathogen. The immune response is first created when the body encounters either the disease or a vaccine, and then it is repeated if the disease attempts to enter the body at a later time. Incubation period The time it takes for someone with an infection to start showing symptoms of an illness. Isolation The process of separating people who are sick with a contagious disease such as COVID-19 from people who are not sick. mRNA vaccines (also called messenger RNA vaccines) mRNA vaccines that contain harmless sections of protein from the virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccines give cells instructions for how to make copies of the protein, then the cells destroy the material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build white blood cells that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future. Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) Actions, apart from getting vaccinated and taking medicine, that help slow the spread of illnesses such as COVID-19. These may include staying home when sick; washing hands; wearing a mask; physical distancing when coming in close contact with others; temporarily closing schools and businesses; and cleaning surfaces. Pandemic The worldwide spread of a new disease. Placebo A substance that is given in a clinical trial that does not contain the certain medication or vaccine being studied. The participants in a trial or experiment who are given this placebo are compared to those who receive the vaccine being studied to determine how the vaccine performs compared to those who receive the placebo (such as if those who received the vaccine were less likely to be infected with COVID-19 compared). Prevalence The number of disease cases (new and existing) within a population over a given time period. Principal investigator The person in charge of a clinical trial. He or she is a scientist who is an expert in what the trial is about. The principal investigator takes the lead in designing a clinical trial, choosing the research team, and carrying out the study. Quarantine The process of separating and limiting the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease such as COVID-19 to see if they become sick. During that time, those in quarantine are asked to monitor potential symptoms. R0 (or R-naught) The average number of people that a person with an infectious disease is expected to spread the infection to. If R0 is greater than 1, it can spread in a population. Side Effect Any health problem shown by studies to be caused by a vaccine. Like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. Usually vaccine side effects are minor (for example, a sore arm where a shot was given or a low-grade fever after a vaccine) and go away on their own within a few days. Social distancing (also physical distancing) Putting space between yourself and others to slow down the spread of infection. Trial protocol A series of procedures to be carried out during a clinical trial. Vaccine efficacy (also referred to as efficacy rate) A measure that is used to describe how good a vaccine is at preventing disease. Efficacy is the benefit that a vaccine provides compared to a placebo, as measured in ideal conditions such as in a clinical trial. To test a coronavirus vaccine, for instance, researchers compare how many people in the vaccinated and placebo groups get Covid-19. A vaccine efficacy of 90% means a 90% reduction of the number of cases from what would have occurred if the participants had not been vaccinated. The greater the percentage reduction of illness in the vaccinated group, the greater the vaccine efficacy. Vaccine effectiveness The benefit that a vaccine or a drug provides out in the real world (compared to the benefit found in the controlled conditions of a clinical trial). A vaccine effectiveness of 90% means that there was a 90% reduction of the number of cases that would have occurred if they had not been vaccinated. The greater the percentage reduction of illness in the vaccinated group, the greater the vaccine effectiveness. A vaccine's effectiveness may turn out to be lower or higher than its efficacy. Vaccination A way of protecting the body against disease by injecting a substance (often containing all or part of a microorganism, such as a virus) that will cause the body to develop antibodies against the microorganism and later fight off disease. Vaccine hesitancy Vaccine hesitancy refers people delaying or refusing of to get vaccinated despite the availability of a safe vaccine. Viral load The amount of a virus in a sample, especially a person's blood or other bodily fluids. Viral load is typically measured as the number of virus particles per milliliter. Virus A tiny organism that multiplies within cells and causes disease such as COVID-19, chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis and hepatitis. Viruses are different from bacteria; viruses are smaller, have a different structure, and cause different diseases than bacteria. Viruses are not affected by antibiotics, the drugs used to kill bacteria. White blood cells Blood cells that protect the body from infection. Zoonotic disease A disease that has its source from an animal that is communicable to humans. COVID-19 is believed to be a zoonotic disease. "}
