Patients are cared for by a team of doctors and nurses, not just a surgeon. Our team meets weekly to discuss important patient issues and therefore patients really do benefit from that team approach. Furthermore, we treat patients like we would want our family to be treated, with respect, kindness, and patience. Regarding surgical advances, we are able to offer the most recent advances in minimally invasive surgery, including advanced techniques for robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, performed by surgeons who are experts in kidney surgery. The breadth and volume of kidney surgery performed here at BIDMC, I believe, is second to none. Another factor that I think makes us unique is that as the lead kidney cancer center for Dana-Farber Cancer Center, we are able to combine leading-edge surgery options with leading-edge systemic therapy, including tumor vaccine trials, high-dose IL2 trials, and other novel clinical trials particularly important for metastatic kidney cancer.
