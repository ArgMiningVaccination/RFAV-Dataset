{"title": "Effects of Acupressure as an Adjunct to Oral Prophylaxis in Treatment of Gingivitis: A Randomized Case-control Study", "author": "S Deepshika; R Saravanan; V Sathya Sree; Pavithrasri Kannan; Kavitha Muthu", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Background: Acupressure is a branch of acutherapy which is a key component of Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is a form of alternative medicine that claims to provide treatment for gingivitis, periodontal disease, halitosis, dental pain, facial palsy, gag reflux and other diseases of the oral cavity. Aim: The objective of the study was to assess the effect of acupressure as an adjunct to oral prophylaxis in treatment of gingival inflammation and compare its efficacy with solitary conventional scaling. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 age-matched adolescents with gingivitis were chosen for the study. They were randomly allocated into control or solitary oral prophylaxis group (Group A) and intervention or acupressure group (Group B). Silness and Loe Gingival Bleeding Index was recorded for 50 subjects prior to the treatment. Group A underwent oral prophylaxis only. Group B underwent oral prophylaxis and performed acupressure therapy twice a day for 14 days. Silness and Loe Gingival Bleeding Index was recorded again after 21 days. Results: There is a considerable reduction of gingival bleeding scores in acupressure group compared to control group. The mean difference between baseline and after intervention scores of Gingival Index in control is1.57\u00b10.286 and in test is 1.73\u00b10.152 with the p value (<0.001*). Conclusion: Acupressure could be served as a valuable adjunct to oral prophylaxis in treatment of gingival inflammation. It might serve as a valuable adjunct to conventional scaling by enhancing host-mediated response. Its efficacy in analgesia can be utilized to minimize post-operative pain. Prospective studies with more number of participants are needed for further validation.", "sitename": "Journal of Natural Remedies", "date": "2022-02-14", "cleaned_text": "Effects of Acupressure as an Adjunct to Oral Prophylaxis in Treatment of Gingivitis: A a branch of acutherapy which is a key component of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
