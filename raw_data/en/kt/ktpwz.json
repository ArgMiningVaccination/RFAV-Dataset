Insomnia and SQI are a mong the most prevalent and distressing problems reported by cancer survivors and can be severe enough to increa se cancer mortality.1-11 Cancer survivors also demonstrate dysregulated circadian activity rhythms, impaired physical func tion (i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular function) and chronically up-regulated inflammatory responses when their slee p is compromised. 4,5,12-48 Despite the ubiquity of insomnia and SQI, they are under-diagnosed and under-treated in cancer survivors.1-11,48 Previous research demonstrates that insomnia can begin before c ancer treatment,4,5 continue during treatment,3,49 and persist for years after treatments are completed.6,50 Approximately, two thirds of cancer patients who experience insomnia acutely while receiving treatm ents will develop chronic insomnia that persists for years into survivorship. 3,50 Recent data from a local randomized clinical trial led by Dr. Roscoe and investigator s in our URCC NCORP Research Base shows that 80% of cancer survivors recruited for this study report experiencing persistent insomnia during the first 5 years after completion of surgery, chemothera py and/or radiation therapy.51- 53 See Figure 1. Patients reported that insomnia began during the time they were receiving treatments for their cancer and persisted up to 30 years into survivorship.51-53 Collectively, prior research3- 6,49,50 and our new data suggest that the insomnia we propose to study, during the first 5 years po st-treatment, is related to c ancer and its treatments. Data from Dr. Roscoe and colleagues also suggests that cognitiv e behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective for treating persistent insomnia (p < 0.05) among these survivors and that the number of years since completing primary treatments for cancer has no impact on the efficacy of CBT-I (p> 0.05).51-53 Formally intervening with a b ehavioral treatment for insomnia was both necessary and helpful for cancer survivors regardless of number of years since completion of primary cancer treatments.51-53 This is supported by other research suggesting that persistent insomnia does not resolve on its own and requires formal intervention.3,50,54,55 Finally, we note that the NCCN guidelines for cancer survivor s specifically recommend formally intervening among cancer survivors to alleviate insomnia with n o designated cut-off in terms of years since completion of treatment.56 Treatment options for insomnia include: 1) pharmaceuticals, whi ch do not cure insomnia and can lead to toxicities, negative interactions with cancer therapeutics, dependency, and rebound impairment after di scontinuation, 2) traditional exercise, which is recommended in treatment guidelines, but not widely implemented in survivorship care plans beyond the use of generalized statements in which survivors are encour aged to be physically active and exercise, and 3) psychobehavioral interventions.1-10 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the gold standard psychobehavioral treatment for i nsomnia for the general population, and it is efficacious for treating insomnia among cancer survivors.57,58 Yoga is a well-tolerated exercise intervention with promising preliminary evidence for its efficacy in improving insomnia and SQI among cancer survivors. Our research and that of other s suggest that yoga may improve insomnia and SQI by regulating circadian activity rhythms, improving physical function (i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular function) and decreasing inflammation. 14,59-73 We conducted\u2014to our knowledge\u2014t he first multicenter, phase II I, randomized, controlled trial (RCT), in 410 cancer survivors from 12 community oncology practices throug hout the U.S., showing that Figure 1: Number of Survivors Reporting Persistent Insomnia PostTreatment 030 years post treatment 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 6 of 43 our standardized yoga intervention (YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae: 4 wks., 2x/wk., 75 min./session) produced significant moderat e to large improvements in insomnia and SQ I while also improving circadian activity rhythms. Yoga par ticipants decreased sleep medication use, while control par ticipants increased sleep medi cation use. Adherence to YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae was relatively high at 80%, and there were no study-rela ted adverse events. All (100% ) participants found the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae program useful and would recommend it to other can cer survivors experiencing sleep problems. In response to NCI research priorities and PA 11-260, we propos ed a follow-on study that aligns with NCI research priorities to develop effective supportive care interventions f or survivors. We proposed a multicenter, 3-arm, blinded, phase III RCT to fill remaining empirical gaps by comparing the effectiveness of ARM 1) our standard YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae program, ARM 2) standard CBT-I, and ARM 3) a health education i ntervention controlling for time and attention for improving insomnia in 720 cancer survivors 2-60 months followin g adjuvant treatment. We will also explore three possible mechanisms through which YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae may improve insomnia\u2014circadia n activity rhythms, physical func tion (i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular function) and inflammatory immune responses\u2014based on our biobehavioral model. Innovation: This study is innovative becau se it is the first multi-center, phase III, blinded, RCT to test: 1) the effectiveness of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae compared to CBT-I and a health education control for improving insomnia and SQI, 2) the 3- and 6-month sustainability of insomnia benefits from YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae, and 3) the role of possible functional and biological mediators in the efficacy of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae. CBT-I is an effective gold standard treatment for the genera l population\u2014this trial will provide pivotal scientific data to determine if YOCA S\u00a9\u00ae should be considered a gold standard treatment option for insomnia in cancer survivors. In addition, this is the fir st study to examine the associa tions between both 24- and 12- hour circadian activity rhythms us ing a multi-oscillating model , physical function, cytokines, yoga and sleep in cancer survivors. We are not aware of any other group doing this work . ________________ 2.0 Background ________________ If YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is shown to be as effective as or more effective than CBT-I an d more effective than health education and if insomnia improvements are sustained 3 and 6 months later from t he yoga intervention, the benefits for cancer survivors would include: 1) an additional evidence-based, safe, non-pharmacological, effective, low-cost, enjoyable treatment for insomnia\u2014possibly a new gold standard treatment option; 2) a st andardized yoga therapy that can be explicitly prescribed and reproducibly disseminated in communities as part of survivo rship care plans for the treatment of insomnia; and 3) a better understanding of the functi onal and biological pathways through which YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae works to improve insomnia in order to further refine its effective use and applicability in various cancer populations. Yoga\u2014A Holistic Mind-Body Mode of Exercise: The many different styles and types of yoga are based on Eastern traditions from India (e.g., Classical, Advaita Vedanta, Tantra ), Tibet (e.g., Tibetan), and China (e.g., Chi Kung, Tai Chi).61,74,75 The word yoga is derived from its Sanskrit root \"yuj,\" which literally means \"to yoke\" or join together. In this case, yoga refers to joining the mind and the body.61,74,75 The earliest forms of yoga were firmly rooted in physical and mindful (breathing and meditative) practices and led to what is known today as classical yoga which forms the basis for most of the yoga currently taught in the U.S.74 Yoga, Sleep Quality Impairment and Insomnia: The existing evidence suggests that yoga is effective for imp roving SQI, but we were unable to find published studies that specific ally addressed the effects of yoga on insomnia in cancer survivors. In addition, no studies in cancer compared the effe cts of yoga on SQI to a proven effective gold-standard treatment for insomnia or SQI, examined the long-term durabilit y of effects, or examined potential mechanisms of action through which yoga may improve insomnia or SQI.14,59-61,64,65,71,73,76 Yoga Program Evaluations: Four evaluations of community yoga programs for cancer patients and survivors suggest that yoga may improve SQI.62,63,69,70 These yoga programs were based i n cancer centers or community- based yoga studios and offe red yoga classes specifically for cancer p atients receiving treatment and survivors who had completed treatments. The yoga classes included a wide variety of postures and mindfulness exercises from different types of yoga, and they were offered 1-2 times a week for 60-90 minutes. Participants in two of these programs also attributed improvements in strength, physical function, and phy sical fitness to their yoga practice.62,70 However, these 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 7 of 43 reports utilized convenience sampl es and did not use research m ethods designed to answer spec ific scientific questions about the effects of yoga on SQI. These programs also did not use standardized yoga interventions that can be accurately and consistently replicated for dissemination and use in the treatment of insomnia or SQI. Therefore, this study will be a confirmatory phase III RCT and will use our standardized yoga intervention, YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae. Phase I and II Pilot Studies: One phase I and five phase II studies provide preliminary support for the safety, feasibility and efficacy of yoga f or improving SQI among cancer patients and survivors (See Table 1).59,61,71,73,76 These studies assessed a range of yoga doses from 1-2 sessions/week with classes lasting 50-120 minutes using a variety of different types of yoga over 4-12 weeks. The interventions included a variety of postures and mindfulness exercises. The interventions were deemed saf e and feasible for cancer patients receiving treatment and survivors. Participants enjoyed the yoga interventions and in four studies reported imp rovements in SQI; two studies showed no changes in SQI. 60,76 Three of the phase II RCTs co mpared yoga to a waitlist control, one to a support therapy control condition and one to a health education control condition.59-61,73,76 The latter two studies suggest that yoga may be more effective for improving SQI than counseling, hea lth education, time and atten tion. Using YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae we conducted the first\u2014to our knowledge--phase III RCT demonstrating the efficacy of yoga for improving insomnia, SQI, and circadian activity rhythms among 410 cancer survivors. [See preliminary study 1.] This follow-on study compares the efficacy of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae to CBT-I and a health education control, examines the durabili ty of insomnia benefits, and explores possible mechanisms (circadian, physical and immune function). This RCT compares yoga to a health education control for time and attention. Why We Developed YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae: While yoga is increasingly popular in the U.S. and there are ma ny books and DVDs as well as cancer center and commun ity programs marketed toward ca ncer survivors (e.g., \"Gentle Yoga for Cancer Table 1: Summary of Phase I, II & III Yoga Studies Examining Sl eep Among Cancer Patients and Survivors Phase I Trial Design Sample Treatment Status Type of Yoga Dose of Yoga Outcomes Ulger et al., 2010 1-Arm Breast Cancer (N=20) Post-Adjuvant Treatment Classical 2x's/week 60 min/sess 4 weeks Sleep * QOL CRF NA Phase II Trial Design Sample Treatment Status Type of Yoga Dose of Yoga Outcomes Cohen et al., 2004 2-Arm RCT w/ SC Waitlist Lymphoma (N=39) Mixed receiving active and within 12 months post- adjuvant treatment Tibetan 1x's/week NA min/sess 7 weeks Sleep * Meds * Carson et al., 2009 2-Arm RCT w/ SC Waitlist Breast Cancer (N=37) treatment Yoga of Awareness 1x's/week 120 min/sess 8 weeks Sleep * Vidiraja et al., 2009 2-Arm RCT w/ SC + Support Therapy Breast Cancer (N=88) During adjuvant radiotherapy Integrated 3x\"s/week 50 min/sess 6 weeks 2-Arm 2x's/week 60 min/sess et al., 2011 2-Arm RCT w/ SC + Health Breast post- adjuvant treatment Iyengar 2x's/week 90 min/sess 12 weeks Sleep NC Phase III Trial Design Sample Treatment Status Type of Yoga Dose of Yoga Outcomes Mustian et al., 2013, 2011, 2010b, * Meds * Circadian Activity * Rhythms Notes: An arrow with an asterisk pointing upward indicates a s tatistically significant improvement in study outcome (i.e., improved sleep quality, less insomnia and reduct ions in sleep medication use). RCT = Randomized, Controlled Trial. NC = No Change, SC = Stand ard Care 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 8 of 43 Patients,\" \"Yoga for Breast Cancer Patients and Survivors,\" and \"Healing Yoga\"), there is little, if any, evidence as to the efficacy of these programs for im proving insomnia or SQI among cancer survivors. These yoga programs are not regulated, and there is significant variability in what is offered. For example, some yoga programs focus on very gentle, low-intensity, meditative practic es (e.g., Restorative, Integral, Svaroopa), while others focus on vigorous practices (e.g., Power, Ashtanga), and yet others focus on both (e.g., Hatha, Iy engar, Kundalini).77 Some programs modify the yoga environment by using heaters and humidifiers (e.g., Bikram) or props such as straps, blocks, ropes and chairs (e.g., Iyengar).77 Class structure varies considerably; some classes include only physical postures and no mindfulness exercises, while others include only mindf ulness exercises and no physical postures. The small number of studies examining the safety and effectiveness of only limited types of yoga for impr oving SQI among survivors coupled with the lack of regulation and wide variabilit y of yoga course offerings substa ntially increases the chance that survivors may spend a sizeable amount of time, energy a nd money participating in yoga programs that may not be safe or effective. For example, yoga in a room heated to over 100 degrees may be contr aindicated for some survivors, and vigorous yoga may result in excessive muscle sore ness and joint pain, increasing insomnia. We developed Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae) as a standardized program of yoga that can be easily and consistently replicated for res earch, and ultimately, dissemina tion and used in the treatment of insomnia and SQI. YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is a standardized yoga program designed by Dr. Mustian and her research team specifically for use by cancer patients and survivors. The YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae program is a low to moderate intensity mode of exercise that d raws from two basic types of yoga: gentle Hat ha and Restorative yoga. The pr ogram includes 16 specific physical postures (asanas) and mindfulness exercises focused on breathing (pranayama) and medi tation (dhyana). The program is designed to be delivered by Registered Yoga Alliance instructors in community settings, two times a week for 75 minutes over four weeks\u2014an explicit yoga prescripti on for the treatment of insomn ia and SQI. [See the detailed clinical protocol.] We also developed a training program for yoga instructors, including a written manual and two DVDs. The training materials provide precise instructions for all posture, breathing and med itation exercises with appropriate modifications if necessary. We successfully trained 18 yoga instructors and used the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae program in our first multicenter study. We will train additional instructors and use YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae again in the current study. Limitations of Previous Phase I-III Studies: None of the phase I-II studies was a definitive phase III RCT that was planned and powered a priori to test the effects of yoga on ins omnia or SQI as a primary outcome. The sample sizes were small, ranging from 20-88. They did not screen for or require a specific level of insomnia or SQI as part of participant eligibility. The studies did not blind participants with the e xception of the Bower study.76 Yoga interventions were not standardized and were highly variable in content, type, intensi ty, and duration of yoga, making it impossible to determine the actual dose of yoga needed to improve insomnia or SQI. The yoga interventions were not described in great detail, making repeatability and standardized dissemination impossible. While general comments suggested the interventions were safe and that participants enjoyed them, no specific detai ls were provided on the rate of adverse events. Information on participant attendance, compliance and attrition, details of the prescribed yoga dose vers us the actual dose achieved (e.g., mode, frequency, intensity , duration), and information on sustainability of improvements in SQI stemming from yoga were limited. Furthermore, no studies, including our prev ious phase III trial, compare d yoga to a gold-standard treatment for insomnia or SQI such as CBT-I\u2014a required next ste p in clinical research if yoga i s to be determined a gold- standard treatment option for insomnia. Moreover, no studies, with the exception of ours, examined possible biological mechanisms through which yoga may improve insomnia or SQI. This phase III RCT capitalizes on the positive aspects of our prior phase III RCT and addresses most of the remaining limitations by blinding participants, comparing YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae to CBT-I and a health education time and attention control, examining the durability of effects on insomnia and investigating biological mechanisms whe reby YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae may improve insomnia. Yoga Summary: Further research is warranted b ecause, despite their limitations, these phase I-III studies collectively suggest that: 1) cancer patients can safely participate in yoga during and after cancer treatment s, 2) yoga interventions are feasible in a variety of cance r centers and community-based yog a studios, 3) cancer survivors participating in these yoga programs enjoy them and find them beneficial, and 4) yoga parti cipation ranging from 1-2 sessions/week for 50-120 minutes per session over a period of 4-12 weeks may lead to imp rovements in insomnia and SQI. Pathophysiology of Insomnia and SQI: The pathophysiology of insomnia and SQI and their relationships with cancer and its treatments are largely unexplained.25,48,78 Research suggests that sleep p roblems may arise Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 9 of 43 from abnormal sleep/wake homeostasis, hyperarousal, disruptive cognitive and behavioral factors and impaired circadian, physical (i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular) and immune function. [Note: We acknowledge our model does not include ALL potential biopsychosocial mechanisms (e.g., relaxation pathways); it's not possible to investigate them ALL in a single clinical trial.] Our working model is based on our rese arch and that of others showing that cancer survivors with compromised sleep demonstrate dysregulated circadian function ( i.e., flattened diurnal rhythms, suppressed morning peaks, elevated evening nadirs, and delayed acrophases), impaired physical function (decreased cardiopulmonary and muscular function) and dysregulated immune responses (chronical ly up-regulated pro-inflammatory responses). 4,5,12-2425-47 Based on these data, we theorize that yoga will elicit positive changes in circadian activity rhythms, physical function and inflammation that will, in turn, mediate the effec t of yoga on insomnia. We developed a theoretical model to serve as a framework to guide our research on these pu tative mechanisms whereby yoga may improve insomnia. All components of the full biobehavioral model will not be stat istically evaluated, as that is beyond the scope of any single study, but we will statistically evaluate the dir ect effects of yoga on circadian activity rhythms, physical function (i.e., cardiopulmonary [6-minute walk] and muscular [s trength]) and inflammatory responses, as well as, the mediating effects of these plausible mechanisms on insomnia. Integrated Behavioral and Biological Systems Model (See Figure 2): Our theory is that cancer and its treatments directly and negatively influence circadian, physical (i.e., ca rdiopulmonary and muscular) and immune function; in turn, diminished function in these systems leads to insomnia. Cancer and its treatments also lead to a reduction in physical activity/exercise th at elicits physical decondition ing responses which, in turn, lead to diminished function in these same systems, further impairing sleep. Yoga, a form of exercise, is capable of positively influencing each of these systems and improving circadian, phys ical and immune function and, consequently, improving insomnia as described below. Yoga and The Circadian Clock System: Yoga is a form of exercise that may regulate circadian function by acting as an exogenous behavioral non-photosensitizer for the circadian system that normalizes dysregulated circadian activity rhythms stemming from cancer and its treatments, there by improving insomnia. The circadian clock system consists of a central com ponent\u2014the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus known as co mponents involving multiple organ- and tissue-specific \"clocks.\" These peripheral clocks are synchronized through humoral and neural connections throughout the body that, in turn, affect behavioral and physiological output rhythms (i .e., diurnal fluctuations in sle ep, physical activity, heart ra te, strength, and cytokines).79-81 Figure 2: Integrated Systems Biological Model 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 10 of 43 The master clock, however, has its own intrinsic rhythm which is entrained\u2014synchronized to a 24-hour cycle--by exogenous photo- and non-photosensitizers. The light; one of the strongest non- photosensitizers is exercise (e.g., yoga).81 Our prior study suggests that yoga favorably alters circadian activity rhythms.14 We will assess circadian activity rhythms using actigraphy as in preliminary study 1 described below. Yoga and The Immune System\u2014 Inflammatory Responses: Yoga may regulate immune function in the same way as other modes of exercise, by da mpening the chronically up-regulated pro-inflammatory responses exhibited in cancer survivors as a result of their disease and its treatment s; this dampening, in turn, may normalize overall inflammatory responses and improve insomnia. Exercise reduces low-grade infla mmation by triggering the immed iate but transient release of IL-6.82 IL-6 is released from skeletal m uscle in proportion to exercise intensity and duration; the proportion of muscle mass used during an exercise bout, and tra ining status.82 In this environment IL-6 functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule by triggering the release of TNFr\u0000, IL-10, and IL-1r\u0000 which, c onsequently, inhibits the production of TNF, IL-8, IL-1 and IFNg and regulates overall inflammatory responses.82 Research suggests that yoga may improve inflammatory immune responses in cancer survivors w ith SQI.66,67,72 We will assess inflammation with appropriate standardized high-sensitivity multiplexed cytokine/ chemokine assay kits under GLP compliance as in preliminary studies 2 through 5 below. Yoga and Physical Function in the Cardiopulmonary and Muscular Systems: Yoga may improve physical function (i.e., cardiopulmonary and muscular function) in the same way a s other modes of exercise, by eliciting a physiological conditioning response. This physical conditionin g response may improve the reduced physical function exhibited by cancer surv ivors as a result of their dis ease and its treatment, consequently improving insomnia. It is well documented that trad itional modes of exercise performed frequently at high enough intensities for a sufficient duration improve cardiopulmonary and muscular function as part of a desirable physical conditioning response,83,84 and that regular exercise, using traditional modes, which impr oves physical function (cardiopulmonary and muscular), results in medium to large improvements in total sle ep time, slow wave or \"deep\" sleep, nighttime wakefulness, sleep onset latency and insufficient sleep.85-88 Research suggests that participation in yoga improves cardiopulmonary and muscular func tion in healthy individuals an d those with other diseases,68,77,89-92 but we could find no studies showing this in a cancer population. We will assess physical function with a 6-minute walk test and a handgrip dynamometry test as in Dr. Mustian's preliminary studies 2 through 5. PRELIMINARY STUDIES BY THE PI AND RESEARCH TEAM YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae Multicenter Phase III RCT (URCC04-01/U3905) --Study 1: Dr. Mustian14,64,65 and her research team completed a nationwide, multic enter, phase III RCT examining th e effectiveness of a standardized 4-week yoga program (YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae--Yoga for Cancer Survivors) for improving SQI in 410 cancer survivors. Insomnia, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency and circadian activity rhythms were also asses sed as secondary endpoints. Study participants were recruited through the University of Rochester Cancer Center Community Clinical Oncology Program (URCC CCOP) Research Base in Rochester, NY and 9 affiliated Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs; 12 total community oncology practices) across the U.S. \u2014a consortium of oncology researchers and practicing community oncologists with over 30 years of success conducting large, multicenter, phase III RCTs to test new treatments for the side effects stemming from cancer and its treatments. The study was highly successful and accrued all 410 cancer survivors through 12 community oncology practices in 12 different cities across the U.S. in 32 months; 321 participants (79%) prov ided evaluable data. Table 2: SleepQuality Impairment, Insomnia, and Sleep Medication Use in YOCAS Trial Outcome Mean (SEM) Yoga (N = 168)Control (N= 153)Between Group Pvalue Pre Post Pre Post Sleep Quality 9.20 (0.25) 7.23 (0.26) 8.96 (0.28) (1.62)13.4 (1.76)20.2 (0.10)0.018 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 11 of 43 Results (See Table 2 and Figure 3): Our standardized yoga intervention (YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae; 4 wks., 2x/wk., 75 min. /session; 600 total min.) significantly improved SQI, insomnia, and circadian activity rhythms among 410 cancer survivors. 14,64,65,93 The YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae intervention not only significantly improved SQI and secondaril y, insomnia, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency, but the yoga participants decreased their sleep medication use during the intervention, while the control participants increased sleep medication use. Multi-oscillator modeling revealed a 12-hour, ultradian rhythm model fit the circadian activity rhythms better than a single-oscillator, 24-hour model a nd demonstrated significant r hythm differences between groups post-intervention (p<0.05) with a delayed 12-hour acrophase in the yoga group (p< 0.05). The yoga group demons trated higher physical activity during the morning (first 12 hours of the day) and sta bilized physical activity throughout the afternoon and evening (second 12 hours of the day); whereas, the standard car e control group showed a lower physical activity pattern in the morning and a higher peak in physical activity in the after noon and evening. Blunted morning circadian rhythms (low physical activity) and excessive peaks (high physical activity) in circadian rhythms during the afternoon and evening are associated with SQI. 4,5,12-24 Adherence and Adverse Events: Survivors assigned to the yoga arm attended an average of 6.5 of the 8 prescribed sessions for a total of 480 minutes of the prescribed 600 minut es during the 4-week intervention period. Survivors in the yoga arm also reported extra yoga practice outside of the two r equired yoga sessions, resulting in a total average of 182 minutes each week over 3 days with a rating of perceived exerti on of 3.4 (moderate intensity). Contamination in the control condition was very low; 7 participants reported an aver age of 20 minutes of yoga one time each week with a rating of perceived exertion of 1.0 (very weak) during the interventio n period. There were no study-related adverse events. Survivors liked the yoga intervention; 100% found it useful for improving their sleep and would recommend it to other cancer survivors. Yoga Intervention: We used the YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae program previously described in the background section and fully detailed in the manual. To ensure intervention quality, fidelity across st udy sites and instructors, and to prevent drift over the course of the study, Dr. Mustian and her team developed a specialized training program for instructors that included a set of two DVDs, a written manual, and a 2-hour web-based teleconference training workshop. Training updates were provided on a regular basis\u2014minimally every s ix months. An independent and r andom observation of class instruction was also made during each 4-week YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae intervention by research staff to assess the quality and fidel ity of intervention delivery by instructors. Measures: Measures included: SQI and Sleep Medication Use (Pi ttsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PSQI), 94 Insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index; ISI).95,96 Wake after sleep onset, sleep e fficiency and circadian activi ty rhythms were assessed by actigraphy.20,24,97 Summary: Results suggest that YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae can improve insomnia, SQI, and circadian activity rhythms amon g cancer survivors and that survivors like the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae intervention, will attend it, will practice yoga on their own, and will Figure 3: Circadian Rhythms at Pre- and Post-Intervention 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 12 of 43 recommend it to others. These da ta also suggest that altering circadian activity rhythms is a plausible mechanism whereby yoga may lead to improvements in insomnia. Changes in Physical Function and Inflammation Are Possible Mech anisms Whereby Yoga May Improve Insomnia\u2014Studies 2 through 4: Study 2: Dr. Mustian and her team conducted a phase II RCT comparing t he influence of a Tai Chi Chuan (a Chinese form of yoga) intervention (3x/week, 60 minutes/session, 12 wee ks) on physical function and inflammation to a psychosocial support therapy intervention among breast cancer survivors (N=21) between 2 weeks and 24 months post- adjuvant therapy. Results showed better cardiopulmonary function (6-minute walk test) and muscular function (handgrip test) as well as more favorable inflammatory responses in the tai chi group compared to the support therapy group post intervention. Participants liked the intervention and attended 72% of the sessions with no adverse events. 36,38,41-43,45,47 Study 3: Dr. Mustian and her research t eam also conducted a phase II R CT examining the influence of a low to moderate intensity aerobic and resistance exercise intervention (Exercis e for Cancer Patients\u2014EXCAP\u00a9\u00ae) on SQI, physical function (i.e., cardiopulmonary function and muscular function) and inflammatory responses among breast and prostate cancer patients (N=38) beginning radiation therapy. Participan ts were randomized to 4 weeks of exercise or no exercise. Cytokines and receptors were measured using appropriate ELISAs. Exercise participants exhibited less SQI, better physical function (i.e., cardiopulmonary function via 6-minute walk test and muscular function via handgrip dynamometer test) and reduced i nflammatory responses post intervention compared to participants in the control group. Higher levels of IL-6 and lower levels of TNFR1 were as sociated with increased SQI.35,46 Study 4: We also recently completed a phase II RCT examining the influen ce of the EXCAP\u00a9\u00ae intervention over 6 weeks on SQI and physical func tion (cardiopulmonary and muscula r function) in 53 prostate cancer patients. EXCAP\u00a9\u00ae participants demonstrated improve ments in cardiopulmonary funct ion (VO 2max) and strength (repetition maximal testing), and these improvements were inversely correla ted with SQI (all p<0.05). These changes in cardiopulmonary and muscular func tion significantly predicted c hanges in SQI (p<0.05, r=0.120) and, collectively, accounted for approximately 17% of the variance in SQI. Successful Experience and Expertise in Collecting Actigraphy, 6 -Minute Walk, Handgrip Dynamometry and Cytokine Data in a Large Multicenter Research Base Study: Study 5: In addition to successfully com pleting the previously mention ed multicenter RCT examining the influence of yoga on insomnia, SQI and circadian activity rhythms (via actig raphy), Dr. Mustian and colleagues are currently conducting a nationwide, multicenter, phase III RCT examining t he influence of EXCAP\u00a9\u00ae over 6 weeks on SQI, cardiopulmonary (6-minute walk) and muscular (handgrip dynamometry) function, inflammation (cytokines in serum), and energy expenditure (actigraphy) among cancer patients recei ving chemotherapy. This study has accrued > 600 participants in 36 months. Dr. Mustian and her team have trained 256 CCOP (now NCORP) staf f members at 19 CCOPs affiliated with the Research Base to obtain actigraphy da ta, administer the 6-minute walk and handgrip tests, and acquire and process bl ood samples for cytokine analy ses. The same methods used to collect data in those two RCTs will be used in this multicenter RCT. We will measure the same cytokines in our follow-on RCT as in our previous studies because our preliminary data are positive. Successful Experience and Expertise in Delivering Group-Based P sychotherapy and CBT-I in a Large Multicenter Research Base Study: Studies 6 and 7: The URCC Research Base is currently conducting a study testin g the efficacy of a modified version of standard CBT-I for improving insomnia, sleep quality, circadian activity rhythms and heart rate variability among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (URCC12048). The URCC Research Base previously successfully conducted a phase III RCT testing the effectiveness of group-based psychosocial suppo rt therapy for improving quality of life and other symptoms among 326 men receiving treatment for prostate cancer through the Research Base (U9994). The same procedures used successfully to implement these group-based psy chotherapies will be used in this RCT. 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 13 of 43 Preliminary Studies Summary: These seven preliminary studies: 1) suggest that YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae may be effective for improving insomnia, SQI and circadian activity rhythms, 2) provide support for testing our theory that YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae may improve insomnia by improving c ircadian activity rhythms, cardi opulmonary function, muscular function and inflammation, 3) demonstrate our expertise and ability to succe ssfully conduct nationwide, m ulticenter, phase III RCTs, 4) demonstrate our abilities to deliver group-based yoga and psych otherapies and to collect objective physical function, sleep and circadian activity rhythms d ata in large multicenter clinic al trials, and 5) demonstrate our ability to work with the Research Base and NCORP Affiliates. ______________ 3.0 Objectives ______________ 3.1 Primary Aim: 1. To determine if YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is effective for improving patient-reported insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index) compared to CBT-I and a health education control immediately po st intervention. 3.2 Secondary Aims: 1. To examine if YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is effective for improving objec tive symptoms of insomnia (sle ep latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, sleep duration, and daytime napping via actigraphy) and global sleep quality impairment (Pittsburg Sl eep Quality Index) compared to CBT-I and a health education control. 2. To examine if YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and CBT-I are effective for maintaining improvements in insom nia (Insomnia Severity Index) 3 and 6 months post intervention compared to a health education control. 3.3 Exploratory Aims: 1. To explore whether YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae is effective for improving circadian activity rhythms (24 and 12 hour amplitudes and acrophases measured via actigraphy), physical fu nction (i.e., cardiopulmonary [6-min. walk] and to CBT-I and a health education c ontrol. 2. To explore whether changes in c ircadian activity rhythms, physical function and inflammation mediate the effect of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on insomnia. 3. To explore the time-varying nature of physical activity behavior after cancer treatment and develop a new methodological approach to jointly model longitudinally measured exposures and outcomes subject to measurement error and modification by personal characteristics in a physical activity intervention study. ______________________ 4.0 Participant Eligibility ______________________ Eligibility criteria for all study participants must be confirm ed using the Eligibility Checklist.

If you are unable to log on, call 585.275.1364, between 8:30 AM and 4:30 PM (Eastern Time); Monday through Friday. 5.3 The following information will be requested: 5.3.1 NCORP site 5.3.2 Most recent IRB approval date (either initial or annual-not an amendment date) 5.3.3 Name and telephone number of coordinator following the study participant 5.3.4 Treating component or subcomponent CTEP institution code 5.3.4.1 Enrolling physic ian CTEP Investigator ID 5.3.5 Confirmation that participant meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria requirements listed in Section 4.0 including 5.3.5.1 Documentation of eligibility screening score of >10 on the Insomnia Severity Index Screening Form. 5.3.5.2 Documentation of meeting DSM-V Insomnia diagnosis crite ria on the DSM-V Screening Form. 5.3.5.3 Documentation of meeting all eligibility requirements o n the Eligibility Checklist. 5.3.6 Confirmation that the consent form has been signed 5.3.7 Participant's identification 5.3.7.1 Screening ID# from the Screening Log 5.3.7.2 First and last initials 5.3.7.3 Birth date (MM/DD/YYYY) 5.3.7.4 Gender 5.3.7.5 Race and Five-digit zip code 5.3.7.7 Payment code 5.3.7.8 Stratification: ISI severity screening score and current hormone therapy status (yes/no) 5.4 An email confirmation of reg istration will be sent from the URCC NCORP Research Base. 5.5 Registration and randomization of participants will occur w hen an entire cohort has been consented. A cohort consists of a yoga group, a CBT-I group and a health education group at a single NCORP location. All participants are registered at t he same time. The minimum numb er of participants to comprise a cohort is 15 and the maximum is 30. The NCORP must notify the URCC when the fin al participant in a cohor t is being consented, and provide the total number of participants enrolled to that c ohort, the institution's CTEP ID, and the date of the first day of the baseline week. T he Research Base requires a 2 4-hour turn-around time to open the registration site. The NCORP site must then r egister the entire cohort of participants within 24 hour s and will receive the randomization assignment for each participant at that time. NCORP coordinators will know the randomization assignments; however participants are not to be notified of the ir randomization assignments until they have completed all baseline assessments. The participants randomized to each of the three conditions w ill all participate in the intervention they are assigned together as a group and the sessions will only contain study participants. (Note: The URCC has successfully used this metho d of randomization in previous studies including U3905 (the prior yoga study), U 2991 and U9994 where cohorts wer e randomized to treatments delivered using group formats.) Participant cohorts will be recruited at each NCORP and then randomized; this will allow for statistical analyses by site. 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 17 of 43 5.6 A total enrollment of 720 participants (accounting for 30% of participants providing non-evaluable data) is planned as follows: Group N Evaluable YOCAS 240 168 CBT-I 240 168 Health Education 240 168 5.7 Randomization will be stratified by ISI severity score obta ined during the screening pr ocess (ISI score of 10-18 = \"moderate\" and 19-28 = \"severe\") and hormone therapy (two level s: yes/no). In addition, participant cohorts will be recruited at each NCORP and then randomized; this will, in t urn, allow for statistical analyses by site. 5.8 The three study arms are as follows: Arm 1 = The standard YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae intervention Arm 2 = The standard CBT-I intervention Arm 3 = The health education control intervention which is equa lly matched to YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on time and attention. 5.9 The randomization will assign participants to the three arm s in the ratio of 1:1:1 using random block sizes of 3 or 6 and will be administered at t he URCC NCORP Research Base by means of a computer generated random numbers table provided by the biostatistician. _________________________ 6.0 Research Protocol _________________________ 6.1 Overview and Intervention Groups: 720 cancer survivors 2-60 months post-primary (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation) t reatment will be randomized to YOCAS, CBT-I, or the Health Education group. 6.2 Blinding: As part of the consenting pr ocess, participants will be blinded to study hypotheses and the true nature of the health education control condition (which is not expecte d in any way to improve insomnia; it is there to provide a time and attention c ontrol condition for the yoga arm ). In the beginning of the study they will be told that we are comparing three different interventions for improving sleep, specifically insomnia. Participants will be fully briefed about the nature of the study, the hypotheses we tested, and the true nature of the health education control condition upon completing the study during the exit int erview. 6.3 YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae Group: This is the standardized YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae yoga intervention which is a low to moderate intensity mode of exercise that draws from two basic types of yoga; gentl e Hatha and Restorative yoga. The program includes 18 specific physical postures and mindfulness exercises focused on breathing and meditation. Instructors will be allowed to modify the yoga postures to meet the specifi c needs of participants and participants will be allowed to use yoga props. (See the YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae manual, \"Yoga for Cancer Survi vors\".) The program is delivered by Registered Yoga Alliance and/or International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT) instructors in community settings, 2 times a week for 75-minute sessions over 4 weeks. Yoga instructor qualifications are documented in a resume or CV and submitted to the Research Base along with a copy of their Yoga Alliance and/or International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT) cred entials for approval. 6.4 CBT-I Group: This Cognitive Behav ioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). CBT-I is a standardized structured, multi-component cogniti ve behavioral intervention ( sleep education, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive thera py, and relapse prevention). (See the CBT-I workbook, \"Cognitive for Insomnia\".) CBT-I is delivered by health professio nals who are trained (e.g., clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, licensed counselors, nurses, etc.) to deliver CBT. The intervention is delivered 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 18 of 43 once a week for 90 minutes over an 8 week period. CBT-I instru ctor qualifications are documented in a resume or CV and submitted to the Research Base for approval. 6.5 Health Education Control Group: This group will receive a survi vorship health education inter vention (equally matched to YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae for time and attention) which is based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology cancer survivorship educational recommendations and a booklet e ntitled \"Cancer Survivorship Next Steps for Patients and Their Families.\" (See the health education bookle t.) The intervention is delivered by community health educators with a minimum o f a Bachelor's degree in a hea lth-related field or Registered Nurse certification, and a year of experience working in a clinical oncology setting with patients. This intervention is delivered 2 times a week for 75 minutes per session over 4 weeks. Health professional qualifications are documented in a resume or CV and submitted to the Research Base for approval. 6.6 The participants will all participate in the treatment they are assigned together as a group (1 group for each study arm condition) and the treatment sessions will only contain study participants. Participants will not be charged for any of the treatment sessions. 6.6.1 Each participating NCORP will be responsible for finding suitable yoga, CBT-I and health education instructors. The study PI, Dr. Karen Mustia n, along with members of the re search team, will be available to assist NCORPs in selecting appropriate instructors. Each instructor w ill be required to provide the following: copy of his/her resume or curriculum vitae documentation of his/her Yoga Alliance or International Associa tion of Yoga Therapists (IAYT) instructor training and certification status, CBT instructor tr aining/experience, or health educator instructor training/experience in a clinical oncology setting. personal liability insurance information in order to be paid as a study consultant, the instructor will complete o an IRS W-9 form o a University of Rochester Accepta nce form to follow the terms a nd conditions of working with the University Additionally, the instructors will sign an Adherence Statement promising to follow the yoga, CBT-I and health education interventions exactly as outlined in the clini cal protocols provided. The NCORP site will submit these materials to the Research Base (elizabeth_nagalski@urmc.rochester.edu) for review by Dr. Musti an and members of the research team to approve the yoga, CBT-I and health education instructor for con sultation and for teaching the interventions. Each instructor will also be required to complete a training se ssion with Research Base staff under the direction of Dr. Mustian, prior to final approval as a study in structor. A decision regarding approval of the instructor will be made wi thin two weeks of providing all the necessary materials and fully completing training. All instructors will be paid directly as consultants by the URC C NCORP Research Base. Instructors must submit an invoice to the Research Base within 7 calendar days o f completing the series of 8 intervention sessions for processing. Instructors will be paid a flat fee of $1200.00 per cohort to teach all 8 sessions and includes all preparation and travel time. Instructor invoi ces should be sent to: Libby Nagalski at Elizabeth_nagalski@urmc.rochester.edu. 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 19 of 43 6.6.2 Details and logistics on where the yoga, CBT-I and healt h education sessions will be conducted, obtaining props, meeting rooms and specifics regarding participant transp ortation will be individualized by each NCORP site. 6.7 Instructor Training: Dr. Mustian and her team devel oped a training program for yog a instructors, including a written manual and 2 DVDs, one for instructors and one for participants. The training materials provide precise instructions for all posture, breathing and meditation exercises with appropriate modifications if necessary. We successfully trained 18 yoga instructors and used the YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae program in our previous yoga study, U3905. We will train additional instructors and use YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae again in the current study. Dr. Pigeon and his team have developed a CBT-I training progr am for health professionals tha t includes a manual and PowerPoint presentation. The training materials provide precise instructions for all CBT -I components. He has successfully trained instructors to deliver CBT-I for the University of Rochester Me dical Center and the Veteran's Administration. We will use this same training program to train the CBT-I instructors for this study. Dr. Mustian and her team also developed a training program for health educators, includi ng a manual and PowerPoint presentation. The training materials provide precise instructions on the content to be covered in each of the health education sessions. We will use this program to train the health educati on instructors for this study. Each study instructor must successfully complete all training sessions prior to final approval to serve as an instructor in this study. Training sessions take approximately 1 hour. NCORPs cannot hir e and use instructors that are not trained and approved by Dr. Mustian and her team. 6.8 Intervention Quality: The exact same procedures used to ensure quality and fidelity and to prevent drift that were used in the previous yoga study, U3905, will be used in th is trial, except we will use videotaping to ensure proper class content rather than independent observations. The interventions will be de livered by professionally qualified instructors hired and vetted by Dr. Mustian and membe rs of the research team. All instructors will receive extensive training regarding the information to be taught. Training updates w ill be provided minimally every year for instructors and NCORP site staff. Dr. Mustian and her staff will be availa ble to answer questions at all times. Coordinators will be required to videotape the t hird class in each condition and send the videotape to the URCC NCORP Research Base by the end of the next business da y. Tapes will be reviewed within 3 business days of receipt by qualified staff under the direction of Dr. M ustian. Immediate feedback will be provided to the instructor and NCORP site staff so that corrections can be made if necessary. If at any time a coordinator or staff member realizes the intervention protocols are not being follow ed properly, the Research Base and study P.I. (Dr. Mustian) must be notified immediately. Video recordings will be uploaded via the research base's secure encrypted Box data upload system. Once URCC has reviewed the v ideo recordings and given authorization, the sites must destroy them. 6.8.1 Assessment Data Quality: The coordinators must submit al l baseline data from one individual in each of the three arms by the 3rd work day post baseline. This includes paperwork, fitness asse ssments, and actigraphy. Data are either uploaded or emailed to URCC. The Research Base will review and give the sites feedback so that corrections can be made if necessary. O nce the site has downloaded the actigraph data they must immediately give the actigraphs back to the appr opriate participants so they have them before the mid-intervention assessment. 6.9 All instructors will complete an Attendance Log for each se ssion to assist in documenting intervention compliance by instructors and participants. They will return these logs to the study coordinator. The Coordinator will darken the participants nam es; leaving only the initials v isible. They will in turn submit attendance logs for each of the three study arms to the Research Base. One attenda nce log is to be submitte d at the end of the intervention for each interven tion session for all 3 study arms. The names should be darkened to leave just participant initials visible. 6.10 Coordinator Training: All NCORP coordinators and sta ff must complete mandatory trai ning conducted by Research Base staff and PEAK Lab staff for this study. The tra ining includes study orientation, actigraphy, handgrip testing, 6-minute walk test, and blood drawing, proces sing, storage and shipping. The training lasts approximately 2 hours. 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 20 of 43 6.11 Screening: Cancer survivors 2-60 months post-primary (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) treatments, who have been treated at NCORP communities affiliated with the URCC NCORP Research Base will be screened. A screening consent form will be used by the coordinators when ap proaching potential study participants either over the phone or face to face. If the person declines participation in the study, the screening consent form will be destroyed. If the person agrees to discuss the study, a screen ing consent form will be completed and submitted to the Research Base. At screening, the DSM-V and ISI screening f orms will be used to determine eligibility for the study. All persons presented with this study will be entered on a RE DCap screening log found on the Research Base website. 6.12 Consent, Collection and Handling of Sensitive Data: If the person meets all eligibility criteria, the coordinator will go over the study in detail using the full study consent form. Both parties must sign the study consent form if the person agrees to be on study. Participants are asked to pr ovide their medical insurance ID number and their social security number in the consent form to follow them as pa rt of future research in the Medicare and Medicaid Beneficiary databases and the URCC NCORP Research Base Distribu ted Research Network (DRN). Information will not be obtained from individuals who do not give us permis sion to track them for future research in these databases. Permission to follow a participant is voluntary. T hey will be able to decline giving this information and still participate in the study. 6.12.1 The URCC NCORP Research B ase DRN enables investigators to collaborate with each other in the use of electronic health data, while also safeguarding protected healt h information and proprietary data. It supports both single- and multisite research programs. The Netw ork's querying capabilities reduce the need to share confidential or pr oprietary data by enabling auth orized researchers to send queries to collaborators holding data (i.e., data partners). In some cases, queries can take the form of computer programs that a data partner can execute on a preexisting datas et. The data partner can return the query result, typically aggregated (count) data, rather than the data itself. This form of remote querying reduces legal, regulatory, privacy, proprietary, and technical barriers associated with data sharing for research. This form of querying also provides added protection for resear ch participants. The network seeks to build strong and trusted collaborations to support the research that will lead to improved health for millions of people around the world. 6.12.2 The data will be collect ed in a web-based; encrypted electronic REDCap YOCAS Insurance Information form created by URCC NCORP Research Base. The REDCap system is a secure, web-based application that is flexible enough and has an intuitive interface for users to enter data and real time validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of data entry. NCORP site study staff will meet with each participant in a pri vate and secure setting to fill o ut this form. The staff member will confirm that the subject has consented to giving this information by ch ecking the consent form signed by the subject. Only participants that c onsent to giving this informat ion will fill out a REDCap electronic Insurance Information form. The form must be completely filled out during this session with the subject. The study staff will NOT be allowed to save this information in any other form, whether paper or electronic, etc. to be uploaded later. Once the form is comple te the sites will no longer have access to it. Each REDCap form has a unique ID# for tracking purposes. It wil l be sent directly to University of Rochester's server in a local d ata center. The database is secu red behind a firewall. Only the PI, Lead coordinator of this study, URCC Research Base IT analyst, and the REDCap Administrator will have access to the database. There will also be limited access for t wo Research Base staff members who will be auditing this information. Once all data for the study have be en collected, the file will be transferred to a URCC NCORP DRN secured database separate from the study databas e. At this point only the data custodian (PI of the study), th e Lead Coordinator, and Lead URC C IT staff member will have access to it. 6.12.3 The information collected will allow us to be able to follow the participant's progress concerning their cancer or any new cancers that may arise for up to a 30 year pe riod post their study completion. In order to allow us access to future medical claims it is necessary to collect social security numbers along with Insurance ID information. 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 21 of 43 6.12.4 All study personnel must follow the NCORP Clinical Tri al site specific policy on Collection of Social Security and Insurance ID numbers. This Policy should cover pr ivacy regulations regarding the collection and transmission of Social security numbers and Insu rance ID information. Each NCI NCORP community affiliate site should ha ve a Privacy Policy and an official who will work with the URCC NCORP Research Base. Study sites must document that staff members have read and will follow their local policy. This information must be retained with study reg ulatory files for URCC NCORP auditing purposes. 6.12.5 Any breach must be reported promptly, within 5 calendar days, to the Research Base (Libby Nagalski and Ann_Colasurdo@urmc.rochester.edu) and Study PI (Dr. Mustian). They in turn will notify the URMC Privacy officer and Security official. They may be required to complete follow-up information regarding exactly what the breach was and what steps were taken to prevent further breaches. A breach of privacy must be reported to the University of Rochester IRB as well as the NCORP site's IRB. 6.12.6 The disclosure of social security numbers, Medicaid a nd Medicare and Insurance ID numbers by potential subjects is optional. Potential participants can still take pa rt in this study if they decide not to disclose this information. 6.13 Procedure Overview: Participants in all three groups will complete a battery of a ssessments including questionnaires, a weekly diary, a 6 minute walk test, a handgri p dynamometer test, actigraphy monitoring, and a fasting blood draw. Within the i nformed consent process, the c oordinator or other study personnel will explain to the participants that there will be five assessment periods. These assessments are completed at: 1) baseline, 2) mid-intervention, 3) post-interventi on, 4) 3 months after post-inte rvention, and 5) 6 months after post-intervention. Reminder phone calls will be made to participants regarding stu dy appointments, wearing the actigraphs, and completing questionnaires. Permission will be obtained to leav e messages; however, coordinators must make every effort to speak with the study participant for these calls to b e considered complete. Documentation of permission to leave a message should be record ed in coordinator notes. Speci al arrangements are made to retrieve study materials via courier on a case by case basis via each NCORP community if necessary. Each assessment will include 1) questionnaires on sleep (ISI, P SQI, MEQ-SA), mood (POMS), anxiety (STAI), depression IT-F ), cognitive problems (FACIT-COG), exercise (Godin), symptoms (Symptom Inventory), sleep medicatio ns and stimulant use (medication and CAM Use forms), and quality of life (FACIT), 2) a daily diary for asses sing sleep patterns and specific symptoms, 3) one week of actigraphy 4) physical f unction tests (6-minute walk an d handgrip tests), 5) and a fasting blood draw. The actigraphs are small, water-resistant devices; one is worn around the wrist for 7 consecutive days to gather data on sleep and circadian rhythm. The o ther is worn on the waist for the same 7 consecutive days to determine physical activity. Participants will complete their questionnaires at t he time of their assessments or at home. 6.14 Requesting Actigraphs, Blood Draw Kits and Other Study Material s: Study initiation materials will be shipped to the NCORP after the entire cohort is registered. The se materials are comprised of 1) the coordinator's kit (including equipment for conducting the 6-minute walk test and handgrip test), 2) the video recorder, 3) actigraphs, 4) yoga kits, and 5) blood suppli es. The study supplies will b e shipped from the Research Base via FedEx for delivery within 2-3 business days. 6.15 Baseline Assessments: Baseline assessments will occur on Study Days -7 to -1, or du ring study week 1. The coordinator will charge and initialize the actigraphs. The act igraphs should be initialized no earlier than the Wednesday prior to baseline week to ensure adequate data storage. The coordinator will also instruct all participants on how to put each actigraph on and give them writ ten instructions. An actigraph manual along with videos and training sessions are provided for coordinators by t he Research Base. The coordinator will reinforce with the participant to wear the ir actigraphs for 7 consecutive days and to begin filling out their daily diaries on day -7. Only NCORP site staff w ho have completed the URCC YOCA S\u00a9\u00ae study actigraphy training can instruct participants on how to wear them and give them to participants. All participants will be asked t o complete on study data and cl inical information forms as well as a series of questionnaires to evaluate insomn ia, their emotional state, and their physical health. The questionnaires will take 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 22 of 43 approximately 35 minutes to compl ete and participants are asked to complete them as close to the end of the baseline week as possible. Tr eatment notes including all cance r-related treatment should be submitted with this assessment. A 6 minute walk and handgrip test will be conducte d to measure strength, and a fasting (minimum of 8 hours) blood draw of approximately 3 tablespoons, will be com pleted to assess inflammation. Coordinators will call participants to remind them to wear the actigraphs and com plete study assessments on the Thursday or Friday prior to the start of the base line assessment. At the end of the baseline week, a second call is made to remind participants to complete study assessments and to inform them o f their study randomization assignment. Alternatively, these reminders can be made in person at the baseline assessment visit. Study coordinators are to inform participants of their study randomization after fitness testing, fasting blood draw and case report forms have been completed. Only NCORP site staff who have completed the URCC Research Base training on functional assessment and blood dra w and processing are allowed to perform these assessments and process the blood specimens. 6.16 Intervention: Participants will begin the intervention immediately after ba seline assessments are complete. Participant adherence will be monitored by attendance records, daily diaries, and actigraphy. 6.16.1 Participants in the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and health education groups will pa rtake in the intervention t wice a week for 75 minutes over a 4 week period (study days 0-27 or study w eeks 2-5). 6.16.2 Participants in the CBT-I group will complete one sessio n a week for 90 minutes over an 8 week period (study days 0-55 or study weeks 2-9). 6.17 Mid-Point Assessment: Half-way through the intervention, participants will again complete study questionnaires (as detailed in section 6.13 above) as well as the 6 minute wal k and handgrip tests, fasting blood draw, 7 more consecutive days of wearing the actigraphs, and continue record ing in their daily diaries. The coordinator will call and remind the participants to wear their actigraphs for 7 consecutive days, to contin ue filling out their daily diaries, and to complete all study assessments. 6.17.1 For participants in the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and health education groups, t he mid-point assessment will be done during study days 7-13 or study week 3. 6.17.2 For participants in the CBT-I group, the mid-point assessment w ill be done during study days 21-27 or study week 5. 6.18 Post-Intervention: At the end of the intervention period, participants will comple te all study procedures as outlined above and stop entering data in their daily diaries af ter this assessment. The coordinator will call participants and remind them to wear the actigraphs, complete forms and diaries, and to complete all study assessments. 6.18.1 For participants in the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and health education groups, t he post assessment will be done during study days 21-27 or study week 5. 6.18.2 For participants in the CBT-I group, the post assessment will b e done during study days 49-55 or study week 9. 6.19 3-Month Post Intervention Follow Up: At this assessment, participants will again be asked to fill out questionnaires, complete a 6 minute walk and a handgrip test, a fasting blood draw, 7 consecutive days wearing the actigraphs, and filling out daily diaries for that time. T he coordinator will complete a scheduling and reminder call during the week prior to the follow-up visit. 6.19.1 For participants in the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and health education groups, t he 3-month post assessment will be done during study week 17. 6.19.2 For participants in the CBT-I group, the 3-month post assessmen t will be done during study week 21. 6.20 6-Month Post Intervention Follow Up: At this assessment, participants will again be asked to fill out questionnaires, complete a 6 minute walk, and a handgrip test, a fasting blood draw, 7 consecutive days wearing the actigraphs, and filling out daily diaries for that time. A dditionally, participants will complete a feedback form 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 23 of 43 and a 15-minute qualitative exit interview at the end of the 6- month post-intervention assessment period. All participants will be debriefed a nd the 3 study arms will be explained. The coordinator co mpletes a scheduling and reminder call during the week prior to the follow-up visit. 6.20.1 For participants in the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and health education groups, t he 6-month post assessment will be given during study week 29. 6.20.2 For participants in the CBT-I group, the 6-month post assessmen t will be given during study week 33. 6.21 Management of actigraphy: Actigraphy will be handled by the PEAK Laboratory at the Rese arch Base. 6.21.1 Each NCORP site will be responsible for designating some one on the research staff to be responsible for receiving the actigraphs and an alternate person to cover in ca se of vacation or illness. The staff member will verify identification numb ers on the actigraphs and log al l equipment onto the Investigational Device Accountability Record. This form will be used to track actigra phs arriving from the URCC, actigraphs given to participants, actigraphs returned from participants, a nd actigraphs returned to the URCC. Recording the identification c odes on the devices as assigned t o each participant will ensure that the same actigraphs are used for each participant. 6.21.2 When the NCORP site notifies the Research Base that the entire cohort has been registered, the actigraphs will be shipped from URCC fully charged. The coordinator will recharge them and initialize each actigraph. The actigraphs should be initialized no earlier tha n the Wednesday prior to baseline week to ensure adequate data storage The coordinator will instruct each participant on how to put th e actigraphs on, care for them and charge them. The coordinator will also g ive them written instructions developed by URCC, and successfully used in prio r studies to aid in proper data acquisition. 6.21.3 The Research Base PEAK Lab staff will ensure that the ac tigraphs are in good working order before shipping the units to the NCORP site. The NCORP site staff wil l distribute the actigraphs, actigraph chargers and actigraph instructions to each participant at the baseline assessment. The participants must have the actigraphs and must be able to start wearing them when they get up on the morning of Study Day -7 (Sunday morning). Participants will wear a wrist actigraph 24 hours a day for 7 consecutive days, and a second actigraph will be worn around the participant's waist 24 hours a day for the same 7 consecutive days. The coordinator will instruct the participant when to re move the actigraphs (the following Sunday). Both will be worn during the baseline assessment, the mid-point assessment, the post-intervention assessment, the 3-month post intervention follow -up, and the 6- month post intervention follow up. As the actigraphs are water resistant but not waterproof, participants will take the actigra phs off only when they shower, bathe, swim or do anything where the actigraphs would b e submerged in water. Otherwise, they should wear them as described above during each assessment peri od. 6.21.3.1 NCORP research staff w ill explain to participants the procedures for wearing the actigraphs and reinforce the importance of wearing them through the night. 6.21.3.2 All study participants will keep both actigraphs from baseline throughout study week 5 (this is the post-intervention assessment period for yoga and health edu cation groups, and mid-point for CBT-I group). All actigraphs will then need to be retriev ed from participants during study week 6. All data needs to be dow nloaded and sent to URCC. DO NOT RE-INITIALIZE ANY ACTIGRAPHS UNTIL CONFIRMATION IS RECEIVED THAT URCC HAS THE DATA. Once it is confirmed the data has been properly downloaded the actigraphs can be reinitialized. The coordinator will need to make arrangements within 3 busin ess days following baseline assessments to meet one participant in each arm and download th eir actigraph data to be submitted to URCC for the data quality audit at the beginning of the cohort and return the actigraphs to the 3 participants prior to the mid-point assessm ent. 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 24 of 43 The coordinator will need to re-initialize and return the acti graphs to participants in the CBT-I group only, during study week 8, so they can wear them for post -intervention assessments during study week 9. The coordinator will need to re-initialize and return the actigraphs to participants in all three study groups for both the 3-month and 6-month follow-up assessments. Actigraphs need to be sent to participants during the week prior to the scheduled 3- and 6-month follow-ups. When not wearing the actigraphs, participants are instructed to plug them into the wall chargers and keep them charging. Every a ttempt will be made to send the same actigraphs to participants for all assessments. 6.21.3.3 The NCORP research staf f will download the data from the actigraphs within 3-4 business days of receiving them from the partic ipants and upload them to the URCC NCORP Research Base secure website. DO NOT RE-INITIALIZE ANY ACTIGRAPHS UNTIL CONF IRMATION IS RECEIVED THAT URCC HAS THE DATA. The electronic data file will be saved in a privacy-secure electronic file a t the Research Base and PEAK Hu man Performance Laboratory. In the event the supply of actig raphs is ample, the Research Ba se may allow the NCORP to keep devices between the post-in tervention and the 2 follow-up assessments. This will be determined on a case by case basis. 6.21.4 Assessment Training and Adherence to Assessment Protocols: The University of Rochester PEAK Human Performance Laboratory, a URMC CTSI Clinical Research Cor e Lab, provides services to aid investigators in effectively impl ementing behavioral interventi ons and assessing clinical outcomes that involve physical activity and function. The PEAK Lab has been instrumental in standardizing the procedures for the collection of actigraphy, handgrip, and 6-mi nute walk data to ensure adherence to protocol. The staff is also adep t at training NCORP site staff to properly collect, process, store and ship blood for NCORP studies. Study Chair, Dr. Karen Mustian, directs the PEAK Lab which has been closely involved in URCC Research Base studies since its incept ion. PEAK Lab staff have designed support materials and trained NC ORP site staff to administer th e behavioral interventions and outcome assessments for the URCC studies involving yoga (U3905), EXCAP intervention (UCCO08106) and many other URCC Research Base studies. The PEAK lab staff are adept at managing and analyzing actigraph data and all functiona l data for NCORP Research Base studies as well as biological samples. The URCC also requires each NCORP staff member to go through t raining programs which includes, overall protocol information, f unctional and clinical assessmen ts, actigraphy, blood collection and processing, videotaping, proper forms completion, and quality c ontrol checks. Refresher training will be provided as needed. Adherence will be monitored throughout the study as the inform ation is received at the URCC. We have specifically implemented an extra quality assurance check after baseline, as well as having the NCORPs videotape the 3 rd intervention class to monitor in structor adherence to the spec ific program they are to teach. 6.22 Participant Reimbursement: Participants will receive a $50.00 reimbursement for their ti me and effort to complete each study assessment for a total reimbursement of $25 0.00. Participants are only reimbursed for the study assessments they actually complete. Each NCORP will be r esponsible for dispersing the reimbursements to study participants using methods appropriate for their sites. Each NCORP will invoice the URCC Research Base monthly for reimbursement expenses. URCC will only reimburse f or the cash value of $50.00 per assessment; no gift card or other fees will be reimbursed if NCORPs choose to use methods of reimbursement that incur extra fees in lieu of cash. Send invoices to: Christine Bryce, 265 Crittenden Blvd., Box 420658, Adverse Events: 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 25 of 43 6.23.1 Risks from participating in this research: YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae may result in muscle soreness , strains, and/or joint pain. CBT-I may result in temporary increases in daytime fatigue, sle epiness, and memory and concentration difficulties. Participants may feel upset or worried when filling out the questionnaires. Drawing blood may cause pain and bruising at the site where the blood is taken, and sometimes, may cause people to feel light-headed or even to faint. Rarely, yo u might get an infection at the site of the needle stick. 6.23.2 Adverse events will be reported using the URCC Adverse E vent form. This form can be found on the URCC NCORP Research Base website. 6.23.3 Submit written adverse event reports in one of the follo wing ways: (1) PDF by email: Cathleen_lesniewski@urmc.rochester.edu (2) By mail: Cathleen Lesniewski URCC NCORP Saunders Research Building 265 Crittenden Blvd CU 420658 Rochester, description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized until March 31, 2018 for AE reporting. CTCAE version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting beginning April 1, 2018. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloa ded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 6.23.5 An unexpected adverse event is defined as any adverse experience, the specif icity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk information described in section 6 .23.1. Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Grade 5 Unexpected and Expected Unexpected Expected Unexpected Expected Unexpected Expected Une xpected Expected with hospital- hospital- ization Unrelated Unlikely Not Required Not Required Not Required Not Required Not Required Not Required Not Required Not Required 10 Calendar Days Not Required 10 Calendar Days 10 Calendar Days Possible Probable Definite Not Required 10 Calendar Days Not Required Not Required 10 Calendar Days 10 Calendar Days Not Required Not Required 24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days 10 Calendar Days 24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days 10 Calendar Days Hospitalization is defined as initial hospitalization or prolon gation of hospitalization for 24 hours, due to adverse event. 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 26 of 43 6.23.6 A serious event refers to any event in which the outcome results in any of the following: death, a life- threatening adverse experience , inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or a congenit al anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in d eath, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate me dical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical interventio n to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 6.23.7 Adverse events should be reported to the local IRB as pe r its requirements. 6.24 Data Safety and Monitoring: 6.24.1 All adverse events requiring reporting will be submitted to Cathy Lesniewski as described above. Adverse events that are serious AND unexpected AND related will be forwarded to the study chair and the URCC Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) chair immediately upon receipt at URCC. Additional information may be requested upon their review. 6.24.2 All adverse events reported to URCC are entered into a p rotocol-specific spreadsh eet. Adverse event rates are monitored utilizing the sp readsheet. If a serious adverse event is being reported frequently, the study chair will conduct a detailed review. The DSMC chair will be n otified and will determine if further action is required. 6.24.3 The URCC Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review study progress and cumulative reports of adverse events at annual meetings. An overall assessment of accrual and adverse events will enable the committee members to assess whether significant bene fits or risks are occurring that would warrant study closure. 6.24.4 The URCC will notify the NCORPs immediately of any serious safety concerns identified by the DSMC. DSMC reports will be available for download on the Research Bas e website. ____________________________________________ 7.0 Patient Reported and Functional Measures ____________________________________________ 7.1 The On Study Data/Participant Record and Clinical Record Information forms are used to record demographic and clinical infor mation. Diagnostic, treatment an d other clinical information will be abstracted from the participant's chart a nd recorded on these forms. Thes e data will be used for descriptive purposes, to aid in participant monitoring, for m oderator analyses and for exploratory analyses. 7.2 The two Medication and CAM Usage forms will track the participant's use of prescription and non- prescription sleep and stimulant medication, as well as any other sleep and stimulant aids used during each assessment conducted during the study. These forms will also specifically ask participants to report the use of any CAM modalities for any reason. 7.3 Insomnia and Sleep Assessments: 7.3.1 Insomnia will be measured by the Insomni a Severity Index (ISI), which is a well-validated self-report measure of insomnia.98-100 The measure consists of seven questions on a 5-point Likert Sc ale with a total score ranging from 0-28. Reliability and validity of this measure have been established.98-100 Total score will be used. 7.3.2 Sleep quality will be assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PS QI),101,102 a commonly used, 24-item psychometrically sound measure scored for both global s everity and subscale scores. The PSQI will assess sleep initiation and ma intenance problems and possi ble etiologic factors (e.g., pain, 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 27 of 43 nightmares, and hot flashes). Tot al score will be used. This me asure takes less than 5 minutes to complete. 7.3.3 Number of hours of sleep and intended sleep period will be calculated from the Daily Diary. For each day of the study period when sleep is assessed, participants wi ll indicate time to bed at night and time arose in the morning. 7.3.4 Sleep Chronotype will be measured by the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire Self-Assessment (MEQ-SA).103 This is a 19-item self-report instrument that characterizes t he sleep chronotype of an individual. 7.4 Objective Insomnia Symptoms will be measured via actigraphy . Participants will have their sleep-wake exposure monitored through the use of a wrist-worn actigraphy-based data logger, the Actigraph GT3X manufactured by ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL. The Actigraph G T3X features a variable epoch length that can be set, and has 16MB of non-volatile memory. \"Non-volatile\" mea ns that even if the battery, which can log 21 days of runtime before needing to be recharged, becomes exhausted, the data remain intact. The motion data will be analyzed using the ActiLife Analysis Software. The program uses a validated sleep algorithm to provide an assessment of sleep by delineati ng the \"in bed\" and \"out of bed \" portions of the day. The software and algorithms calculate the percent of sleep during these two portions of the day. The actigraphy, in conjunction with the sleep/wake diaries, can be used t o approximate the timing of both daytime and nighttime sleep. While daily sleep diaries are a common method used to examine patterns of sleep and wakefulness, we will in ternally validate the at-home monitoring by comparing actigraphy data collected during baseline and follow-up to the daily questionnaires. This measurement strategy allows for an assess ment of sleep problems (sleep latency, WASO, sleep efficiency, daytime sleep) which is free from either subj ective or observer bias and requires minimal subject compliance, allows for the detection of periods of wakefulness as brief as 30 seconds in duration. 7.5 Circadian Activity Rhythm will be assessed using actigraphy . The exact actigraphs used to objectively assess sleep described in section 7.4 will be used. A two-oscillator cosinor model (12 and 24 hours) will be calculated using nonlinear regression methods on the log (activity counts). This model was found to fit the data for cancer survivors (Study 3) better than a single-oscillator model. Mesor (overall), Amplitude, and Acrophase for the 12- and 24-hour cycles will be calculated. 7.6 Cardiopulmonary Function (aerobic capacity) will be assessed using the 6-Minute Walk Te st, which is a sub- maximal measurement using a 6- minute walk protocol. A recent s ystematic review has concluded that this method possesses excellent measureme nt properties, was better tolerated, and was more reflective of activities of daily living than any o ther walk test in use.99 Participants are directed to a specific area designated for walking. Participants walk for a total of 6-minutes and cover as much di stance as they can during this time. The walk test is optimally performed in a flat, well lit area that allows for a minimum of 100 feet of walking before the participant needs to make a tu rning motion. For example, the t est may be conducted in a hallway (walking back and forth) or a larger room that allows for a circular/square w alking pattern. Upon completion of the test, the total distance walked (in feet), exercise heart rate (in beats per mi nute), and exercise rate of perceived exertion (using the ACSM revised rating of exertion scale) are recorded. This test was easy to implement, and well received in a busy clinical setting in the pilot study of the proposed exerci se intervention. The total distance walked in six minutes can be used to estimate gross VO 2 (oxygen consumption).87 Gross VO 2 = Resting VO 2 + Exercise (or net) VO 2. The formula used to estimate gross VO 2 is VO 2 (mL *kg-1 * min-1) = [0.1 mL *kg-1 * meter-1 * S (m * min-1)] + [1.8 mL * kg-1 * meter-1 * S (m * min-1) * G] + 3.5 mL *kg-1 * min-1 Where S is speed in meters per minute and G is the percent grad e expressed as a fraction. 87 7.7 Muscular Function (strength) will be assessed using The Handgrip Dynamometer Tes t, which is a grip strength test used to assess the maximal voluntary contraction generated by the arm muscles. The test is administered with the participant standing in anatomical position, the elbow join t angle will be held cons tant at 180 degrees. Trials 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 28 of 43 will be performed in an alterna ting bilateral sequence for a total of six attempts (three with each arm). A fourth test will be performed if any of the values vary by >3 Kg. The average score of the three trials will be used for right and left limbs to calculate static strength. The surgica lly involved arm(s) for breast cancer participants will be noted for data analysis.87 This test was also easy to implement and well received in the clinic in the pilot study of the proposed intervention. 7.8 Because many symptoms including cancer-related fatigue (CRF), depression, anxiety, mood disruption, cognitive problems and impaired QOL are often present with insomnia, measures of CRF, depression, anxiety, mood, sleep and cognitive problems have been carefully selected to minimize potential confounding and enable assessment of possible confounds between these concepts. 7.8.1 General Symptomatology will be measured with the Symptom Inventory (SI), a list of 20 symptoms modified from measures created at M.D. Anderson and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centers.104 It is a series of uniscales where the severity of each symptom is ind icated by filling in the appropriate circle on an 11-point scale, anchored by 0 = \"Not Present\" and 10 = \"As Bad as You Can Imagine.\" An additional eight questions assess the degree that the symptoms interfere w ith the participant's quality of life, with 0 = \"Did not interfere\" and 10 = \"Interfered completely.\" Ten additional questions assess the degree to which the participant uses speci fic mind-body techniques to man age symptoms. Medical oncologists at our Cancer Center use this measure as part of clinical care, and we have used it in numerous studies. It will serve as a concurrent self-report measure of symptoms that will be used in exploratory analyses. 7.8.2 Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) will be assessed subjectively via the revised Brief Fatigue Inv entory (BFI),105,106 which is a 9-item, patient-report instrument with established reliability and validity that we have used in previous studies.92 The BFI allows for the rapid assessment of fatigue level and its interference with daily activiti es in cancer patients, and identifies those patients with severe fatigue. The reliability and validity of the BFI were demonstrated in a stud y of 305 cancer patients and 290 community-dwelling adults. An inte rnal consistency coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) of 0.96 was demonstrated when the BFI was administered to 305 patients with cancer.93 This measure was used in the previously mentioned pilot study of the proposed exercise inter vention. 7.8.3 CRF will also be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chron ic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Subscale (FACIT-F). The FACIT-F subscale is a 13 item scale that asks questions directly related to the impact of CRF on daily activities.90 It was developed by Cella and his group through extensive int erviews with oncology professionals and patient s experiencing symptoms of ca ncer, and it has been validated in a series of studies. The basic meas ure has shown very good test/retest reliability as well as validity.94,95 It has become one of the most comm only used measures in oncology, and we have used this scale in our previous studies including the pilot study designed for this pr otocol. 7.8.4 In addition, CRF will be assessed subjectively vi a the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory (MFSI).107 The MFSI is a multidimensional 30-item fatigue scale developed specifically for documenting CRF. In addition to a fatigue tot al score, the instrument incl udes subscales for assessing general, physical, emotional, mental and vigor domains of fatigue. The self-report instrument was psychometrically validated am ong a sample of 304 cancer patients and has been shown to have good fit via confirmatory factor analy sis, reliability and validity.96-98 7.8.5 Depressive Symptoms will be measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) . The CES-D56 is a 20-item depression scale developed and validated for use with a variety of populations. It is in a format similar to that of the Beck Dep ression Inventory, but with less emphasis on physical symptoms of depression that may be confounded with dis ease symptoms or treatment side effects. It has been shown to r eliably and validly measure dep ression in cancer populations,102 and we have successfully used this measure in previous studies. 7.8.6 Anxiety will be measured using the Spielberger State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). In order to reduce the overall patient burden, we will use only the state portion of the questionnaire. This one-page, self- 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 29 of 43 administered questionnaire consists of 20 short statements whic h people may use to describe their feelings. Participants are asked to indicate the degree to whi ch they generally experience each particular feeling, ranging from 1 = \"Not at all\" to 4 = \"Very much so\" at that time. It is one of the most widely- used assessments of anxiety. Int ernal consistency coefficients > 0.90 have been shown, along with test/retest reliability coeffici ents > 0.70. Concurrent, const ruct, convergent and divergent validity have also been demonstrated.103,104 We have successfully implemented this measure in previous stu dies. 7.8.7 General Mood will be assessed using the short form of the Profile of Mood States (POMS). The POMS consists of 30 adjectives in 6 subscales (e.g., anxiety, depres sion), which subjects rate on a five-point scale with = \"Not at all\" a nd \"5\" = \"Extremely\" to describe their moods over the past week. The POMS has been used extensively i n research with cancer patients and has demonstrated reliability and validity.105,106 7.8.8 Cognitive Problems will be assessed using the Func tional Assessment of Chronic The FACIT-Cog subscale is 50-item scale that asks questions directly related to cognition.90 It was developed by Cella and his group through extensive interviews with oncology professi onals and patients experiencin g symptoms of cancer, and it has been validated in a series of studies. The basic measure has shown very good test/retest reliability as well as validity.90,94,95 It has become one of the most c ommonly used measures in oncol ogy, and we have used this instrument in our previous studies (e.g., the pilot study designed for this protocol). 7.8.9 Quality of Life (QOL) will be assessed subjectively via the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT; FACT-F). The FACIT; FACT-F is a 27-item QOL scale developed specifically for use in cancer clinical trials.90 It was developed by Cella and his group through extensive int erviews with oncology professionals and patient s experiencing symptoms of ca ncer, and it has been validated in a series of studies of 542 cancer patients. The basic measure has shown very good tes t/retest reliability as well as validity.90,94,95 Along with a total score repre senting QOL, there are psychome trically validated subscales of physical, functiona l, social, and cognitive-emotional status. It is one of the most commonly used measures in oncology, and we have used this instrument in our previous studies, including the pilot study designed for this protocol. 7.8.10 Pain will be assessed via the Brief Pai n Inventory (BPI) and the Vis ual Analog Scale (VAS) to evaluate the severity and quality of pain experienced. The Brief Pain I nventory (BPI) has become one of the most widely used measurement tools for assessing clinical pain.109 The BPI allows patients to rate the severity of their pain and the degree to which their pain interferes wit h common dimensions of feeling and function. Initially developed to assess pain related to cancer, the BPI has been shown to be an appropriate measure for pain caused by a wide range of clinical conditions. The BPI has been used in hundreds of studies. In some ways, the BPI is a \"legacy\" instrument\u2014a self- report measure that has, over time, become a standard for the asse ssment of pain and its impact. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that measures joint pain across a contin uum of pictures of faces with values from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). The questi on associated with the VAS reads as follows: ''Please score the inten sity of the pain you feel in your peripheral joints (knee, wrist, fingers/toes, elbow, shoulder, etc .), excluding spine/back pain and pain at the operated area.'' 7.9 Physical Exercise/Activity will be assessed subjectively usi ng the Godin Leisure Time Exe rcise Questionnaire and a Daily Diary . 7.9.1 The amount of leisure time spent in physical activity wil l be assessed using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin).110 The Godin consists of two questions designed to assess the fre quency within a typical 7 day week of mild, moderate, and strenuous exercise performed for a duration of at least 15 minutes during a participant's free time. The measure is ea sily administered and brief, with a retest coefficient of .62, a concurrent coefficient of .32 and an obje ctive validity coefficient of .56 compared with CALTRAC accelerometry, estimated VO 2 max and body composition (via hydrostatic weight).111 The Godin has also been used successfully in populations of adu lt cancer patients.112-115 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 30 of 43 7.9.2 The Daily Diary is designed to track compliance and parti cipation in the exercise intervention and additional daily activities. The participant will be asked to take 1-2 minutes and complete the journal each morning upon wakening and each evening immediately prior t o sleeping. This daily diary was used in the piloted version of the proposed study, and participants completed the forms without any problems. 7.9.3 A s an objective measure of physical activity, a GT3X+ actigraph will be worn around the waist. The GT3X+ actigraph provides calculated energy expenditure values for Active Energy Expenditure (AEE) in kilocalorie s and total energy expenditure in Metabolic Equivalents per Time (METs) in kilocalories/m in/kg. The GT3X+ actigraph features a variable sample rate which can be set between non-volat ile memory. \"Non-volatile\" me ans that even if the battery, which can log 31 days of data, become s exhausted, the data rema in intact. The GT3X+ actigraph AEE Algorithm is based on validation studies, co pies of which are available upon request. Software supplied by the manufacturer will be used to determine bouts of activity during each assessment period. 7.10 Participant Feedback regarding their views on the experimental treatment they receiv ed will be assessed via completion of a feedback questionnaire by all participants and open-ended qualitative inte rviews at the conclusion of the study. The information in the feedback questionnaire and interviews will allow us, for future studies, to obtain information needed to alter aspects of the interventions with which participants were displeased and to determine participants' reactions to the intervention. 8.0 Blood be assessed in the blood at all five assessment time points. A fasting blood draw (minimum of 8 hours) will be perf ormed on all participants at all five assessment time points. The standard URCC NCORP Research Base blood colle ction protocol will be used. Six tubes of blood (approximately 50ml) will be collected including: two red top tubes for serum, two purple top EDTA- heparin tubes (1 for plasma a nd 1 for DNA) and 2 Paxgene tubes for RNA. Cytokines will be analyzed and any remaining blood samples including serum, plasma and whole blood for DNA and RNA analyses will be used by Dr. Mustian and members of her research team for additional exp loratory analyses. The remaining blood samples are not banked or made available for use by investigators outsi de of Dr. Mustian's research team. All NCORPs will handle all human biological materials and disposal of biohazard waste in accordance with biosafety level II guidelines at their respective institutions for blood collectio n, handling, disposal, sto rage and shipping. All NCORP personnel handling human biological materials and laborat ories used by NCORPs must have received appropriate biosafety certifications and meet routine inspectio n guidelines according to their facility guidelines. 8.1.1 All requisitions, blood tubes, microfuge tubes, freezer b oxes, pipettes, and labels for blood draws are provided by the Research Base in the form of barcoded and pre-labeled patient kits. All patient kits are study specific. DO NOT MIX REQUISITIONS, BLOOD T UBES, MICROFUGE TUBES OR PIPETTES ACROSS PATIENT BLOOD DRAW KITS EVEN IN THE SAME STUDY BECAUSE THE BARCODES AND LABELS ARE KIT SPECIFIC. DO NOT MIX THE FREEZER BOXES, LA BELS OR EXTRA SUPPLIES PROVIDED ACROSS STUDIES EVEN URCC RESEARCH BASE STUDIES, BECAUSE THEY ARE STUDY SPECIFIC. All coordinators will fill in the appropriate patient informati on on the requisition form in each kit when it is assigned to the patient. Every time a patient blood draw is performed a separate new patient kit is used 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 31 of 43 and assigned to the study partic ipant. Each NCORP is responsible for designating an individual that is certified and a lab or facility that meets the biosafety level II criteria to perform the blood draws and to handle, dispose, store and ship t he blood samples appropriately . The individual designated to perform the blood draws, handle, d ispose, store and ship the samples must participate in the training provided by the URCC NCORP Research Base, previ ously described in section 6.0, and be approved by the study PI (or PI's designee) prior to any blood collection at each NCORP site . 8.1.2 Serum will be extracted from the two red top tubes for e stimation Plasma will be extracted from one of the purple to p EDTA-heparin tubes for the serum and plasma, the tubes will first sit upright for 30 minutes at room temperature after blood collection. Second, the tubes will then be put into a centrif uge (note temp) and spun for 15 minutes at 1600 x g. After 15 minutes, there should be a clear separation of the serum or plasma (yell owish liquid on top) from the other cells. If this is not evident, then centrifuge for 15 additional minutes. The upper layer of serum (red top tubes) and plasma (purple top tube) is then gently aliquotted into the 2.0 ml microfuge tubes provided in each URCC NCORP patient blood draw kit. Serum from the red top bloo d tubes is to be placed into the pre- labeled pink microfuge tubes. Pla sma from the purple top tube is to be placed in the pre-labeled purple microfuge tubes. All microfuge tubes are then placed in the pre-labeled freezer boxes provided by the URCC Research Base and the freezer box is then placed in either a -20 C or a -80 C degree freezer (-80 C is preferred if available but not required) for storage until s hipped to assessed using Multiplex and ELISA methods a s appropriate. The remaining serum and plasma will be stored, as part of study participation, for use in future research by Dr. Mustian, t he study PI, and her research team at the URCC Research Base. 8.1.3 One purple top EDTA-heparin tube and two Paxgene tubes w ill be prepared and stored for future DNA and RNA extraction. The EDTA-he parin tube will be rocked 10 ti mes and then placed upright in a -20 C freezer for a minimum of 24 hour s. After 24 hours, the EDTA-he parin tube can then be transferred to a - 80 C freezer if available. The t wo Paxgene tubes will be rocke d 10 times, stored upright for minimum of 2 hours and a maximum of 24 hour s at room temp and then placed upright in a -20 C freezer for a minimum of 72 hours. After 72 hours, the Paxgene tubes can be transferred to a -80 C freezer if available. After the tubes have been frozen upright for their designated time above, they can then be placed on their side in the pre-labeled freezer boxes provided by the Research Base. (Storage in a -80 C freezer after 4 days is preferred if available but not required .) The whole blood in these tubes will be stored, as part of study partic ipation, for use in future resea rch by Dr. Mustian, the study PI, and her research team at the URCC. See the Blood Procedures Manual fou nd on the URCC Research Base website for complete blood processing instructions. 8.1.4 Shipping Su pplies to NCORPs and In ventory Tracking: Upon notification of the Research Base that a NCORP has registered a cohort fo r this study, a starter blood d rawing package and an initial supply of barcoded and pre-labeled blood draw kits will be shipped to the NCORP for distribution and use. Each NCORP site will be responsib le for designating someone on the research staff to be responsible for receiving the blood draw suppli es and kits. The staff member w ill verify that the shipment contains the correct number of supplies and kits and that the supplies and k its are in good condition. The identification numbers need to be verified for accuracy and recorded. The Investigational Device Accountability Record (DARF) will be used to track supplies and kits arriving from the Research Base, kits given to participants, sam ples stored, and samples shipped to the URCC NCORP Research Base. 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 32 of 43 8.1.5 Shipping Frozen Blood Samples to URCC Research Base: PRIOR TO SHIPPING SAMPLES, YOU MUST CONTACT THE URCC RESEARCH B ASE TO MAKEARRANGEMENTS TO RECEIVE YOUR SAMPLES. Call: Libby Nagalski 585-275-1364 Ship Samples To: ATTN: Libby Nagalski University of Rochester Medical Center Wilmot Cancer Institute, PEAK Laboratory (B-5035) 601 Elmwood Avenue, Box 704 Rochester, NY 14642 Samples are to be stored in URCC-supplied freezer boxes as out lined in the Blood Procedures Manual found on the URCC Research Base we bsite. Samples must be stored at a minimum of -20C, but preferably at -80C. Samples cannot be stored at -20C for longe r than 3 months. The NCORPs are responsible for shipping all samples to the Res earch Base within 3 months of sample collection. All samples must be shipped priority overnight and frozen on dry ice. Each NCORP is responsible for adhering to Federal Guidelines for shipping bio safety level II biohazards as well as URCC NCORP Research Base biosafety level II guidelines (outlined in the blood procedures manual provided), their NCORP institutional biosafety level II guidelines and the shipping company guidelines when packing and shipping the frozen blood samples to the Research B ase. 9.0 Design Consideration 9.1 Decision to conduct a trial comparing YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae to a gold standard insomnia treatment for the general population: We considered proposing a dism antling trial to determine whic h component of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is the most active. However, after muc h deliberation with colleagues, we believe the study comparing YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae to CBT-I has significantly greater potential to impact standard of care for insomnia among cancer survivors and, potentially, other populations. 9.2 Changes From Our Prior Yoga RCT: In this study, we extend our pr evious findings by comparing YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae to CBT-I (a gold-standard treatment for insomnia in the general population) and a health education intervention controlling for time and attenti on. We also blind study partic ipants to control for demand characteristics and bias. We provide participants with \"Y oga Kits,\" including mat, strap, Subject DVD, and manual to facilitate home practice during the intervention period and sustained practice during the following 6 months and assess the durability of intervention benef its at 3 and 6 months following completion of the interventions. We add assessments of cardiopulmonary function, muscular function and inflammation to test the direct effects of yoga on these outcomes and their mediational effects on insomnia throug h YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae. 9.3 Length of Intervention\u2014Why 4 and 8 Weeks: We used a 4-week intervention period for YOCAS\u00a9\u00aein our first study for two main reasons: 1) 4 weeks was the minimum length, in the published literature, shown to be efficacious for improving sleep problems, and 2) for practical purposes, we felt this length was reasonable for implementation in community se ttings via private oncology pract ices and would have good adherence. We have chosen to retain the 4-week period for YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae as it was previously shown to be effective and to compare it to CBT-I delivered over the gold-standard 8-week period. We are a ware that new versions of brief and electronic CBT-I are currently being evaluate d for efficacy among survivor s, but we feel it is important to use the form of CBT-I shown to be effective among groups of cancer survivors in published literature. 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 33 of 43 9.4 Length of Follow-Up\u2014Why 3 and 6 Months: We chose 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments because they will provide good information on the short and longer-term benefits of the yoga intervention, and, while clearly reflective of long-term influence, a 12-month follow-up is not practical within the time period of this R01-funded project. 9.5 Decision to Conduct a Multicenter Study: It is not possible to recru it the necessary 720 cancer survivors at a single location within the 5-year time period of an R01. We ha ve considerable experience successfully conducting large, multicenter phase III RCTs through the Research Base with our NCORP affiliates\u2014accrual of the required 720 participants in this environment is possible, and our previous studies demonstrate that it is highly probable they will be successfully accrued within the timeframe of this R01-funded project. __________________________________________ 10.0 Data Handling and Statistical Considerations ___________________________________________ 10.1 Sample Size and Statistical Power: Allowing for 30% of participants who may not provide complete data (as in our prior study), we will need to enroll a total of 720 partici pants to have 504 fully evaluable participants (168 evaluable in each of the three study arms). Fully evaluable pa rticipants is defined as having completed the On Study/ Participant Interview and the Clinical Record Informatio n (baseline), the ISI, PSQI, Daily Diaries, and actigraphy (baseline and post-in tervention assessments) for pri mary and secondary endpoints. With 504 fully evaluable participants, will have 80% power at a 0.025 signific ance level to test our hypotheses. We will use a significance level of 0.025 to control for type I error because two hypotheses (i.e., 1 inferiority [yoga vs. CBT-I] and 1 superiority [yoga vs. health education]) will be tested i n our primary aim. [Note: We will reimburse survivors for participating in this study in an effort to decrease attrition and data loss.] 10.2 Power for Primary Aim 1: The two primary hypotheses to be tested in our primary aim inc lude: (1) YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae will be as effective as CBT-I, and (2) YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae will be more effective than the health education control. 10.2.1 Power for Hypothesis 1: Based on baseline data from our previous phase III RCT examin ing the effects of yoga on insomnia and data from Savard58 and Morin,116 we assume an ISI standard deviation of 4.6. Since half a standard deviati on is commonly accepted as appropriate for estimating a clinically important change, we regard a difference of 2.3 (half a standard deviation) between YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and CBT-I as nontrivial. Following the same methods as Garland and colleagu es,117 we set the non-inferiority margin to 1.15 (half of the 2.3 difference). We will test the null hypothesis that the difference in mean change on the ISI between YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and CBT-I is greater than 1.15; that is, YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is inferior to CBT-I.118,119 Rejection of the null hypothesis means that YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is as effective ( non-inferior) as CBT-I. Using ANCOVA to estimate differences in mean change between YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and CBT-I, a correlation of 0.576 (from our prior study), and a sample of 168 subjects per group, we will have sufficient (80%) power to detect non-inferiority using a margin of 1.15 at p = 0.025. 10.2.2 Power for Hypothesis 2: Using ANCOVA to estimate differences in mean change between YO CAS \u00a9\u00ae and health education, a correla tion of 0.576 (from our prior study), and a sample size of 168 evaluable subjects per group, we will have sufficient power to detect dif ferences on the ISI of at least 1.3, 1.5 and 1.6 (all larger than our 1.15 non-inferiority margin) at 80%, 9 0%, and 95% power, respectively.118,119 (Note: It is already well-established that CBT-I is superior to general health education and equal time and attention, as such an overall test of group differences is not necessary or sufficient\u2014the differences in question are specifically betw een yoga and CBT-I and yoga and h ealth education and require two separate hypotheses be tested.) 10.3 Study Timeline: Based on our prior experience conducting studies in the URCC Research Base, we anticipate that study start-up activities (e.g., obtaining NCI and IRB app rovals, presenting the protocol and training NCORP site staff, setting up databases, registration and randomization, ordering supplies and making kits and manuals, sending kits and other study supp lies to NCORPs) will take appr oximately 6 months. Screening and accruals will 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 34 of 43 begin during the 7th month and continue t hrough month 54. The final 6 months will be used to retrieve any remaining data, supplies and equipment from NCORPs, to conduct final audits of the data, to conduct analyses, to write abstracts and papers, and to present findings at meetings . We expect it will take between 24 and 47 months to accrue the 720 participan ts needed for this study. 10.4 Representation of Women and Minorities: None of the eligibility criteria for the study involve gender or ethnicity. Past enrollment in our NCORP studies has closely pa ralleled the gender and ethnic composition of the available population. See secti on 12.0 on Gender and Minoritie s. 10.5 The same protocols and procedures for data quality and control that we have used for our previous URCC Research Base protocols will be used for this study. Data will be entered on scannable forms (Teleform) and electronically sent to a Microsoft Access database. After scan ning, data are audited visually for errors, and then the entire database is re-audited. MPLus, R and SAS statistical packages will be used for the analyses. 10.6 Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests will be performed at the two-tailed 5% lev el of significance. Likewise, 95% confidence intervals will be c onstructed for estimation of effects (e.g., difference in mean CRF, aerobic capacity, strength and QOL between the active treatment group a nd the control group). Data will be analyzed on an \"intent-to-treat\" basis; participant data will be included i n the treatment group to wh ich the participant was randomized, regardless of any subsequent changes to the treatme nt (treatment in this study is considered the study intervention, i.e., exercise intervention, CBT-I, or Health edu cation standard care). 10.6.1 Assumptions. The assumptions underlying all statistical analyses will be t horoughly checked using appropriate graphical a nd numerical methods.109,110 For the ANCOVA analyses, the assumptions are bivariate normality of the Pre- and Post-treatment responses wi th common covariance matrices, after correction for the model fixed effects. Bivariate normality wi ll be assessed with Roysten's procedure, and equality of the covariance matrices will be assessed with t he Box M test. The ISI data from our previous trial did not show violations of these assumptions. If distributions are markedly skewed, we will apply transformations as appropriate. The biomarker data will likely require a logarithmic transformation, as is common practice. If heteroscedistic var iance is found in the residuals for any of the models, a Box-Cox transformation will be applied to the data. As a last resort, appropriate nonparametric methods will be attempted, e.g. Wilcoxon rank sum test on chang e scores.111,112 If outliers or influential data are detected, the accuracy of the data will be investigate d. If no errors are found, analyses may be repeated after removing these cases to evaluate their impact on the results. However, the final analyses will include these data points. 10.6.2 Missing Values. Every effort will be made to facilitate participants' complet ion of questionnaires and provision of actigraphy and physical function data, and blood.120 In the event of missing data, the reasons for missing data will be recorded and tabulated according to treatment group. Some missing data are inevitable. Under the missing at random (MAR) assumption, we will use multiple imputation to obtain unbiased estimates of key paramete rs. If data are suspected to be missing not at random (MNAR), a sensitivity analysis using the methods of Liublinska and Rubin (2014) 121 will be run to determine the impact on results. 112 If the estimates are similar to the ones obtained from the simpler analysis of only complete cases, we will report th e complete-case analysis resul ts. 112 10.7 Statistical Analyses: 10.7.1 Primary Aim 1 Analyses: To determine if YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae is as effective as CBT-I and more effective than health education for improving insomnia (ISI total), two separate analyses will be performed, each aimed at estimating the differe nce between arms in mean change from baseline with associated confidence intervals. The comparison of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae to CBT-I is a non-inferiority hypothesis with a one- sided alpha, and the comparison of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae to the health educat ion control is a traditional null hypothesis of no difference with a two-sided alpha.118,119 See the Statistical Power section for more details. A linear mixed effects ANCOVA will be used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in mean changes from baseline for the two groups (Hypothesis 1 = YOCAS \u00a9\u00ae vs. CBT-I; 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 35 of 43 Hypothesis 2 = YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae vs. health education). The response will be post-treatment ISI total score. The model fixed effects will be Group and Baseline ISI. NCORP S ite will be included as a random effect. The REML method will be used to es timate the random effect vari ance components. If the NCORP Site variance component is significant , the fixed effects will be te sted using F tests with the Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom adjustment.122 If the NCORP Site variance component is not statistically sig nificant, we will use ordinary least-squares estimation and F-Tests for t esting the fixed effects. The mean difference between groups with associated 95% confidence interv als will be estimated using the appropriate contrasts. An alpha l evel of 0.025 will be used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Additional follow-up analyses will include NCORP site and cohor t as covariates and examine possible interactions. 10.7.2 Secondary Aim 2 Analyses: To examine if YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is effective for improving objective symptoms of insomnia (sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, slee p duration, and daytime napping via actigraphy) and global sleep quality impairment (PSQI total) compared to CBT-I and a health education control, we will use the same methods as for Primary Aim 1 with no multiple comparison adjustments.123 10.7.3 Secondary Aim 3 Analyses: To examine if YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae and CBT-I are effective for maintaining improvements in insomnia at 3 and 6 months post-intervention compared to a health education control, we will perform a longitudinal analysis124 using the ISI total score at all five time points as the response. The fixed effects will be Time, Group (all three in this analysis), and Time by Group interaction. Within-subject random effects will initially be m odeled assuming an unstructured covariance matrix, but will be simplified after inspection of the estimate d covariance structure (e.g., compound symmetry). If NCORP Site variance in the primary analysis is s tatistically significant at the 0.05 level, it will be included as an additiona l random effect, independent of the within-subject random effects. REML estimation will be used. Fixed effects will be tested using F tests with the Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom adjustment.122 The impact of group on the time trajectory of insomnia will b e tested via the Time*Group interaction. Least-s quares means for each Time and Group combination will be plotted to visualize and understand the time trajectories of insomnia. Di fferences in time trajectories between the three groups will be tested with no adjustments for multiple co mparisons.123 10.7.4 Exploratory Mechanistic Aim 4 Analyses: To explore whether YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is effective for improving circadian activity rhythms (24 and 12 hour amplitudes and acrop hases via actigraphy), physical multiplexes) compared to CBT-I and a health education control, we will use the same analytical methods as for Primary Aim 1 to assess changes in the estimated paramet ers of the two-oscillator (12 and 24 hours) cosinor model97 and the Hill function model.125 These parameters include Mesor (M), Amplitude (A1) and oscillator . Estimates will be from the log-transformed activity counts using nonlinear regression. Degree of rhythmic ity will be assessed with the Fi sher-transformed model multiple correlation. We will also fit si ngle-oscillator models (24-hou r Mesor, Amplitude, and Acrophase) for comparison with other published studies.20,24 The time participants woke up in the morning and fell asleep in the evening will be extracted from weekly diaries. We will apply the same methods as for physical function and inflammation outcomes; inflammatory biomarkers wil l be log-transformed as needed. 10.7.5 Exploratory Mechanistic Aim 5 Analyses: To explore whether changes in physical function, circadian rhythm and inflammation mediate the effect of YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae on insomnia , we will use separate mediation analyses performed on pre-post ISI change sc ores (CS) and the above outcomes as potential mediators. Path analysis will be used, where the intervention affects CS, the intervention affects the mediator, and the mediator, in turn, affects the CS. We wi ll also use structural equation modeling. Mediation will be assessed via indirect effect estimation using bootstrap-based 95% confidence intervals. 126,127 Latent variables will be introduced into the model for multip le measures of a common entity (e.g., cytokines for inflammation). If multiple measure s are weakly correlated, we will split them 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 36 of 43 into separate measurement terms (e.g., pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines). MPlus software will be used, with full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimatio n. Under MAR, this provides less biased estimates due to missing data. 10.7.6 Additional Analyses: The following analyses will be i nterpreted cautiously for hypo thesis generation. We will use the same analytical methods described for Aims 2, 3 , 4 and 5 to explore the interrelationships between insomnia, SQI, sleep chronotype, CRF, depression, anxie ty, mood, hormone therapy, pain, cognitive problems, symptoms, e xercise, cardiopulmonary function, strength, inflammation, stimulant and sleep medication use. 10.7.7 Interim Analyses: No interim analyses of efficacy data from the trial are plann ed. _________________________ 11.0 Records To Be Kept _________________________ Measure Screening Baseline Mid-Point InterventionPost- Intervention 3 Month Follow-Up6 Month Follow-Up Eligibility and Consent DSM-V Insomnia Severity Index Screening On-Study Data/Participant Interview Clinical Record Information Cancer Treatment Notes Sleep Medication and CAM Use Stimulant Medication and CAM Use Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) Sleep Quality (PSQI) Sleep Chronotype (MEQ-SA) Actigraphy 6-Minute Walk Test Handgrip Dynamometer Test Fasting Blood Draw (Blood Requisition Form) Symptom Inventory (SI) Fatigue Interference (BFI) Cancer-Related Fatigue (FACIT-F) Cancer-Related Fatigue (MFSI) Mood Cognitive Problems (FACIT-COG) Quality of Life (FACIT) Pain (BPI) Pain (VAS) Leisure Time Physical Activity (GODIN) Daily Diary Feedback Questionnaire Qualitative Exit Interview 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 37 of 43 Call Log 1 Attendance Log 1A second phone call is made at the end of baseline. 11.1 All written materials will be kept confidential, locked in the file room at the Research Base that is accessible only by Research Base personnel, and identified by study ID numbers.

An estimate of minority particip ation from our U RCC Research Ba se accruals between 3/1/ 2011 and 2/29/2012 for three large phase III clinical trials in o ur target population of cancer survivors indicates minority participation will be approximately 13%. O ur research group found 142 of the 1078 (13 .17%) patients accrued t o these clinical trials categorized themselves as being from an ethnic or racial minori ty. One of these studies was Dr. Mustian's recently completed phase III clinical trial testing the effects of an ex ercise intervention on cancer-related fatigue. Dr. Mustian has recently had s uccess increasing minority accrua ls on her local single-site studies in Rochester, NY by implementing strategies suggested by the Recruitment and Ret ention Core of the URMC CTSI. Male cancer patients have been underrepresented in yoga trials for cancer patients. In a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2012 , Buffart et al. found 13 publis hed trials of yoga for cancer patients. 118 Twelve of these trials focused specifically on breast cancer; 11 recruite d only female patients, and one reported that 5% of their sample was male. The thirteenth trial was a small (N=38) pilot trial focused on lymphomas; 39% of this sample was male.53 In an analysis of population-based data, similarly, only 3.5% of men in the United States reported practicing yoga, c ompared to 10% of women.119 To ensure sufficient representation of male cancer patients in the current trial, the following steps will be taken. Research coordinators at the NCORP sites will be instructed to screen specifically for and oversample male cancer patients in their recruitm ent efforts, to account for the potential reticence of men to engage in a group- based yoga intervention. Wher e possible, coordinators conducting recruitment will be gender matched to the patients they are recruiting (i.e., male coordinators recruiting male patients, female coor dinators recruiting female patients). Recruitment and study materials, including study ma nuals include both ma le and female models. For this study, our goal is to increase minority recruitment to 18% (a 5% increase). We will work closely with our minority-based NCORPs to ensure they have the resources and hel p they need to open this study and to effectively recruit participants and conduct the study. We will also work closely with our non-minority-based NCORPs to support increased minority accrua ls at all of our affiliated NC ORPs. We will provide each NCORP with culturally 14040 Protocol 6-7-18 Amd5 clean Page 38 of 43 sensitive recruitment materials. Lastly, our IRB and all of ou r NCORP IRBs mandate that all study materials and measures meet federal guidelines and can be easily understood b y individuals without a high school degree. In addition, we will meet quarter ly with Research Base staff an d annually with all NCORPs; at face-to-face meetings and on audits where we will discuss minority recruitme nt levels and make adjustments in our recruitment strategies as needed in an earnest effort to increase minority recruitment for this trial.
