The IIP administers the federal Vaccines for Children program in Idaho. Vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) are supplied at no cost, through federal or state funding, for eligible Idaho children ages 0 through 18 years. Providers must be enrolled with the IIP to receive the vaccine. Any healthcare provider who serves children 0 through 18 years of age, wants to provide childhood vaccines through the federal VFC program, has a current medical license in good standing, and has independent prescription writing authority for vaccines may enroll with the IIP. Healthcare providers who want to enroll can begin by contacting the IIP by phone at 208-334-5931 or email at [IIP@dhw.idaho.gov](mailto:IIP@dhw.idaho.gov?subject=Apply%20to%20Enroll%20in%20the%20VFC%20Program). New provider enrollment involves the following steps: - Completing the new provider enrollment packet - Acquiring vaccine storage and handling equipment that meets program requirements - Assigning staff members (primary and back-up) to be responsible for vaccine management and training - Completing an on-site enrollment site visit with IIP staff Vaccines for Children (VFC) enrollment information The Idaho Vaccines for Children (VFC) program provides vaccines to participating healthcare providers for children from birth through 18 years of age. Patients eligible for vaccines supplied by the IIP All children 0 through 18 years of age who are eligible for the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, the Idaho Immunization Assessment, and federal funds for designated targeted populations may receive vaccines supplied by the IIP. Patient eligibility must be screened and documented for every child at each immunization visit. Vaccines for children eligibility All providers must screen every child at each immunization visit for VFC eligibility. VFC eligibility does not have to be verified by the provider, but it must be documented. All children 0 through 18 years of age who meet one of the following criteria are considered VFC eligible: - Is Native American or Alaskan Native - Is enrolled in Medicaid - Has no health insurance - Is underinsured. Underinsured children have private health insurance but the coverage does not include vaccines; the coverage includes only selected vaccines (the child is VFC eligible for non-covered vaccines); or, children whose insurance caps vaccine coverage at a certain amount (once the coverage amount is reached, these children are categorized as underinsured). Underinsured children are eligible to receive VFC vaccine only through a federally qualified health center (FQHC), rural health clinic (RHC), or deputized public health district. Private providers must inform parents of underinsured children that free vaccine may be available at a FQHC, RHC, or local public health district. State-supplied eligibility All children 0 through 18 years of age whose custodial parent or legal guardian lives in Idaho, and who are not eligible for the federal Vaccines for Children program, are eligible for state-supplied vaccines funded through the Idaho Immunization Assessment. Other eligibility Other populations deemed eligible by the department's immunization program based on available funding and resources.
