Meningococcal disease is a serious illness caused by a bacterium. It can cause meningitis, which is an infection of the brain and spinal cord, and it can also cause blood infections. The infection can cause death or lifelong disability. About 375 people get the disease each year , and about 10 to 15 out of 100 people infected with meningococcal disease die. Of those who survive, up to one out of five have per manent disabilities, such as deafness, brain damage , loss of limbs, or seizures. A person with meningococcal disease may become seriously ill very quickly. Antibiotics can treat meningococcal infections, but often can't be given soon enough to help. Anyon e can get meningococcal disease, but it is most common in infants less than 1 year of age. Teens are less likely to be infected than infants, but disease levels increase in adolescence starting around age 11, and peak around age 19 years. What are the symp toms of meningitis? Symptoms can include : High fever Headache Very stiff neck Confusion Nausea Sensitivity to light Vomiting Exhaustion If a person has a blood disease, a rash may also develop. Early symptoms can easily be mistaken for influenza or other illnesses . Contact your health care provider immediately if you have symptoms. How does meningococcal disease spread? Meningococcal disease is spread by contact with secretions (saliva or spit ) from the nose and throat. Kissing, sharing silverware, drinking directly from the same container, sharing a cigarette or lipstick, coughing, and having close social contact (living in the same household) are examples of how this disease spreads. How can you prevent meningococcal disease? Vaccination is on e of the most effective ways to prevent meningococcal disease. Other ways for everyone to prevent infection include washing your hands often and avoiding sharing silverware, drinking containers, lipstick, and smoking materials. What are the options for meningococcal vaccine? Meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY) is highly effective at protecting against four strains of the meningococcal bacteria. Three strains are common in the United States and the fourth strain protects travelers to certain countries where the disease is more common. The MenACWY vaccine does not contain the meningococcal B strain that is more commonly found in infants and may cause some cases in adolescents. There is an additional vaccine, meningococcal B vaccine (MenB), that contains the B strain. If your clinic does not carry the MenB vaccine, you can ask them to order it for you, or to refer you to another clinic that has the vaccine. Talk to your health care provider about getting this additional vaccine. MENINGOCOCCAL VACCIN E: WHY PRETEENS AND TEENS SHOULD GET IT (11/2017) Page 2 of 2 Who should get the meningococcal vaccines?
