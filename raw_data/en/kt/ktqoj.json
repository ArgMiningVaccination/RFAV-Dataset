I began taking it, berberine, and a vitamin K complex after a heart attack as an alternative to being on Plavix back in 2016. (I've just doubled my dose to 4000 FU based on my reading here.) I'm taking Esbriet and Metformin (based on a preclinical study of mice and IPF), plus a number of supplements I have read might help, e.g., Rosavin, AMPK activator, and have just added serrapeptase and DHEA. But I'm all in on supplements and have been for decades (partly because of past abuse of my body (e.g., smoking), heart disease, and not the best nutritional habits), and keep evolving my program. I've also been taking Ayurvedic formulas for IPF, recommended by a doctor in India, but I'm focusing more on IPF research now. So I also take a number of anti-aging targeted supplements such as NAD+, and various Extension's formulas called Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer, Senolytic Activator, Gerroprotect AI, and more (the ingredients are on their site). And well, a host of others for general health which I hope might help. I'm 5 years into my IPF and had been stable at a moderate level for almost 2 years, but just took a sudden step downward, just when I started to feel a little comfortable about it. That's a lot of mixed information, but I hope it's useful to someone. "}
