Introduction The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) an d Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence -Based Practice Work Group (EBPWG) was established and first chartered in 2004, with a mission to advise the Health Executive Committee \"... on the use of clinical and epidemiological evidence to improve the health of th e population ...\" across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Military Health System (MHS), by facilitating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the VA and DoD populations .(1) Development and update of VA/DoD CPGs is funded by VA Evidence Based Practice, Office of Q uality and Patient Safety. The system -wide goal of evidence -based CPGs is to improve patient health and well- being. In December 2014 , the VA and DoD published a CPG for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (2014 VA/DoD COPD CPG), which was based on evidence reviewed through February 2014 . Since the release of that CPG, a growing body of research has expanded the evidence base and understanding of COPD . Consequently, a recommendation to update the 2014 VA/DoD COPD CPG was initiated in 2019 . This CPG provide s an evidence -based framework for evaluat ing and manag ing care for patients with COPD toward improv ing clinical outcomes. S uccessful implementation of this CPG will: Assess the patient's condition and collaborate with the patient, family, and caregivers to determine optimal management of patient care Emphasiz e the use of patient -centered care using individual risk factors and event history Minimiz e preventable complications and morbidity Optimiz e individual health outcomes and quality of life (QoL) II. Background A. Description of COPD COPD comprises a combination of chronic and slowly progressive respiratory disorders including emphysema, small airway disease , and chronic bronchitis. Clinically, COPD can be described as persistent resp iratory symptoms with significant airflow limitation, as measured by reduced maximal expiratory flow during forced exhalation.( 2) A key characteristic of COPD is the incomplete reversibility of airway obstruction, which may differ from other conditions such as asthma, in which airway obstruction is commonly reversible with bronchodilators. (2) B. Pathology While COPD is primarily a respiratory condition, it is associated with systemic inflammation. (3, 4) COPD results from an inflammatory process in the distal airways possibly linked to oxidative stress. (2) Pathologic changes occur in the large and sm all airways and in the terminal respiratory unit. These distal airways narrow in response to the inflammation and scarring. There are a number of additional pathophysiological changes as well, including hyperinflation and impaired gas exchanges. (2) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 6 of 94 C. Etiology In most cases, COPD results from prolonged exposure to lung irritants. In the United States (U.S.), exposure to cigarette smoke is the key causal factor in the development of COPD. (5, 6) Smoking has been causally linked to COPD; more than 80% of cases of COPD in the U.S. may have developed as a result o f smoking. (6) Smoking is also a risk factor for COPD complications, such as pneumonia. (6) Smoking cessation results in a signi ficant slowing of the rate of decline in lung function, but typically no substantial reversal of the established damage.( 2) Smoking is more common among military personnel than among civilians, especially in those who are younger and enlisted. (6) The VA spends billions of dollars a y ear to treat patients with COPD; a majority of th ese cases are associated with smoking. (6) Othe r causes of COPD includ e particulates and noxious inhaled substances. Other risk factors for COPD include household, environmental and occupational air pollution, secondhand smoke, history of childhood respiratory infections, and genetic predisposition. (2) More unusual risk factors of COPD include alpha -1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency and other rare genetic conditions. (2) D. Epidemiology and Impact of COPD COPD has a considerable public health impact on the general population of the U .S. and on the hea lth of Veterans and Service Members in particular. It is the third leading cause of death globally. (7) Global prevalence of moderate to severe COPD has been estimated to be as high as 10% of the population. (8) As of May 2020, there were more than 16.4 million adults in the U .S. diagnosed with COPD. (9-11) In addition, COPD is thought to be frequently under -recognized and under -diagnosed. Therefore, the number of Ame ricans with COPD may be even higher. (9) Since the 1960s, mortality rates due to COPD have climbed. Recently, there has been a shift in the population a ffected by COPD, and the mortality rate in women has surpassed that of men. Women have smaller lungs , and estrogen may play a role in worsening lung disease, making women more vulnerable than men to lung damage from cigarette smoke and other pollutants. (12) The condition does not affect all ethnicities equally; non -Hispanic, white males are affected more than other ethnic groups. (9) Due to the chronic and progressive nature of the condition and the long duration of exposure to tobacco smoke, the prevalence of COPD increases with age. The condition also has important healthcare resource implications. The U.S. spent approximately $49.9 billion on COPD, predominantly on direct healthcare expenditures. (13) In 2010, for adults over the age of 25, there were an estimated 699,000 hospitalizations for which COPD was the first diagnosis. However, there was a decline in the overall age -adjusted prevalence of those who have had COPD diagnoses, perhaps related to the overall population decrease in smoking. (11) Veterans are at higher risk of COPD than those in the general U.S. population. According to Anderson et al. (2020), COPD affects 12.7 million individuals in the U.S., including nearly 1.25 million U.S. V eterans which is about 25% of the V eteran population. (14) Within the VA population, patients with COPD have significantly higher all -cause and respiratory -related healthcare utilization than patients without COPD. (15) Because some of their activities may pose a risk of environmental and occupational exposure, patients in the military are under particular scrutiny from their healthcare providers to look for COPD. Additionally, the physical activity associated with military life may uncover symptoms of COPD earlier among people in the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 7 of 94 military . Patients in the military or Veterans may therefore show signs of COPD earlier in their lives than their civilian counterparts. (16) E. Progress in Management of COPD As previously mentioned , d espite the high number of people in the U .S. that have been diagnosed with COPD, the age -adjusted prevalence has declined since 1999, possibly due to overall population decrease in smoking rates. (11) Furthermore, there has been an increase in the understanding of the disease and effective management methods. COPD is now recognized as a significant public health problem, and a greater amount of research is being conducted on the underlying mechanisms and effectiveness of various treatment methods. (17) Pharmacologic therapy is improving with better understanding of the disease process and novel drugs. Additionally , non- pharmacologic therapy , such as pulmonary rehabilitation , is becoming increasingly recognized as an effective option. (17) While these treatment methods may not be appropriate for all patients, they allow providers to intervene early with numerous effective treatment options. The increasing amount of COPD research leading to further understanding of the disease and effective management strategies allows patients and providers alike to be optimistic that they can manage COPD effectively to provide patients with an improved QoL. III. Scope of this Guideline This CPG is based on published clinical evidence and related information available through F ebruary 2020. It is intended to provide general guidance on best evidence -based practices (see Appendix A for additional information on the evidence review methodology). This CPG is not intended to serve as a standard of care. A. Guideline Audience This CPG is intended for use by VA and DoD primary care providers (PCPs) including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, social workers, and others involved in the healthcare team caring for patients with COPD . Additionally, this CPG is intended for community -based clinicians involved in the care of Service Members, beneficiaries, or Veterans with COPD . B. Guideline Population The patient population of interest for this CPG is patients with COPD who are eligible for outpatient care in the VA or DoD healthcare delivery systems and those who receiv e outpatient care from community -based clinicians. The population includes Veterans as well as deployed and non -deployed active duty Service Members and their dependents. Regardless of care setting, any patient in the VA and DoD healthcare system should have access to this CPG's recommended interventions. IV. Highlighted Features of this Guideline A. Highlights in this Guideline Update The pace of clinical research on COPD continues to grow every year with more than 30,000 publications since the release of the last guideline update in 2014. (18) This research includes new practice -changing insights into the pathophysiology, phenotypes, progression, diagnosis, and treatment that were incorporated into these guidelines. In particular, the Work Group would like to highlight recommendations VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 8 of 94 advocating for increasing support to patients through self -management programs and telehealth, as well as changes in the recommendations for medication management that ref lect increasing understanding of the various phenotypes of the disease. This research also continues to strengthen evidence for recommendations that have not changed, such as the importance of smoking cessation. Finally, the CPG highlights the areas for wh ich more research is needed, including key aspects of care such as the use of antibiot ics during COPD exacerbations. The methodology used in developing this CPG has also been updated since the prior versions and reflects stricter standards than previous versions, which are detailed in Appendix A . The result is a refined CPG that includes the most evidence -based aspects in COPD care. In order to accomplish this, the scope of the CPG has been narrowed to focus on outpatient care in the primary care setting; it does not address the specialty care of advanced COPD or the inpatient care of COPD exacerbations. The 2021 VA/DoD COPD CPG used stricter methodology than previous iterations. For additional information on GRADE or CPG meth odology, see Appendix A. B. Components of the Guideline The 2021 VA/DoD COPD CPG is the third update to this CPG. It provides cl inical practice recommendations for the care of patients with COPD (see Recommendations ). In addition, t he Algorithm incorporates the recommendations in the context of the flow of patient care. This CPG also includes Research Priorities , which identif y areas needing additional research. To accompany this CPG, the Work Group also developed toolkit materials for providers and patients, including a provider summary, patient summary, and pocket c ard. These can be found at https://www.healthquality.va.gov/index.asp. V. Guideline Development Team The VA Evidence Based Practice, Office of Quality and Patient Safety, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S. Army Medical Comm and, identified the following four clinicians to serve as Champions (i.e., leaders ) of th is CPG's Work Group: Drs. Amir Sharafkhaneh, MD, PhD and W illiam C. (Claibe ) Yarbrough, MD , MS from the VA and MAJ Nathan L . Boyer, MD, FCCS and LTC Brian M . Cohee, MD , FACP from the DoD. The Work Group comprised individuals with the following areas of expertise: pulmonology, critical care, sleep medicine, primary care medicine, emergency medicine, physical therapy, respiratory therapy, pharmacology, family medicine, internal medicine, social work, and nutrition . See Table 1 for a list of Work Group members. This CPG Work Group, led by the Champions, was tasked with: Determining the scope of the CPG Crafting clinically re levant key questions (KQs) to guide the systematic evidence review Identifying discussion topics for the patient focus group and considering the patient perspective Providing direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic evidence review and the assessment of the level and quality of evidence Developing evidence -based clinical practice recommendations, including determining the strength and category of each recommendation VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 9 of 94 The Lewin Team, including The Lewin Group, ECRI, Sigma Health Cons ulting, Duty First Consulting, and Anja li Jain Research & Consulting, was contracted by the VA to help develop this CPG.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 10 of 94 VI. Summary of Guideline Development Method ology The methodology used in developing this CPG follows the Guideline for Guidelines , an internal document of the VA and DoD EBPWG updated in January 2019 that outlines procedures for developing and submitting VA/DoD CPGs.( 19) The Guideline for Guidelines is available at http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp . This CPG also aligns with the National Academy of Medicine's (NAM) principles of trustworthy CPG s (e.g., explanation of evidence quality and strength, the management of potential conflicts of interest [ COI], inter disciplinary stakeholder involvement, use of system atic review, and external review). (20) Appendix A provides a detailed desc ription of the CPG development methodology . A. Evidence Quality and Recommendation Str ength The Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to craft each recommendation and determine its strength . Per the GRADE approach , recommendations must be evidence -based and cannot be made based on expert opinion alone. The GRADE approach uses the following four domains to inform the strength of each recommendation (see Grading Recommendations ):(21) Confidence in the quality of the evidence Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Patient values and preferences Other considerations , as appropriate, e.g.: Resource use Equity Acceptability Feasibility Subgr oup considerations Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative st rength of each recommendation (Strong or Weak ). The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework above, which incorporates the four domains. (22) A Strong recommendation generally indicates High or Moderate confidence in the quality of the available evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility). Based on the GRADE approach, if the Work Group believes all, or almost all, informed people would recommend for or against an intervention, they develop a Strong recommendation. (22) If, after assessing these domains, the Work Group believes that most informed people would recommend the intervention, but a substantial number would not, i t generally assigns a Weak designation to the recomme ndation.( 22) Nevertheless, a Weak recommendation is clinically important and evidence -based. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 11 of 94 In some instances , there is insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation for or against a particular therapy , preventive measure, or other intervention. For example, the systematic evidence review may have found little or no relevant evidence, inconclusive evidence, or conflicting evidence for the intervention . The manner in which this is expressed in the CPG may vary. In such instances , the Work Group may include among its set of recommendations an insufficient evidence statement for a n intervention that may be in common practic e even though it is not supported by clinical evidence, and particularly if there may be other risks of continuing to use it (e.g., high opportunity cost, misallocation of resources). In other cases, the Work Group may decide to not include this type of statement about an intervention . For example, the Work Group may remain silent where there is an absence of evidence for a rarely used intervention. In other cases , an intervention may have a favorable balance of benefits and harms but may be a standard of care for which no recent evidence has been generated. Using these elements, the Work Group determines the strength and direction of each recommendation and formulates the recommendation with the general corresponding text (see Table 2 ). Table 2. Strength and Direction of Recommendations and General Corresponding Text Recommendation Strength and Direction General Corresponding Text Strong for We recommend ... Weak for We suggest ... Neither for nor against There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against ... Weak against We suggest against ... Strong against We recommend against ... It is important to note that a recommendation's strength (i.e., Strong versus Weak ) is distinct from its clinical importance (e.g., a Weak recommendation is evidence -based and still important to clinical care). The strength of each recommendation is shown in the Recommendations section . This CPG's use of GRADE reflects a more rigorous application of the methodology than previous iterations. For instance, the determination of the strength of the recommendation is more directly linked to the confidence in the quality of the evidence on outcomes that are critical to clinical decision -making. The confidence in the quality o f the evidence is assessed using an objective, systematic approach that is independent of the clinical topic of interest. Therefore, recommendations on topics for which it may be inherently more difficult to design and conduct rigorous studies (e.g., RCTs) are typically supported by lower quality evidence and, in turn, Weak recommendations. Recommendations on topics for which rigorous studies can be designed and conducted may more often be Strong recommendations. Per GRADE, if the quality of evidence differs across the relevant critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation. (23, 24) This stricter standard provides a consistent approach to determining recommendation strengths. For additional information on GRADE or CPG methodology, see Appendix A. B. Categorization of 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations Evidence -based CPGs should be current . Except for an original version of a new CPG , this typically requires revision of a CPG's previous versions based on new evidence or as scheduled , subject to time- based expirations.( 25) For example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has a process for VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 12 of 94 monitoring the emergence of new evidence that could prompt an update of its recommendations, and it aims to review each topic at least every five years for either an update or reaffirmation .(18) Recommendation categories were used to track how the previous CPG's recommendations could be reconciled . These categories and their corresponding definitions are similar to those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE , Engl and).(26, 27) Table 3 lists these categories, which are based on whether the evidence supporting a recommendation was systematically reviewed, the degree to which the previous CPG's recommendation was modified, and whethe r a previous CPG's recommendation is relevant in the updated CPG. Additional information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in Recommendation Categorization . The 2021 CPG recommendation categories can be found in Recommendations . Appendix D outlines the 2014 VA/DoD COPD CPG's recommendation c ategories . Table 3.

Abbreviation: CPG: clinical practice guidel ine C. Management of Potential or Actual Conflicts of Interest Management of COIs for the CPGs is conducted as described in the Guideline for Guidelines .(28) Further, the Guideline for Guidelines refers to details in the VHA Handbook 1004.07 Financial Relationships between VHA Health Care Professionals and Industry (November 2014, issued by the VHA National Center for Ethics in Health Care), (29) as well as to disclosure statements (i.e. , the standard disclosure form that is completed at least twice by CPG Work Group members and the guideline development team) .(28) The disclosure form inquires regarding any relevant financial and intellectual interests or other relationships with, e.g., manufacturers of commercial products, providers of commercial services, or other commercial interests. The disclosure form also inquires regarding any other relationships or activities that could be perceived to have influenced, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, a respondent's contributions to the CPG. In addition, instances of potential or actual COIs among the CPG Work Group and VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 13 of 94 the guideline development team were also subject to random web -based identification via standard electronic means (e.g., Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments and/or ProPublica). No CO Is were identified among the CPG Work Group or the guideline development team. If an instance of potential or actual COI had been reported, it would have been referred to the VA and DoD program offices and reviewed with the CPG Work Group Champions. The VA and DoD program offices and the CPG Work Group Champions would have determined whether, and if so, what, further action was appropriate (e.g., excusing Work Group members from selected relevant deliberations or removal from the Work Group). Disclosure for ms are on file with the VA Office of Quality and Patient Safety and are available upon request. D. Patient Perspective When developing a CPG, consideration should be given to patient perspectives and experiences, which often vary from those of providers .(23, 29) Focus groups can be used to help collect qualitative data on patient perspective s and experiences . VA and DoD Leadership arranged a patient focus group on February 5th, 2020, at the Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. The focus group aimed to gain insights from patients with COPD of potential relevance and incorporate these into the CPG as appropriate . Topics discussed included the patients' priorities, challenges they have experienced, information they have received regarding their care, and the impacts of their care on their lives. The patient focus group comprised a convenience sampl e of six participants ; one woman and five men. Five participants were Veterans and received care at the VA. One participant was not a Veteran or Service Member but had received healthcare within the DoD as a family member. The Work Group acknowledges this convenience sample is not representative of all patients with COPD within the VA and DoD healthcare systems and, thus, findings are not generalizable and d o not comprise evidence . For more information on the patient focus group methods and findings , see Appendix B. Patient focus group participants were provided the opportunity to review the final draft and provide additional feedback. E. External Peer Review The Work Group drafted, reviewed, and edited this CPG using an iterative process. For more information, see Drafting and Finalizing the Guideline . Once the Work Group completed a near- final draft, they identified experts from the VA and DoD healthcare systems and outside organizations to review that draft. The draft was sent to those experts for a 14-business -day review and comment period . The Work Group considered a ll feedback from the peer reviewers and modified the CPG , where justified, i n accordance with the evidence. F. Implementation This CPG and algorithm are designed to be adapted by individual healthcare providers with consideration of unique patient considerations and preferences, local needs, and resources. The algorithm serves as a tool to prompt providers to consider key decision points in the care for a patient with COPD . The Work Group submits suggested performance metrics for the VA and DoD to use when assessing the implementation of this CPG. Robust implementation is identified within VA and DoD internal implementation plans and policies. Additionally , implementation would entail wide dissemination through publication in the medical literature, online access, educational programs, and, ideally, electronic medical record programming in the form of clinical decision support tools at the point of care. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 14 of 94 VII. Approach to Care in Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense A. Patient -centered Care Guideline recommendations are intended to consider patient needs and pref erences and represent a whole/holistic health approach to care that is patient -centered, culturally appropriate, and available to people with limited literacy skills and physical, sensory, or learning disabilities. VA/DoD CPGs encourage providers to use a patient -centered, whole health/holistic health approach (i.e., individualized treatment based on patient needs, characteristics, and preferences). This approach aims to treat the particular condition while also optimizing the individual's overall health an d well -being. Regardless of the care setting, all patients should have access to individualized evidence -based care. Patient -centered care can decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in clinicians, and improve treatment adherence. (30, 31) A whole/holistic health approach ( https://www.va.gov/wholehealth/ ) empowers and equips individuals to meet their personal health and well -being goals. Good communication is essential and should be supported by evidence -based information tailored to each patient's needs. An empathetic and non -judgmental approach facilitates discus sions sensitive to gender, culture, ethnicity, and other differences. The importance of palliative care has emerged in more recent years with the goal of helping the patient and family achieve the highest QoL despite the progressive nature of COPD. Palliative care is a specialty in medicine focused on treating the symptoms, pain, and stress that accompany serious illnesses like COPD. There is some evidence that palliative care programs can reduce breathlessness and improve QoL in patients with COPD .(32) Rather than using a mortality prognosis, \"the decisi on to start palliative care should be based on the presence of symptoms refractory to conventional therapy, alongside the preferences of patients. Palliative care includes, among other elements, care planning communication, end- of-life decisions, limitation of aggressive treatments (intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and symptomatic treatment, while always considering the physical, psychosocial and spiritual aspects and preferences of patients .\"(33) Palliative care may also provide therapies to relieve the discomfort of shortness of breath or anxiety, education about lifestyle changes , and medication and disease management. (34) Regardless of disease stage or prognosis, all patients with COPD should have patient -centered, advanced care planning discussions, and shared decision making with their primary care provider. When a patient or provider identifies a psychosocial barrier, a referral to a social worker should be considered. A social worker's primary focus is to assist patients, their families , and caregivers in resolv ing psychosocial, emotional, and economic barriers to health and well- being by using a \"person in environment\" perspective. Social workers address social determinants of health and assess the patient's psychological and emotional adjustment to illness with in the context of medical diagnosis, prognosis , and treatment options. An assessment of environmental factors includes a review of the dynamics of the Veteran's support system, functional status, vocational, economic, housing, spiritual, cultural, and legal factors that influence the ability to accomplish their healthcare goals.

Shared Decision Making This CPG encourage s providers to practice shared decision making. Shared decision making was emphasized in Crossing the Quality Chasm, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now NAM) report, in 2001 .(35) Providers must be adept at presenting information to their patients regarding individual treatments, expected risks, expected outcomes, and levels and/or setti ngs of care, especially where there may be patient heterogeneity in risks and benefits. The VHA and MHS have embraced shared decision making. Providers are encouraged to use shared decision making to individualize treatment goals and plans based on patient capabilities, needs , and preferences. C. Patients with Co -occurring Condi tions Co-occurring conditions can modify the degree of risk, impact diagnosis , influence patient and provider treatment priorities and clinical decisions, and affect the overall approach to the management of COPD . Many Veterans, Service Members, and their families have one or more co-occurring conditions . Because COPD is sometimes accompanied by co-occurring conditions , it is often best to manage COPD collaboratively with other care providers. Some co -occurring conditions may require early specialist consul tation to determine any necessary changes in treatment or to establish a common understanding of how care will be coordinated. This may entail reference to other VA/DoD CPGs (e.g., for asthma,a chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea ,b hypertension,c obesity and o VIII.

Recommendations The following evidence -based clinical practice recommenda tions were made using a systematic approach considering four domains per the GRADE approach (see Summary of Guideline Development Methodology ). These domains include: confidence in the quality of the evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes (i.e., benefits and harms), patient values and preferences, and other implications (e.g., resourc e use, equity, acceptability).

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 23 of 94 A. Diagnosis and Classification Recommendation 1. We suggest post -bronchodilator spirometry to confirm clinical diagnosis of COPD. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Expiratory airflow obstruction is one of the most verifiable indicators of COPD. The expiratory flow obstruction is confirmed by presence of FEV1/FVC less than 70% or less than lower limit of normal (LLN) based upon age appropriate cut -offs in pos t-bronchodilator spirometry. The expiratory airflow obstruction is not fully reversible in COPD. (37-41) However, clinical diagnosis based on history and physical assessment alone may result in under or over diagnosis of COPD. Gershon et al. (2017) showed the use of spirometry is associated with increased medication prescriptions for COPD. (42) Although the spirometric confirmation of COPD diagnosis is important, it may delay the diagnosis and start of therapy Historically, the administration of a bronchodilator was needed to confirm that airway obstruction could not be completely reversed. (42) Post -bronchodi lator spirometry improves the accuracy of COPD diagnosis over pre -bronchodilator spirometry.( 43) Evidence suggests that a post -bronchodilator ratio of FEV1/FVC less than 70% is acceptable confirmation of the presence of COPD in older patients without a prior history of asthma. (44) However, clinicians must use caution when applying this criteria to elderly patients because FEV1/FVC less than 70% can be a normal part of aging. Relying on history of exposure, history of asthma, symptoms, and the LLN of FEV1/FVC to confirm the diagnosis may be more accurate in this specific population. (44) Using lower FEV1/FVC threshold may exclude more patients from being considered as \"obstructed\" and therefore diminish the sensitivity but increas e the specificity. Reversibility to acute inhalation of short -acting bronchodilators may vary in repeated tes ting in COPD patients. (45) The absence of acute reversibility after treatment with a bronchodilator may not predict response to long- term pharmacotherapy. Thus, revers ibility testing should not be used to gauge the potential benefits of treatment. (46-48) The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation (42, 43) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The body of evidence had some limitations. The limitations included lack of accessibility for testing specifically in the era of communicable respiratory infections and difficulty of doing spirometry among patients with more severe forms of COPD. The benefits of accurate diagnosis and early initiation of treatment slightly outweighed the harms of spirometry causing delay in treatment and exposure to communicable respiratory pathogens. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied because some may not have access to spirometry , and there is a risk of exposure when a communicable respiratory disease is present. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 24 of 94 Recommendation 2. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific clinical criteria to inform decision -making regarding advancing pharmacologic therapy for COPD . (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion This recommendation is related to advancing pharmacologic therapy in outpatients with symptomatic COPD. Multiple recent guideli nes and reviews have considered potential criteria for selecting patients for more advanced initial therapy at the time of diagnosis, in contrast to a stepwise approach to increasing therapy. (49) The Work Group examined the literature on this topic in this CPG's systematic evidence review. Based on the literature identified , the Work Group determined there is insufficient evidence to recommend any one of these criteria to inform decision -making on advancing COPD therapy. The systematic evidence review identified three efficacy trials ;(50-52) however, these did not address nor support a recommendation on this topic. No studies comparing different approaches for selecting patients for initial nor subsequent intensified therapy were identified. A potential benefit for an initial intensified approach to pharmacotherapy is also not excluded by this evidence review. Therefore, the Work Group identified this as a potential subject for future research effort s. Providers use various forms of symptom assessments for advancement of therapy . The COPD treatment algorithm (see Module A: Management of COPD in Primary Care ) outlines a stepwise approach to advancing therapy that is consiste nt with Recommendation 5 , Recommendation 8 , and Recommendation 10 from this updated CPG. This exemplifies a strategy in which the therapy is matched to achieving good control of sy mptoms and reducing risk of exacerbations , while minimizing side effects and overuse. The effectiveness of the medications used in advancing therapy is established; however, effectiveness of the use of clinical criteria to guide decision -making to improve outcomes has not been established. T he Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendatio n.(50-52) Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -added r ecommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence regarding establishing the criteria for advancing therapy is very low. The benefits and harms of use of the clinical criteria were balanced. The body of evidence had some limitations including lack of specificity needed to develop clear recommendations. (51) Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation . B. Risk Reduction Recommendation 3. We recommend smoking cessation for prevention and risk reduction of COPD. (Strong for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Cessation of smoking tobacco and avoidance of tobacco smoke are the cornerstones of COPD treatment. Avoidance of respiratory irritants can preserve lung function and slow progression of the disease more than any available medical treatment. Individuals with COPD who stopped smoking were generally found VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 25 of 94 to have improved FEV1 the following year, a decreased rate of decline in FEV1, and reduced mortality. (53) Smoking cessation interventions are widely accepted and available. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. (53, 54) Therefore, t his is a Reviewed, New - replaced recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was moderate. The benefits of slower decline in lung function and reduced all -cause mortality in the long term outweighed the harms associated with smoking cessation. Most p atients have similar values about the contribution of smoking to illness, but many do not want to quit, have trouble quitting, and/or enjoy smoking. Smoking cessat ion interventions are widely available, have low resource use, and are widely accepted across providers. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Strong for recommendation. Recommendation 4. We suggest routine vaccination for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia for prevention and risk reduction of COPD exacerbation s. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Routine influenza vaccination can benefit p atients with COPD by reducing exacerbations of COPD. There are no new trials since 2004; however, low quality evidence suggests influenza vaccination reduces the likeliho od of a COPD exacerbation in patients with COPD. (55) Pneumococcal vaccination may also be beneficial. There was moderate quality evidence for decrease in exacerbation .(56) However, there was low quality evidence for improvement in a variety of COPD - related outcomes including mortality and hospital admission. Patients with COPD are at increased risk of respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, related exacerbations, and mortality. The systematic evidence review identified no evidence to recommend a specific pneumococcal vaccine. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation (55, 56) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 20 14 COPD CPG. Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence for exacerbations was low . The body of evidence had some limitations. While the SR included had good quality methodology, the in cluded studies were of fair quality due to unreported risks of bias. (55) The benefits of improved exacerbations outweighed the minimal side effects. Patient values and preferences were somewhat va ried as some patient do not want to receive vaccinations. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 26 of 94 C. First -Line Therapy Recommendations 5.We recommend offering inhaled long -acting muscarinic antagonists as first -line therapy in patients with symptomatic COPD . (Strong for | Reviewed, New -replaced) 6.We recommend against offering an inhaled long -acting beta agonist as first -line therapy in patients with symptomatic COPD, unless a long -acting muscarinic antagonist is not tolerated or is contraindicated. (Strong against | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Evidence suggests that, in patients with symptomatic COPD , long- acting bronchodilators decrease dyspnea, improve QoL, and exacerbations compared to (57-60) Additionally, long -acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and LABAs do not increase the risk of serious adverse events or total adverse events. (59, 61-64) Long -acting bronchodilators do not supplant short -acting bronchodilators, which may improve lung function and decrease respiratory symptoms in patie nts with COPD. (65) Although there is a lack of high quality evidence addressing their efficacy, the Work Group acknowledges that th e prescription of short - acting bro nchodilators is the current standard of clinical practice in COPD. The use of short -acting bronchodilato rs is include d in the algorithm (see Module B: Management of Acute COPD Exacerbations ), but not add ressed in a formal recommendation . Also, numerous patient focus group participants advocated for the symptomatic benefit and sense of security provided by short -acting bronchodilators. LAMAs remain the first -line maintenance therapy for symptomatic patients with confirmed COPD. Chen et al. (2017) compared the efficacy of LAMAs to LABAs in an SR and demonstrated LAMAs were more effective in reducing the risk of acute exacerbations and were associated with less adverse events than LABAs.( 66) Further supporting LAMAs over LABAs for first -line monotherapy, the SR by Maia et al. (2017) found patients treated with LAMAs had reduced risk of severe exacerbations leading to hospitalization. (67) The systematic evidence review carried out for this guideline update identified two SRs comparing effectiveness of various LAMAs, neither review found that one LAMA was superior to another in terms of safety or efficacy. (58, 60) Despite general consistency in the evidence supporting first -line use of a LAMA over a LABA, there is some variability in patient preferences regarding this treatment. The Work Group determined that certain patient populations, such as those with glaucoma or urinary retention, may not tolerate a LAMA or may be reluctant to start a LAMA given the perceived risk of an adverse outcome. In these patient populations, a LABA could be considered as a first-line agent for symptomatic COPD. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to these recommendations (57-63, 66, 67) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. (64, 65) Therefore, these are Reviewed, New -replaced and Reviewed, New -added recommendations. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate. The benefits of LAMA therapy, including reduced rates of VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 27 of 94 exacerbations and hospitalizations and decreased adverse events , outweighed that harms, which were minimal. Patients have similar values and preferences for a medication that improves their symptoms and causes few side effects. Thus, the Work Group decided upon Strong for and Strong against recommendations. Recommendation 7.We recommend against offering an inhaled corticosteroid in patients with symptomatic COPD as afirst-line therapy. (Strong against | Not reviewed, Amended) Discussion ICSs are not recommended for first -line therapy in COPD and are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Association (65) for this purpose. The effects of ICS monotherapy on lung function and QoL are inferior to monotherapy with LABAs. (68) In addition, ICS monotherapy causes more adverse events compared to placebo, including oropharyngeal candidiasis, hoarseness, bruising, and pneumonia.( 69) As discussed in Recommendations 5 and 6 , there are more effective and safe options for first -line monotherapy for patients with symptomatic COPD (i.e., utilizing either a LAMA or, if this is not tolerated, a LABA). The Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation and considered the assessment of the evidence put for th in the 2014 COPD CPG .(69) Therefore, this is a Not reviewed, Ame nded recommendation . The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate. The harms, including oropharyngeal candidiasis, hoarseness, bruising, and pneumonia, outweighed the benefits of an ICS as first -line monotherapy. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Strong agains t recommendation. Recommendation 8.For patients with moderate to severe obstruction who continue to report significant dyspnea ordecreased quality of life despite using a long -acting muscarinic antagonist, we suggest adding a long- acting beta agonist to long- acting antimuscarinic agent therapy. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion A meta-analysis by Oba et al. (2018) identified an SR of 11 randomized control trials (RCTs) that suggests LAMA/LABA combination therapy has a statistically significant improvement on QoL and dyspnea compared to LAMA monotherapy in individuals with moderate to severe COPD. (70) However, the change in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire was not clinically significant. Similarly, the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) was found to be statistically but not clinically significant with the addition of a LABA to a LAMA. Other studies examining the harms of LABA in combination with LAMA did not find a statistical or clinical difference in serious adverse events compared to LAMA monotherapy. The relevant studies comparing LAMA/LABA to LAMA were of high quality with low to moderate risk of bias, and there was high confidence in the quality of the evidence. (70) Despite the statistically significant findings, the lack of clinically significant findings prevented the Work Gro up from including a recommendation on the optimal time to add LABA therapy to LAMA monotherapy. The FEV1 of included VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 28 of 94 individuals varied widely without a definitive cut -off. The percentage of males in the studies was as high as 96%; the percentage of individuals who currently smoked ranged from 26% to 63%; and the FEV1 predicted of individuals ranged from 37.2% to 57.4%. (70) This wide variation without clear cut -offs informed the Work Group's guidance regarding moderate to severe obstruction. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation (70) and co nsidered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. Therefore, t his is a Reviewed, New - replaced recommend ation, The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was high. The benefit of combination therapy only slightly outweighed the harm, as the benefit was limited to statistically significant but not clinically significant improvement. There is some variation in patient values and preferences, as some patients may not prefer taking a second medication, while others may want to try dual therapy. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation. Recommendation 9.If choosing dual therapy, we recommend against offering long -acting beta agonists with inhaled corticosteroids for patients with COPD . (Strong against | Review ed, New -added) Discussion An ICS plus LABA is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia compared to LAMA monotherapy. (70) The harm of ICSs/LABAs was not offset with potential benefit, as there was no significant difference in rates of exacerbations, QoL, dyspnea, or serious non -fatal adverse events . Although the precise risk related to pneumonia with the use of ICSs plus LABA compared to LAMA monotherapy varies based on the inclusion criteria, the number needed to harm is approximately 50. (70) The Work Group determined both providers and patients would agree upon avoiding prescription of medication that causes increased harm without added benefit compared to an alternative treatment. While evidence suggests an ICS/LABA is an inferior option compared to LAMA monotherapy for the management of COPD, most studies excluded individuals with asthma or asthma- COPD overlap. (70) This recommendation can be applied to the population included in the studies, which were 80% male, 43% current smokers, and me an age of 65. (70) The applicability of this recommendation cannot adequately be extrapolated outside these inclusion criteria. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation .(70) Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate. Individual studies included in the SR by Oba et al. (2018) (70) had some limitations including smaller study sample size and larger confidence intervals ( CIs).(71, 72) Thus, the possibility of a clinically significant benefit could not be excluded. However, the ha rms of increased rates of pneumonia significantly outweighed the benefits associated with an ICS/LABA compared to LAMA monotherapy, as none were identified. P atients have similar values and preferences for taking a medication that comes with harm and no benefit. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Strong against recommendation. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 29 of 94 Recommendation 10.In patients with COPD who are on combination therapy with a long -acting antimuscarinic agent /long- acting beta agonist and continue to have COPD exacerbations, we suggest adding an inhaled corticosteroid as a third medication . (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Triple therapy with an ICS, LAMA, and LABA has been compared with both single and combination therapy in numerous RCTs which primarily involve patients with COPD with moderate to severe airflow obstruction and a history of one or more moderate to severe acute exacerbations (defined as exacerbations treated with antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, or those that result in hospitalization) within the prior year. Four SRs of these trials served as the evidence base for this recommendation. (73-76) Triple therapy decreased the frequency of moderate to severe exacerbations, improved QoL, and improved FEV1 when compared to single or dual therapy .(73-76) No differences were found based on whether the inhalers are separate or co mbined into one device. (73, 76) Triple therapy did not increase the rates of serious adverse events or total adverse events. Studies inconsistently reported an association between triple therapy and an increased risk of pneumonia compared to LABA/LAMA dual therapy. (73, 74, 76)A meta -analysis by Cazzola et al. (2018) estimated a number needed to treat of 38 for triple therapy to prevent an acute exacerbation of COPD compared to LABA/LAMA dual therapy. Conversely, triple therapy was associated with a number needed to harm of 195 for pneumonia. (74) While patient focus group participants desired improvements in their risk of exacerbations, QoL, and functional status, some heterog eneity exists among patients when weighing the risks of pneumonia and the benefits of triple therapy with an inhaled steroid. Also, the use of separate devices for triple therapy may require a patient to utilize multiple different inhaler types and techniq ues, and thus limit adherence to therapy. Pre -specified secondary analyses within triple therapy trials have shown benefit across all groups but suggest the magnitude of benefit was heterogeneous amongst different COPD phenotypes and may be influenced by the frequency of exacerbations, active smoking status, and/or blood eosinophil counts. (73-75) The Work Group determined the strength of evidence did not justify a recommendation to treat these subgroups differently. More research should be done to elucidate markers of COPD phenotypes that benefit from different therapeutic options. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation (73-76) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New - replaced recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low. The body of evidence had significant limitations including heterogeneity among the included trials as well as imprecision and limitations on the comparison of serious adverse events and pneumonia. (73) The benefits of increased QoL and decreased risk of exacerbations slightly outweighed the harms of increased risks of pneumonia. Patients likely have similar values and preferences for avoiding pneumonia and exacerbations. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 30 of 94 Recommendation 11.There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of eosinophilia or suspicion of asthma -COPD overlap syndrome to guide choice of additional therapy. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New- added) Discussion One SR was identified that addressed the use of eosinophil counts to guide therapy for COPD. (75) Within the SR, five RCTs examined blood eosinophil counts as markers of response with the addition of IC Ss, maintenance of ICSs, or withdrawal of an ICS. The SR showed no difference in ICS containing treatments and non- ICS containing treatments in the risk of moderate to severe exacerbations. Other secondary outcomes were mixed in terms of benefit of exacerb ation and risk of pneumonia. None of the studies were originally designed to assess the use of eosinophil counts as a marker to guide therapy for COPD. Because the SR had mixed results with significant heterogene ity, the Work Group did not recommend for or against the use of eosinophil counts in the decision to use ICS therapy. In contrast, there is evidence for the use of eosinophil counts to inform the decision to withdraw an ICS in a patient with stable COPD. This evidence is reviewed in Recommendation 12 below. There was insufficient data to define asthma- COPD overlap syndrome. The term \"syndrome\" has been used by some, but a clear definition is currently not available , and, even when used, it is not clear how it might aid in deci sions for therapy. The Work Group did not recommend for or against the use of this syndrome in making treatment decisions. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation .(75) Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low. There was insufficient evidence to make a determination on the balance of potential benefits and harms . There was also insufficient data to define an overlap syndrome or determine how it might aid in the decisions of advancing therapy. There was large variation in patient values and preferences, as there is significant heterogeneity in patie nts with these conditions, leading to subgroup considerations. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation . Recommendation 12.We suggest considering withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD without moderate to severe exacerbations in the last two years . (Weak for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Overall, moderate to high quality evidence from an SR of eight RCTs by Calzetta et al. (2017) suggested that ICS withdrawal did not differ from ICS continued for risk of exacerbations and time to exacerbation.( 77) In addition, those weaned had a significant improvement in the QoL as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Other studies included in the SR showed a small but clinically insignificant decrease in FEV1 and no change in the adverse events or rates of exacerbation. (77) There was evidence from two RCTs in an SR (78) which s uggested an increase in risk of exacerbation in participants with higher baseline absolute blood eosinophil levels with threshold ( 300 cells/\u00b5l) in the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 31 of 94 withdrawal groups compare d to the continue groups for up to 10 months follow -up. However , evidence from another RCT in the SR showed no differ ences in serious adverse events .(78) ICSs are not without risk of adverse events, and safely decreasing medication load is a priority for both patients and providers . There may be variability in willingness to stop withdrawing medications in stable patients, and the evidence supporting this recommendation may help patients and providers be more comfortable with weaning. There was no evidence to support a recommendation for any specific p articular withdrawal protocol. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation .(77, 78) Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate. The body of evidence had some limitations as the increased risk of exacerbations was only found in the high eosinophil subgroup. Additionally, there was lack of repeatability/reliability of single eosinophil measure and the added complexity of requiring lab measurement to help decide treatment . The benefits of being off a steroid medication outweighed the potential harms of withdrawal, which were not significant in patients with absolute eosinophil counts of <300 cells/\u00b5l. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied, as risk varied by subgroup and most patients do not want to be on steroids given the side eff ects. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation. Recommendation 13.There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of N -acetylcysteine preparations available in the United States for patients with stable COPD who continue to haverespiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough). (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion N-acetylcysteine is an antioxidant, anti- inflammatory, and mucolytic agent. Cysteine is one of the three amino acids that make up glutathione, the most abundant intracellular antioxidant. It was the only mucolytic agent covered in the search during the systematic evidence review carried out for this CPG update. The systematic evidence review identified an SR and meta -analysis of 12 RCTs by Fowdar et al. (2017). (79) There was large variability in dose and treatment duration among the included trials. NAC was found to reduce long- term ( >6 months) but not short -term exacerbation prevalence. However, there was no effect on exacerbation rate, FEV1, FVC , or inspiratory capacity. Adding NAC to standard therapy did not change FEV1 or incidence of adverse events compared to standard therapy alone. (79) For this reason, the Work Group did not recommend for or against the use of NAC in COPD treatment regimens. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recomme ndation (79) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. Therefore, this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low. The body of evidence had some limitations including large variation in the use of NAC. (79) Other considerations include d insufficient evidence to judge the balance of potential benefits and harms. There was large variation in patient values and preferences regarding the use of NAC. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 32 of 94 Recommend ation 14.There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of antibiotics for outpatient COPD exacerbations (C-reactive protein guided or not ). (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New- replaced) Discussion The efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate outpatient COPD exacerbations remains uncertain. An SR by Vollenweider et al. (2018) evaluating the benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment for COPD exacerbations suggested, with low quality evidence, that outpatients treated with broad- spectrum antibiotic therapy have decreased risk for treatment failures up to one month following the initiation of treatment. (80) However, the SR also found no significant difference between antibiotic treatment and placebo in re -exacerbations in 2-6 weeks, median time to next exacerbation up to 12 months , and a ll-cause mortality up to two years after starting antibiotic treatment. (80) Evidence from one SR and two RCTs s uggest s an increase in diarrhea with antibiotic therapy compared with placebo from four weeks to two years post commencement of antibiotics. (80-82) No significant difference was found in harms between shorter and longer durations of broad spectrum antibiotics. (81) Similarly, the use of C -reactive protein (CRP) point -of-care testing guided antibiotic prescription compared to usual care , had no clinically important difference in adverse effects comp ared to antibiotics at six months. (82) The Work Group did not review evidence on other specific biomarkers, such as procalcitonin, in directing the use of antibiotic therapy in COPD exacerbations. COPD exacerbations can be triggered by environmental irritants, bacterial pathogens, and/or viral pathogens. This creates a challenge in determ ining the appropriateness of routine treatment of mild to moderate outpatient COPD exacerbations with antibiotics, given their effectiveness only against susceptible bacterial infections. Based on clinical judgment, antibiotic therapy may be warranted and beneficial on a case -by-case basis. Such patients could include those presenting with a moderate exacerbation, increased dyspnea and increased sputum volume/purulence, fever/chills, and leukocytosis with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. There is large heterogeneity in the studies and methods used to capture exacerbation- related attributes (e.g., duration, severity, frequency). The studies included individuals with all levels of exacerbation severity (mild to severe) , and definitions of exacerbations varied. The Work Group did not find any study that specifically evaluated antimicrobial resistance. Very few studies defined harms a priori or evaluated \"serious\" adverse events. The severity of adverse events was not defined, and harms were generally capture d as present or absent. Lack of adequate reporting for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, poor capture, and reporting of harms were the most frequent sources of bias. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recom mendation (80-82) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New - replaced recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low. The body of evidence had some limitations including studies with participants from both inpatient and outpatient settings and evaluation of antibiotics that are not currently in use in clinical practice. The systematic VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 33 of 94 evidence review carried out as part of this CPG update only considered studies that were conducted in outpatients and evaluated use of antibiotics currently in use within the U.S. The benefit of a decrease in treatment failure was balanced with harm of diarrhea as a side effect in some patients. Patient values and preferences for receiving antibiotics is somewhat varied. Thus the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation. Recommendation 15. We recommend providing long- term oxygen therapy to patients with chronic stable resting severe hypoxemia (PaO 2 <55 mm Hg and/or SaO 2 88%) or chronic stable resting moderate hypoxemia (PaO 2 56 - 59 mm Hg or SaO 2 >88% and 90%) with signs of tissue hypoxia (hematocrit >55%, pulmonary hypertension, or cor pulmonale). (Strong for | Not reviewed, Not changed) Discussion Severe chronic hypo xemia is associated with significant comorbidity and mortality. There is evidence that long- term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in these clinical situations reduces mortality. (83-85) Chronic stable hypoxemia is defined as two measurements at least six weeks apart and at least six weeks from any acute illness resulting in hypoxemia. Effects of supplemental oxygen in moderate hypoxemia are not clear. (86) There is insufficient evidence that LTOT reduces mortality in COPD patients with mild to moderate hypoxemia (66 mmHg <PaO 2 74 mm Hg) in the absence of signs of tissue hypoxia. (85) There is also insufficient evidence that LTOT for chronically hypoxic COPD patients improves dyspnea, QoL, hospitalization rates, or readmission rates. (85) Therefore, t he Work Group decided to not make specific recommendations related to LTOT for these patient populations. If transitional home oxygen is provided after an acute respiratory illness, the need for LTOT should be re - evaluated in 30 - 90 days. The RCTs found that a survival benefit among RCTs with LTOT did not measure oxygen levels or re -evaluate the need for LTOT after initial qualification. (83, 84) Up to 50% of these patients will not qualify for con tinued LTOT .(87) In contrast, patients with chronic stable hypoxemia who have met the criteria for LTOT prior to hospitalization do not require reassessment. (88) Discontinuing LTOT in these patients can result in subsequent worsening of hypoxemia. (88, 89) Furthermore, the safety of discontinuing LTOT under these circumstances is unknown. The Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. (83-85) Therefore, this is a Not reviewed, Not changed recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate. The benefits of LTOT outweighed the potential harm of adverse events, such as fire hazards for smokers. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Strong for recommendation. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 34 of 94 Recommendation 16.We suggest against routinely offering ambulatory long -term supplemental ox ygen for patients with chronic stable isolated exercise hypoxemia, in the absence of another clinical indication for supplemental oxygen.(Weak against | Reviewed, Not changed) Discussion Oxygen p lays a pivotal role i n th e m aintenance o f cell and body fu nct ion.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 35 of 94 The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation (91-94) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG .(90) Therefore, this is a Reviewed, Not changed recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. Other considerations include insufficient evidence to judge the balance of potential benefits and harms. Patient values and preferences were varied as they do not want to be seen as debilitated. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak against recommendation. Recommendation 17.In patients with COPD, we suggest starting or continuing cardio -selective beta -blockers o nly in those who have a cardiovascular indication for beta- blockers (e.g., heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or recent myocardial infarction).(Weak for | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion In patients with COPD with a cardiovascular (CV) indication for cardio -selective beta -blockers , such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or recent myocardial infarction, observational data suggests that these agents are safe, improve mortality rates, and decrease COPD exacerbations. (95) While metoprolol was the only beta -blocker examined by the studies included in the systematic evidence review, the Work Group extrapolated these results to all cardio -selective beta -blockers, as they all have at least some cross- reactivity with beta2- receptors found in lung tissue. He et al. (2017) assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of a low -dose cardio -selective beta -blocker (metoprolol) in treating ac ute e xacerbation of COPD .(96) The RCT evaluated 100 patients with CV indications for beta- blockers and found metoprolol led to a reduction in COPD exacerbations and mortality when compared to placebo, without an increase in the incidence of adverse effects (chest tightness and lung rhonchi). However, the intended population of this study was patients with cor pulmonale with an N-termin al pro b -type natriuretic peptide level greater than 1 ,800 picograms/milliliter (pg/mL). While patients with reduced ejection fraction or cardiomyopathy were intended to be excluded from this trial, itis unclear how thoroughly this was evaluated by the investigators. Thus, it is difficult to elucidate the truebenefit of beta -blockers in all patient populations with acute exacerbations of COPD . Suissa et al. (2018) conducted an SR of 18 observational studies investigating the effectiveness of beta-blocker s in COPD patients on major outcomes of death and COPD exacerbation. (95) Evidence from the SR suggests the use of beta -blockers in COPD patients with CV indications leads to reduced COPD exacerbations and mortality compared to non -use of beta -blockers. The most recent attempt to provide better quality evidence on this topic was the -Blockers (LOCK) COPD RCT by Dransfield et al. (2019). (97) This trial evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of a beta-blocker (metoprolol) in 532 patients with COPD who did not have CV indications for beta -blockers. The study was stopped earl y due to a higher risk of exacerbations and hospitalization associated with beta- blocker use. Patient preferences were consistent in the patient focus group with high level of concern about QoL and medication -related side effects. The Work Group considere d reports that patients with COPD -asthma overlap have poor outcomes on beta -blocker therapy, but there was not enough available evidence to VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 36 of 94 draw conclusions. T he Work Group also considered that the harms of using cardio -selective beta -blockers in patients with COPD and hypertension without any other CV requirements outweigh the benefits. (97) The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 95, 96) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. Therefore, this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evide nce was very low. The body of evidence was limited to two RCTs with relatively small sample sizes .(95, 96) The use of beta -blockers in patients with a CV indication was associated with decreased COPD exacerbations and mortality, without an increase in adverse events . This was not the case for COPD patients without a CV indication for beta- blockers, in whom beta -blockers are associated with a higher risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations. (97) Patient values and preferences were similar, as all patients generally have the same desired outcomes regarding mortality benefits and adverse events when it comes to treatment with beta -blockers. Lastly, there was limited evidence evaluating beta -blockers in COPD patients with overlapping asthma. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation. Recommendation 18.We suggest offering a supported self -management pr ogram that includes a written action plan with exacerbation management, smoking cessation, and exercise.(Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion A supported self -management program may benefit patients with COPD. T here was significant improvement in QoL when the self -management program included key components, such as written action for exacerbation management, exercise training, and smoking cessation. (98-100) In a meta -analysis of 10 RCTs by Lenferink et al. (2017), (101) subgroup analysis showed even greater QoL improvement in programs with smoking cessation. A meta- analysis of 10 RCTs by Can non et al. (2016) showed that self - management with an exacerbation action plan, exercise training, and COPD education improved activity and physical function. (100) Without the key components, including written action for exacerbation management, disease education, smoking cessation, and exercise training, many studies did not ha ve statistically significant improvement in QoL for COPD patients , no matter the level of severity. (99, 102-107) The evidence reviewed consistently demonstrated supported self -management improved QoL, although there was not a significant difference in mortality or rates of worsening of adverse events, including rates of COPD- related hospitalizations. Exercise pro grams studied had varied functional outcomes but only two had improvement of dyspnea. (108, 109) In a meta -analysis of five RCTs by Paneroni et al. (2017), aerobic exercise training had clinical significance on QoL. (110) Exercise training varied among the studies , although most consisted of aerobic training with walking, cycling, or use of an arm crank and strength training either with weights or elastic bands. No harms were found with supported self -management. Self-management plans have been widely used in other respiratory diseases such as asthma. Supported self-management plans allow patients to have guidance regarding concerns directly related to their chronic respiratory disease. These plans give patients clear instructions regarding therapies for worsening of symptoms, a structured plan for exercise, and strong recommendations for smoking cessation. When VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 37 of 94 written, the action plan is tailored for each patient. This was an important factor for focus group participants. Patients feel empowered and in control when they work jointly with a provider on a disease - specific, individualized, and written action plan. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation (98-110) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. The confidence in the quality of evidence was low. The body of evidence had some limitations including variability in assessing behavioral health changes and variability between groups regarding components of usual care. The benefits varied among studies but many demonstrated improved QoL and rate of exacerbations. These benefits outweighed the harms, which were limited . The Work Group recognized the clinic resources needed to complete and regularly track participating patients. This should be a major consideration before initiating and integrating a supported self-management program in the primary care setting. Thus, th e Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation. Recommendation 19. We suggest offering telehealth support that includes telemonitoring and/or mobile applications. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion The systematic evidence review evaluated tele health interventions in the context of monitoring and supported self -management via telecommunications and digital communications technologies. (111- 127) The interventions reviewed were very heterogeneous, but all of them would be considered supportive in nature and not a replacement for usual medical care. The quality of the evidence for the evaluation of telehealth support was low due to inconsistency. Most studie s were either fair or poor quality, and studies varied with respect to their comparison groups and timing in which outcomes were assessed. The interventions were broadly categorized as telephone only, mobile phone/interactive web -based support, video supported and remote monitoring. Telephone- assisted education, coaching, or rehabilitation interventions without mobile phone applications or telemonitoring showed improvement in QoL in studies that assessed outcomes immediately after the intervention but not in studies that assessed outcomes after some follow- up period. (112, 127) In one SR, interventions utilizing mobi le phone/interactive web -based technology were more effective than face-to -face or documentary educational self- management support in improving QoL and increasing physical activity. (111) Individual RCTs identified through the systematic evidence review, however, did not show improvements in QoL with the use of smartphone applications for promotion of exercise and self- management. (113-115) Two SRs (116, 117) and five of six RCTs, (118-123) showed no improvemen ts in QoL. Evidence of the effect of telemonitoring on acute healthcare utilization, emergency room (ER) visits , and hospitalizations was inconsistent. Two SRs ( 116, 124) showed improvement while one SR (117) and five RCTs did not. (117-120, 122, 123) Only two RCTs identified in the systematic evidence review were categorized as utilizing a video -supported intervention. (125, 126) Neither trial showed improvements in QoL. There is likely significant variability in patient values and preferences regarding telehealth interventions. Patients also vary in their ability to use technology. Focus group participants were open to the idea of VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 38 of 94 internet or teleconferences but noted that in-person meetings, if held at accessible locations, would be preferable. Telehealth may assist with equity for patients whose access to care is limited by home -bound status or rural location. During pandemic outbreaks, telehealth may be the only safe option for the delivery of supportive programs. The feasibility of implementing telehealth support programs for patients with COPD has improved substantially since the 2014 VA/DoD COPD CPG due to improvements in technology and significant VA and DoD investment in telehealth infrastructure. National initiatives, such as the Rural Veterans Tele -Rehabilitation Initiative (RVTRI), and other programs have increased resources to facilities to offer telehealth options. The use of mobile apps and telemonitoring equipment requires more effort on the part of the patient; however, the interactive nature of these modalities may better engage patients in their care. Patients may be more likely to be physically active when monitoring activity with mobile applications or telemonitoring technology. Telemonitoring may reduce acute healthcare utilization, but the burdens telemonitoring place on patients may counter positive effects on QoL. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 111-127) and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2014 COPD CPG. Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. The benefits increasing accessibility with telehealth support outweighed the harms. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied but the Work Group thought most patients would welcome education, prom otion of exercise, coping skills, and self- management training that is delivered remotely to their home. Technologic advances have increased feasibility of telehealth. Travel is particularly burdensome for patients with COPD and telehealth can overcome geo graphic barriers to care. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation. X. Research Priorities During the development of the 2021 COPD CPG, the Work Group identified areas needing additional research, including areas requiring stronger evidence to support current recommendations and research exploring new areas to guide future CPGs. Areas include triple therapy, diagnostic testing, dyspnea, exacerbations, hospitalizations, creating pathways to advance therapy, and the role of telehealth. More research is needed on the safety of triple therapy and to better describe the subpopulations of COPD patients most likely to benefit from or be harmed by the steroid component of triple therapy and the use of eosinophils . In addition, research is needed to determine specific clinical signs and the utility of CRP and other diagnostic tests to further assist the identification of patients with a bacterial infection in which antibiotic therapy would be warranted. Studies comparing broad -spectrum versus narr ow-spectrum antibiotics as well as specific antibiotic agents would be beneficial. Another area of potential research includes evaluating the efficacy and safety of self-initiated versus provider- initiated antibiotic therapy for COPD exacerbations. More re search is also needed on how COPD treatment impacts dyspnea, COPD exacerbations, and COPD -related hospitalizations as well as clinical research is needed to provide clinicians with a stronger evidence with which to create treatment pathways . Additional research is also needed to compare the effectiveness of telehealth versus face -to-face supported self -management programs. Additionally, further research is needed to clarify the role of telemonitoring in the care of patients with COPD in order to determine which variables or symptoms are the most useful to monitor and how telemonitoring data can be used by patie nts and providers. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 39 of 94 Telemonitoring devices will likely become more sophisticated, wearable , and convenient over time ; research on telehealth for COPD should be driven by ad vances in telehealth technology . Lastly, evidence suggests additional research is needed to better understand the subtypes of COPD, the risk factors for each, and how they can be identified and treated differently, including those patients with symptoms and smoking history suggestive of COPD but without obstruction on pulmonary function tests (PFTs ). VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 40 of 94 Appendix A : Guideline Development Methodology A. Developing Key Questions to Guide the Systematic Evidence Review To guide this CPG's systematic evidence review, the Work Group drafted 12 KQs on clinical topics of the highest priority for the VA and DoD populations . The KQs follow ed the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing , and setting (PICOTS) framework, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (see Table A-1 ). Table A-1. PICOTS (128 ) PICOTS Element Description Population or Patients Patients of interest. It includes the condition(s), populations or sub -populations, disease severity or stage, co -occurring conditions, and other patient characteristics or demographics. Intervention or Exposure Treatment (e.g., drug, surgery, lifestyle changes) , approach (e.g., doses, frequency, methods of administering treatments ), or diagnostic /screening test used with the patient or population. Comparator Treatment(s) (e.g., placebo, different drugs) or appro ach(es) (e.g. , different dose, different frequency, standard of care) that are being compared with the intervention or exposure of interest described above . Outcomes Results of i nterest (e.g., mortality, morbidity , QoL, complications ). Outcomes can inclu de short, intermediate, and long -term outcomes . Timing, if applicable Duration or follow -up of interest for the particular patient intervention and outcome to occur (or not occur). Setting, if applicable Setting or context of interest. Setting can be a l ocation ( e.g., primary, specialty, inpatient care) or type of practice . Abbreviation: PICOTS: population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing , and setting ; QoL: quality of life Due to resource constraints, all KQs of interest to the Work Group could not be included in the systematic evidence review. Thus, the Work Group selected the 12 highest priority KQs for inclusion in the systematic evidence review (see Table A -2). Using the GRADE approach, the Work Group rated each outcome on a 1 - 9 scale (7 - 9, critical for decision making; 4 - 6, important, but not critical, for decision making; and 1 - 3, of limited importance for decision making). Critical and important outcomes were included in the evidence review (see Outcomes ); however, only critical outcomes were used to determine the overall quality of evidence (see Grading Recommendations ). a. Population(s) The population of interest for all KQs included a dults (18 years) who have a diagnosis of COPD that includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and chronic airflow limitation/obstruction. Some KQs also included additional sub- populations that were also covered per key question .

Conducting the Systematic Review Based on the Work Group's decisions regarding the CPG's scope, KQs, and PICOTS statements, the Lewin Team produced a systematic evidence review protocol before conducting the review.

General Criteria for Inclusion in Systematic Evidence Review All studies included as evidence must have be en published in English on or after January 1, 2014 , to February 21, 2020. Publication must have been a full text clinical study or systematic review; abstracts alone were not included. Similarly, letters, editorials, and other publications that were not full -length clinical studies were not accepted as evidence. Study must have enrolled a patient population in which at least 85% of patients had COPD, with identifiable data for the population of interest (i.e., patients with COPD should have been identifiable in the dataset). Only studies assessing the efficacy of drugs that have received FDA approval for marketing in the U.S. were included in this review. Study must have enrolled at least 20 patients (10 per study group). Study must have reported on an outcome of interest. b. Key Question Specific Criteria for Inclusion in Systematic Evidence Review Studies addressing KQ s 2 to 12 must ha ve been an SR of RCTs or an RCT. Observational studies were not considered as evidence for these questions. Randomized crossover trials were included only if data from the first period (prior to treatment crossover) was reported separately. Post -hoc and no n-systematic pooled analyses were only included if they address ed a subpopulation or outcome not covered or reported in original study. For KQ 1, SR s of acceptable study designs and prospective diagnostic cohort or other prospective non- RCT studies that report ed on the diagnostic characteristics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity) of the tools assessed in the question were also accepted as evidence. Retrospective case series or chart reviews were not accepted as evidence. SRs must have searched MEDLINE or EMBASE for eligible publications, performed a risk of bias assessment of included studies, and assessed the quality of evidence using a recognizable rating system, such as GRADE or something compatible (e.g., the Strength of Evidence ratings used by the Evidence -based Practice Centers for the Agency for Research and Quality). If an existing review did not assess the overall quality of the evidence, evidence from the review must have been reported in a manner that allowed judgment of the overall risk of bias, co nsistency, directness, and precision of evidence. E xisting review s were not used as evidence if it was not possible to assess the overall quality of the evidence in the review. For KQ 8 , short -term antibiotic use was defined as 10 days or less. c.

Developing Evidence- based Recommendations In consultation with the VA Office of Quality and Patient Safety and the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S. Army Medical Command Office , the Lewin Team convened a four- day virtual recommendation development meeting on June 15, 2020, to develop this CPG's evidence -based recommendations . Two weeks before the meeting, the Lewin Team finalized the systematic evidence review and distributed the report to the Work Group; findings were also presented during the first day of the recommendation development meeting. Led by the Champions, the Work Group interpret ed the systematic evidence review 's findings and developed this CPG's recommendations. Where appropriate, the Work Group carried forward and modified recommendations from the 2014 VA/DoD COPD CPG as necessary (see Categorization of 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations ). The Work Group also developed new recommendations not included in the 2014 VA/DoD COPD CPG based on the 2020 evidence review. As the Work Group drafted recommendations, they also rated each recommendation based on a modified GRADE and USPSTF methodology. Re commendation s were rated by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and other implications. a. Grading Recommendations Per GRADE , each recommendation's strength and direction is determined by the following four domains :(21) 1. Confidence in the Quality of the Evidence Confidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality of the evidence base supporting a recommendation. The options for this domain include: High, Moderate , Low, or Very l ow. This is a direct reflection of the GRADE ratings for each relevant critical outcome in the evidence review (see Outcomes ). Per GRADE, if the quality of evidence differs across the relevant critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation.( 23, 24) The recommendation strength generally aligns with the confidence in the quality of evidence. For example, Strong recommendatio ns are typically supported by High or Moderate quality evidence. However, GRADE permits Low or Very low quality evidence to support a Strong recommendation in certain instances (e.g., life -threatening situation). (21) 2. Balance of Desirable and Undesirable O utcomes The balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes (i.e., benefits and harms) refers to the relative magnitudes or tradeoffs of anticipated benefits (e. g., increased longevity, reduced morbidity , improved VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 49 of 94 QoL, decreased resource use) and harms (e.g., decreased longevity, increased complications, impaired QoL). The options for this domain include: benefits outweigh harms/burden, benefits slightly outweigh harms/burden, benefits and harms/burdens are balanced, harms/burdens slightly outweigh benefits , and harms/burdens outweigh benefits . This domain assumes most clinicians will offer patients an intervention if its advantages exceed the harms . The Work Group 's understanding of the benefits and harms associated with the recommendation influence d the recommendation's strength and direction. 3. Patient Values and Preferences Patient values and preferences is an overarching term that includes patients' perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals for health and life as they may apply to the intervention's potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience . The options for this domain include: similar values , some variation, or large variation. For instance, there may be some variation in patient values and preferences for a recommendation on the use of acupuncture, as some patients may dislike needles. When patient values seem homogeneous, this domain may increase the recommendation's strength. Alte rnatively, when patient values seem heterogeneous, this domain may decreas e a recommendation's strength. As part of this domain, the Work Group considered the findings from the patient focus group carried out as part of this CPG update (see Appendix B ). 4. Other Implications Other implications encompass the potential consequences or other impacts that might affect the strength or direction of the recommendation . The options for this domain include resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility , and subgroup considerations. The following are example implications related to equity and subgroup considerations, respectively: some of the indicated population may be geographically remote from an interv ention (e.g., complex radiological equipment) ; a drug may be contraindicated in a subgroup of patients. Table A-4. GRADE Evidence to Recommendation Framework Decision Domain Questions to Consider Judgment Confidence in the quality of the evidence Among t he designated critical outcomes, w hat is the lowest quality of relevant evidence ? How likely is further research to change the confidence in the estimate of effect? High Moderate Low Very low Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes What is the magni tude of the anticipated desirable outcomes ? What is the magnitude of the anticipate d undesirable outcomes ? Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that benefits outweigh harms/ burden s or vice versa? Benefits outweigh ha rms/burdens Benefits slightly outweigh harm / burden Benefits and harms /burden s are balanced Harms /burden s slightly outweigh benefits Harms /burden s outweigh benefits Patient v alues and preferences What are the patients' values and preferences? Are values a nd preferences similar across the target population? Are you confident about typical values and preferences? Similar values Some variation Large variation VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 50 of 94 Decision Domain Questions to Consider Judgment Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations) What are the costs per resource unit? Is this intervention generally available? What is the variability in resource requirements across the target population and settings? Are the resources worth the expected net benefit from the recommendation? Is this i ntervention and its effects worth withdrawing or not allocating resources from other interventions? Various considerations b. Recommendation Categorization A summary of the recommendation categories and definitions is available in Table 3. 1. Categorizing Recommendations with an Updated Review of the Evidence Reviewed refers to recommendations on topics included in this CPG's systematic evidence review. Reviewed , New -added recommendations are original, new rec ommendations (i.e., not included in the previous CPG) . These recommendations are based entirely on evidence included in the current CPG's systematic evidence review. Reviewed , New -replaced recommendations were in the previous CPG but revised based on the updated evidence review. These recommendations may have clinically relevant edits . Reviewed , Not changed recommendations were carried forward from the previous CPG unchanged. Reviewed , Amended recommendations were carried forward from the previous CPG with a nominal change . This allowed for the recommendation language to reflect GRADE approach and any other not clinically meaningful edits deemed necessary. These recommendations can be based on a combination of evidence included in the current CPG's systemati c evidence review and the evidence base that supported the recommendation in the previous CPG. Reviewed , Deleted refers to recommendations from the previous CPG that were deleted after a review of the evidence. This may occur if the evidence supporting the recommendation is out date d (e.g., there is no longer a basis to recommend use of a n intervention and/or new evidence suggests a shift in care ), rendering the recommendation obsolete. 2. Categorizing Recommendations without an Updated Review of the Eviden ce There were also cases in which it was necessary to carry forward recommendations from the previous CPG without an updated review of the evidence. Given time and resource constraints, the systematic evidence review carried out for this CPG update could not cover all available evidence on COPD ; therefore, its KQs focused on new or updated research or areas not covered in the previous CPG . For areas in which the relevant evidence was not changed and for which recommendations made in the previous CPG were s till relevant, recommendations could have been carried forward to the updated CPG without an updated review of the evidence . The evidence supporting these recommendations was thus also carried forward from the previous CPG. These recom mendations were categ orized as Not reviewed . If evidence had not been reviewed, recommendations could have been categorized as Not changed, Amended, or Deleted . Not reviewed , Not changed recommendations were carried forward from the previous CPG unchanged. Not reviewed , Amende d recommendations were modified from the previous VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 51 of 94 CPG with a nominal change . Not reviewed , Deleted recommendations were determined by the Work Group to not be relevant . A recommendation may not be relevant if it, for example, pertained to a topic (e.g., po pulation, care setting, treatment ) outside of the updated CPG's scope or if it was determined to be common practice. The recommendation categories for the current CPG are noted in the Recommendations . The recommendation categories from the 2014 VA/DoD COPD CPG are noted in Appendix D. D. Drafting and Finalizing the Guideline The Work Group wrote, reviewed, and edited three drafts of the CPG using an iterative review p rocess to solicit feedback on and make revisions to the CPG. T he first and second drafts were posted online for 20 and 14 business days , respectively, for the Work Group to provide feedback . Draft 3 was made availab le for a 14-day peer review and comment ( see External Peer Review ). The Work Group reviewed all feedback submitted during each review period and made appropriate revisions to the CPG. Following the Draft 3 review and comment period, the Work Group reviewed external f eedback and created a final draft of the CPG. The Champions then presented the CPG to the EBPWG for approval. The Work Group considered the EBPWG's feedback and revised the CPG as appropriate to create the final version. To accompany the CPG, the Work Grou p produced toolkit products, including a provider summary, pocket card, and patient summary. The EBPWG approved the final CPG and toolkit products in April 2021. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 52 of 94 Appendix B : Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings A. Methods VA and DoD Leadership recruited participants for the focus group , with support from the Champions, other Work Group members, and individuals at the patient focus group location as needed. While participant recruitment focused on eliciting a range of perspectives likely to be relevant and informative in the CPG development process, p atient focus group participants were not inte nded to be a representative sample of VA and DoD patients. Participants were not incentivized for their participation or reimbursed for travel expenses. The Work Group, with support from the Lewin Team , identified topics on which patient input was important to consider in developing the CPG . The Lewin Team developed , and the Work Group approved, a patient focus group guide covering these topics. The focus group fac ilitator led the discussion us ing the guide to elicit the patient s' perspectives about their treatment and overall care. Given the limited time and the range of interests of the focus group participants, not all questions were addressed. B. Patient Focus G roup Findings a. Participants indicated that providers should consider activities of daily living when assessing a patient's pulmonary functioning to better understand the practical impact of COPD on a patient's life. Participants thought pulmonary functio n testing should include activities of daily living instead of just walking. Participants expressed concern that their providers did not consider the practical aspects of managing their COPD and the impact it has on their lives . b. Participants were concerned about the practicality and weight of supplemental oxygen equipment and expressed unanimous support for rescue inhalers. Participants agreed that their supplemental oxygen tanks were too heavy and expressed a desire for lighter and more portable equipment . Although participants wanted lighter oxygen equipment, they found the smaller oxygen concentrators to be too expensive. Many participants disliked the single strap design of oxygen cylinder bags because it is uncomfortable, impractical, and restricts them from carrying other items. Participants were hesitant to use oxygen on a regular basis. Many agreed it is easy to become dependent on it. All participants valued the por tability of rescue inhalers and most carried at least one with them at all times . c. Participants valued self -management and alternative medicine treatment options. Participants valued exercise as a self- management tool because it improved their symptoms and provided social stimulation. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease April 2021 Page 53 of 94 Most participants thought a COPD support group would be helpful for social interaction and sharing of treatment options. Participants were open to trying alternative medicine and turned to naturopathic options when the care they received was inadequate. d. Participants varied in their trust of the medical system and sought more consistent care from providers who knew them and their medical issues. VA participants expressed frustration with scheduling appointments and receiving follow -up from their providers. Participants sought consistent care from the same team of providers. e. Participants stressed the importance of shared decision making in discussing treatment options with their providers. Patients sought providers who considered an individual's comorbidities when discussing treatment options and were mindful that patients vary in their preferences for and tolerance of different treatments. Participants valued providers who use shared decision making to understand a patient's needs, values, and treatment preferences. Participants received inconsistent care from providers. While some of their providers utilized shared decision making to individualize their care, others did not.

Inclusion of more than one 2014 strength of recommendation indicates that more than one 2014 VA/DoD COPD CPG recommendation is covered by the 2021 recommendation. \"Not applicable\" indicates that the 2014 VA/DoD COPD CPG recommendation was a new recommendation, and therefore does not have an associated 2014 strength of recommendation. b Evidence column: The first set of references listed in each row in the evidence column constitutes the evidence base for the recommendati on. To be included in the evidence base for a recommendation, a reference needed to be identified through a systematic evidence review carried out as part of the ini tial development or update of this CPG. The second set of references in the evidence column (called \"Additional References\") includes references that provide additional information related to the recommendation, but which were not identified through a systematic evidence review. These references were, therefore, not included in the evidence base for the recommendation and did not influence the strength and direction of the recommendation. c 2021 Strength of Recommendation column: The 2021 VA/DoD COPD CPG was developed using the GRADE approach to determine the strength of each recommendation.
