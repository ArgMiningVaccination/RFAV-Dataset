This article unpacks this plurality to show how different components contribute to the healing process in complementary and yet hierarchical ways which hold to a nexus of political, social, medical, economic, cosmological, biological, and environmental factors. It also questions the boundaries between the religious and medical, Buddhist and non-Buddhist, worldly and otherworldly, and natural and supernatural. - Type - Research Article - Information [Journal of Southeast Asian Studies](/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies), [Volume 51](/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/volume/70A0126A06E9EB618D773F9917AD9B6C), [Issue 1-2](/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/issue/8E8326BB07DBF06942E35958447B8CF0), June 2020 , pp. 49 - 71 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 The National University of Singapore, 2020 Footnotes The author would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers of this article for their insightful comments and criticisms.
