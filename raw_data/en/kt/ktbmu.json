Our Legacy Since 1850, the building at 155 Queen Street East has proudly served the St. Marys community and surrounding areas. The brick-faced stone building which currently occupies the address was built in 1882 by Sidney Fraleigh and has operated as a pharmacy since. The McIntyre family were the pioneers of what would eventually become Hubbard Pharmacy. In the late 1960s, after the McIntyre's, the pharmacy became owned by Al Duesburry and later by Ron Sage. In 1989, upon the passing of Mr. Sage, Hubbard Pharmacy got its name after being purchased by Dwayne and Cathy Hubbard. In 2016 Erin Dunbar became a partner, and in March 2020 Hubbard Pharmacy was purchased by Erin and David Dunbar.
