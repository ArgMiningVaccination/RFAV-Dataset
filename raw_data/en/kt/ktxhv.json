Vol. 19-1 2PREFACE The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is an electronic-only, online monthly publication of the Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, Department of Administration, that is published pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rulem aking notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative documents affecting rules that ar e statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-related documen ts an agency may wa nt to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to p rovide public notice of all rul emaking actions and must invite public input. This is done through negotiated rulemaking procedures or after proposed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiate d proposed rulemaking procedu res through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a legal notice (Public Notice of Intent) that publishes in author ized newspapers throughout th e state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to participate w hen a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency, if none have been scheduled. Such s ubmissions or requests must be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" for ea ch proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, th e agency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed rule at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowth\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislati ve review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the ru lemaking that will be forwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when the agency adopts a temp orary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by th e calendar year and issue numbe r. For example, Bulletin 13-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2013; Bulletin 14-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2014 . Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 13-1 refers to January 2013; V olume No. 13-2 refers to February 2013; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin p ublished in January 2014 is cited as V olume 14-1. The December 2015 Bulletin is cited as V olume 15-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online co mpilation of all final and enf orceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full for ce and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codifi ed into the Administ rative Code upon becoming effective. All pending rules that have been approved by the le gislature during the legislati ve session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administ rative Code. These rules are co dified into the Administrative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending rules are not enforceab le, they are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into t he Administrative Code until approved as final. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index . Link to it on the Adminis trative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED I N THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Admi nistrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct r ulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions . At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet t he required statutory criteria and agencies must, when feasible, engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 December 4, 2019 - Vol. 19-1 21. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a proces s in which all interested persons and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule through dialogue. Agencies are required to conduct ne gotiated rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. The agency files a \"Notice of Int ent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" for publication in the Administrative Bulletin inviting interested persons to contact the agency if interested in discussing the agency's intentions regarding the rule changes. This process is intended to result in the for mulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of regular rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that re gular (proposed) rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is tak en by the agency. 2. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an actio n by an agency wherein the age ncy is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include very specific information regarding the rulemaking including all relevant state or federal statutory au thority occasioning the rul emaking, a non-technical description of the changes being made, any associated costs, gu idance on how to participate through submission of written comments and requests for public hearings, and the text of the proposed rule in legislative format. 3. TEMPORARY RULEMAKIN G Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds tha t it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or f ederal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of these criteria, and with t he Governor's approval, the agency may adopt and make a temporary rule effective prior to receiving legislative authorization and without allowing for any public input. The law allows an agency to make a temporary rule immediately e ffective upon adoption. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative sessi on unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a final rule, o r expires under its own terms. 4. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency und er regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review bef ore it becomes a final, enforc eable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule, a statement regarding when t he rule becomes effective, a description of how it differs from the proposed rule, and ide ntification of any fees being imposed or changed. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pending rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending ru le change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original noti ce was written so as to assure that member s of the public were reasonabl y notified of the su bject. It is not always necessary to re publish all the text of the pen ding rule. 5. FINAL RULEMAKINGA final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 7 December 4, 2019 - Vol. 19-1 2HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published i n the Idaho Administrative Bulletin a r e organized by a numbering schematic. Each state agency has a two -digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/nume rical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text i s divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An e 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Pr ocedures Act and are required by this act to be publi shed in the Idaho Administrativ e Code and the Idaho Adm inistrative Bulletin. 1. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Admi nistration's Division of Purch asing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of th e Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c.ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket numbe r is a series of by a \"-\", (the two-digit agency code) in the Bu lletin. The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket number: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-1401\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being publ ished; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2014. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2014 would be designated as \" 1402\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 1402. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affec ted are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"3 45\" and so on). Whenever the seq uence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 8 December 4, 2019 -

( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 454. WIRE ROPE. 01. General Characteristics. Wire rope comes in many grades and dimensions, and every rope has its own characteristics with regard to strength and resistance to crushing and fatigue. A larger rope will outlast a smaller rope of the same materials and construction, used in the same c onditions, because wear occurs over a larger surface. Similarly, a stronger rope will outlast a weaker rope, because it performs at a lower percentage of its breaking strength, with reduced stress. ( ) 02. Wire Rope Terms . Common grades of wire rope incl ude extra improved plow steel (EIPS) and swaged powerflex, among others. The following terms are commonl y used for wire rope: ( ) a. Abrasion Resistance. Ability of outer wires to resist wear. Abr asion resistance is greater with larger wires. ( ) b. Core. The foundation of a wire rope which is made of materials that will provide support for the strands under normal bending and loading conditions. A fiber co re (FC) can be natural or synthetic. If the core is steel, it can be a wire strand core (WSC) or an independent wir e rope core (IWRC). ( ) c. Crushing Resistance. Ability of the rope to resist being deform ed. A rope with an independent wire core is more resistant to crushing than one with a fiber core. ( ) d. Die-form Line. Made fr om strands that are first compacted by dr awing them th rough a drawing die to reduce their diameter. The fi nished rope is t hen swaged or f urther compressed. ( ) e. Fatigue Resistance. Ability of the rope to withstand repeated b ending without failure (the ease of bending a rope in an arc is called its \"bendability\"). Fatigue resistance is greater with more wires. ( ) f. Strength. Referred to as breaki ng strength, usually measured as a force in pounds or tons. The breaking strength is not the same as the load limit, which is c alculated as a fraction of the breaking strength to ensure safety. ( ) g. Swaged Line. Manufactured by runn ing a nominal-sized line through a drawing die to flatten the outer crown and thus reduce the rope diameter. This compacted r ope allows for increased drum capacity and increased line strength. ( ) 03. Typical Wire Rope Specifications . The table below lists a few examples of wire-rope breaking strengths.

Worksafe BC. Tabl e lists typical breaking strengths. See manufacturer's specifications for specific lines. ( ) 04. Synthetic Rope . High-tensile strength synthetic lines are considerably lighte r than standard wire rope; however, some lines are dimensionally as strong as standa rd wire rope. Accordingl y, high-tensile strength synthetic lines are permitted to be used in appropriate logging applications, including as substitutes for brush straps, tree straps, tail and intermediate support guylines, guyline extensions, skyline extensions, and haywire. Manufacturers' standards and recommendations for determining us able life or criteria for retirement of such lines shall be followed. Personnel shall examine the lines for broken or abraded strands, discoloration, inconsistent diameter, glossy or glazed areas caused by compression and heat , and other inconsistencies. Rope life is affected by load history, bending, abrasion, and chemical exposure. Most petroleum products do not affect synthetic ropes. ( ) 05. Inspection and Care . ( ) a. Wire rope shall be inspected daily by a qualified individual an d repaired or taken out of service when there is evidence of any of the following conditions: ( ) i. Twelve and five tenths percent (12.5%) of the wires are broke n within a distance of one (1) lay. ( ) ii. Evidence of chafing, sawing, crushing, kinking, crystallizat ion, bird-caging, corrosion, heat damage, or other damag e that has weakened the rope structure. ( ) b. Qualified personnel shall closel y inspect those points subject to the most wear, including the knob ends of lines, eye splices, and those sections of line that most often run through blocks or carriages. If there is doubt about the integrity of the line, it is far safer to replace a s uspect line, or cut ou t and resplice a def ective area, than ris k a failure during operation. Evaluation of the load-bearing yard er lines shall be stringent. A qualified person shall also inspect all other lines used on si te and remove any that are un safe. ( ) 06. Additional Precautions . The following precautions sha ll also be observed: ( ) a. Ensure the working load limit for any line is adequate for the intended use. ( )13/16 1.56 39.6 1.63 49.3 7/8 1.42 34.6 1.83 46.5 1.91 56.0 15/16 1.95 53.3 2.20 (tons)DIVISION OF BUILDING SAFE TY Docket No. 07-0801-1901 Idaho Minimum Safety Standards & Pract ices for Logging Adoption of Pending Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 71 December 4, 2019 - Vol. 19- 12b. The manufacturer's specificatio ns with regard to assigned break ing strength shall be followed. Such specifications as determined by engineering test results should factor the grade of the wire, number of strands, number of wires per strand, fille r wire construction, lay pattern of the wires, and the dia meter of the line. ( ) 07. Safety Factor . Operators shall follow the manufacturer's specifications in d etermining load limits. The working load limit is a fraction of a line's breaking stren gth - a factor of three (3), o r one-third (1/3) the breaking strength, is commonly used as a safety factor for running and s t a n d i n g l i n e s , w h e n w o r k e r s a r e n o t e x p o s e d t o breaking lines or loads passing overhead. A safety factor of th ree (3) is commonly used to determine the working load limit for a standing or running line. A standard six (6) x twen ty-six (26) IWRC wire rope with a diameter of one (1) inch has a breaking strength of approximately forty-five (45) t ons - divide by three (3) - equals fifteen (15) tons working load limit. ( ) 08. Wire Labeling . ( ) a. The elements of a typical wire r ope are labeled, for example, s ix (6) x twenty-five (25) FW PRF RL EIPS IWRC. The label indicates a six (6)-strand rope with twent y-five (25) wires per strand (six (6) x twenty-five (25)), filler-wire construction (FW), strands pre-formed in a h elical pattern (PRF), laid in a right-hand lay pattern (RL), using an extra-improved plow steel (EIPS) grade of wire, and strands laid around an independent wire rope core (IWRC). See figure 013.08-A for p roper labeling of wire rope. ( ) FIGURE 013.08-A ( ) b. Out of Service Standard Example. A six (6) x twenty-five (25) IWRC wire rope = six (6) strands in one (1) lay with twenty-five (25) wires per strand = one hundre d fifty (150) wires. The rope must be taken out of service when twelve and five ten ths percent (12.5%), or one-eig hth (1/8), of the wires are broken within the distance of one (1) lay = one hundred fifty (150) divided by eight (8) = eighteen and seventy-five one hundredths (18.75), or nineteen (19) broken wires. ( ) 09. Wire Line Life. Table 013.08-A provides the allowable life of a line in million board feet in accordance with line size and use.

Dynamic Loads . Operators shall consider high dynamic loads when calculating safe working limits of wire ropes. Wire ropes are often subjected to high dy namic loads, which greatly m ultiply the force on a line and may exceed the safe working li mit. Even a split second of t ime over the limit can lead t o premature failure of a line. Typical dynamic loads occur when a turn hits a stump, a turn comes down off of the back hillside to full suspension, or when excessive force is applied to pulling a tur nout of its bed. A high dynamic load or a sudden shock load that exceeds the working lim it may not result in immediate failure, but rope strands m ay stretch and weaken, and may fail at a later time. ( ) 11. Other Common Wire Rope Considerations . ( ) a. Wire Rope Stretching and Line Diameter. A stretched wire rope has a reduced diameter. Operators shall check for stretched lines by measuring the diameter, part icularly on older lines and any line used in stressful situations. ( ) b. Older Wire Rope. Standing lines and guylines are often kept in service for multiple years (four (4) to five (5), and as long as ten (10) years in some instances) w ithout exhibiting any obvious signs of excessive wear other than rust. Operators shall check date stamps of wire rope and evaluate line life. Operators shall also inspect the core of older lines periodically for a fractured or dry core, w hich could indicate other deficiencies such as broken wires, excessive wear, or line deformation. ( ) c. Hard Use. The life of a wire rope is also affected by hard use. Line life can be measured by the volume of wood hauled (see Table 013.08-A). Line life is reduced when a line exceeds its elastic limits, is heavily shocked, or rubbed against rocks or other lines. As a line wear s, the safe working load limit shall be lower and the payload adjusted appropriately. ( ) d. Wire Rope endurance and elastic limits. Working within the endu rance and elastic limits of lines can help preserve line life. The following principles shall be observed when evaluating the integrity and safe use of wire rope: ( ) i. The \"endurance limit\" for all lines is fifty percent (50%) of the breaking strength. If wire rope tensioning regularly e xceeds the endurance limit, the life of t he line is reduced through fatigue. ( ) ii. The \"elastic limit\" for all lines is sixty to sixty-five percent (60-65%) of the breaking strength. When a wire rope is loaded to its normal safe working limit, th e line stretches, but then returns to its original size when the load is released. If a load increases past the elastic limit through prolonged exertion or repeated stress, the line will stretch and stay stret ched, resulting in a perma nent reduction in the breaking strength. ( ) e. Lubrication and Abrasion. Wire rope is lubricated in the factor y to reduce internal friction and corrosion, and prolong the life of the rope. Heat from friction causes the internal lubrica nt to deteriorate. Friction occurs when the rope stretches u nder load, particularly in plac es where it bends around sheaves or other objects. An improperly lubricated line can p ick up particles of dirt and sa nd that will increase abrasi on. Accordingly, operators DIVISION OF BUILDING SAFE TY Docket No. 07-0801-1901 Idaho Minimum Safety Standards & Pract ices for Logging Adoption of Pending Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 74 December 4, 2019 - Vol. 19- 12shall: ( ) i. Check for and ensure the proper lubrication of all lines and wire rope, following the manufacturer's instructions. Commercial wire rope lubricants are available. ( ) ii. Carefully inspect lines for fau lts in areas where dust and s and may collect. ( ) iii. Store all wire rope and lines off the ground. ( ) 12. Line Connections. ( ) a. Inspection. Operators shall regul arly inspect shackles, hooks, splices, and other connecting equipment for damage and wear, as well as ensure the connectors are the correct type and size for the line and intended use. ( ) b. Wire Splicing. Splices are used to form an eye at the end of a line, extend the length of a line, or repair a broken or damaged line. The splicing of wire rope requires special skill and shall only be performed under the supervision of a competent person with using the proper tools. Reference materials are available with detailed instructions for numerous types of splices. Individuals splicin g wire shall always wear appropriate eye protection while splicing or assisting with a splicing procedure. ( ) c. The logger's eye splice and three (3)-pressed ey e are the most common methods to form an eye for use as a skyline terminal. See Figure 013.12-A. The spliced eye is approximately eighty percent (80%) efficient. A three (3)-pressed eye can reach n inety percent (90%) line stren gth. The pressed eye is typically performed at the rigging shop. Spliced eyes may be placed in the field, but may require additional time to install. ( ) FIGURE 013.12-A THE LOGGER'S When (Farme rs, Rolled) eye splices are used on load-bearing lines, the strand ends must be secured by: ( ) i. each strand three (3) or ( ) ii.

If the pending rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent resolution, the rule becomes final and ef fective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specified in the concurrent resolution. Upon legislative approval of this pending rule the amendments m ade in this docket will o verwrite those sections of the reauthorized rule promulgated under Docket No. 20-0000-1 900F, which will also be filed for review for final approval during the upcoming legislative session. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is here by given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is aut horized pursuan t to Sections 5 8-104(6) and 58-105, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise expl anatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the r easons for the change. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordance wit h Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. The pending rule was modified to correct a misspelling, provide more clarit y, and further shorten the rule in compliance with the Red Tape Reduction Act. The pending rule text is being republished in its entirety foll owing this notice. The text of the proposed rule was published in the September 4, 2019 Idaho Administrative Bulleti n, V ol. 19-9, pages 359-366. The pending rule adopts the changes initially proposed by IDL t hat update definitions and terminology to comport with the 2019 changes to Title 47, Chapter 15, Idaho Co de. IDL also proposed to remove mandatory participation for operators with less than 40 acres of disturba nce and less than $100,000 of reclamation liability and to allow operators to provide an alternative type of financial ass urance if it satisfies a minimum reclamation dollar per acre and is on an IDL form. Changes also raise the maximum limi tations on participation in the Reclamation Fund to 80 acres or $440,000 of reclamation liability. The Land Board would establish by policy the actual allowed acres and amount of reclamation liability per operator based on the fund' s required minimum balance and updated actuarial analysis. This will al low the Land Board t o expand access for participants when it becomes financially prudent.

The costs for processing encro achment permit applications for single-family docks, two-family docks, water-intake lines, and assignments exceed the current application fees collected. Increased fees for the se four types of applications are necessary to ensure fees cover the respective processing costs within the limitations provided in Section 58- 1307, Idaho Code. Further, Section 58-1305, Idaho Code, does not specify who should provide notice of application to adjacent property owners for all noncommercial navigational encroachments, and t he pending rule prescribes tha t the department shall provide notice. There are no changes to the pend ing rule and it is being adopted as originally proposed. The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the September 4, 2019 Idaho Admi nistrative Bulletin, V ol. 19-9, pages 367-372 .

The action is aut horized pursuant to Section 33 -1002G, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule: Section 33-1002G, Idaho Code was amended in 2018 to allow the c orresponding administrative rule (55.01.03) to be amended to allow for the added cost funding for Career Te chnical Schools to moved to an enrollment based formula. The Division of Career Technical Schools has worked fo r two years to get consensus on a new methodology for distributing added cost funds to Career Technical Schools. The have promulgated a proposed rule that is currently out for public comment and will be brought back as a pending ru le. In order to use the same methodology developed in the proposed rule during the current fiscal year they are re questing approval of a temporary rule. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, t he Governor ha s found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the foll owing reasons: This rule would confer a benefit to Idaho Career Technical Scho ols by allowing the FY20 funding allocated for these schools to be distributed based on student enrollment. This will allow for the funding to more closely follow the student generating the cost than the current methodology based on average daily attendance.

NUMERIC CRITERIA FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES FOR WATERS DESIGNATED F O R AQUATIC LIFE, RECREATION, OR DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY USE. 01. Criteria for Toxic Substances . The criteria of Section 210 apply to surface waters of the state as provided in Tables 1 and 2. (3-28-18) a. Table 1 contains criteria set for protection of aquatic life. Criteria for metals (arsenic through zinc) are expressed as dissolved frac tion unless otherwise noted. For purposes of these criteria, dissolved fraction means that which passes through a forty-five hundredths (0.45) micron filter. (3-28-18) Table 1.

The decision was made to remove the old tissue-based aquatic life crit eria and rely on the fish tissue criterion to provide prot ection for aquatic life as well as human health. Thus, current Idaho water quality stan- dards do not have mercury water column criteria for the protect ion of aquatic life. While EPA approved Idaho's adop- tion of the fish tissue criterio n in September 2005, it had wit hheld judgment on Idaho's remova l of aquatic life criteria. On December 12, 2008, EPA disapproved Idaho's removal of the ol d aquatic life criteria.

See definitions of Acute Criteria (CMC) and Chronic Criteria (C CC), Section 010 of these rules. c. Criteria for these metals are exp ressed as a function of the wa ter effect ratio, WER, as defined in Subsection 210.03.c.iii. CMC = CMC column value X WER. CCC = CCC column value X WER. d. Criterion expressed as total r ecoverable (unfiltered) concentra tions. e. No aquatic life criterion is adopted for inorganic mercury. How ever, the narrative criteria for toxics in Section 200 of these rules applies. The Depart ment believes application of the human health criterion for methylmercury will be protective of aquatic life in most situations. f. Aquatic life criteria for these me tals are a function of total hardness (mg/L as calcium carbonate), the pollutant's water effect ratio (WER) as de fined in Subsection 210.03.c.iii. and multiplied by an appropr iate dissolved conversion factor as defined in Subsection 210.02. For comparative purpose s only, the example values displayed in this table are shown as dissolved metal and co rrespond to a total hardness of one hundred (100) mg/L and a water effect ratio of one (1.0).g. Criteria are expressed as weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide. h. Total chlorine residual concentrations. i. Aquatic life criteria for pentachlorophenol are expressed as a function of pH, and are calculated as follows. Values displayed above in the tab le correspond to a pH of seven and eight tenths (7.8). CMC = exp(1.005(pH)-4.830) CCC = exp(1.005(pH)-5.290) j. PCBs are a class of chemicals wh ich include Aroclors, 1242, 125 4, 11096 825 and 12674112 respectively. The aquatic life criteria apply to this set of PCBs. k. Aquatic life criteria for coppe r shall be derived in accordance with Subsection 210.03.c.v.

Water column values are based on dissolved total selenium in water and are derived from fish tissue values via bioaccumulation modeling. Water column values are the applicabl e criterion element in the absence of steady-state condition fish tissue data. In fishless waters, selenium concen trations in fish from the nearest downstream waters may be used to assess complianc e using methods provided in Aquatic Life Ambient Water Quality Criterion for Sele- nium - Freshwater, EPA-822-R-16- 006, Appendix K: Translation of a Selenium Fish Tissue Criterion Element to a Site-Specific Water Column Value (June 2016) . 4. Intermittent Exposure Equation= where WQC is the applic able water column element, for either le ntic or lotic waters; Cbkgrnd is the average back- ground selenium concentration, and fint is the fraction of any 30-day period during which elevated sel enium concentra- tions occur, with fint assigned a value 0.033 ( corresponding to one day). m. There is no specific acute crite rion for aquatic life; however, the aquatic life criterion is based on chronic effects of the selenium on aquatic life and is expected to adequately p rotect against a cute effects.

Factors for Calculating Hard ness Dependent Metals Criteria . Hardness dependent metals criteria are calculate d using values from the following table i n the equations: (5-3-03) a. CMC=WER exp{mA[ln(hardness)]+bA} X Acute Conversion Factor. (5-3-03) b. CCC=WER exp{mc[ln(hardness)]+bc} X Chronic Conversion Factor.i. This fish tissue residue criteri on (TRC) for methylmercury is b ased on a human health re ference dose (RfD) of 0.0001 mg/kg body weight-day; a relative source contribution (R SC) estimated to be 27% of the RfD; a human body weight (BW) of 70 kg (for adults ); and a total fish consumption rate of 0.0175 kg/day for the general population, summed from trophic level (TL) breakdown of TL2 = TL4 = 0.0057 kg fish/day. This is a criterion th at is protective of the general population. A site-specific cri terion or a criterion for a par - ticular subpopulation may be calculated by using local or regio nal data, rather than the a bove default values, in the formula: TRC = [BW x {RfD - (RSCxRfD)}] / TL. In waters inhabit ed by species listed as t hreatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act or designated as their critica l habitat, the Department will apply the human health fish tissue residue criterion fo r methylmercury to the highest trophic level available for sampling and analysis. j.

Applicability . The criteria established in S ection 210 are subject to the ge neral rules of applicability in the same way and to the same extent as are the other numeric chemical criteria when applied to the same use classifications. Mixing zones may be applied to toxic substance criteria subject to the limitations set forth in Section 060 and set out below. (3-25-16) a. For all waters for which the Department has determined mixing z ones to be applicable, the toxic substance criteria apply at the boundary of the mixing zone(s) and beyond. Absent an authorized mixing zone, the toxic substance criteria apply throughout the waterbody includi ng at the end of any discharge pipe, canal or other discharge point. (3-25-16) b. Low flow design conditions. Water quality-based effluent limits and mixing zones for toxic substances shall be based on the following low flows in perenni al receiving streams. Numer ic chemical criteria may be exceeded in perennial streams outside any appl icable mixing zone only when flows are less than these values: (3-25-16) i. Where \"1Q10\" is the lowest one -day flow with an average recur rence frequency of once in ten (10) years determined hydrologically; (5-3-03) ii. Where \"1B3\" is biologically b ased and indicates an allowable exceedance of once every three (3) years. It may be determined by EP A's computerized method (DFLOW model); (5-3-03) iii. Where \"7Q10\" is the lowest average seven (7) consecutive da y low flow with an average recurrence frequency of once in ten (10) y ears determined hydro logically; (5-3-03) iv. Where \"4B3\" is biologically based and indicates an allowable exceedance for four (4) consecutive days once every three (3) years. It may be determined by EPA's computerized method (DFLOW model); (5-3-03) v. Where the harmonic mean flow is a long term mean flow value calculated by dividing the number Note to table: The term \"exp\" re presents the bas e e exponential function. Footnotes to table: a. Conversion factors (CF) are from \"Stephan, C. E. 1995. Derivati on of conversion factors for the calculation of dissolved freshwater aquatic life criteria for metals. U.S. Env ironmental Protection Agency, Environmental Research Laboratory - Duluth.\" The conver sion factors for cadmium and le ad are hardness-dependent and can be calculated for any hardness (see limitations in Subsection 210.03.b.i.) us ing the following equations. For comparative purposes, the conversion factors for a t otal hardness of one hundred (100 ) mg/L are shown in the table. The conversion factor shall not exceed one (1). Cadmium Acute: CF=1.136672-[(ln hardness)(0.041838)] NOTE: The cadmium acute criterion eq uation was derived from dissolved metals toxicity data and thus requires no conversion; this conversion factor may be used to back calculate an equivalent total recoverable concentration.

(5-3-03) c. Application of aquatic life metals criteria. (3-25-16) i. For metals other than cadmium , for purposes of calculating ha rdness dependent aquatic life criteria from the equations in Subsection 210.02, the minimum hardness a llowed for use in those equations shall not be less than twenty-five (25) mg/l, as cal cium carbonate, even if the actual ambient hardness is le ss than twenty-five (25) mg/ l as calcium carbonate. For cadmi um, the minimum hardness for u se in those equations shall not be less than ten (10) mg/l, as calcium carbonate. The m aximum hardness allowed for us e in those equations shall not be greater than four hundred (400) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, except as specified i n Subsections 210.03.c.ii. and 210.03.c.iii., even if the actual ambient hardness is great er than four hundred (400) mg/l as calcium carbon ate. (3-29-10) ii. The hardness values used for calculating aquatic life criter ia for metals at design discharge conditions shall be representative of the ambient hardnesses fo r a receiving water that occur at the design discharge conditions given in Subsection 210.03.b. (5-3-03) iii. Except as otherwise noted, the aquatic life criteria for me tals (arsenic through zinc in Table 1 in Subsection 210.01) are expressed as dissolved metal concentrations. Unless otherwise specified by the Department, dissolved concentrations are considered to be concentrations recovered from a sample which has passed through a forty-five hundredths (0.45) micron filter. For the purposes of calculating aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in footnotes c. and f. in Table 1 in Subsection 210.01, the water effect ratio i s computed as a specific pollutant's acute or chronic toxi city values measured in water from the site covered by the standard, divided by the respective acute or chronic toxicity value in laboratory diluti on water. The water-effect ratio shall be assigned a value of one (1.0), except where the Department assigns a different v alue that protects the design ated uses of the water body from the toxic effects of the pollutant, and is derived from su itable tests on sampled water representative of conditions in the affected water body, consistent with the design discharge conditions established in Subsection 210.03.b. For purposes of calculating water effects ratios, the term acute toxicity value is the toxicity test results, such as the concentration lethal one-half (1/2) of the test organism s (i.e., LC5O) after ninet y-six (96) hours of exposure (e.g., fish toxicity tests) or the effect concentration to one- half of the test organisms, (i.e., EC5O) after forty-eight (48) hours of exposure (e.g., daphnia toxicity tests). For purposes of calculating water effects r atios, the term chronic value is the result from appropriate hyp othesis testing or regression analysis of measurements of growth, reproduction, or survival from life cycle, partia l life cycle, or early life sta ge tests. The determination of acute and chronic values shall be according to current standard protocols (e.g., those published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)) or other comparable me thods. For calculation of criteri a using site-specific values for both the hardness and the water effect ratio, the hardness used in the equations in S ubsection 210.02 shall be as required in Subsection 210.03.c.ii. Water hardness shal l be calculated from the measur ed calcium and magnesium ions present, and the ratio of calcium to magnesium shall be approximately the same in labo ratory toxicity testing water as in the site water, or be similar to av erage ratios of laborato ry waters used to deriv e the criteria. (3-28-18) iv. Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria. (4-6-05) (1) The \" Implementation Guidance for the Id aho Mercury Water Quality Cri teria\" describes in detail suggested methods for discharge related monitoring requirements , calculation of reasonable potential to exceed (RPTE) water quality criteria in determining need for mercury effluent limits, and use of fish tissue mercury data in calculating mercury load reductions. This guidance, or its upda tes, will provide assistance to the Department and the public when implementing the methylmercury criterion. The \"Impl ementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria\" also provides basic background information on mercury in the environment, the novelty of a fish tissue criterion for water quality, the connection between human health and aquatic life pro tection, and the relation of environmental programs outside o f Clean Water Act programs to r educing mercury contamination of the environment. The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria \" is available at the Department of Environmental Quality, 1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho 83706, and on the DEQ website at www.deq.idaho.gov . (4-6-05) (2) The implementation of a fish tissue criterion in NPDES permits and TMDLs requires a non- traditional approach, as the basic criterion is not a concentra tion in water. In applying the methylmercury fish tissue criterion in the context of NPDES effluent limits and TMDL load reductions, the Department will assume change in fish tissue concentrations of methylmercury are proportional to change in water body loading of total mercury. DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-1901 Water Quality Standards Adoption of Pending Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 191 December 4, 2019 - Vol. 19-12Reasonable potential to exceed (RP TE) the fish tissue criterion for existing NPDES sources will be based on measured fish tissue concentratio ns potentially affected by the discharge exceeding a specified threshold value, based on uncertainty due to measurement variability. This threshold v alue is also used for TMDL decisions. Because measured fish tissue concentrations do not reflect the effect o f proposed new or increased discharge of mercury, RPTE in these cases will be base d upon an estimated fish tissue methylmercury concentr ation, using projected changes in waterbody loading of total mercury and a proportiona l response in fish tissue mercury. For the above purposes, mercury will be measured in the skinless filets of sp ort fish using techniques capable of detecting tissue concentrations down to point zero five (0.05) mg/kg.

The pending rule becomes final and effective upon the conc lusion of the legislative session, unless the rule is appr oved or rejected in part by con current resolution in acco rdance with Section 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. If the pending rule is approved or rej ected in part by concurrent resolution, the rule becomes final and full force and effect upon adoption of the co ncurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is here by given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is aut horized pursuant to Chapters 1 and 36, Title 39, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise expl anatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the r easons for the change. This pending rule adopts and re-publishes the following existin g and previously approved and codified chapter under IDAPA 58 rules of the Depar tment of Environmental Quality : IDAPA 58.01.03, Individual/Subsu rface Sewage Disposal Rules This rulemaking also includes revisions in response to Executive Order No. 2019-02 , Red Tape Reduction Act, issued by Governor Little on January 21, 2019. DEQ proposes to combine IDAPA 58.01.15, Rules Governing the Cleaning of Septic Tanks, with IDAPA 58.01.03, Individual/Subsu rface Sewage Disposal Rules, by moving IDAPA 58.01.15, Sections 003 and 004, into IDAPA 58.01.03 as new sect ions 050 and 051. When IDAPA 58.01.03 and IDAPA 58.01.15 were adopted as temporary rules in May 2019 and then published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, it was DEQ's intent to follow up with publication of two separate proposed rules. However, upon review of its administrative rules, DEQ det ermined that the two rule chap ters could be consolidated into a single chapter. Temporary rule IDAPA 58.01.15 w ill expire upon conclusion of th e 2020 legislative session. The proposed rule was published in the September 4, 2019 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, V o l . 1 9 - 9 , p a g e s 6 1 0 through 637. DEQ received no public comments, and the rule has been adopte d as initially proposed. The proposed rule includes non-substantive clerical revisions made by the Ad ministrative Rules Coordinator using his authority under Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5202. \"The coordinator shall have the aut hority to make clerical revisions or to correct manifest typographical or grammatical errors to both proposed a nd existing rules that do not alter the sense, meaning or effect of such rules.\" Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5202(2). The revision s are consistent with Executive Order No. 2019-02 , and did not alter the sense, meaning or effect of the rules (i.e., elimination of restrictive words such as \"shall\"). More information regarding this rule docket is available at www.deq.idaho.gov/58-0103-1902 . FISCAL IMPACT: The fo llo wing is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: This rulemaking is not anticipated to have any fiscal impact on the state general fund because the FY 2020 budget has already been set by the Legislature, and approved by the Governor, an ticipating the existence of the rules and fees being reaut horized by this rulemaking.
