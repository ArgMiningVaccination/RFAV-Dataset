The IHS provides comprehensive primary health care and disease prevention services to approximately 2. 6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a network of over 605 hospit als, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations. Facilities are predominantly located in rural primary care settings and are managed by IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs. United States Government and Indian Nations The provision of federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives is based on a special relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States. The Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, as well as numerous treaties and court decisions, have affirmed this special relationship and the plenary power of Congress to create statutes that benefit Indian people. Principal among these statutes is the Snyder Act of 1921, which provides the basic authority for health services prov ided by the Federal Government to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Indian Health Service and Its Partnership with Tribes In the 1970s, federal Indian policy was re -evaluated leading to adoption of a policy of Indian self - determination. This policy promotes Tribal administration of Federal Indian programs, including health care. Self -Determination does not lessen any federal obligation, but provides an opportunity for Tribes to assume the responsibility of providing health care for their members. IHS partners with Tribes on health care delivery in the context of regular Tribal consultation. The Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as amended, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 (IHCIA), as amended, provided new opportunities for the IHS and Tribes to deliver quality and accessible health care. The IHCIA includes specific authorizations such as improvements for urban Indian health programs, Indian health professions programs, and the aut hority to collect from Medicare and Medicaid and other third -party insurers for services rendered at IHS or Tribal facilities. Under the ISDEAA, many Tribes have assumed the administrative and program matic roles previously carried out by the Federal G overnment. Tr ibes currently administer over half of IHS resources through ISDEAA contracts and compacts. The IHS directly administers the remaining resources and manages programs where Tribes have chosen not to contract or compact health programs. CJ - 1 INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE Fiscal Year 202 1 Budget Submission to Congress Overview of Budget The fiscal year (FY) 202 1 Indian Health Service (IHS or Agency ) Budget supports the Agency's three strategic goals: 1) ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people; 2) promot e excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization; and 3) strengthen IHS program management and operations . These goals guide the strategies and objectives IHS will carry out to achieve the agency mission to raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of A I/ANs t o the highest level. The Budget conveys the Administration' s strong support of health care needs of AI/ANs, and includes key proposals to improve the management and operations of HIS, and recruit and retain quality health care professionals. The Budget di rectly supports the President's agenda to address the Nation's priorities through careful investments of taxpayer resources and furthers the Administration's initiative to end the HIV epidemic in America. The Budget invests in the new Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Improving Maternal Health in America Initiative to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. Specifically, HHS is developing a cross-agency approach to improve maternal health focu sed on four strategic goals to1) Achieve Healthy Outcomes for All Women of Reproductive Age by improving prevention and treatment, 2) Achieve Healthy Pregnancies and Births by prioritizing quality improvement, 3) Achieve Healthy Futures by optimizing post -partum health, and 4) Improve Data and Bolster Research to inform future interventions. The Budget also supports the HHS Secretary's priorit ies 1 to combat the opioid crisis (e.g., by increasing access to treatment and reducing opioid overdose -related deaths through prevention, treatment, and recovery services); transform the nation's healthcare system to a value-based system (e.g., enhanced focus on patient control over health information through interoperable and accessible he alth information technology. The IHS provides a wide range of clinical, public health, community, and facilities infrastructure services to approximately 2. 6 million AI/ANs who are members of 57 4 federally recognized tribes in 37 states. Comprehensive primary health care and disease prevention services are provided through a network of over 605 hospitals, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations . These facilities are predominately primary care settings and are managed by IHS, tribal, an d urban (I/T/U) Indian health programs. The IHS meets the annual statutory requirement to consult with, and solicit the participation of, AI/AN Tribes and tribal organizations in the development of the budget for IHS. Likewise, IHS confers with urban Indian organizations. The consultation and confer input informs the IHS budget formulation process. The core of the agency's formulation process consists of the priorities and recommendations developed in consultation with Tribes through this independent annual budget process led by the National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup. 2 IHS is strongly committed to this process and it ensures that th e IHS budget is relevant to the health needs and priorities of AI/AN s. The tribal priorities identified in the 1 https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/priorities/index.html 2 The requirements for consultation are contained in statutes and various Presidential Executive orders including the: Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law (P.L.) 93 -638 as amended; Indian Health Care Improvement Act, P.L. 94 -437, as amended; Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies from President William J. Clinton, April 29, 1994; Presidential Executive Order 13084, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, May 14, 1998; Presidential Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, November 6, 2000; and Presidential Memorandum, Government-to- Government Relationship with Tribal Gover nments, September 23, 2004. CJ - 2 consultation process are also instrumental to inform senior officials of other U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies of the health needs of the AI/AN population, so that they have the opportunity to reflect those priorities in the Department's budget requests. The tribal budget consultation process is a key component of the IHS strategic objectives to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships (Objective 1.2); improve communication wi thin the organization, with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public (Objective 3.1); and secure and effectively manage the assets and resources (Objective 3.2); objectives that advance the IHS mission . Summa ry of Budget Submission The total discretionary budget authority for IHS is $ 6.4 billion, an increase of $ 185 million 3 above the FY 2020 Enacted. Major changes include: Current Services (fixed costs): +$ 42.4 million to address increases in costs for medical inflation. Unfunded, these costs reduce IHS 's buying power and reduce funds available for patient care and oversight. Staffing and Operating Costs for Newly -Constructed Health Care Facilities: +$ 36.6 million for staffing of four newly -constructed health care facilities built through the Joint Venture Construction Program. These funds will allow new facilities to expand the provision of health care in areas where the existing capacity is overextended. New Tribe: +$2.6 million to fund direct health care services for the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Montan a which was federally recognized on December 20, 2019. Electronic Health Record Modernization : +$117.0 million for Electronic Health Record (EHR) system modernization. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced changes to discontinue use and support for the VA Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) . To avoid negatively impacting IHS and tribal programs , which are reliant on VistA for the core of IHS's current EHR - the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) , IHS must pursue modernization of its Health Information Technology (HIT) and it s EHR . This project will continue work begun in FY 2019 to augment, upgrade, or replace the IHS EHR system with a modern system capable of support for the delivery of care, revenue generation, and interoperability. ISDEAA Section 105(l ) Leases: +$101.0 million for compensation of reasonable operating costs associated with facilities leased or owned by Tribes and Tribal organizations for carrying out health programs under ISDEAA contracts and compacts as required by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324( l). The Budget proposes a new indefinite discretionary appropriation account, Payments for Tribal Leases, and reforms to improve management of lease payments. HIV, HC V, and Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Initiative: +$ 27.0 million to enhance HIV testing and linkages to care in support of the Ending the HIV Epidemic : A Plan for America. The Initiative would also provide treatment and case management services to prevent and treat HC V infection due to injection drug use and fund data collection to measure outcomes. This funding will also provide overall support for STD data surveillance and enhancements and provides supplementary resources for Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs). 3 Increase based on the FY 2020 CBO score for Contract Support Costs of $820 million. CJ - 3 Quality and Oversight: +$4.9 million for continued progress and focus on quality and IHS administrative and management oversight. To ensure a culture of reliability is developed and sustained , and that systems and processes are performed as intended consistently over time, IHS must invest in a program of national quality improvement and oversight. With th ese investments, IHS can better provide consistent quality and evidence -based care across its system with a focus on clinical excellence and patient -centered care. HIS's goal is to provide satisfying, efficient, and effective care to our patients and honor the Nation's commitment to AI/ANs. These funds will provide key resources for the Office of Quality to build out its national capabilities , enforce consistency in quality across the IHS system, and improve access and analysis of program and administrative data. Recruitment and Retention: +$ 11.5 milli on to support of a range of recruitment and retention strategies aimed to enhance and support the mission of the IHS. Initiatives include providing housing subsidies and Title 38 compensation to more eligible providers , increaseing the number of IHS Loan Repayment, Scholarship awards, and supplemental loan repayment, and support for the expansion of IHS recruitment and outreach activities. Improving Maternal Health in America: +$5 million to provide new funding to support IHS preventative, perinatal, and postpartum care ; address the needs of pregnant women with opioid or other substance use disorder; and improve quality services and health outcomes in order to reduce maternal morbidity by 50 percent. Maximizing Technology to Increase Access to Care: +$2.9 million for the expansion of the Telebehavioral Health Center of Excellence, which will increase access to health care services. This funding will expand the capabilities of the Center to assist with accessing a wider variety of care by IHS patient s in rural or isolated locations . Health Care Facilities Construction : +$106 million will continue to make progress on the Health Care Facilities Priority Projects. Th ese facilities will improve access to medical care and facilitate the collaboration and partnership between tribes and the IHS. Staff Quarters: +$20.0 million to fund the replacement and the addition of new staff quarters in isolated and remote locations to enhance and improve the recruitment and retention of quality healthcare professionals. Contract Support Costs (CSC): +$35.0 million for the estimated increase in CSC associated with the requested increases in health care programs and services reflected in this budget, which would be transferred to Tribes and Tribal organizations through ISDEAA contracts and compacts, as required by law. Program Adjustments: -$163.5 million to maximize funding through Services and Facilities to protect direct patient care services. CJ - 4 Overview of Agency Performance The IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 sets the direction of the agency over the next five years and includes a mission and vision statement, three goals, and eight objectives.1 IHS's strategic goals are focused on: access to care, quality of care, and strengthening management and operations . The FY 2021 budget supports the three IHS strategic goals and improvement of AI/AN health outcomes in some of the following ways:2 Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. The Hospitals and Health clinics budget line supports the bulk of the agency's clinical measures, including, maintaining or exceeding targets for childhood and adult immunizations, breast feeding rates, and critical health screenings. IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 (IHS SP) Objective 1.3, Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022 (HHS SP) Objective 2.2, Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions. Funding for dental he alth maintains access to dental services and preventive procedures such as, dental sealants and topical fluorides. IHS SP Objective 1.3; HHS SP Objective 2.1, Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living. Funding for the Alcohol and Substa nce Abuse and Mental Health budgets support five screening measures to promote early intervention. IHS SP Objective 1.3; HHS SP Objective 2.3, Reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and r ecovery support. The Special Diabetes Program for Indians monitors and reports several clinical diabetes care measures. IHS SP Objective 1.3; HHS SP Objective 2.2. In FY 2021, IHS anticipates the opening of two newly constructed healthcare facilities. IH S SP Objective 1.3; HHS SP Objective 1.3, Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options. Goal 2: To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organiz ation. IHS ambulatory care facilities are required to obtain Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) certification/designation by December 31, 2021. The PCMH models of care promote care standardization across the agency. IHS SP Objective 2.1, Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization; HHS SP Objective 1.3. Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations. IHS, Tribes, Tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations provide critical health care servi ces. IHS continues to strengthen tribal consultation and urban confer efforts to ensure stakeholders have the opportunity to provide input and are informed of system or policy changes. IHS SP Objective 3.1, Improve communications within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public; HHS SP Objective 1.3. IHS continues to improve business processes to inform decision making and strengthen partnerships to maximize patient health care options . IHS SP Objective 3.2, Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources; HHS SP Objective 1.3. 1 See the \"IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 Goals and Objectives\" diagram at the end of this section . The IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 is Strategic Plan FY the HHS Plan Strategic Plan Strategic Plan and IHS Strategic Plan Crosswalk , the plans are aligned according to strategic objectives. The IHS FY 2021 budget support s the IHS and HHS Strategic Plan objectives, as referenced in italics below. CJ - 5 In FY 2021, IHS will continue Electronic Health Record (EHR) system modification efforts will ultimately replace IHS's current medical, health, and billing records systems. The information technology infrastructure is central to management and operations of the health care system. IHS SP Objective 1.2, Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships; IHS SP Objective 3.3, Modernize informa tion technology and information systems to support data driven decisions; HHS SP Objective 5.3, Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals. The FY 2021 budget request provides critical support in assuring the availability and expansion of health care services, assuring the quality of services, and in providing operational support for the Indian health care system. In addition to the above ref erenced budget measures, IHS has implemented the following performance reporting and management processes to monitor agency progress. Performance Reporting The IHS budget measures support the agency's strategic goals and objectives and are focused on monitoring population health (clinical measures) and strategies to assess program trends and management (non-clinical measures). The FY 2021 budget includes several budget related measures as reported in each narrative and in the outcomes and outputs tables, evaluation results may also be reported in the narrative sections . IHS reports valid and reliable aggregated clinical measures using a centralized reporting system to meet the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA) requirements . IHS annually reports GPRA/ GPRAMA clinical measure results. Tribes administer over 63.2 percent of IHS resources through I SDEAA contracts and compacts and may choose to participate in IHS GPRA/GPRAMA performance reporting. Many Tribal programs operate EHR systems that differ from the IHS EHR, Resource and Patient Management System ( RPMS). Since 2002, IHS has reported electronic population level results for GPRA/GPRAMA clinical measures. Over time, as more Tribes assumed responsibility of providing health care for their members and adopted non- RPMS EHR systems , the agency's clinical performance measure results primarily reflected IHS programs. Prior to FY 2018, IHS clinical measure results reflected only RPMS data as non-RPMS data could not be verified or validated for budget -related performance reporting . Beginning in FY 2018, the IHS clinical results were reported from a new system, the Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM) . 3 The IDCS DM provides those Tribes using non- RPMS EHRs the opportunity to report data for GPRA/GPRAMA purposes ; reporting is optional for Tribes . The IDCS DM calculates measure results using any data (RPMS, non-RPMS or Fiscal Intermediary) submitted to the IHS National Data Warehouse (NDW) and assures reporting of valid and reliable clinical measure results. The FY 2018 clinical GPRA/GPRAMA measure results are reported from the IDCS DM and reflect aggregated Federal, T ribal, and urban (I/T/U) results. Tribal programs have the option to participate in IDCS DM reporting and aggregated results include participating Tribal programs. The FY 2021 budget request includes anticipated targets based on most recent year results . 3 The IDCS DM uses all data exported to the NDW, including non -RPMS tribal and urban data. B udget measures previously reported from RPMS cannot be compared to IDCS DM results because: IDCS DM standardizes the use of user population estimates as the denominator for clinical GPRA/GPRAMA measures, and the reporting year changes from July 1 -June 30 ( GPRA/GPRAMA year) to October 1 -September 30 (to match the user population estimate report year). CJ - 6 Performance Management IHS cascades performance goals and objectives and performance-related metrics agency -wide, and aligns them with the agency's strategic plan. Specific measures cascade from senior executive performance plans to those of subordinate managers and supervisors. From there they cascade into employee performance plans, which ensures that performance of all employees relates to key agency performance objectives. Agency leadership periodically reviews progress in meeting these agency performance objectives, holding regular discussions with senior executives to identify challenges to success and determine feasible solutions. Agency leadership then implements those solutions, making specific adjustments or taking corrective actions that eliminate or minimize obstacles preventing the achievement of desired results. The connection between performance objectives, performance measures, and employee accountability enables agency leadership to direct the efforts of the workforce more accurately, and to make more informed and effective decisions. The impact is greater success in meeting the full array of agency mission requirements.

SUMMARY OF THE BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2021 Indian Health Service (IHS) Budget submission for Clinical Services of $4.2 billion is $243.0 million above the FY 2020 Enacted level. Included in this budget is funding of $30.8 million for Staffing of New and Replacement Healthcare Facilities, $2.6 million for New Tribes, $117.0 million for Electronic Health Record modernization , $27.0 million for the elimination of HIV/HCV in Indian country , $3.5 million for recruitment and retention efforts, $5.0 million for the Improving Maternal Health in America , $32.5 million for medical inflation , and $1 42.8 million in adjustments to maximize funding for direct patient care services. The detailed explanation of the request is described in each of the budget narratives that follow this summary . Hospitals and Health Clinics , supports essential personal health services and community based disease prevention and health promotion services. Health services includ e: inpatient care, routine and emergency ambulatory care; and medical support services including laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, medical reco rds, physical therapy, and other services . Specialized programs are conducted to address: diabetes; maternal and child health ; youth services; communicable diseases including human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV), tubercul osis, and hepatitis ; women's and men's health; geriatric health ; disease surveillance; and healthcare quality improvement. Electronic Health Record (EHR) , holds an extremely high degree of mission criticality given the ability to provide much -anticipated clinical and administrative capabilities used in modern systems for the delivery of timely and impactful healthcare. Expected benefits from adopting and implementing a modernized or new system include but are not limited to improved patient safety, improved patient outcomes, better disease management, enhanced population health, improved clinical quality measures, opioid tracking, patient data exchange, third party revenue generation, agency performance reporting, etc. By identifying and properly selecting the best match for proposed system capabilities, the system will support the IHS mission. Additionally, the IHS aims to obtain interoperability with the Department of Veteran's Affairs, Department of Defense, t ribal and urban Indian 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, f or impacted f unds. CJ - 64 health programs, academic affiliates, and community partners, many of whom are on different Health Information Technology platforms. The IHS must consider an integrated EHR system solution that will allow for a meaningful integration to create a system that serves IHS/Trib al/Urban beneficiaries in the best possible way. Dental Health , supports preventive care, basic care, and emergency care, with approximately 90 percent of services covering basic and emergency care. Basic services are prioritized over more complex rehabilitative care such as root canals, crown s and bridge s, dentures, and surgical extractions. The demand for dental treatment remains high due to high dental caries rate in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children; however, a continuing emphasis on community oral health promotion and disease prevention is essential to impact long-term improvement of the oral health of AI /AN people. Mental Health, supports a community -oriented clinical and preventive mental health service program that provides outpatient mental health and related services, crisis triage, case management, prevention programming, and outreach services. Alcohol and Substance Abuse , supports an integrated behavioral health approach to collaboratively reduce the incidence of alcoholism and other drug dependencies in AI/AN communities. Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) , supports the purchase of essential health care services not available in IHS and Tribal healthcare facilities including inpatient and outpatient care, routine emergency ambulatory care, transportation, specialty care services (mammograms, colono scopies, etc.), and medical support services (e.g., laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, physical therapy, etc.). The demand for PRC remains high as the cost of medical care increases. The PRC program continues to emphasize adherence to medical priorities, enrolling patient s in alternate resources available to them (such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance), negotiating discounted rates with medical providers, and implementing improvements recommended by Tribes and oversight authorities. The majority of clinical services funds are provided to 12 Area (regional) Offices that distribute resources, monitor and evaluate activities, and provide administrative and technical support to approximately 2. 6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a network of over 605 hospitals, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations 2 in service areas that are rural, isolated, and underserved. Performance Summary Table The following long -term performance measures are considered overarching because they are accomplished through a variety of programs and activities in the IHS Services budget. 2 Previous number of 850 from the Fiscal Year 2019 Congressional Justification represents buildings owned by IHS and/or tribes through Village Built Clinics and tribally -owned facilities.

The Indian Health Service ( IHS) provides medical and surgical inpatient care, routine and emergency ambulatory care, and medical support services including laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, medical records, and physical therapy. The IHS direct health care services supports the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 and integrates the Department's Strategic Goal to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018- 2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living, 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions , 2.3 Reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery, & 2.4 Prepare for and respond to public health emergencies ). The IHS and tribes primarily serve small, rural populations with primary medical care and community health services, relying on the private sector for much of the secondary and most of the tertiary medical care needs. Some IHS and tribal hospitals provide secondary medical services such as ophthalmology, orthopedics, infectious disease, emergency medicine, radiology, general and gynecological surgery, and anesthesia. The IHS system of care is unique in that personal health care services are integrated with community health services. The program includes public/community health programs targeting health conditions disproportionately affecting AI/AN populations such as diabetes, maternal and child health, and communicable diseases including influenza, human immunodeficiency 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, for impacted funds. CJ - 67 virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ), and viral hepatitis. T he health status of AI/AN people has improved significantly in the past 60 years since IHS's inception. However, AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy that is 5.5 years less than the U.S. all races population, 73.0 years to 78.5 years, respectively .2 More than 60 percent of the H&HC budget is transferred under P.L. 93 -638 contracts or compacts to tribal governments or tribal organizations that design and manage the delivery of individual and community health services through 22 hospitals, 285 health centers, 54 health stations , 127 Alaska village clinics , and five school health centers. The remainder of the H&HC budget is managed by direct federal programs that provide health care at the service unit and community level. The federal system consists of 24 hospitals (23 hospitals have emergency departments) , 50 health centers, 24 health stations , and 11 school health centers. Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting health informatio n is done through a network of t ribally - operated epidemiology centers in collaboration with a national IHS coordinating center leading to the identification of health conditions as well as promoting interventions. Information technology supports personal health services (including the E lectronic Health Record and telemedicine) and public health initiatives (such as Baby Friendly Hospitals and Improving Patient Care ) that are primarily funded through the H&HC budget (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022, Goal 4, Objective 4.1 Foster sound, sustained advances in the sciences). The H&HC funds provide critical support for direct health care services, ensures comprehensive, culturally appropriate services, provides available and accessible personnel , promotes excellence and quality through impl emented quality improvement strategies, and strengthens the IHS program management and operations to raise the health status of AI/AN populations to the highest level ( IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , , and Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. ; Goal 2, Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization and Objective 2.2: Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities ; and Goal 3, Objective 3.1: Improve communicatio n within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public , Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources , and Objective 3.3: Modernize information technology and inform ation systems to support data driven decisions; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high- quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs; Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living, 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and ch ronic conditions, 2.3 Reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery, & 2.4 Prepare for and respond to public health emergencies ; Goal 3, Objective 3.2 Safeguard the public against preventable injuries and violence of their results, 3.3 Support strong families and healthy marriage, and prepare children and youth for healthy, productive lives , & 3.4 Maximize the independence, well-being, and health or older adults, people with disabilit ies, and their families and caregivers; Goal 4, Objective 4.1 Improve surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory services; Goal 5, Objective 5.1 Ensure responsible financial management , 5.2 Manage human capital to achieve the HHS mission, 5.3 Optimize information technology investments to improve 2 Data comparing the AI/AN population to the U.S. general population are documented and updated annually by the IHS .

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The following are brief examples of specific activities funded through H&HC that help to improve the quality of services throughout the IHS healthcare system: Quality -In FY 2019, IHS elevated and institutionalized the goals and objectives included in the new IHS Strategic Plan that will guide quality improvement and patient safety efforts over the next several years. The OQ was established in FY 2019 and is actively leading quality and patient safety work from IHS Headquarters, including oversight of policy and accreditation standards, implementation of quality improvement strategies, and monitoring accountability of federally -operated facilities. The IHS is working to appropriately staff the Office, which is subject to fundi ng and hiring processes. To provide oversight of quality and safety of care at federally operated facilities, the OQ has identified four divisions: 1) Quality Assurance; 2) Patient Safety and Clinical Risk Management; 3) Innovation and Improvement, and, 4) Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls. The establishment of the OQ meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization; IHS Strategic Plan Goal Three To Strengthen IHS program management and operations; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The OQ FY 2019 activities and accomplishments include the following: Quality Assurance -The OQ Division of Quality Assurance has focused intently on ensuring quality of care in IHS facilities through external accreditation and certification. The OQ supports all IHS facilities through collaboration, assistance and participation in the facility Mock Survey process. Mock surveys use the accreditation standards to evaluate facility preparedness to ensure a state of continual readiness to achieve accreditation standards to provide high quality safe patient care. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. In FY 2019, the OQ supported and provided assistance to IHS facilities in all 12 IHS Areas to achieve and maintain accreditation standards, including Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), The Joint Commission (TJC) Hospital, Ambulatory, Behavioral Health and Critical Assess Hospital Standards as well as Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) and Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH). As of FY 2019, 97 percent of all IHS hospitals have received CMS certification. The remaining non -certified hospital has submitted its certification application to CMS. The Joint Commission (TJC) has provided external accreditation for 75 percent of all IHS hospitals. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition; and, the HHS CJ - 69 Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.3, Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options. Increased focus on quality measurement has improved the IHS ability to monitor and report on compliance with policy requirements, accreditation standards, and regulations. In FY 2018, IHS implemented a National Accountability Dashboard for Quality (NAD-Q) , standardization of practitioner credentialing and privileging software, and accreditation and re -accreditation hospital and ambulatory health center support. The NAD-Q is monitored at the service unit, area, and headquarters level to continuously offer performance capability and assistance. The NAD-Q currently consists of nine measures linked to accountability for compliance with IHS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), or Accrediting Organization requirements related to quality and safety of healthcare delivery services. IHS federally operated hospitals and ambulatory health centers report results on a quarterly basis in the following areas: quality (efficient, effective and equitable); accreditation; workforce; patient -centered care; safety; and timely care. IHS senior leadership monitors results and reports are publicly available on the IHS web site: https://www.ihs.gov/quality/ . In FY 2019, IHS has completed quarterly reporting starting with the 4 th quarter of FY 2017. IHS uses existing facility governance structures and processes to address performance improvement. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. This activity also meets the Presidents Management Agenda Cross Agency Priority Goal 2: Leveraging data as a strategic asset. Patient Safety -The OQ purchased Datix software, an adverse event reporting system, to replace WebCident. WebCident was initially developed by IHS in 2002 as a worker injury reporting system and was modified over time to assist in medication and patient safety event tracking. However, due to WebCident limitations, which include a restricted focus on patient safety reporting and limited data analytic capability, and with limited staff and budget resources to effectively support the system, the Agency made the decision to transition to a new adverse event reporting system. The Division of Patient Safety and Clinical Risk Management is managing the piloting of the new software, which occurred December 4 -18, 201 9 at Red Lake Hospital (Bemidji Area), Crow/Northern Cheyenne Hospital (Billings Area) and Pawnee Indian Health Center (Oklahoma City Area) , with system -wide training and deployment is anticipated to follow in January 2020. This activity meets the IHS Stra tegic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2, Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. In FY 2019, the OQ also provided guidelines to all IHS Area facilities to improve patient safety and compliance with new and upcoming US Pharmacopeia (USP) requirements for compounding sterile preparations. In addition, the OQ has collaborated with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide infection control training to IHS areas to help meet industry standards for infection control, including sterilization and decontamination of surgical instruments used in patient care with in hospitals, ambulatory care and dental facilities . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic O bjective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The IHS has modernized its credentialing and privileging processes to facilitate the hiring of qualified practitioners. The credentialing process evaluates the qualifications and practice history CJ - 70 of a provider such as training, residency, and licensing. Privileging authorizes a healthcare practitioner to practice within a specified scope of patient care services. The OQ manages the rollout and trainin g of the new software system, which provides a centralized electronic database and standardization of credentialing data. The OQ continues to monitor processes and system changes for improvements. This is a critical effort in facilitating the timely hiring of appropriately qualified providers and ensuring patient safety. The improved credentialing and privileging process meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Three, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal Five, Strategic Objective 5.3, Optimize information technology investments to improve efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals. IHS leadership has committed to provide additional oversight and structure to monitor of quality efforts. In FY 2019, the Agency formalized the Quality Assurance Risk Management Committee (QARMC). The QARMC will provide senior level oversight and management for the highest risk clinical and administrative issues being addressed in the IHS. Currently, the QARMC is reviewing events and meeting monthly. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. Innovation and Improvement -The Division of Innovation and Improvement increased quality improvement capacity within the Agency. A Patient Experience of Care Survey Working Group was established by the Steering Committee to develop a standardized patient experience of care survey instrument for use at all IHS healthcare facilities. These anonymous surveys are admi nistered and the results analyzed individually by each IHS healthcare facility. The analysis will determine what improvements, if any, are required to improve the patient experience. The instrument was finalized in March 2017, and a first phase of pilot testing provided key findings and recommendations that are being used for improvement of the instrument. The pilot test found high patient and staff acceptance and specific areas for process improvements. Continued piloting and expansion of the number of facilities implementing this tool will continue throughout FY 2020. By listening to our patients, the survey will improve the quality of care provided by the IHS. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. A Patient Wait Times Working Group was e stablished by the Steering Committee to develop standards for primary care patient wait times for appointments. The Working Group completed standard development in June 2017, establishing the following standards: 28 days or less for primary care non -follo w-up appointments, and 48 hours or less for primary care urgent visit appointments. Subsequently, Emergency Department (ED) wait time standards were implemented in policy for ED throughput time (arrival to Discharge) with the standard of median time 120 m inute or less and left without being seen rate of 2 percent or less. To date IHS Area Offices and HQ have developed dashboards for the wait times standards and to use data for each of these wait time measures for evaluation and improvement. The IHS Standard for Wait Times for Primary Care automation process went live on June 10, 2019, and a monthly report is generated to monitor progress. The ED wait time standards automation process went live on June 24, 2019 and an ED Communication Memorandum and proces s flow was sent to Area Directors and Chief Medical Officers. Monthly reports are being generated and disseminated. Since the ED wait time went there, there has been an improvement, both wait time standards will continue to be monitored. Improving patient wait times will ensure that timely primary care is CJ - 71 available and accessible to IHS patients; this is a direct response to the GAO recommendation to improve oversight of patient wait times. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. IHS continued its productive partnerships with the Premier Inc. Hospital Improvement and Innovation Network (HIIN) and HealthInsight New Mexico Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) with its Partnership to Advance Tribal Health (PATH). The Premier HIIN provides technical assistance and learning platforms to reduce Hospital Acquired Conditions and Readmissions. They coach hospital care teams and staff on best practices, lessons learned, and quality improvement activities aligned with these goals. The HealthInsight NM QIO and PATH provide leadership development learning opportunities, care team effectiveness enhancement, patient safety resources, patient/family engagement technical assistance, and system level assessments. IHS and CMS developed a set of three Aims for PATH in FY 2019. These Aims are: 1) Reduction of Harm; 2) improved and sustained compliance with Federal regulations and accreditation standards; and 3) Improve transitions in care. In FY 2019, PATH working with IHS direct service and CMS certified hospitals, have developed and begun baseline assessments for each of the Aims and developed action plans for each IHS hospital to reach the 2019 Aims by the end of the calendar year 2019 . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide c are to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. In FY 2019, the OQ implem ented the accelerated model for improvement (Ami TM) improvement science framework, and has supported the training Healthcare Improvement Professionals (HIP) to support quality improvement initiatives throughout the IHS areas. There are 45 HIPS implementing various improvement projects and Ami TM is implemented in the Great Plains, Phoenix, and Portland Areas . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2., Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ; IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. Improving Patient Care (IPC) Program -The purpose of the IPC Program is to promote the development and application of the quality improvement processes and to promote the implementation of the Patient -Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model of care to improve the health and wellness of AI/ANs. The IPC program provides a model of collaborative learning to develop proficiency in quality improvement. Data management and analysis are used to drive improvements. Success will be measured in FY 2019, and beyond, by achievement of clinical and process industry -benchmarks, as well as ultimate recognition or certification of participating sites as PCMHs. Participating teams report on clinical outcome measures aligned with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) measures and some additional clinical process measures. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.3, Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options. In 2019, the IPC program has provided 1000 subscriptions to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Open School to support IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) facility staff in their quality improvement efforts with enrollment of over 900 staff. The IHS collaboration with PATH) has CJ - 72 provided 1300 subscriptions to the IHI Open School to support IHS federally operated Hospita l staff in their quality improvement efforts with enrollment of over 570 staff. Combined the IPC Program and the PATH have awarded over 8,000 Continuing Education Units (CEU) for I/T/U staff to date. In 2019, IHS implemented a web based collaborative learn ing environment to support quality improvement and PCMH information dissemination and knowledge exchange. In FY 2019, the IPC Program added four new enhancements to improve the IHS Quality Portal member's experience while utilizing the portal. The enhancem ents include subscription and notification settings, integration of a calendar invitation, the ability for the IHS staff to create \"affinity groups\" to do quality improvement work and the ability to upload resources when replying to a request in the Community Exchange. In FY 2019, IHS Quality had an increase of 46 percent of its membership from FY 2018. During FY 2019, the portal members have viewed over 1500 times resources in the IHS Quality Portal, averaging over 70 views a month of those resources available in the portal. These resources are in different formats. These formats include video, documents, audio files and website URL (uniform resource locator). In FY 2019, the IHS Quality portal members have uploaded over 200 resources to the portal. IPC Pro gram used the support of CSI Solutions (contractor) to perform of a gap analysis and identify multiple process improvement and functionality enhancements for development on FY 2020. IPC Program with the assistance of CSI Solutions develop a process to improve the costumer experience of the active members of the portal utilizing the Community Exchange . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2., Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization; IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. In FY 2019, the IPC Program led and coordinated a working group to review a draft charter of a future National Quality Council. The workgroup was composed of staff from multiple area offices and facilities across the IHS. The IPC Program coordinated the vote and election of an Executive Committee who will coordinate the final development of the charter with support from the IPC Program and the Office of Quality . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The OQ continues to work toward the goal of 100 percent recognition of ambulatory care as PCMH care by 2021. 27 of 31 (87 percent) eligible ambulatory care facilities and 9 of 24 (36 percent) of hospital -based ambulatory care clinics hold PCMH recognition through the TJC or the Accreditation Associated for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). Further, 7 of 9 PCMH - recognized IHS hospitals received their recognition in FY 2019. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of America n Indian and Alaska Native communities; the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.3, Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options. IPC program supports I/T/U facilities in providing them with the tools and resources needed to determine when a change is an improvement and to monitor the spread and scale -up of change using PCMH measures. The IPC program also implemented a national reporting system for the 21 PCMH measures in collaboration with the IHS Office of Information Technology. There are currently 21 approved measures and in FY 2019, IHS completed the implementation of all measures installed in our population health management tool (iCare) for facilities to view, CJ - 73 monitor, and evaluate quality improvement measures. The IPC program in FY 2019 also implemented risk stratification and patien t-reported outcomes tools within our population health management tool to strengthen IHS's ability to provide care that best meets the healthcare needs of AI/AN people. In FY 2019, 70 percent of the IHS health care facilities providing ambulatory care serv ices obtained PCMH designation from either a national accreditation organization or a state Medicaid program. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2., Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization; IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovat ion and competition. Enterprise Risk Management -The Division of Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls is responsible for identifying key risk areas throughout the agency. In FY 2019, key process areas were identified by the IHS Senior Assessment Team and assessed through documentation of key controls and risk assessment workshops. The OQ provided leadership in developing cycle process documentation with key process owners and testing the operational effectiveness through detailed transactional testing. Workshops were conducted with functional staff throughout all levels of the Agency to identify key drivers of risk related to Facility Accreditation Compliance, Employee Retention, and Quality of Care and developed risk response plans to mitig ate critical risk areas. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal Three, Objective 3.2, Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal Five, Strategic Objective 5.1, Ensure responsible financial management. Nursing - Nursing represents the largest category of health care providers in the Indian health system and has a major impact on patient safety and health care outcomes. Nurses are actively engaged in the transformation of the health care system by placi ng more emphasis on prevention, wellness, and coordination of care. As part of the Let's Move! In Indian Country (LMIC), the Indian Health Service (IHS) launched the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) in 2011. This IHS initiative promotes breastfeeding to reduce the risk that children will develop obesity, diabetes, and other obesity -related conditions in the future. 1 The BFHI is a quality improvement initiative to increase breastfeeding (BF) initiation and duration, thereby creating a healthy start in life and preventing childhood obesity. Exclusive BF protects against obesity and type II diabetes, conditions to which American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are particularly prone. The BFHI initiative requires the following: establish a wri tten BF policy; train all staff in the skills necessary to implement the policy; inform pregnant women of the benefits and management of BF; assist mothers initiate BF within 1 hour of birth; show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation; give infants no food or drink other than breast -milk, unless medically indicated; allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day (rooming in); encourage breastfeeding on demand; give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants; and, foster the establishment of BF support groups and refer mothers to them upon discharge. Ten IHS federally operated obstetrical (OB) hospitals are designated as Baby -Friendly. Baby Friendly designated facilities are required to be surveyed and re-desig nated every five years. The following obstetric hospitals have successfully completed Baby Friendly Re -designation assessment: Claremore Indian Hospital, Phoenix Indian Medical Center, Quentin N. Burdick Memorial Health Care Facility, Zuni Comprehensive H ealth Center, and Pine Ridge Service Unit; and, five IHS obstetrical hospitals are engaging in the re-designation process in 2019. This activity meets IHS Objective 1.3 Access: Ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate CJ - 74 personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people and the HHS Goal 2.2 Prevent, treat and control chronic conditions Collaborations have been established with Tribal health care systems with the goal of providing safe and quality care for Native communities. A collaborative agreement was formed between IHS and the Chickasaw Nation Medical Center, Ada, Oklahoma, to enhance clinical competencies for IHS Emergency Department, Perioperative Room, and Labor and Delivery Registered Nurses ( RNs). The agreement is designed to enhance IHS specialty nurses ' clinical competency through preceptored clinical rotations offered at the T ribally-managed Chickasaw Medical Center, which maintains higher patient volume. Factors that impact IHS' s capacity to assist RNs to maintain their level of clinical competency, beyond initial licensure, credentialing, and continuing education, are attributable to geographically isolated IHS hospitals that are further challenged with fluctuating patient v olume. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goals 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality Healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The Division of Nursing Services (DNS) implemented the Rural Obstetrical Nurse Residency Program (RONR). The purpose of RONR is to facilitate a structured professional nursing experience for new and inexperienced obstetrical nurses in an effort to alleviate critical shortages of practicing nurses within the Indian Health System. To sustain the RONR, DNS led a workgroup to develop and draft a RONR charter. The workgroup consisted of Area Nurse Consultants through the agency. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goals 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality Healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. DNS made available 400 subscriptions to the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) web-based course. The web course was offered to Registered Nurses and Advanced Practice Nurses who care for patients in the emergency department, urgent care or other critical care settings, as well as nurses who provide additional coverage for these units . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goals 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality Healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. HIV Program - AI/AN people face significant health disparities in rates of sexually transmitted infections including HIV. From 2010 to 2016, the annual number of HIV diagnoses increased 46 percent (from 157 to 230) among AI/AN overall and 81 percent (from 90 to 163) among AI/AN gay and bisexual men. Of AI/AN with HIV in 2015, 60 percent received HIV care, 43 percent were retained in care, and 48 percent had achieved viral suppression . 3 Current statistics indicate HIV has affected nearly all communities served by the IHS. The HIV Program goal is to prevent new HIV infections and ensure access to quality health services for AI/ANs living with HIV (IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization & 2.2 Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high- quality 3 https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/racialethnic/aian/index.html CJ - 75 healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs; Goal 2 Objective 2.1 Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living, 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions , 2.4 Prepare for and respond to public health emergencies . Integrating the Department's Strategic Goal to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play) IHS increased overall prenatal HIV screening to 87 percent in FY 2016 - a 15 percent increase over FY 2006 data (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022 Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living ). In FY 2016, IHS included HIV screening of 13-64 year-olds in its nationally reportable quality of care metrics. This effort resulted in 80,000 unique AI/AN patients receiving HIV screening for the first time. The overall HIV screening rate has increased by 22 percent. Some of the highest performing IH S facilities have achieved HIV screening levels of more than 70 percent for th e eligible population. In FY 2018, efforts continued to expand screening to our most at -risk populations, including men who have sex with men. To improve AI/AN access to health care in remote areas, the IHS HIV Program provides technical support to IHS, tribal, and urban Indian health sites on screening and treatment, and the use of tele-health (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs) The IHS National HIV/HCV Program submitted three FY 2019 Minority HIV/AIDS Fund (MHAF) applications to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for HHS, Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy (OIDP) . IHS received notice of $7.9 million in MHAF awards. There are seven components to the funding, including a section on tribal consultation and urban confer (IHS Strategic Pl an FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, Objective 1. 2 Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competit ion). Through MHAF, IHS awarded the National Indian Health Board (NIHB) $200,000 to host at least four tribal consultation sessions by July 2020 with the various federally recognized tribes throughout the U.S. to gain input and provide advice to IHS on reaching the goals of the Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America (EHE or The Plan). With MHAF, IHS awarded the National Council of Urban India n Health (NCUIH) $25,000 to host at least two urban confer sessions by April 2020 with their member organizations to gain input and provide advice to IHS on meeting the goals of the EHE. In addition, IHS awarded the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board (AAIHB) $200,000 to institute and manage the National Native HIV Network (NNHN) that will bring together a wide array of key stakeholders from the 12 IHS Areas to support IHS' community level efforts to meet the goals of the Plan. This funding falls under the EHE Empowering Healthier Tribal Communities (Community Planning). Through the IHS National HIV Program, MHAF also provided $1.5 million to the Cherokee Nation Health Services (CNHS) for an EHE pilot project to ensure the future success of The Plan in Indian Country. The program has four main objectives that will help to meet this outcome: (1)Implement a public education campaign in Cherokee Nation centering on HIV care and HIV prevention; (2) Educate CNHS providers on the need to have discussions about the sexual health of the ir patients; (3) Identify and link to care CNHS patients currently living with HIV ; and (4)Establish a robust pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, CJ - 76 Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high -quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse need s). By educating the public and providers, implementing tools for screening high-risk patients, and establishing a PrEP program, CNHS will not only be detecting those individuals who are at risk for HIV and preventing new infections but will also be detecting, linking to care, and providing treatment for those who have previously undiagnosed infections. The pilot project will provide an opportunity to begin implementing and evaluating some key foundational activities that will help accelerate progress toward ending the HIV epidemic in Indian Country. Another section of the FY 2019 MHAF funds provides $2.4 million in competitive funds for the 12 Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs). In October 2019, the IHS awarded $2.4 mill ion to nine TECs to support AI/AN communities in reducing new HIV infections and relevant co - morbidities, specifically hepatitis C and sexua lly transmitted infections (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs). The TECs will provide resources to help Native communities address the four main pillars of the Ending the HIV Epidemic plan: Diagnose, Treat, Protect, and Respond (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 4, Objective 4.1 Improve surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory services). Only current TEC grantees were eli gible to apply for the competing supplemental funding under this announcement and had to demonstrate that they have complied with previous terms and conditions of the TEC program. There were two separate, but related notices in the Federal Register. The first was for those Tribal Epi Centers that do not provide services in the 48 counties or 7 southern states of the EHE Phase One Jurisdictions. These \"Group A\" applicants could apply for up to $100 ,000. The second announcement - for \"Group B\" applicants - was for those TECs whose constituency contains one or more of the 48 counties or 7 southern states in the Phase One jurisdictions of the EHE . These \"Group B\" applicants could apply for up to $275 ,000. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infections can result in illness varying in severity from mild (lasting a few weeks), to serious (a lifelong illness ending in death by liver failure ). The likelihood of liver damage is related to the duration and severity of untreated infection. The CDC estimates that 3.5 million persons in the U.S. have HCV; approximately 120,000 of whom identify as AI/AN. 4 The IHS National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) data identifies 29,803 IHS patients from 2005- 2015 with HCV, and estimates nearly 200 new cases each year; 53.4 percent were among persons born 1945 -1965. The overall HCV burden was higher among males than females. This data does not in clude up to 50 percent of patients who remain undiagnosed. AI/AN people have the largest increase of liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer compared to any other race/ethnic groups. IHS data also identifies fewer than 1,000 HCV patients currently undergoing treatment. HCV death rates among AI/ANs are more than twice the national average compared to other ethnic groups. 5 4 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Edlin+Toward+amore+accurate+estimate 5 https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/commentary.htm CJ - 77 The CDC and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all persons born from 1945-1 965 should be screened for HCV . IHS al igned program initiatives with t he National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan (NVHAP) 2017 -2020, to eliminate new viral hepatitis infections, increase knowledge of hepatitis diagnoses, improve access to high quality health care and curative treatments, and eliminate stigma and discrimination (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high -quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and servic e options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs). IHS clinical data shows that screening for HCV among AI/ANs born from 1945-1965, increased from 8 percent in 2012, to 54 percent in 2017. This achievement is due in part to the integration of the Department's Strategic Goal One to reform, strengthen, and modernize the Nation's Healthcare System through the development of technical support tools like electronic health record (EHR) clinical reminders, publication of IHS policy guidelines for HIV and HCV, and creation of clinical linkages to care (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2 018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs). IHS anticipates higher costs associated with HCV care in FY 2018 and FY 2019 associated with the increased rate of diagnosis (based on increased screening of Baby -Boomers and women of reproductive age) and the substantially high cost of curative medica tions. In FY 2019, IHS established universal screening for HCV for all patients over the age of 18 years at least once in their lifetime, followed by guideline -based treatment, as appropriate (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand s afe, high -quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse need s). Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) rates continue to rise in Indian Country, and recurrent STDs can increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Gonorrhea and syphilis often present as co - morbid conditions with HIV diagnosis, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). Data show that the incidence rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea among AI/AN people are approximately four times that of whites, and AI/AN have the second highest overall rates for both conditions when compared to all other races and ethnicities. 6 Regional differences in STDs in Indian Country are also observed, and AI/AN youth and AI/AN women, particularly wo men of reproductive age, have a disparate and increased STD burden.7 Recent and sustained outbreaks of syphilis have also been observed among AI/AN communities, some related to injection drug and methamphetamine use, and both are recognized risk factors for HIV transmission. Domestic Violence Prevention Program (DVP P) - Domestic and intimate partner violence has a disproportionately large impact on AI/AN communities. According to a 2016 report by the National Institute of Justice , 8 more than four in five AI/AN women (84.3 percent) have 6 https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/minorities.htm https://www.ihs.gov/sites/epi/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/std/Indian_Health_Surveillance_Report_STD_2015 . pdf 8 https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249736.pdf CJ - 787 experienced violence in their lifetime. This includes 56.1 percent who have experienced sexual violence, 55.5 percent who have experienced physical violence by an intimate partner, 48.8 percent who have experienced stal king, and 66.4 percent who have experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner. Data from the National Institutes for Justice and the Center for Disease Control show that more than 1.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence, including sexual violence in their lifetimes. 9 Many of the projects supported by the DVPP are focused on increasing community awareness and identifying resources to address high rates of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls (MMIW). DVP P was established in 2015 , as a nationally coordinated program that provides culturally appropriate domestic violence and sexual assault prevention and intervention resources to AI/AN communities with a focus on providing trauma informed services . The DVP P supports IHS Goal 1 to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people and Goal 1, Ob jective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships. The DVPP focuses on domestic and sexual violence prevention, advocacy, and education about domestic violence and sexual violence, coordinated community responses, as well as providing forensic healthcare services to victims of domestic and sexual violence . In FY 2019, IHS supported a total of 83 award s to participate in the DVPP. In 201 9, IHS participated in formal Tribal Consultation and an Urban Confer regarding behavioral health initiatives and the distribution of funding for the DVPP program . Recommendations and modifications impacting the DVPP as a result of the Tribal Consultation and an Urban Confer will be announced in FY 2020. A total of 83 grantees and federal awardees work to meet the following goals: 1. Build Tribal, Urban Indian Health Programs , and Federal capacity to provide coordinated community responses to AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence, 2. Increase access to domestic and sexual violence prevention, advocacy, crisis intervention, and behavioral health services for AI/AN victims and their families, 3. Promote trauma -informed services for AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence and their families , 4. Offer health care provider and community education on domestic violence and sexual violence , 5. Respond to the health care needs of AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence, and 6. Incorporate culturally appr opriate practices and/or faith -based services for AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence. DVPP is on a five-year funding cycle from FY 2015 - FY 2020. The third year concluded on September 29, 2018, with 99 percent of projects submitting progress reports. Data collected throughout this period indicate an approximate 58,000 direct service encounters including services related to coordinated community res ponses, advocacy, forensic healthcare, integration of traditional healing, faith -based and culturally competent services. Evaluation of year three projects indicate an expansion of services delivered to victims of domestic violence and intimate partner vi olence. Sites also experienced an increase in partnerships among tribal programs to develop Coordinated Community Response and Sexual Assault Response Teams as well as establishing intervention programs that include evidence -based and traditional practice s. 9 https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/missing- murdered -american-indians-alaska-natives-awareness-day- 2019/ CJ - 79 In addition, these funds support the Forensic Health Care activities within IHS HQ. The Forensic Health Care program was developed in 2009 and aims to increase recognition of and prevent sexual assault, child maltreatment (all forms including sexual abuse), intimate partner violence, human trafficking, and elder abuse in Native communities by providing: high- quality staff training, assistance to local facilities to create or sustain appropriate acute forensic care services, and strengthen on-going comprehensive services that enhance survivor healing. The program has established a strong partnership with the International Association of Forensic Nurses. The services provided through this agreement include didactic and clinical forensic examination courses, quarterly educational webinars, and technical assistance to sexual assault programs operating within the I/T/U system. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount ) TRIBAL SHARES H&HC funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume responsibility for operating associated programs, functions, services, and activities. A portion of the overall H&HC budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 20 21 budget submission for Hospitals and Health Clinics is $ 2.4 billion , which is $ 108.0 million above the FY 2020 Enacted level. FY 20 20 Base Funding of $2.3 billion -suppo rts the largest portion of clinica l care at IHS and Tribal health facilitie s, includi ng salari es ben efits f hos pital/clini c administra tion; salaries and ben efits f or ph ysicians, nurses, and ancillary sta ff; pharm aceuticals; and medical supplies. These funds make up the lump sum recurring base distri bution to the Areas each fiscal y ear. I n addition, an am ount of H&HC f unding that initially is a llocated to Headquarters e ach year is reallocated on a non-r ecurring ba sis to Areas during the fiscal year and s uppo rts national activiti es. Also included in the base is funding to provide technical assistance to IHS facilities to promote efficient, effective, high quality care to the AI/AN population. The IHS will strengthen its quality system to ensure alignment with and attainment of nation al standards for quality and patient safety for inpatient and outpatient facilities. This will include accreditation preparation, readiness, and survey activities; bringing health care quality expertise to IHS; and development and dissemination of educati on tools and experiential opportunities to ensure staff competencies in quality assurance and quality improvement. FY 2021 Funding Increase of $108.0 million includes : 1. Current Services: +$ 17.0 million for current services including: CJ - 80 Inflation + 17.0 million - This request offsets the increasing costs of medical products and services, projected to be 3.9 percent. Without these funds, IHS would have to reduce services and slow the purchase of necessary medical supplies to operate its health program wi thin available funds. 2. Staffing for New Facilities +$24.4 million -These funds will support staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated healthcare facilities allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs. The following table displays this request.

Elimination of HIV, Hepatitis C, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases +$27.0 million to focus on the treatment as prevention model and supports efforts to diagnose all HIV - positive IHS patients as early as possible after infection; treat those living with HIV rapidly and effectively to achieve sustained viral suppression; protect individuals at risk of HIV using proven prevention approaches; effectively identify, treat, and prevent related conditions and risks for HIV infection, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and sexually transmitted disease ( STD) infections; and respond rapidly to growing HIV clusters to prevent propagated transmission resulting in new HIV infections. Rates of STDs other than HIV also continue to rise in Indian country and can increase risk for HIV transmission. Additional ly, IHS serves a population also disproportionately affected by HCV\u2014the AI/AN population has more than twice the rate of HCV incidence and nearly three times the rate of HCV-related mortality as the general U.S. population (CDC 2018). Without concerted intervention that includes expanded HIV, STD, and HCV prevention, testing, and treatment, along with increased clinical and public health resourcing and infrastructure, including associated pharmaceuticals and data generation and analysis capacity , rates of AI/AN HIV, STDs, and HCV will likely continue to increase in FY 2021 and beyond. Additional health statistics about these priority diseases are provided in the program accomplishments section of this narrative. This request supports the President's Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America (EHE) and the Eliminating Hepatitis C in Indian Country initiatives. Key components of this budget include: Increased access to treatment and medication. Expanded public health surveillance and data infrastructure to inform prevention and interventions. Increased resources and funding targeted at building tribal and local capacity for addressing the prevention and treatment of HIV, HCV, and STD infections. Expansion of the IHS workforce to coordinate and manage init iative efforts. CJ - 81 Increased support for evaluation, outreach, education, and training. This increase will expand patient screening and treatment for those living with HIV, STDs, and HCV; provide targeted PrEP and expedited partner therapy to those at greater risk for acquiring HIV and other STDs, effectively screen and treat those patients living with chronic HIV and HCV, sufficiently staff and resource internal programs to ensure success, and lays the overall groundwork for IHS' expanded efforts toward operationalizing the EHE with the ambitious goals of reducing new HIV infections by 75 percent in five years and by at least 90 percent in ten years. Expansion of IHS services is critical in reducing the high levels of HIV, STDs, and HCV infections experi enced by AI/AN people. IHS headquarters, area offices, and service units will focus HIV/HCV diagnostic, treatment, prevention, and response services to those geographic areas with the greatest recognized need as follows: HIV Treatment with antiretroviral and prevention through PrEP, and HCV care and treatment with direct acting million: [treatment capacity goals: $13.2 1,100 patients), $1.4 million for PrEP (approximately 100 patients), and $1 million for HIV care (approximately 100 patients).] Partnerships with Tribal Epidemiology Centers: $2.5 million Staffing : $2.9 million for 12 FTEs ranging from GS -11 to GS -14 Public health surveillance and data infrastructure (Data bridges and work): $1.5 million Evaluation: $500,000 Outreach, education, and training: $4 million (IHS, tribal and urban clinical and public health staff training, Project ECHO, PrEP navigator training, stigma reduction, social media and outreach to AI/AN communities, etc.). The National HIV/HCV Program focuses the $27.0 million on staff support for patient care that includes a training coordinator and almost double field located coordinators, and one public health training advisor, with a less robust treatment component . (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high- quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the heal thcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs). IHS will concentrate efforts on building up its HIV and HCV infrastructure in the 12 Area Offices and Service Units. In partnership, this funding request provides overall support for public health surveillance and data infrastructure support at the national level and provides supplementary resources for the Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs). TECs are uniquely positioned to complement the STD, HIV, and HCV prevention and control efforts of IHS clinical operations and staff through the expansion of TEC public health expertise that directly supports Tribal communities primarily via technical assistance, training, and coordination.

As previously described, in 2019, the IHS through partnership with MHAF launched two funding opportunities (totaling $2.4 million) supporting foundational work among the national network of TECs that further the goals of the overall EHE initiative and specifically engage Tribal communities to leverage local and/or regional Tribally -managed public health resources (e.g., TECs). This work will first seek to develop local plans that address the transmission and treatment burdens of STDs, HIV, HCV, and related health condition s. (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 Goal 1, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Strengthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs). This proposed increase leverages and strengthens these foundational efforts, further enhances Tribal capacity, and provides additional regional and local resources for sustainment. For more information about the TECs, please refer to the Tribal Epidemiology Centers narrative. The majority of funding will be distributed through new or existing programs, functions, services, and activity lines to support IHS facilities, tribes, and tribal organiz ations using direct transfers, contracts, cooperative agreements, and compacts, with a set aside for grants to urban Indian organizations. 4. National Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) -$20.0 million . This amount moved to the new Community He alth line item. Funding for the Alaska CHAP will remain in H&HC. 5. Recruitment and Retention +$3.5 million -for the recruitment and retention of medical and other critical personnel for IHS facilities. The additional funds will be used to develop and expand a range of recruitment and retention strategies aimed to enhance and support the mission of the Indian Health Service. Initiatives include the IHS housing subsid y program , expanding the Title 38 compensation pay tables, and supporting the expansion of IHS recruitment and outreach activities , including the development of an applicant tracking system, expanding the medical resident rotation website project, updating and enhancing the IHS jobs board, and implementing the Federal Student Loan Repayment Program . 6. Improving Maternal Health in America +$5.0 million -The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the number of reported pregnancy -related deaths in the United States increased from 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1987 to 16.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2016. Lack of access to appropriate and high-quality care, missed or delayed diagnoses, and lack of knowledge among patients and providers around warning signs contributed to pregnancy -related deaths. Trends also increased across the nation due to an increase in chronic conditions. The pregnancy -related death rate for AI/AN women was more than twice the rate of non -Hispanic white women, and AI/AN women had significantl y higher proportion of pregnancy -related deaths for hemorrhage CJ - 83 and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy than non-Hispanic white women did.10,11 AI/AN populations have higher rates of diabetes and obesity than the general population, which can increase their risk for pregnancy -related morbidity or death. Improving women's health overall in the preconception, pregnancy and postpartum period and increasing awareness of 'warning signs' can improve maternal outcomes. In addition, opioids, alcohol and other drugs continue to affect the nation, contributing to deaths of AI/AN pregnant woman, affecting their health and pregnancy outcomes and increasingly affecting their newborn infants. Funding will be used to deliver on three goals: (1) support IHS preventive, perinatal, and postpartum care, (2) address the needs of pregnant women with substance use disorder including opioids, alcohol, and other drugs, and (3) improve quality of services and health outcomes in order to reduce maternal morbidity by 50 percent. A breakdown of funding is as follows: $4 million ($ 3.5 million for standards of service, screening, training, outreach and education (includes education and tools for patients); $227 ,000 for staffing; and $250,000 for evaluation) $500,000 (I/T/U substance use disorder training, implementation of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) guidelines) $500,000 for the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health ( AIM ) Bundle implementation Activities that support goal (1) include updating standards of the Service 12 and providing subsequent training on those standards for I /T/U that routinely provide care for pregnant women. Funding will also be used to implement and systematize screening and follow up for social determinants of health for pregnant women and to increase cultural awareness to improve health outcomes.13 Using risk -based stratification, staff will then be able to link those at higher risk for poor pregnancy outcomes to enhanced car e14 that will also be expanded . (HHS Goal 1.2 Expand safe, high quality healthcare options and encourage innovation and competition IHS Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships and 2.2 Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities) IHS plans also include development of a culturally appropriate publication/app to provide pregnancy and post -partum education for A I/AN women, including w arning signs, to be available no matter where women live or obtain care.

The AHC HRSN Screening Tool is self -administered. 14 Which may include the evidence- based, culturally tailored Family Spirit home- visiting program CJ - 84 In order to address goal (2), IHS will provide tools and training to I /T/U that routinely see pregnant women to increase targeted outreach to pregnant women and women of childbearing age at risk for substance use disorder, including those at risk f rom opioids, alcohol, and other drugs. IHS will leverage the newly released recommendations for healthcare providers treating AI/AN pregnant women and women of childbearing age with opioid use disorder developed for the IHS by ACOG. (HHS Goal 2.2 Prevent, treat and control chronic conditions) IHS Objective 1.3 Access: Ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people) . Finally, to address g oal (3), the funding will support all IHS and Tribal h ospitals with routine labor and delivery services on site to fully participate in the AIM as well as in Perinatal Quality Collaboratives (PQCs) in states where they exist. 15 AIM is a national data-driven matern al safety and quality improvement initiative based on proven implementation approaches to improving maternal safety and outcomes in the U.S. The goal of the AIM Bundles is to move already established guidelines into practice with a standard approach. PQCs are state or multi -state networks of teams working to improve the quality of care for mothers and babies. PQC members identify health care processes that need to be improved and use the best available methods to make changes as quickly as possible. PQCs have contributed to important improvements in health care and outcomes for mothers and babies, including: Reductions in deliveries before 39 weeks of pregnancy without a medical reason. Reductions in health care- associated bloodstream infections in newborns. Reductions in severe pregnancy complications.16 7. ISDEAA section 105(l) Leases -$101.0 million - transfer from H&HC to the new indefinite discretionary account Payments for Tribal Leases. 8. Program Adjustment +$151.8 million -to maximize funding for direct patient care services. 15 AIM is a national alliance to promote consistent and safe maternity care. Funding will support implementation of all care bundles at IHS and Tribal facilities that offer routine labor and delivery services, as well as facilitation of data- collection, data- mining, and data - sharing necessary to track maternal safety and quality improvement efforts. IHS will seek to connect all federal sites through the secure and centralized AIM Data Center. The AIM Data Center provides timely tracking of outcome, process, and structure data measures to ensure IHS can effectively reduce maternal morbidity and mortality outcomes at both the hospital and system level. Perinatal quality collaboratives (PQCs) are state or multi- state networks of teams working to improve the quality of care for mothers and babies.

Permanent Allocation Method .................................................................................... Cooperative Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service (IHS) Tribal Epidemiology Center (TEC) Program was first authorized and funded by Congress in fiscal year (FY ) 1996. The intent has been to develop public health infrastructure by augmenting existing Tribal organizations with expertise in epidemiology and public health via Epidemiology Centers. Funding is distributed to the TECs through cooperative agreements to Tribes and Tribal organizations such as Indian H ealth Boards. The TECs play a critical role in IHS' overal l public health infrastructure. Operating within Tribal organizations, TECs are uniquely positioned to provide support to local Tribal disease surveillance and control programs, and assess the effectiveness of public health programs. All TECs monitor the health status of their constituent Tribes, produce a variety of reports annually or bi-annually that describe activities and progress towards publi c health goals, and provide support to Tribes who self -govern their health programs. The TEC program funds eleven TECs that provide comprehensive geographic coverage for all IHS administrative areas and one additional TEC serving A merican Indian and Alaska N ative (AI/AN) populations residing in major urban centers nationally. The IHS Division of Epidemiology and Disease Prevention (DEDP) functions as the national coordinating center and provides technical support and guidance to TECs. The DEDP and TECs collect, analyze, interpret, and disseminate health information in addition to identifying diseases to target for intervention, suggesting strategies, and testing the effectiveness of implemented health interventions. The TEC Program supports Tribal communities by providing technical training in public health practice and prevention-oriented research, and promoting public health caree r pathways for Tribal members. Over 90 percent of the TEC Program budget is distributed through cooperative agreem ents based on a 5- year competitive award cycle. In the current 5- year award cycle beginning FY 2016, the 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, for impacted funds. CJ - 89 average annual award across all 12 TECs w as $338,675. The next 5- year competitive award cycle will encompass FYs 2021 -2026 and is projected to increase to $422,000 per TEC based on the FY 2020 enacted . The TECs are fundamental to the IHS' partnership with Tribes by supporting epidemiology and public health functions essential to the delivery of healthcare services. Independent TEC goals are set as directed by their constituent Tribes and health boards. The DEDP tracks these goals and objectives as written in their cooperative agreements (e.g ., surveillance of disease and control programs ; collecting epidemiological data for use in determining health status of Tribal communities). The TEC funds provide critical support in strengthening the collaborative partnerships among the 12 TECs ' constituent AI/AN communities as a part of the agency's work to address the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2 019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2 ( Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ) and the HHS Strategic Plan 2018 -2022 Goal 4.1 ( Improve surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory services). The work of the TECs to collect data relating to, and monitor progress made toward meeting, each of the health status objectives of the Service, the Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations in the service area is an essential part of meeting the IHS Goal 1, Objecti ve 1.3, Strategy 7 ( Reduce health disparities in the AI/AN population) by highlighting disparities in the AI/AN population so they can be reduced through Public Health efforts. This includes the significant health impact of the Opioid crisis in Indian Country and the disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS, HCV, and sexually transmitted diseases in AI/AN communities. Significant improvements in reducing the burden of disparities in this population would strongly address the HHS Goal 2: Protect the Health of Americans Where They Live, Learn, Work, and Play . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The TEC funds provide critical support in strengthening the collaborative partnerships among the 12 TECs and AI/AN communities (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2). Below are key TEC activities. Data Projects that Engage Local Resources Data generated locally and analyzed by TECs enable Tribes to evaluate Tribal and community -specific health status for planning the needs of their Tribal membership. Immediate feedback is provided to the local data systems and leads to improvements in Indian health data overall. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (Section 130) include s language t hat designates the TECs as public health authorities in regards to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) o f 1996. This designation permits TECs to access IHS -generated data sets used to support various public health activities. TECs assist Tribes with projects such as conducting behavioral risk factor surveys to establish a base of measurement for successfully evaluating intervention and prevention activities related to behavioral health needs . Because national surveys (e.g., Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey, Youth Risk Behavior Survey) do not consistently capture representative data for AI/AN populations, TEC s have had an essential role in piloting adapted versions of these national surveys to include AI/AN populations. These surveys provide baseline and trend data used by Tribes and Urban Indian organizations (U IOs) to identify health-related needs and to prioritize CJ - 90 interventions and prevention services. For example, one TEC combines these survey s and other data to generate reports on the health disparities of urban Indians and distri butes nationally to all UIOs to identify health priorities, seek opportunities for new data collection, and support competitive, evidence-driven applications for funding opportunities to address these priorities. Improving Public Health Reporting for A I/AN Communities In public health administrative records, AI/AN people are often misidentified as another race, called racial misclassification. Racial misclassification occurs more often in AI/AN records than in records from other racial groups, which makes it hard to accurately measure and describe the health status of AI/AN people. A specific effort by the Urban Indian Health Institute TEC recently drew attention to serious underreporting of AI/AN race in existing statistics in the report entitled, Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls . To further TEC efforts to correct for racial misclassification to improve public health data quality, in 2019, IHS launched a pilot project with one TEC permitting the use of IHS patient data to correct records within numerous existing public health data sets for AI/AN race. This work is currently underway and directly supports the IHS St rategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3, Strategy 8 (Assure system of data sharing to solidify partnerships with Tribal and urban Epidemiology Centers and other Tribal programs and Urban Indian Organizations ). This increase in information sharing with our TEC p artners acknowledges and strengthens the statutory Public Health functions of the TEC program and builds on the expertise developed over the life of the program. Disease Surveillance and Evaluation In the expanding environment of Tribally -operated health programs, TECs provide additional public health services, such as disease control and prevention programs, in areas such as sexually transmitted disease control, HIV, and cancer prevention. The expertise of the TEC program in sexually transmitted disease and HIV control will be leveraged in the Elimination of HIV, Hepatitis C, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Initiative , if funded. TEC efforts build capacity in the Indian health system by evaluatin g and monitor ing the effectiveness of health and public health programs. This allows TECs to assess access, use, and/or assess quality of care , and to develop recommendations for the targeting of services needed by the populations served. They manage publ ic health information systems, investigate diseases of concern, manage disease prevention and control programs, communicate vital health information and resources, respond to public health emergencies, and coordinate these activities with other public heal th authorities. Collaboration The DEDP collaborates with the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other federal agencies to supplement TEC activities , create stronger interagency partnerships, and prevent costly duplication of effort. TECs support national public health goals by working to improve data for the Government Performance and Results Act, agency performance reports, and monitoring of the Healthy People 2020 objectives at the Tribal level. Health status reports across all TECs will lead to a more comprehensive picture of Indian health. In the long term, these activities create opportunities for IHS to improve the delivery of services by call ing attention to health disparities or concerns experienced by the population the Agency serves.

In FY 2018, TECs responded to 3,210 requests for technical support (EPI -4) and 216 TEC -sponsored trainings for tribal public health capacity building. Funding dedicated to increa sing the TECs' direct support to Tribes to translate emerging public health strategies, resources, and information indirectly reduces the burden on the overall health system by supporting prevention. Completed trainings and technical support to Tribes and Tribal organizations show the sustained efforts of the TECs to engage, train, and collaborate with the Tribes in their service area. These efforts are responsive to Tribal priorities as they are driven by Tribal requests and invitations, not dictated by the Division of Epidemiology and Disease Prevention.

IHS HIT provides support for the IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) programs that care for 2.6 million American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people across the Indian health system. IHS provides the technology infrastructure for a nationwide health care system, including a secure wide area network, enterprise e- mail services, and regional and national Help Desk support for approximately 20,000 network users. IHS HIT also supports the mission-critical health care operations of the I/T/U with comprehensive health information solutions including an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and more than eighty applications. IHS' EHR received 2014 certification for meeting requirements set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), which established standards and other criteria for structured data that EHRs must use. The IHS HIT portfolio directly supports better ways to: 1) care for patients, 2) pay providers, 3) refer care when needed, 4) recover costs, and 5) distribute information, resulting in better care, wiser spending of our health dollars, and healthier communities, economy, and country.

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The IHS Division of Information Technology successfully provided a secure and effective suite of technology solutions to support the agency and its mission throughout the country. Collaboration with tribal health programs and ot her federal agencies is key to the success of the HIT P ortfolio . IHS works closely with the ONC, CMS, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, VA, and other federal entities on IT initiatives to ensure that the direction of its HIT systems are consistent with other federal agencies. In addition, IHS has routinely shared HIT artifacts (e.g., design and requirement documents, clinical quality logic, etc.) with both public and private organizations. The Health Information Technology Systems and Support (HITSS) program modernized the way provider credentialing and privileging is carried out across the Agency to facilitate the hiring of qualified providers and ensuring patient safety. IHS acquired and is now utilizing a centralized electronic credentialing database across all federally operated facilities. The program provided 148 HIT training courses to 3,280 I/T/U users as of April 2019. This included 62 classroom/satellite sessions with 1,025 participants and 86 eLearning/eLearning hands-on sessio ns with 2,255 participants. Added 167 training recordings in fiscal y ear (FY) 2018 for a total of 293 recordings since the FY 2015 recording repository inception. The OIT Training Recording Repository has more than 1,200 registered users. As of April 2019, completed the development and release of more than 54 software updates, including 5 versions, 40 patches, and 9 termin ology content releases to date. Completed testing and progressing with development to implement the upgraded Intersystems HealthShare platform, replacing the previous Ensemble version with an expected completion early FY 2020. Completed and implemented v1.0 of the Electronic Clinical Quality Measures Engine supporting the import of Quality Reporting Document Architecture (QRDA) Category I (CAT-I) files generated by the eCQM Export Tool CJ - 96 (RPMS namespace BQRE); calculation of Eligible Provider (EP) and aggregate Eligible Hospital (EH) clinical quality measures and generating measure reports; generation of Quality Reporting Document Architectur e (QRDA) Category III (CAT -III) files for CMS and/or Registry reporting; the ability to import the QRDA CAT -I in either JSON or XML format; and the automated pull of the QRDA CAT -I files from and automated push of the QRDA CAT -III files to the eCQM Export Tool (RPMS namespace BQRE). The program completed the development and certification of 2018 Clinical Quality Measures, including 6 new measures specific to diabetes care. The National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) continued to facilitate the improved Uniform Data System (UDS) reporting capabilities for the Urban Indian Health Program. UDS reporting is required performance reporting for HRSA -funded health centers. The program also created and enhanced the Data Warehouse Export System (BDW) ex tract - extensive analysis to improve data extraction for business intelligence (BI). This included efforts to mature the Business Intelligence Enterprise reporting environment and developed a Center of Excellence (COE) framework to support BI delivery standards and reuse across the agency. The program also Developed Clinical Efficiency and Effectiveness Indicators for the Division of Oral Health. GIS mapping was integrated with community based poverty levels for Division of Program Statistics (DPS) into an enterprise geoanalytics solution to standard geospatial reporting. IT Operations implemented the ServiceNow Knowledge Management (KM) application to enable the sharing of information in knowledge bases related to Information Technology. These knowledge bases will contain articles that provide users with information such as self -help, troubleshooting, and task resolution. This capability will improve continuity processes and knowledge sha ring of critical employee, administrative, and operational functions through written communications and documentation within the IHS . Migrated all 1,300+ VPN users across the IHS enterprise from the use of Citrix to the more robust and flexible RDS solution. Designed and implemented enterprise solution to support successful deployment of IHS's primary EHR on Windows 10.

This upgrade doubled the network capacity in IHS data centers supporting Tribal partners. IHS completed 15 network upgrades and IHS facilities to modernize network infrastructure and meet a critical need for more bandwidth. An additional 35 site upgrades are planned for FY19. IT Operations replaced end-of -life network equipment at all HQ managed facilities and implemented firewalls between IHS and each tribal facili ty connected to the IHS Tribal Wide Area Network. IT Security and Compliance maintained a 98.79 percent compliance rate on distributing virus definitions to all IHS managed computers. Maintained Enterprise Patch Management services by deploying critical Windows security patches to systems that remain unpatched the 1st Tuesday of the following month that the patch is released. Sustained Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation tools to fortify the cybersecurity of computer networks and systems and provide a standard toolset across IHS and Government giving insight to network security and the IHS and Federal level. CJ - 97 This aids IHS in identifying vulnerabilities rapidly, provides a common operational picture of network health/ integrity, allows comparison of cross -agency performance using common objective data and reduces total costs for purchasing cybersecurity tools/ services through commodity of scale. Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation - Projects are underway to fortify the cybersecurity of computer networks and systems by providing a standard toolset across IHS that provides insight into network security. This aids IHS in identifying vulnerabilities rapidly, provides a common operational picture of network health/ integrity, allows comparison of cross - agency performance using common objective data and reduces total costs for purchasing cybersecurity tools/ services through commodity of scale. IHS is currently deploying and utilizing several CDM tools provided by DHS in order to gain visibility into federal a ssets and monitor vulnerabilities. We are also receiving up to date intel regarding security threats from DHS, HHS, CISA and other sources. IHS requires additional staffing resources to fully utilize the CDM toolsets. Enterprise Patch Management -IHS Patch Management policy was incorporated into the Configuration Management (CM) policy in the Indian Health Manual. IHS submitted a new Cybersecurity Part 10 for the Indian Health Manual (IHM) that consists of 19 chapters relating to specific cybersecurity activities. The implementation of these new policies will ensure information security activities are defined and executed consistently across the IHS enterprise to protect both information and systems. IT Management implemented the Planview System that p rovides an enterprise IT portfolio and project management capability and enables IHS to improve project performance oversight, and monitor corrective actions through to completion. Office of Information Technology (OIT) staff presented current HIT initiatives at various tribal or tribal health board conferences and meetings such as TribalNet; National Tribal Health Conference, Tribal Technical Advisory Group, National Indian Health Board (NIHB), NIHB Medicare, Medicaid, and Health Reform Policy Committee; I HS Tribal Self Governance Advisory Committee; and the Direct Service Tribes Advisory Committee quarterly meetings, etc. OIT staff regularly participated in Tribal Delegation Meetings at IHS Headquarters and attended the Alaska Area Pre- negotiation/Negotia tion meetings to address IT/HIT issues. The program collaborated and supported five Self -Governance Compacts/Contracts with Oglala Sioux, Cheyenne River Sioux, Rosebud Sioux, Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, and the Sac and Fox of Missouri to assist these tribes in transitioning ownership of their health IT systems from federally operated to tribally operated systems. IT Operations provided Rural Health Care (RHC) Program support to over 150 Tribal locations FY 2019. IHS enrolled 10 new Tribal sites into the IHS Consortium. Developed and implemented Phase 2 of the New Medicare Card initiative facilitating the documentation and reporting in RPMS of newly issued Medicare Beneficiary ID numbers. Over 400,000 messages were exchanged between patients, providers, administrators, message agents and received from external HISPs through approximately 29,590 unique direct e -mail addresses since Sept 2015. The IHS Personal Health Record (PHR) has approximately 26,000 total users. 62 percent of these registered PHR users were verified/linked to their IHS Medical Record. The remaining 38 percent are registered but not yet verified/linked. The Master Patient Index/Health Information Exchange completed onboarding 171 of the 174 requesting sites. Additional sites cont inue to be on boarded as agreements are established. Immediate Priorities and Challenges The IHS HIT Portfolio continues to face increased demand for systems improvements and enhancements, rising costs, and increased IT security requirements driven in part by medical advances, and ever-growing and more complex requirements for health information technology CJ - 98 capabilities. These requirements come from government and industry initiatives, program needs of health programs, and operational requests of I/T/U health care facilities. Each new program initiative has information technology requirements for functionality, modal ity, data collection, and reporting which then must be added to a clinician's work flow and managed within the HIT portfolio. The largest priority and challenge involves the IHS RPMS system and its dependency on the VA for software development. RPMS is im pacted by the VA's announcement to adopt the Military Health System \"Genesis\" solution to replace its current legacy Health IT platform, VistA. This move will impact IHS as the RPMS system is dependent on the VA's VistA system through shared software development. The IHS adopts software developed by the VA and adapts it for use in RPMS. Thus, the VA's decision means that a significant supplier of software source code that modernizes and supports RPMS will decline over time. The IHS previously adopted the VA software with minimal funding expenditure in support of a similar but different agency mission. The loss of the VA as a source of software code will raise the cost of continuing to use the RPMS system, and/or require IHS to procure commercial -off-the -shel f replacements for RPMS. CyberSecurity challenges include minimizing unsecured systems and data to reduce the possibility of identity theft, risk to patient health data, system breaches and loss of business continuity in the event of a disaster. System breach or intrusion into an unsecure network puts patient data at risk, impacts the IHS mission by delaying or halting patient care and harms IHS patients which may lead to a lack of trust in patient services. Human resource shortages and slow staff backfill contributes to challenges in keeping up with evolving technology and new Federal, Department and Agency projects/initiatives including FITARA Implementation. FUNDING HISTORY/REQUEST Fiscal Year Budget $182,149,000 TRIBAL SHARES H&HC (IT is funded out of H&HC) funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for carrying out the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. A portion of the overall H&HC budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. 2This represents the total cost of HIT within IHS federal programs. The majority is from Hospitals & Health Clinics budget line with a small amount from Direct Operations for federal personnel and travel. CJ - 99 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 20 21 budget submission for Health Information Technology of $182.1 million is the same as the FY 2020 Enacted level. This funding will continue progress made in past years by minimizing infrastructure costs and maintaining a high level of productivity and commitment by both federal and contractor staff supporting the IHS -developed health information solutions. IHS uses open source tools where possible to minimize acquisition costs and is reducing use of more costly assisted acquisition providers such as the General Services Adm inistration. However, following the announcement by the VA, the IHS is considering the sustainability of the entire RPMS HIT platform. Efforts are underway to examine alternatives to replace or modify RPMS as the IHS HIT platform. The IHS must conduct thorough analysis activities that resu lt in informed decision making regarding any replacement option . Any change in EHR platforms will impact the quality of direct patient care, increase cost recovery and promote continuous health improvements such as, expanded telehealth care services and predictive population health analytics. These potential returns highlight the value of health IT and its impact on the agency mission.

The IHS modernization plan must address many systems that include Dentrix for Dental services, Health Information Exchange connections , Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) for radiology, data analysis and healthcare analytics, population health reporting, laboratory equipment, biomedical equipment, and numerous interfaces to enable coordination of care and efficient workflows for providers. The IHS HIT infrastructure and is used to provide critical support for the I ndian Health Service/Tribal/U rban (I/T /U) health care system that care s for 2. 6 million American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. In September 2018, HHS awarded a contract to Emerging Sun, LLC for an IHS HIT Modernization Research Project. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) HIT Modernization Project provide s a comprehensive assessment of the people, process, and technology that comprise the existing IHS HIT system, including the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS). The project delivered a detailed Analysis of Alternatives 2 and Roadmap for HIT Modernization to support this funding request in late September of 2019. IT Infrastructure and Operations Modernization -Significant improvements are required for the current IT infrastructure in order to support the deployment of a new or modernized EHR solutio n. IHS must enhance cybersecurity, improve IT service management, expand storage and computing capacity, and increase network bandwidth at dozens of rural locations to enable a successful EHR transformation.

FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2017 $0 2018 $0 2019 $0 2020 $125,000,000 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2021 budget submission for the EHR of $125.0 million is $117.0 million above the FY 2020 Enacted level. These funds will be used at the discretion of the IHS Director, and available until expended. This funding will lay the groundwork to improve the quality of care, reduce the cost of care, promote interoperability, simplify IT service management, increase the security of patient data, enhance cybersecurity, and update infrastructure across rural locations to enable a successful Electronic Health Record transition. This will include the continuation of project management operations, acquisition planning, EHR selection, additional tribal consultation, initial infrastructure build, site implementation planning, and continued RPMS stabilization and support. The project will follow industry standards for modernization or replacement of Electronic Health Record systems to leverage expertise and experience in the private sector. This effort directly supports IHS's entire Strategic Goals structure. Health Information Technology Modernization -This project holds an extremely high degree of mission criticality given the ability to provide much- anticipated clinical and administrative capabilities used in modern systems for the delivery of timely and impactful healthcare. Expected benefits from adopting and implementing a modernized system include but are not limited to improved patient safety, i mproved patient outcomes, better disease management, enhanced population health, improved clinical quality measures, opioid tracking, patient data exchange, third party revenue generation, agency performance reporting, etc. By identifying and properly sel ecting the best match for proposed system capabilities, the system will support the mission of the IHS. Additionally, the IHS aims to obtain interoperability with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, tribal and urban programs, academ ic affiliates, and community partners, many of whom are on different IT platforms. The IHS must consider an integrated EHR system that will allow for a meaningful integration to create a system that serves I/T/U beneficiaries in the best possible way. During the estimated 10 -year implementation, IHS expect s to temporarily increase the HIT workforce to acquire and implement this system. CJ - 102 IHS Legacy EHR System Modernization -The current IHS EHR, Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), has been identified by the Government Accountability Office as one of HHS' s top three systems in most need of modernization due to lack of development and enhanc ement work over the past decade. IHS must maintain the existing EHR system until implementati on of the new system is complet e. IT Infrastructure and Operations Modernization -These IT Infrastructure Modernization initiatives are required to provide the platform for which the EHR operates and support redundancy capacity .

The DHP is a service-oriented program providing basic dental services (e.g., diagnostic, emergency, preventive, and basic restorative care), which represents approximately 90 percent of the dental services provided . In FY 201 8, the dental program provided a total of 3,855,924 basic dental services. More complex rehabilitative care (e.g., root canals, crown s and bridge s, dentures, and surgical extractions) is provided where resources allow and account for the additional 278,131 dental services provided in FY 2018. The DHP provided these services through 1,386,821 dental visits in FY 201 8, in 404 dental programs in 37 states. Across all age groups, AI/ANs suffer disproportionately from dental disease. When compared to other racial or ethnic groups, AI/AN children 2 -5 years old have more than double the number of decayed teeth and overall dental caries experience as the next highest ethnic group, U.S. Hispanics, and more than four times that of U.S. white ch ildren. 2 In the 6-9 year -old age group, 8 out of 10 AI/AN children have a history of dental caries compared with only 45 percent of the general U.S. population, and almost half of AI/AN children have untreated tooth decay compared to just 17 percent of the general U.S. population in this age group.3 In the 13-15 year -old age 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019.

In addition, the rate of severe periodontal disease in AI/AN adults is almost double that of the general U.S. population.5 Prevention activities improve health and reduce the amount and cost of subsequent dental care. The DHP measures performance in part through the delivery of preventive services. The DHP maintains data and tracks three key program objectives: 1. Increase the proportion of 2 -15 year-olds with dental sealants; 2. Increase the proportion of 1 -15 year-olds receiving at least one application of topical fluorides; and 3. Increas e access to care across all age groups. The DHP funds provide critical support for direct health care services focused upon strengthening the collaborative partnerships among direct care providers, patients, communities, and internal and external stakeholders. Funds are utili zed to ensure IHS, Tribal, and u rban Indian health organizations have comprehensive, culturally appropriate services and personnel available and accessible, promotes excellence and quality through implemented quality improvement strat egies, and strengthens the IHS program management and operations to address health disparities and raise the health status of AI/AN populations to the highest level possible The DHP provides critical services in support of the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 (IHS SP) and the HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022 (HHS SP). Dental services are important in ensuring comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available to AI/AN people (IHS SP Goal 1). DHP implements several effo rts to improve quality (IHS SP Goal 2) of dental health services and in strengthening management and operations (IHS SP Goal 3). Central to DHP efforts is support of cross-collaboration and partnerships among I/T/U stakeholders (IHS SP Objective 1.2). Th e DHP provides essential services to increase dental health access and education which supports the HHS SP Goal 1: Reform, strengthen, and modernize the nation's healthcare system, and Goal 5: Promote effective and efficient management and stewardship. The program accomplishments section below provides details about DHP efforts. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Early Childhood Caries Collaborative The IHS Early Childhood Caries (ECC) Collaborative was a nationwide initiative that was conducted from 2009 to 2017 and focused on preventing tooth decay in AI/AN children under the age of 71 months. Dental caries are the most common health problem in children, almost eight times more common than childhood asthma, and have significant consequences such as delayed speech development, more missed school days when children begin school, poor self -esteem, and 4 Phipps KR, Ricks TL, Blahut P.

(Supports IHS S P 1.2 and HHS S P Objective1.2: Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition.) By the end of this collaborative , the IHS had increased access to dental care for AI/A N children under 71 months by 7.9 percent and significantly increased prevention and early intervention efforts (sealants increased by 65.0 percent, the number of children receiving fluoride varnish increased by 68.2 percent, and the number of thera peutic fillings increased by 161 percent). (Supports IHS S P Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services; and HHS SP Objective 1.3: Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options.) This resulted in a 5 percent reduction in caries (tooth decay) experience from 2010 to 2019, and a 14 percent reduction in untreated decay in 1- 5 year-olds (with statistical significance) at a national level; in addition, the Navajo, Oklahoma City, and Phoenix Areas had statistically significant reductions in caries experience from 2010 to 2019. (Supports the IHS SP Goal 2: To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization, IHS Objective 2.2: Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and HHS SP Objective1.2 .) This represents the first recorded decrease in tooth decay in young children in the IHS and is evidence of success of the Early Childhood Carie s Collaborative. Furthermore, this success has impacted older children: the 2016- 17 survey of 6-9 year-old children showed that caries experience decreased from 92 percent to 87 percent in this age group from 1999 to 2016- 17, while untreated caries decreased from 73 percent to 47 percent over the same time period . These data represent the first recorded decrease in tooth decay in this age group as well and reflects positively on the ECC Collaborative and the ongoing prevention efforts of the DHP focusing on schoolchildren. Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Centers In recent years, the DHP has utilized field dental programs in conjunction with its Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Centers (DSC) to achieve national performance objectives , support IHS Area initiatives , and support the IHS Strategic Plan for FY 2019- 2023. (S upport s IHS S P Objective 1.2 and HHS SP Objective1.2 .) The DSCs were designed and implemented in FY 2000 to augment the dental public health infrastructure necessary t o best meet the oral health needs of AI/AN communities. The current five-year cycle ends September 1 4, 2020. A total of eight DSCs serve 10 of the 12 IHS Geographic Areas; three are funded by program awards and five are funded through grants. Expansion of the DSCs, utilizing best practices learned from programs of the existing DCSs would assist in controlling oral disease and oral health disparities experienced in susceptible or high -risk populations. The primary purpose of a DSC is to provide technical support, training, and assistance in clinical and preventive aspects of dental programs providing care to AI/AN communities. As a direct result of the advocacy efforts of the DSCs, the number of key preventive procedures has increased significantly in recent years. For example, the number of dental sealants placed per year has tripled in the last decade, and the number of patients receiving topical fluoride treatments has more than doubled in the last five years. In FY 2013, the DHP began trac king the coverage or prevalence of children and adolescents receiving sealants and topical fluoride, rather than simply counting procedures. These CJ - 106 assessments allow improved comparisons with data from the U.S. population compiled by the Healthy People 2020 initiative. DSCs were initially funded in FY 2000. In the ensuing years, these DSCs had an immediate positive impact on the direct delivery of dental care in a number of ways : All centers advocated for an appropriate focus on the dental Government Perf ormance and Results Act ( GPRA) performance objectives to increase specific clinical services. All centers provided continuing education opportunities to enhance the quality of care delivered. Several centers provided on -site clinical and community based program reviews to enhance the quality of care, assuring that field programs maintained a high level of expertise with respect to challenges such as infection control, preparing for accreditation and certification reviews, and patient scheduling practices aimed at maximizing access to care. Several centers provided an array of health education materials or designed materials customized to the specific needs of the IHS Areas they serve. These materials have increased the quality of IHS oral health education efforts throughout Indian Country. Several centers provided or arranged for direct clinical services that otherwise would not have been provided. The aggregate accomplishments of the DSCs have resulted in an increase in clinical preventive care, an increase in overall clinical services, and an enhancement of the quality of clinical and community based care delivered by the dental field programs. Dental Health Data Access to dental services is a prerequisite to the control of oral disease in susceptible o r high -risk populations. The access to care GPRA objective is currently aligned with Healthy People 2020 methodology as a percentage of patients who have visited the dentist within the previous 12 months . (GPRA measure data support s the IHS S P Objective 1.3 and HHS S P Objective1.3. ) The access to care goal in FY 2019, was 2 7.2 percent and the DHP achieved 30 percent, meeting the goal for the first time in two years and increasing from FY 2017 when the final result was 28.24 percent. The dentist to population ratio in the IHS system continues to be very low when compared to the ratio in the U.S. private sector. This low dentist to population ratio and an increase in population growth in the AI/AN population will continue to present a challenge in achieving the access rate goal. The IHS has 1,023 dentists (including part-time) in the system, according to the IHS Dental Directory. 8 In 2017, there were 2,895,571 AI/AN in the U.S., according to the most recent user population estimate.9 That means that the IHS system has approximately 1 dentist per 2,830 patients served. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were an estimated 153,500 dentists in the U.S. in 2016 10 serving a population of 325,719,178,11 meaning that there is approximately 1 dentist per 2,122 people served. Topical fluorides and dental sealants have been extensively researched and documented in the dental literature as safe and effective preventive interventions to reduce tooth decay. In FY 2013, the tracking of dental sealants and the tracking of patients receiving topical fluoride measures changed from simple counts of procedures or patients to the percentage of children receiving 8 Indian Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services.

New annual targets were set for these two objectives as of July 1, 2013. In FY 2019, 32.10 percent of 1-15 year-old children received topical fluoride, an increase from 16.3 percent when this measure was first tracked in FY 2015 , and surpassing the annual goal of 30.0 percent. In FY 201 9, 15.9 percent of 2 -15 year -old children received sealants, a slight decrease from 16.04 percent in FY 2018 , barely missing the national goal of 16 percent. The DHP continues to assess the care provided by its programs through a robust, continuing oral health surveillance program that started in 2010 and is planned through 2025. (Supports the IHS SP Goal 3: To Strengthen IHS program management and operations through Objective 3.3: Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decision. It also supports the HHS S trategic Plan Goal 4: Foster sound, sustained advances in the sciences through HHS Objective 4.1: Improve surveillance, epidemiology, and laborator y services. ) 0-5 year -old AI/ AN children were surveyed in 2010, 2014, and 2018-19; 6-9 year -old children were surveyed in 2011 -12 and 2016-17: 13-15 year -old youth were surveyed in 2013 and 2019 - 20; and AI/AN adults were surveyed in 2015. The surveillance program has been used as a model nationally and helps highlight disparities in disease burden and distribution in the AI/AN population. Results of all surveys can be found in data briefs located on the IHS Dental Portal at www.ihs.gov/doh , and data from this surveillance program is also included in the CDC National Oral Health Surveillance System, allowing public health advocates to compare AI/AN disease prevalence with individual state or national data. Dental Health Service Delivery Improvem ents The DHP has also made significant improvements in the way dental services are delivered. Through the implementation of an electronic dental record (EDR), over 70 percent of IHS and tribal dental programs have been transitioned to an electronic dental record system that will support the delivery of effective quality dental services. The IHS Dentrix Enterprise (DXE) Electronic Dental Record EDR program has been successfully implemented at 244 IHS Federal, Tribal, and Urban dental clinics. The EDR provides accurate data collection and dissemination through the IHS National Data Warehouse. This data supports evaluation of Oral Health Initiatives such as the Early Childhood Caries collaborative and future data development could improve outcome measurements. Further improvements in billing capabilities could increase third party collections. (Supports IHS S P Goal 3: To Strengthen IHS program management and Operations through Objective 3.3: Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions . It also supports the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5: Promote Effective and Efficient Management and Stewardship through Objective 5.3: Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals.) A second improvement was the release of 20 new dental clinic efficiency and effectiveness standards by which IHS and tribal dental programs can measure clinical productivity, staffing ratios, and specific clinical efficiency indicators against national averages. A third way the DHP has improved the delivery of care is through the development of new national protocols for the early screening and treatment of periodontal disease in adults. (The implementation of dental clinical and efficiency standards and the national periodontal health screening protocols support the IHS SP Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization through strategies that focus on providing training, coaching, and mentoring to ensure quality improvement and accountability of staff at all lev els of the organization. These 2 accomplishments also support the HHS S P Objective 1.2: Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encouraging innovation and competition.) A fourth way the DHP has improved the delivery of care is through ongoing support of long-term training (LTT) of general dentist to build the cadre of dental specialists in the IHS and tribal dental programs. (The DHP LTT program supports the IHS S P Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, and HHS S P Objective1.4: Strengthen and expand the CJ - 108 healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs.) Dentists completing DHP - sponsored LTT to become s pecialist such as pediatric dentists, periodontists, and endodontists have a service payback obligation to serve AI/AN patients. In the past 4 years, an Oral Maxillofacial Surgeon, an endodontist, four pediatric dentists, and periodontist have returned fr om LTT to serve AI/AN patients. A fifth way the DHP is improving the delivery of services is through the adoption of an integrated care model, specifically in promoting depression screenings by dental health providers through a collaboration with the IHS Behavioral Health Program. (The collaborative efforts between the DHP and the IHS Behavioral Health Program to improve the delivery of services support the IHS S P Objective 2.1. These 2 accomplishments also support the HHS S P Objective 1.2:Expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encouraging innovation and competition.) The DHP continues to improve the delivery of services is through a sustained (20+ years) continuing dental education (CDE) program. The IHS CDE program provides American Dental Association Commission for Continuing Education Provider Recognition approved quality education with over 250 clinical and public health courses to IHS and tribal dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, and dental public health leadership. The total number of CDE courses offered has increased from 149 in FY 2014 , to over 250 in FY 2019 . Between 201 6 and 2019 , a total of over 120,000 hours of CDE were awarded, an estimated value of up to $24 million ($200/hour). In a ddition, through a concentrated effort to train alternative dental workforce models, since 2016 the CDE Program has trained over 350 dental assistants in expanded functions, thereby increasing productivity and efficiency of IHS and tribal clinics. The models of expanded function dental assistants have been shown to increase access to dental care in the DHP by up to 3.0 percent , increase total services delivered by dental programs up to 5.1 percent, and increase the total services per patient visit by up to 14 percent. (The DHP CDE program supports the IHS SP Objective 2.1 through strategies that focus on providing training, coaching, and mentoring to ensure quality improvement and accountability of staff at all levels of the organization. The DHP continues to evaluate training efforts and staff implementation of improvements, as appropriate. The DHP CDE program also supports the HHS SP Objective 1.2.) The DHP continues to be on the forefront of hot issues in public health dentistry. For example, in 2018 the DHP worked in collaboration with the IHS Heroin, Opioids, and Pain Efforts (HOPE) Committee to develop the IHS Dental Pain Management Guidelines in an effort to lessen the impact of dental professionals prescribing habits on the ever-growing opioid epidemic in the U.S. The guidelines are available at the IHS Dental Portal at www.ihs.gov/doh . Another hot issue is the lack of understanding patients have regarding their own oral health, and the DHP has worked to promote oral health literacy through outreach activities and educational materials developed for AI/AN patients. (The IHS Pain Management Guidelines and promotion of health literacy support the IHS SP Objective 1.3 and HHS S P Objective1.3. ) FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2017 $182,597,000 $197,949,000 President's Budget $219,380 ,000 CJ - 109 TRIBAL SHARES Dental funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to tribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. A portion of the overall Dental budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2021 budget submission for Dental is $219.4 million, which is $8.8 million above the FY 2020 Enacted level. FY 20 20 Base Funding of $2 10.6 million will support oral health care services provided by IHS and t ribal programs, maintain the program's progress in raising the quality of and access to oral care through continuing recruitment of oral health care professionals t o meet workforce needs, and to meet or exceed agency targets.

As many as five grant awards may be made, at an annual funding level of $250,000 each, with the purpose being to es tablish Dental Preventive and Clinical Support Centers Programs (also known as Dental Support Centers or DSCs). The DSCs combine IHS and tribal resources and infrastructure in order to address broad challenges and opportunities associated with preventive and clinical dental programs. Centers also rigorously measure and evaluate their work with the goal of demonstrably improving dental health outcomes through the technical assistance and services they provide. Centers may work simultaneously to improve many different dental programs in a region, providing support, guidance, training, and enhancement to these programs, which then provide services to patients.

The MH/SS program supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2, to provide care that better meets the health care needs of American Indians and Alaska Native communities. The most common MH/SS program model is an outpatient service staffed by one or more mental health professionals providing individual, family, and group psychotherapeutic services and case management. After hour s emergency services are generally provided through local emergency departments and contract s with non-IHS hospitals and crisis centers. Inpatient services are generally purchased from non-IHS hospitals or provided by state or county hospitals providing mental health services. Intermediate level services such as group homes, transitional living support, intensive case management, and related activities are typically offered through state and local resources. Additionally, slightly more than one -half of the tribes administer and deliver their own mental health programs. IHS continues to support tribal communities in their ability to address the mental health disparities experienced among the AI/AN population. IHS Mental Health initiatives and grant programs support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 that ensures comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible. In partnership with tribal community partners, a collaborative community of learning will support IHS efforts to 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019.

CJ - 112 promote excellence and quality through the development of innovative, community -based projects to expand mental health services and treatment in integrated clinical settings . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Suicide Prevention : Suicide rates among AI/ANs are historically higher than those of the total U.S. population. In 2016, the suicide rate for AI/AN adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 34 (19.5 per 100,000) was 1.3 times higher than the national average for that age group (14.5 per 100,000). Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among all AI/AN across all ages.2 Strategies to address behavioral health, alcohol, substance use disorder, and suicide prevention require comprehensive clinical strategies, and approaches. The IHS utilizes and pr omotes collaborations and partnerships with patients and their families, including tribes and tribal organizations, Urban Indian organizations , federal, state, and local agencies, as well as public and private organizations. The 2017 -2022 National AI/AN S uicide Prevention Strategic Plan advances the 2012 National Suicide Strategic Plan with culturally relevant approaches and strategies specific for AI/AN communities. 3 The IHS utilizes a suicide surveillance reporting tool to document incidents of suicide in a standardized and systematic fashion. The suicide surveillance tool captures data related to specific incidents of suicide ideation with plan; suicide attempts; and suicide deaths through the use of the Suicide Report Forms (SRF) which includ es date and location of act, method, contributing factors, and other useful epidemiological information to better understand the issue, identified risk factors and target resources appropriately. In FY 2019, tribal communities submitted 2 ,387 completed Suic ide Report Forms . Zero Suicide Initiative: The \"Zero Suicide\" philosophy is a key concept of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (NSSP) and is a priority of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (Action Alliance). Zero Suicide focuses on developing a system -wide approach to i mproving care for individuals at risk of suicide who are currently utilizing health and behavioral health systems. Health care systems are uniquely poised to identify those struggling with thoughts of suicide by considering the following data: 50 percent of those who die by suicide had contact with a primary care provider within 1 month of suicide 80 percent of those who die by suicide had contact with a primary care provider within 1 year of suicide 20 percent of those who die by suicide had visited with behavioral health within 1 year of suicide 10 percent of those who die by suicide had visited the emergency department within 2 months of suicide In FY 2017, IHS received $3.6 million to fund 8 pilot IHS and t ribal sites to participate in its first cohort of the Zero Suicide Initiative , five tribal and three federal facilities, funded at 2 US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Available from http://www.cdc.gov/injury/ wisqars/index.html CJ - 113 $400,000 to implement the Zero Suicide Model within their healthcare system. Each project plan includes utilizing evidence -based treatments in suicide care, initiating safety plans with patients at risk for suicide, implementing intensive follow -up upon missed or cancelled appointment s, universal suicide screening of all at -risk patients, increasing restriction of lethal means, implementing intensive case management, and initiating follow up with patients within 24 hours of transition of care. In year two, all project sites have successfully established a Zero Suicide policy and have developed suicide risk screening procedures, clinical pathways, and data collection plans to enhance surveillance and analysis capabilities . By the end of Year 2, sites participating in the Zero Suicide Initiative report ed more than 200,000 outpatient contacts. In FY 2019, the IHS and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) partnered by way of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to address the high rates of suicide impacting the AI/AN communities. With this three year partnership (FY 2 019- 2021) , IHS and NIH will work together to implement the Ask Suicide Screening Questions (ASQ) and its accompanying toolkit for universal screening within IHS Emergency Departments (EDs). ASQ is a suicide screening resource developed by NIMH for medical settings to help nurses or physicians successfully identify individuals at risk for suicide. In FY 2019, IHS conducted a site visit and staff training on the ASQ, and partnered with IHS OIT to fully integrate the validated suicide risk screening instrument into the IHS electronic health records system for field implementation. These efforts support several IHS Strategic Plan including Goal 1 Objective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships and Goal 3, Objective 3.3 to modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions . Trauma -Informed Care: Trauma Informed Care supports the IHS Strategic Goal 2, Objective 2.2 , by providing care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. IHS has worked to implement the principles of trauma informed care to ensure its system understands the prevalence and impact of trauma, facilitates healing, avoids re -traumatization, and focuses on strength and resilience. Developing and implementing a trauma informed care approach to address childhood trauma, including historical trauma, is necessary to comprehensively address the root causes of violenc e, suicide, depression, anxiety, self -harm, and chronic physical diseases. In September 2016, the MH/SS and Improving Patient Care and the Johns Hopkins University developed the Pediatric Integ rated Care Collaborative (PICC) pilot project. The PIC C focus ed on increasing the quality and accessibility of child trauma services by integrating behavior and physical health services in patient -centered medical homes. Initially, ten PICC pilot sites were selected to attend in-person and virtual quality improvement learning collaborative sessions where they received tailored technical assistance to integrate trauma informed care into pediatric primary care. The goal of the pilot project was to harvest lessons learned t hat improve implementation of screening for trauma among the pediatric population, engaging families, and developing policy recommendations for the Indian health system . In FY 2019, IHS continue d to support seven sites established in FY 2018 , alongside the previous ly selected tribal and IHS sites to develop a quality improvement model. In addition, these supported sites completed site assessments, developed implementation plans and have shared best and promising practices for trauma informed care. In FY 2020, l essons learned from the PICC will be used by I HS to incorporate into a standalone trauma informed care policy in the Indian Health Manual, accompanied by on -demand online training for clinical and non-clinical staff . In 2019, IHS continued to partner with the University of N ew Mexico (UNM) to develop an online training curriculum related to tra uma and trauma-informed care tailored for IHS staff, clinical staff, and supervisors. UNM adapt ed the Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care CJ - 114 (CCTIC) model to be culturally appropria te and for use within AI/AN communities. The training seeks to increase staff knowledge of the impact of historical trauma on American Indian/Alaska Native populations, the types of trauma, the impacts of trauma on physical and behavioral health, and the principles and implementation of Trauma Informed Care. The UNM CCTIC is now available as an online on-demand webinar series for clinical and non-clinical staff. The goal of the CCTIC is to facilitate organizational change built around five core values: s afety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration, and empowerment. Staff training focused on recognizing trauma and its impact, becoming trauma informed, treating trauma, and ensuring supervisors at all managerial levels understand the impact of trauma and historical trauma in employee performance, coworker relationships, and well-being. In FY 2021, IHS will expand the training to incorporate additional modules and continuing education credits for healthcare professions. Behavioral Health Integration Initiative (BH2I) : IHS supports changing the paradigm of mental health and substance abuse disorder services from being episodic, fragmented, specialty, and/or disease focused to incorporating it into the patient -centered medical home. The statistics facing AI/AN peoples for suicide, alcohol -related deaths, domestic and sexual violence, and homicide require the Indian health system to develop a system of comprehensive screening and effective intervention to reduce morbidity and early mortality. In FY 2 017, IHS received $6 million to launch the Behavioral health Integration Initiative, which is on a three-year funding cycle through FY 2020. BH2I supports the IHS Strategic Goal 1, Objective 1.3, to increase access to quality health care services. In FY 2019, IHS continued funding for 12 IHS, tribal, and urban Indian organizations to integrate behavioral health with primary care services in their local health facilities. Additionally, IHS contracted with a technical assistance (TA) provider to guide this pilot project through the implementation of their integrated care efforts with expertise from psychiatrists, primary care physicians, and social workers. A primary goal of the BH2I is to formalize integration across the system, develop care teams, strength en infrastructure, and enhance clinical processes including increased depression screenings in primary care clinics. The TA provider has also develo ped and implemented a cross - site evaluation of the BH2I initiative to help IHS determine the impact of BH2I. While the initiative focuses on increased implementation of depression screening in primary care clinics, this project will include additional measures that reflect organizational change for behavioral health integration beyond focusing solely on screenin g rates. Thus far, BH2I projects have reported successes such as same day access to behavioral health providers and reduction in wait times to see a psychiatrist. Reflective of the Agency priority to raise the mental health of the AI/AN population, in FY 2019, IHS report ed 42.6 percent of AI/AN adults over the age of 18 screened for depression using a standardized screening assessment for depression. In FY 2019 , this same measure was reported for youth ages 12-17 and data indicated 37.3 percent of eligible youth were screened for depression. For FY 201 9, targets were based on prior year results and both measures exceeded their targets. TeleBehavioral Health and Workforce Development : The IHS TeleBehavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) was established in 2009, utilizing funds from the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative, to assess the feasibility of providing behavioral health services via televideo. Due to the rural nature of many IHS and t ribal facilities, I/T/U patients face many issues surrounding access to care, particularly specialty care. P roviders working in these remote areas often face barri ers to maintaining the required c ontinuing e ducation (CE)/Continuing Education Unit (CEU) credit s required for licensure and remaining up to date on current clinical guidelines . The TBHCE assists IHS, tribal, and urban Indian organizations providers and CJ - 115 facilities in overcom ing these challenges by providing a range of telebehavioral health services and training. There are 2 5 sites receiving direct care services through the TBHCE. These services include, adult counseling, child counseling, family counseling, trauma/P ost Traumatic Stress Disorder (P TSD ) counseling, child psychiatry, adult psychiatry, and addiction psychiatry. In FY 2019, the TBHCE provided more than 4,627 hours of telebehavioral health services . Additionally, the TBCHE hosts a robust weekly, tele -education schedule designed to meet the specific training needs of IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian (I/T/U) health care providers. The tele - education program supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.1, to recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce . More specifically, IHS utilizes tele - education (otherwise known as distance learning) to deliver national continuing education (CE) programming to I/T/U healthcare providers. In FY 2019, TBHCE provided 105 webinars that resulted in a total of 2,747 overall training hours and 1,431 CE hours. Additionally, TBHCE now hosts four online courses that were accessed for a total of 1,844.25 overall training hours and 923 CE hours. The TBHCE also developed and supports the online IHS Essential Training on Pain and Addiction. In FY 2019 , 302 I/T/U providers completed this five -hour training. Additionally, 251 I/T/U clinicians completed the TBHCE hosted Essential Training on Pain and Addiction Refresher course. Evaluation data of the TBHCE \"Trainings in Pain Management and Opioid Substance Use Disorder\" indicated a positive change in the knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitude among IHS clinicians toward virtual educational trainings focused on pain management and best practices to effectively manage chronic p ain.

A portion of the overall Mental Health budget line is reserved fo r inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2021 budget submission for Mental Health is $ 128.2 million, which is $ 19.3 million above the FY 2020 Enacted level. FY 20 20 Base Funding of $108.9 million - This funding will maintain the program's progress in addressing mental health needs by improving access to behavioral health services through tele - behavioral health efforts and providing a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services. CJ - 116 FY 2021 Funding Increase of $19.3 Current for current services including: o Inflation +$ 961,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. Staffing for New Facilities +$1.9 million -These funds will support staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated facilities allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs. The following table displays this request. New Facilities Amount FTE/Tribal Positions Yukon -Kuskokwim Primary Care Center (JV), Bethel, Sur Health Paso, TX $200,000 2 Grand Total: $1,930,000 16 Telebehavioral Health Center +$2.9 million to expand telehealth services provided through the Tele Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) to have a significant impact on sustainable access to care. This includes: o Facilities -A new space specifically designed for telehealth is needed to rent, lease or be constructed with an estimated need of 4000 square feet. o Equipment and Hardware - Much of the equipment currently used is near or past recommended \"end-of-life\" and needs updating. This includes infrastructure such as, hardware, servers, and maintenance agreements. Also needed is the end-point equipment used by the providers and sites. o Behavioral Health Provider Staff -Demand from AI/AN communities for telebehavioral services has outstripped TBHCE's capacity, and there is a waitlist for new communities until additional capacity can be developed. Though current telebehavioral health services are self -sustaining through third party billing, there are no additional funds for expansion of staff capacity. The requested funds support hiring of additional provider FTEs to support the TBHCE. These include 8 clinical FTEs: FTE psychiatrists FTE social and FTE psychiatric nurse practitioner (GS-12/13). o Support Staff -TBHCE has a very small number of support staff. To meet the demand for services and expand, additional support staff are required. The requested funds support hiring of additional support FTEs to support the TBHCE. This would include: 1 FTE IT Network Specialist (GS-14), 1 Project Management Specialist (GS-13), 1 Management Analyst (GS -11), 1 FTE Data and QA/QI Specialist (GS -12).

Permanent Allocation Method ......... Direct Federal; P.L. 93 -638 Self -Determination contracts and compacts, Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Alcohol and substance abuse and addiction are among the most severe public health and safety problems facing American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals, families, and communities. The purpose of the Indian Health Service (IHS) Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is to raise the health status of AI/AN communities to the highest possible level through a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services that are community -driven and culturally competent. The ASAP addresses the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objecti ve 1.2 by building, strengthening, and sustaining collaborative relationships with I/T/Us and 1.3 increasing access to quality health care services. These collaborative activities strive to integrate substance abuse treatment into primary care. For instance, the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program provides prevention and intervention resources developed and delivered by local community partners to address the dual crises of substance abuse and suicide in AI/AN communities. In general, AI/AN populations suffer disproportionately from substance abuse disorders compared with other racial groups in the United States. Research has consistently found that AI/AN experience high rates of substance use compared with the U.S. general populat ion. As one example, a study from Koss et al. reported levels of alcohol dependence ranging from 21 to 56 percent for men and 17 to 30 percent for women, both higher when compared to the U.S. national averages for men and women (19 percent and 8.9, respectively In 2016, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population had the highest overdose rates from all opioids (13.9 deaths/ 100,000 population), including the largest percentage increase in the number of deaths between 1999-2015 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, for impacted funds. CJ - 120 compared to other racial and ethnic groups. In 2017, the age -adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths was 9.6 percent higher than the rate for 2016. During that time, deaths rose more than 500 percent among AI/ANs. In addition, due to misclassification of race and ethnicity on death certificates, the actual number of deaths for AI/A Ns may be underestimated by up to 35 percent.2 The services and functions of the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse program supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 to provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/AN communities and Goal 1 to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate services in the prevention, treatment and recovery of alcohol and substance use disorders. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS As alcohol and substance abuse treatment and prevention have transitioned from IHS direct care services to local community control via t ribal contracting and compacting, IHS' role has shifted to providing support to enable communities to plan, develop, and implement culturally informed programs. Organized to develop programs and program leadership, the major IHS ASAP activities and focus areas are: Integrated Substance Abuse Treatment in Primary Care : IHS continues to support the integration of substance abuse treatment into primary care and emergency services. Integrating treatment into health care offers immediate and same-day opportunities for health care providers to identify patients with substance use disorders, provide them with medical advice, help them communicate the health risks and consequences, obtain substance abuse consultations, and refer patients with more severe substance use- related problems to treatment. 3 One integration activity is the implementation of the Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) instrument , which is an early intervention and treatment service for people with substance use disorders and those at risk of developing these disorders. IHS has broadly promot ed SBIRT as an integral part of a sustainable, primary care-based activity that will support and integrate behavioral health into care. SBIRT is eligible for reimbursement from the Center s for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). IHS has incorporated SBIRT as a national measure to be tracked and reported. In FY 2019 , the SBIRT screening measure was utilized in 14.9 percent of the patient visits for those between ages 9 through 75. The target for this measure was 8.9 percent, therefore IHS efforts exceeded the expected percent of patients to be screened using the SBIRT. IHS continues to provide annual national training on SBIRT including guidelines for improved clinical documentation in the electronic health record. In FY 2020 , IHS continue s to increase efforts that broadly promote the SBIRT measure to achieve targets at the regional and local levels including a more focused education campaign on the importance of early detection and intervention using SBIRT screening among IHS operated programs. Increasing access to Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT): The Indian Health Service is committed to assuring access to Medication Assisted Treatment for patients struggling with Opioid Use Disorder. The IHS continues to host training sessions for clinicians to receive their Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) waiver to prescribe buprenorphine and in FY 2018 added buprenorphine -containing medication and injectable naltrexone to the IHS National Core Formulary. In June 2019, the IHS released the Special General Memorandum Assuring Access to MAT that requires Federal Indian Health Service Facilities to create an action plan to identify local medication assisted treatment (MAT) resources and coordinate patient access to these 2 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/ss/pdfs/ss6619.pdf 3 U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy. Integrating Treatment into Healthcare. Available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/integrating-treatment-and-healthcare. CJ - 121 services when indicated to assure equitable access to MAT services. In addition, the IHS has created workforce development strategies that include substance use disorder training for healthcare workers and technical assistance materials to support sites with creati ng integrated substance use disorder approaches to care. To address challenges that limit access to recovery services in remote and rural IHS locations and villages, the IHS released an Internet Eligible Controlled Substance Prescriber Designation Policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 38) to assure access to MAT using telemedicine models for remotely located Tribal members. In March 2019, the IHS released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on American Indian/Alaska Native Pregnant Women and Women of Childbearing Age with Opioid Use Disorder developed in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Women's Health. This resource will help provider s improve maternal participation in early prenatal care, improve screening for substance use disorder, and increase access to MAT for pregnant women and women of child -bearing age. The goal of these clinical recommendations is to foster relationships and improve awareness surrounding trauma - informed approaches to maternal opioid use that may lead to recovery, hope, and healing. Additionally, the IHS and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Native American Child Health (CONACH) recently released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome that includes clinical recommendations on the prevention and management of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. These recommendations provide standards of care for screening, diagnosing, support, and treatment of pregnant mothers and infants affected by prenatal opioid exposure Finally, IHS has partnered with the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and the Clinician Consultation Center to facilitate I /T/U clinician access to free Opioid Use Disorder tele- consultation services. These services are intended to assist clinicians with patient treatment planning, facilitate didactic learning, and provide support for health systems that desire to create local p rotocols. Proper Pain Management and Opioid Stewardship and Training: The IHS has created and released a comprehensive Opioid Stewardship workbook to assist sites with creating best practices surrounding safe opioid prescribing and increasing access to integrative pain treatments. The workbook emphasizes utilizing opioid surveillance strategies to evaluate population health outcomes, target opioid interventions, enhance clinical decision support, and create professional practice evaluation strategies. The IHS opioid stewardship program evaluation considers metrics that eval uate trends in Morphine Milligram Equivalents versus a restricted focus on total opioid prescription fills. The IHS has also created a robust workforce development strategy to include didactic training. In September 2019, the IHS launched its Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder Continuing Medical Education webinar series. The IHS has hosted learning sessions in this series that include buprenorphine prescribing in pregnancy as well as an auricular acupuncture -training program. Additional sessions are scheduled in FY 2020. The IHS has also recently facilitated dedicated access to tele-consultation services for IHS clinicians to receive on -demand substance use expert recommendations and tailored clinical guidance for IHS healthcare providers of all experience levels. This service is also available to assist IHS health systems with creating clinic policies and procedures to support creation of integrated MAT services in IHS facilities. In May 2016, the IHS implemented a policy on mandatory opioid training requiring all federally controlled substance prescribers to complete the \"IHS Essential Training on Pain and Addiction\" CJ - 122 with required refresher training every 3 years. This training is now available on demand with continuing medical educati on credits. The IHS released its Refresher training course in January 2018 including four sessions of its mandatory five -hour training course for providers on proper opioid prescribing. In FY 2019 , 302 new clinicians completed this course. The mandate also includes an additional refresher training after three years. In FY 2019, 7251 clinicians completed the Essential Training on Pain and Addiction Refresher course. In FY 2019 , IHS provided Pain Skills Intensive trainings in the Phoenix and Tucson Area and the Navajo Area. These trainings focus on assessment and treatment of myofascial pain, including non-pharmacological interventions. Additionally, they include the half -and-half DATA Waiver training for buprenorphine MAT. A total of 35 clinicians attended these trainings. In FY 2020 , IHS will provide additional Pain Skill Intensive trainings covering new IHS Areas. In FY 2019 , IHS provided three webinars that addressed pain management, opioids, and opioid misuse with a total of 1 08 attendees. Opioid Use and the Adolescent Brain Initiating Buprenorphine as Medication Assisted Treatment for Pregnant Women with Opioid Use Disorder Medication Assisted Treatment -MAT The IHS has created agency policy and clinical practice recommendations to improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary opioid exposure. In June 2014, the IHS implemented IHM Chapter 30 policy titled Chronic Non-Cancer Pain Management to promote appropriate pain management. Finally, the Indian Health Service released new clinical guidelines to assist dentists with selecting the safest pain control options. The Recommendations for Management of Acute Dental Pain will limit opioid prescribing to patients who cannot safely use alternativ e pain medication. The guidelines also include a decision tree for pre - and post -operative pain management, as well as recommended dosing of systemic analgesics based on anticipated operative pain. Pain and Opioid Use Disorder Case Consultation Services: To provide ongoing clinical support for providers, IHS, in partnership with the University of New Mexico Pain Center, provides a weekly Chronic Pain and Opioid Management ECHO. ECHO is a case-based learning model in which consultation is offered through virtual clinics to primary care clinicians by an expert team to share knowledge and elevate the level of specialty care available to patients. In FY 2019 , 178 IHS, tribal, and urban clinicians participated in 34 ECHO sessions with over 1,000 attendees . Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTCs) : YRTCs provide residential substance abuse and mental health treatment services to AI/AN youth. Congress authorized the establishment of these YRTCs in each of the 12 IHS Areas, with two (northern and southern) specifically authorized for the California Area. These YRTCs provide quality holistic behavioral health care for AI/AN adolescents that integrate traditional healing, spiritual values and cultural identification. The Alaska and Portland Areas divided the ir funds to provide residential treatment services for two programs. The second treatment facility for the Portland Area opened in October 2017. In FY 2019 all federal YRTCs in operation 18 months or longer have achieved accreditation status. Indian C hildren's Program (formerly, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)): Training and technical assistance on FASD is provided through the IHS TeleBehavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) Indian Children Program (ICP). The focus of the ICP is training clinicians on developmental and neurobiological issues that can affect AI/AN children. To this end, ICP CJ - 123 developed and posted a nine -session training series on FASD in AI/AN populations. ICP is currently piloting a four -hour, introductory course on FASD and another course on Autism Spectrum Disorder. The target audience of these trainings are Community Health Representatives, school staff, and other community members. In FY 2019, ICP produce d a nine - session training series, Substance Use and the Adolescent Brain. The ICP also provides additional clinician supports. For example, clinicians can take advantage of the bi -weekly, Pediatric Neurodevelopmental & Behavioral Health Consultation Clinic. This virtual clinic is designed to help clinicians successfully diagnose, manage, and/or treat AI/AN youth with FASD, ASD, and other neurodevelopmental issues. Information Systems Supporting Behavioral Health Care : The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) includes functionalit y designed to meet the unique business processes of behavioral health ( BH) providers and support BH -related initiatives. Standardized instruments and clinical decision support tools are available to support routine and effective screening for alcohol and substance use, depression, domestic violence and smoking status. Additionally, surveillance tools are available to capture suicide data at the point of care. Aggregate national RPMS behavioral health data is maintained to support local, national and othe r program reporting requirements as well as quality performance measurements for numerous screening and prevention initiatives including screening for alcohol and substance use, depression, domestic violence, smoking, and suicide data collection. Partner ships : IHS is collaborating with other agencies working in the field of substance disorders such as S ubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (S AMHSA ), Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Resources and Services Administration, Office of National Drug Control Policy, and CMS to ensure that the best available information, training s, protocols, evaluations, performance measures, data needs, and management skills are incorporated and shared with all agencies and organizations working on subs tance use disorders. The Department of the Interior (DOI) through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA ) and the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and the IHS ha ve a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention, which was a mended in 2011 as a result of the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Through this MOA, BIA, BIE, and IHS coordinate and implement plans in cooperation with t ribes to assist tribal governments in their efforts to address behavioral health issues. The MOA includes coordination of data collection, resources, and programs of IHS, BIA, and BIE. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) requires interagency coordination and collaboration among HHS (IHS and SAMHSA), DOI (BIA/BIE), Department of Justice (Office of Justice Programs/Office of Tribal Justice), and the Office of the Attorney General. The coordination of Federal efforts and resources will assist in determining both the scope of alcohol and substance abuse problems as well as effective prevention and treatment programs. The MOA required by Section 241 of the TLOA was signed on July 29, 2011, b y the Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services and the Interior and the Attorney General to: (1) determine the scope of the alcohol and substance abuse problems faced by tribes; (2) identify and delineate the resources each entity can bring to bear on the problem; (3) set standards for applying those resources to the problems; and (4) coordinate existing agency programs. In April 2019, the IHS expanded collaboration with the Defense Veterans Center for Integrated Pain Management to explo re feasibility of creating an IHS auricular acupuncture program utilizing the Veterans Health Administration Battlefield Acupuncture protocol. The IHS has created a pilot program that includes credentialing and privileging processes, clinical practice CJ - 124 protocols, documentation standards, patient education materials, and a sustainability plan. The initial training session was hosted in November 2019 and 23 IHS clinicians were certified in this modality. The IHS has expanded access to harm reduction interventions that include increased access to the opioid overdose reversal medication, naloxone. In 2015, the IHS signed a memorandum of agreement with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The agreement allows IHS to provide BIA Law Enforcement Officers (LEO) with training and naloxone rescue kits for responding to incidents of opioid overdose. Between 2015 and 2017, this partnership trained and put naloxone in the hands of 324 BIA LEOs, who are often the first responders to incidents of opioid overdose in Tribal communities. In 2017, IHS turned the naloxone training program over to the BIA after certifying 48 BIA LEOs as naloxone trainers. The IHS continues to support this program by re - supplying naloxone rescue kits to BIA LEO first responders as need ed. In 2019, IHS conducted first-responder train -the-trainer sessions on naloxone and harm reduction strategies for community health workers from IHS and tribal sites from across the country. During that training 86 community workers were supplied with naloxone kits and certified to offer naloxone training within their local communities. The IHS also supports naloxone co-prescribing and has created sample collaborative practice agreements to engage pharmacists in naloxone distribution efforts and has hosted an IHS 'Grand Rounds' on naloxone co-prescribing to increase this life-saving procedure. A \"First Responder Toolkit\" that includes a training video, a law enforcement testimonial video, customizable forms, and a train -the trainer curriculum was created to support naloxone deployment in tribal communities. The IHS formally expanded access to naloxone in March 2018 through a policy titled \"Prescribing and Dispensing of Naloxone to First Responders\" that require IHS Federal pharmaci es to provide naloxone to all Tribal law enforcement agencies and other trained first responders. These efforts have resulted in a 143 percent increase in naloxone procurement across IHS facilities that utilize the Prime Vendor. The IHS has further adapt ed the toolkit and strategy to equip community first responders and paraprofessionals with training on opioid overdose response and naloxone. These expanded collaborations with local law enforcement and community first responders resulted in an initial pilot community -health naloxone train-the -trainer program to include naloxone distribution. Ninety -six community -health workers completed training as naloxone trainers for their tribal communities in one week. ASA Grant and Federal Award Programs The IHS Division of Behavioral administers community -based grants that promote the use and development of evidence -based and practice-based models that represent culturally -appropriate prevention and treatment approaches to substance use from a community -driven context. In particular, the IHS Opioid Grant Program and the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention program (SASP) will support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships and Objective 1.3 to increase access to quality health care services. IHS Opioid Grant Program: In FY 2019, IHS received $10 Million in FY 2019 funding under the Special Behavioral Health Pilot Program (SBHPP) for American Indians and Alaska Natives to be targeted at opioid specific activities. In FY 2019, IHS held Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer to support the development of a grant program that will promote the documentation, and sharing of locally -designed, culturally -appropriate prevention, treatment, recove ry, and aftercare CJ - 125 services for mental health and substance use disorders in American Indian and Alaska Native communities . A funding opportunity for the SBHPP will be released in FY 2020. Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program (SASP): The SASP is a nationally -coordinated $31.97 million program providing funds for culturally appropriate substance use and suicide prevention programming in AI/AN communities. The program funds 175 projects . IHS administration of the SASP grants supports the HHS Strategic Plan, Goal 2 to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play. In August of 2019, IHS initiated Tribal Consultation and an Urban Confer regarding behavioral health i nitiatives and the National Tribal Advisory Committee on Behavioral Health recommendations regarding the distribution of funding for the SASP program. In total 22 comments and recommendations were received and DBH is reviewing all comments and recommendations to provide recommendations to the I HS Director. The goals of SASP are to: 1. Increase IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) capacity to operate successful substance abuse prevention, treatment, and aftercare and/or suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention services through implementing community and organizational needs assessment and strategic plans; 2. Develop and foster data sharing systems among I/T/U behavioral health service providers to demonstrate efficacy and impact; 3. Ident ify and address suicide ideations, attempts, and contagions among AI/AN populations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, intervention, and postvention strategies; 4. Identify and address substance use among AI/AN populations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, treatment, and aftercare strategies; 5. Increase provider and community education on suicide and methamphetamine use by offering appropriate trainings; and 6. Promote positive AI/AN youth development and family engagement through the implementation of early intervention strategies to reduce risk factors for suicidal behavior and substance use. SASP projects were awarded funding in at least one of four purpose areas and work to address the corresponding SASP goal listed above. SASP Purpose Areas are: 1. Community Needs Assessment and Strategic Planning; 2. Suicide Prevention, Intervention, and Postvention ; 3. Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Aftercare; and 4. Generation Indigenous (Gen-I) Support. Of the projects funded, 19 projects specifically focus on substance use prevention, treatment, and aftercare, while 108 focus on substance use and suicide prevention among Native youth. IHS established the Universal Alcohol Screening (UAS) as a national measure to increase screening and improve detection and intervention strategies among patient s' ages 9 through 75 years of age. In FY 201 9, 40.7 percent of eligible patients were screened for risky alcohol use , exceeding the IHS target of 37.0 percent. The SASP program is currently in its fifth and final year of implementation. In the fourth year, 100 percent of projects submitted progress reports as a requirement of funding. Positive strides in the delivery of substance use services have been accomplished and rep orted in preliminary CJ - 126 data monitoring for SASP program activities. Successful outcomes during the fourth year of the program include expanded behavioral health services offered through school settings and home visiting with a total of 3,757 patients receiving care . Over 240 providers were trained in behavioral health integration with 133 of those providers located within a primary care setting . Project accomplishments include 79, 803 individuals screen for suicide ideation, 64 percent of the SASP program suicide prevention projects implemented an enhanced process for suicide screening, and over 16,500 community members have been trained in suicide and/or substance use prevention. Sixty three percent of projects hosted a successful prevention education community event, and 59 percent reported their trainings to have expanded staff knowledge (a 12 percent increase from year 2) . Seventy one percent reported implementation and document ation of a system change. In addition, among projects supported, a total of 10,595 individuals received cultural services, a high percentage of projects have continued to offer integrated traditional healing into care, extended service hours, provision of follow -up care, new counseling and case management services. In summary, the SASP program continues to support tribes, tribal organizations, urban Indian organizations, and federal facilities offering care. Preventing Alcohol -Related Death s (PARD) : In the 2017 Senate Appropriations Committee Report 114- 281, the Committee directed IHS to \"allocate $2,000,000 of the increase provided for the alcohol and substance abuse program to fund essential detoxification and related services.\" Specifically, in the re port the number of alcohol related deaths in the community of Gallup, New Mexico was addressed with the report stating, \"these deaths underscore the urgent need for substance abuse treatment, residential services and detoxification services\" in this commun ity. In response, the IHS used the increased appropriated funds provided to address this urgent need in the city of Gallup, New Mexico. In addition to Gallup, New Mexico, IHS was aware of the urgent need for alcohol detoxification services in the Great Plains Area after the removal of liquor licenses in White Clay, Nebraska, leading to the potential for increased mortality if services were unavailable for alcohol detoxification. As a result, funds were also made available to address this urgent need. The funds provided to Gallup, New Mexico and the Great Plains Area (specifically the Oglala Sioux Tribe) to address the need for social detox services were made available in FY 2017 through a competitive cooperative agreement. The funding announcement was r eleased in FY 2017 and two projects were selected and funded. The project period is for 5 years and will run from September 15, 2017, to September 14, 2022. With the additional funding, the Gallup NM site reported detoxification services to 9,482 unique individuals with over 75 percent of those clients including males . In addition to services offered for monitoring, supervising and managing detoxification, this site has increased coordination and transportation with the Emergency Department ; and establish ed a contract with the Gallup Police Department to transport patients to the detoxification center. The Great Plain s' site has used the funding to increase coordination with behavioral health programs, provide screenings and brief intervent ions to individuals incarcerated in jails, and serve as an immediate placement for individuals who are in need of treatment services following detoxification. In FY2019, the Great Plains' site completed diagnostic alcohol and substance abuse assessments fo r nearly 1 ,000 individuals with an estimated 58 percent of those individuals connected to an appropriate level of care for follow -up. YRTC Aftercare Pilot Project: In December 2017, IHS utilized $1.8 million to implement a pilot project for aftercare services for Native youth discharged from residential substance abuse treatment. The Project focus is to identify appropriate aftercare services that can be culturally adapted to support AI/AN youth in their recovery journe y once they leave YRTC care. Two YRTCs , Desert Sage and Healing Lodge of the Seven Nations, were selected and to develop approaches to aftercare, recovery, and other support services for Native youth that can be used across other IHS and tribal YRTCs. These facilities are tasked with implementing best practices CJ - 127 around effective reintegration processes while establishing a collaborative partnership community -based approach to reduce substance use relapse. With the additional funding the two YRTCs have engaged tribal and urban programs tha t refer adolescents to the YRTCs, to identify best practices for aftercare. This has resulted in improved coordination around aftercare and case management, increased training of community supports for the adolescents, improved identification of transitio nal living, increased awareness of the use of social media, and improved follow -up with data collection after discharge. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount SASP Gen I ,000 ($15,475,000) ($16,500,000) TRIBAL SHARES Alcohol and Substance Abuse funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to tribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. A portion of the overall Alcohol and Substance Abus e budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2021 budget submission for Alcohol and Substance Abuse is $ 235.7 m illion, whic h is $9.9 million below the FY 2020 Enacted level. FY 20 20 Base Funding of $2 45.6 million - This funding will maintain the program's progress in addressing alcohol and substance abuse needs by improving access to behavioral health services through tele -behavioral health efforts and providing a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services.

Direct Federal, PL 93-638 Tribal Contracts and Compacts, Commercial contracts, and Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Snyder Act provides the formal legislative authority for the expenditure of funds for the \"relief of distress and conservation of health of Indians.\"2 In 1934, Congress provided the specific authority to enter into medical services contracts for American Indians and Alaska Natives.3 These, among other authorities4 established the basis for the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Program.5 The PRC Program is integral to ensure comprehensive health care services are available and accessible to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) (IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 ). The Indian health system delivers care through direct care services provided in an IHS, Tribal or Urban Indian Health Program (I/T/U) facility (e.g., hospitals, clinics) and through PRC services delivered by non-IHS providers to increase access to quality health care services (IHS Strategic Plan 1.3) . The general purpose of the PRC Program is for IHS or Tribal facilities to purchase services from private health care providers in situations where: 1) No IHS or Tribal direct care facility exists, 2) The direct care element is not capable of providing required emergency and/or specialty care, 3) The direct care element has an overflow of medical care workload, and 4) Full expenditure of alternate resources (e.g., Medicare, private insurance) has been met and supplemental funds are necessary to provide comprehensive care to eligible Indian people. 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, for impacted funds. 2 The Snyder Act, Public Law 67-85, November 2, 1921, 25 U.S.C \u00a7 13. 3 The Johnson O'Malley Act of April 16, 1934, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 452. 4 Transfer Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001; Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C \u00a7 1601, et seq. 5 The Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2014, Public Law 113-76, January 18, 2014, adopted a new name for the IHS Contract Health Services (CHS) program to Purchased/Referred Care (PRC). The IHS will administer PRC in accordance with all law applicable to CHS. CJ - 130 In addition to meeting the eligibility requirements for direct services at an IHS or Tribal facility, PRC eligibility is determined based on residency within the service unit or Tribal PRC delivery Area; authorization of payment for each recommended medical service by a PRC authorizing official; medical necessity of the service and inclusion within the established Area IHS/Tribal medical/dental priorities; and full expenditure of all alternate resources (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, state or other health programs, etc.). Alternate resources must pay for services first because the IHS PRC Program is the payer of last resort.6 Services purchased may include hospital, specialty physician, outpatient, and laboratory, dental, radiological, pharmaceutical, or transportation services. When funds are not sufficient to purchase the volume of PRC services needed by the eligible population residing in the PRC delivery area of the local facility, IHS PRC regulations require IHS or Tribal PRC programs to use a medical priority system to fund the most urgent referrals first. Medical priority (MP) levels of care are defined as follows: MP Level I: Emergent or Acutely Urgent Care Services are defined as threats to life, limb and senses . MP Level II: Preventive Care Services are defined as primary health care that is aimed at the prevention of disease or disability. MP Level III: Specialty Services are considered ambulatory care which include inpatient and outpatient care services . MP Level IV: Chronic Tertiary and Extended Care Services are defined as requiring rehabilitation services, skilled nursing facility care. MP Level V: Excluded Services are services and procedures that are considered purely cosmetic in nature, i.e., plastic surgery . A PRC rate, a capitated rate based on Medicare payment methodology, is used to purchase care, and Medicare participating hospitals are required to accept this rate as payment in full for all hospital -based health care services (Public Law 108-173). This allows IHS to purchase care at a lower cost than if each service were negotiated individually increasing access to quality health care services and provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/ANs ( IHS Strategic Plan 1.3 .4 - Increase access to quality community, direct, specialty, long -term care and support services, and referred health care services and identify barriers to care for AI /AN stakeholders ). Physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and services are purchased at the PRC rate. However, if a physician or non -hospital provider does not accept the PRC capitated rate, agreements or contracts can be negotiated with individual providers of supplies or services using the provider's most favored customer rate as a ceiling for negotiation (42 CFR 136 Subpart I) (IHS Strategic Plan 3.2.7 - Develop policies, use tools, and apply models that ensure efficient use of assets and resources ). Program funds are administered and managed at IHS Headquarters, at each of the 12 IHS Areas, and at IHS and Tribal facilities across the nation. The regulation has demonstrated that IHS is able to stretch the same amount of money to cover additional necessary health care services and improve access to care. This meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people . Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services. The PRC Program also administers the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF). Created in 1988, the CHEF was established for the sole purpose of meeting extraordinary medical costs associated with treatment of victims of disasters or catastrophic illnesses.7The CHEF is used to reimburse PRC programs for high cost cases (e.g., burn victims, motor vehicle crashes, high risk obstetrics, cardiology, etc.) after a threshold payment amount is met, the current threshold is $25,000. The CHEF is centrally managed at IHS CJ - 131 The PRC Program contracts with a fiscal intermediary (FI), currently Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Mexico, to ensure payments are made in accordance with IHS' payment policy, and coordinate benefits with other payers to maximize PRC resources. (IHS Strategic Plan 3.2.7 - Develop policies, use tools, and apply models that ensure efficient use of assets and resources) All IHS -managed PRC programs and some tribally -managed PRC programs use the FI to ensure the use of PRC rates for inpatient services and PRC or negotiated rates for physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and services. PRC funding provides critical access to essential health care services and remains a top request by Tribes in the budget formulation recommendations. (IHS Strategic Plan 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services) Note: On February 28, 2019, IHS updated the Indian Health Manual, Part 2, Services to Indians and Others, Chapter 3, Purchased/Referred Care. In this IHM update IHS adopted the policy that PRC funds may be used for staff administrating the PRC program at administrative levels. This adopts the GAO recommendation for the use of PRC funds for PRC staff where appropriate. This policy change requir es Areas to ensure they are funding requests through Priority Level II before these PRC administrative expenses can be charged. This policy meets the ( IHS Strategic Plan 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforc e.) PROGR AM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Rates - The PRC rates for all hospital- based services implemented in 2007 and the PRC rates for physicians and non- hospital providers of supplies and services implemented in 2016 have increased access to care by allowing I/T/Us to purchase additional services with these Medicare methodology capitated rates, referred to as PRC rates. PRC rates were originally referred to as Medicare- like rates (MLR) for hospital based services but are now identified as PRC rates. PRC rates are based on the Medicare payment methodology for all hospital based services, physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and services. The PRC rates rule (42 CFR 136 Subpart I) for physicians and non- hospital providers of supplies and services applies to I/T/Us but only to the extent the tribally -operated PRC programs agree to \"opt-in\" via its Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act contract or compact. The rule has flexibility that allows PRC programs to negotiate rates that are higher than the PRC rate based on Medicare methodology , but equal to or less than the rates accepted by the provider or supplier's most f avored customer rate; in the absence of Medicare payment methodology for a service, the IHS payment amount is calculated at 65 percent of billed charges from the provider or supplier. Medical Priorities - Recent PRC program increase in purchasing power through the PRC rates described above have allowed most of the IHS and Tribally -managed PRC programs to approve referrals in priority categories other than Medical Priority I (life or limb), including some preventive care services, thus increasing access to patient care services. In FY 2019, 90 percent of IHS-operated PRC programs were able to purchase services beyond Medical Priority I - Emergent or Acutely Urgent Care Services. Prior funding increases and Medicaid expansion have enabled programs to purchase preventive care beyond emergency care services, such as mammograms or colonoscopies. The IHS PRC Workgroup helped IHS develop a more accurate form for annually reporting denied and deferred PRC services. In FY 2019, PRC programs denied and deferred an estimated $615,982,865 for an estimated 155,842 services for eligible AI/ANs. Because Tribally -managed programs are not required to report denials data, it is difficult to provide a verifiable and complete measure of the total unmet need for the entire I/T/U system. Therefore, the denied services estimate is based on actual data from federal programs and estimated Tribal data. CJ - 132 Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) - In FY 2019, all high cost cases submitted for reimbursement from the CHEF have been reimbursed. It is estimated that more cases may qualify for CHEF reimbursement but were not reported by local IHS and Tribally -managed PRC programs. Catastrophic case requests are reimbursed from the CHEF until funds are depleted. The implementation of PRC rates for inpatient and non-hospital providers of supplies and services as well as the increase of I/T/U beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid, Medicare and Private Insurance has enabled the CHEF to reimburse PRC programs for high cost catastrophic events and illnesses that occur through the end of the fiscal year.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93 -638 Tribal Contracts and & Compacts, Tribal Shares, Grants PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service (IHS ) Public Health Nursing (PHN) Program is a community health nursing program that focuses on the goals of promoting health and quality of life, and preve nting disease and disability. The PHN Program provides quality, culturally sensitive health promotion and disease prevention nursing care services through primary, secondary and tertiary prevention services to individuals, families, and community groups : Primary prevention interventions aim to prevent disease and include such services as health education/ behavioral counseling for health promotion, risk reduction, and immunizations. Secondary prevention interventions detect and treat problems in their early stages. Examples include health screening of high-risk populations, screening for diabetes and hypert ension, fall risk assessments, and school health assessments. Tertiary prevention interventions prevent or limit complications and disability in persons with an existing disease. The goal of tertiary prevention is to prevent the progression and complicatio ns associated with chronic and acute illness by providing optimal care for the patient. Examples include chronic disease case management, self -management education, medication management, and care coordination. The PHN program aligns with the IHS Strategi c Plan FY 2019 -2023 Goal 1 to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people by increasing access to quality health care services (Goal 1, objective 1.3). The PHN Program f unds provide critical support for direct health care services in the community which improve Americans' access to health care and expand choices of care and service options (The HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022, Goal 1: Reform, Strengthen, and 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, for impacted funds. CJ - 137 Modernize the Nation's Health Care System, objective 1.3) . PHNs support population-focused services to promote healthier communities through community based direct nursing services, community development, and health promotion and disease prevention activities. PHNs are licensed, professional nursing staff available to improve care transitions by providing patients with tools and support that promote knowledge and self -management of their condition as they transition from the hospital to home. The PHN expertise in co mmunicable disease assessment, outreach, investigation, and, surveillance helps to manage and prevent the spread of communicable diseases. PHNs contribute to several agency's primary prevention efforts such as providing community immunization clinics , adm inistering immunizations to homebound AI/AN individuals , and through public health education, inspiring AI/AN people to engage in healthy lifestyles and ultimately live longer lives. PHNs conduct nurse home visiting services via referral for such activities as follows: Maternal and pediatric populations, including childhood obesity prevention through breastfeeding promotion, screening for early identification of developmental problems, and parenting education; Elder care services including safety and health maintenance care; Chronic disease care management; and Communicable disease investigation and treatment. PHNs perform a community assessment to identify high-risk populations and implement evidenced based interventions to address identifi ed areas of need . This activity targets fragmentation in patient care services and improves care continuums , including patient safety . Interventions are monitored with data collection and evaluated for outcome with an emphasis on producing a good return on investments in terms of service(s) provided. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The PHN Program aligns with the Agency's priorities and contributes to patient care coordination activities and access to quality, culturally competent care that aims to promote health and quality of life through a community population focused nurse visiting program which serves the patient and family in the home and in the community (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1. 3). The PHN Program assesses the services provided in meeting the agency's priority Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) measures and integrates the Department's Strategic Goal to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.1, to empower people to make informed choices for healthier living). Using a variety of methods to educate the AI/AN population such as via individual and group patient education sessions, screening activities and referring high-risk patients, and immunizing individuals to prevent illnesses , the PHN works to improve the overall wellness of Americans. Preventative health care informs populations, promotes healthy lifestyles and provides early treatment for illnesses. The PHN Data Mart report for GPRA year 2018 reflects a total number of individual PHN patient related encount ers was 329,980; PHN accomplishments in GPRA screening documented activities include the following encounter numbers : Tobacco Screening ( 4,065) Depression Screening ( 12,359) Domestic Violence Screening ( 12,728) (11,111) Adult Influenza Vaccines ( 40,487) In 201 9, the PHN Program continued efforts to meet the IHS' s goal to decrease childhood obesity and prevent diabetes by supporting Baby Friendly re-designation by accomplishing the following CJ - 138 activities: providing patient education, assessment and referral services for prenatal , postpartum and newborn clients during home visits , and utilizing a standardized PHN electronic health record template to document intervention (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Go al 2 to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performin g organization, Objective 2.2: provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/AN communities ). The PHN data mart provide s a mechanism to evaluate how the PHN program delivers this evidence-based prevention service of promoting breastfeeding during the nurse patient encounter . For GPRA year 201 8, there were a total of 12,111 PHN patient encounters related to the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative . These patient encounters included 29,065 documented patient education topics provided by the PHN during prenatal, postpartum and newborn encounters , which included the following topics: breastfeeding, child health for the newborn, immunizations, family planning, sudden infant death syndrome, tobacco use/prevention, postpartum depression, formula feeding, and child health. As part of this initiative, IHS is encouraging clinicians in Indian Country to support policies and practices that foster breastfeeding as the exclusive feeding choice for infants during their first six months of life. By doing so, clinicians will reduce current and future medical problems and decrease health care costs. In 2019, the Clinton PHN Program, Clinton, OK, initiated a PHN best practice project to promote breastfeeding. The Clinton PHNs are addressing access to care by seeking lactation certification to support breastfeeding education services to patients in various settings including the home. They are now completing 90 hours of lactation management courses (60 hours of online education followed by 32 hours of classroom) to become International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs) specializing in breastfeeding management. The goal is to ensure that all Clinton PHNs be IBCLC certified by October 2020. To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people by increasing access to quality health care services (IHS Strategic Plan FY 201 9-2023, Goal 1) , the PHN Program continues to support caregivers of individuals suffering from dementia. Caregivers supported by the PHN program includes screening for depression, the effect of depression on daily life, and caregiver burden and frustration. For GRPA year 201 8, there have been 5,146 PHN encounters to patients with dementia , and services provided at these PHN encounters include the following: Immunizations ( 847) Life adaptation ( 371) Medications ( 846) Safety and fall prevention (484) During the se visits, a total of 12,363 patien t education topics were documented by the PHN and included the following: medication, repeat prescription, wound dressing, long term drug therapy, opioid dependence, and vitamin deficiency. The goal to implement the se service in 50 Tribal communities by 2018 was met in December 2017 and resulted in this service being available in 52 communities. Future e fforts to adapt this intervention to deliver and sustain the program in AI/AN communities is ongoing. The Pine Ridge PHN Mental Health Case Management Program was established to focus on suicide prevention in the local community during 2016 to 2018. This intervention serves as a best practice for improve d health outcomes of high risk patients through a community case management model that util ized the PHN as a case manager. In FY 2018 the program billed for this service, leveraging revenue to support services in the community; served to supplement data collection reports on the PHN data mart to report outcome; and, in FY 2019 collaborated to establish similar services at the Standing Rock Service Unit PHN Program. During FY 2019- 2020 , this activity will be shared as a best practice resource for the PHN grant program for tribal and urban grant recipients (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.2). CJ - 139 In support of the Million Hearts campaign to prevent heart attacks and strokes, PHNs provided 35,561 patient encounters in the 2018 GPRA year that encompassed patient education on tobacco cessation at 4,464, hypertension at 28,113 , and sodium reduction at 3,002. Additional education provided during these PHN encounters include tobacco use, immunizations, diabetes, and medications. PHNs provide services to enhance quality care and support patient safety during transitions of care settings by follow up on hospital discharges in an effort to decrease hospital readmissions. In 2018 GPRA year, PHNs documented 67,184 patient encounters with patients who were discharged from the hospital and provided a total of 12,498 follow -up visits; some of these patients had multiple post discharge follow -up visits . Top patient education topics provided during these encounters include immunizations, lifestyle adaptation and medication. In FY 2019, the PHN Program aligned efforts t o integrate Relationship Based Care (RBC) as a means of improving quality care and meeting the needs of the AI/AN population (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.2) . To build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships, RBC is linked to the 201 9-2023 IHS Strategic Plan which is to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to the AI/AN people. Investing in a transformation of the program's culture will promote cost -savings with decreased cost burden of staff turnover and labor relations issues. RBC promotes a healing culture in organizations by focusing on three key relationships: the relationship with self, with the care team, and with patients and families. The PHN program coordinated efforts to support RBC leadership practicum training in August 2019 by hosting PHN attendance at this centralized opportunity. In addition, to support staff retention and staff development, an evidenced based preceptorship program with proven training materials, preceptor development, and an evidenced based repository of training material will be implemented in 2020. The Vermont Nurses in Partnership activity will be available to establish evidence-based transition programs, competence validation, and experiential learning for the PHNs. Beginning in 2020 training on a comprehensive Clinical Transition Framework will support this activity. The PHN program continues to review the delivery of service for safe and quality standards of various accrediting bodies. This activity will focus on the Joint Commission to define the PHN services as an integrated IHS service for review and continued efforts to host webinars to share practices on safe and quality care with a focus on the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care survey. This activity will continue into FY 2020 to promote quality PHN services are provided in a safe manner. As the primary care system is foundational to achieving high- quality, accessible, efficient health care for AI/AN clients, expanded PHN engagement will be made to support the patient -centered medical home (PCMH) efforts to enhance quality care. PHN programs will engage in FY 2019-2020 efforts to meet the IHS national target of one hundred percent of IHS ambulatory care facilities achieving PCMH by 2021. In 201 9, the PHN program continued identification of interventions which target ed prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) t o improve quality care. In collaboration with the IHS ST D Consultant (Office of the Public Health Service), this activity was monitored with the use of the PHN data mart tool as a performance measurement in support of practicing population based health man agement. The PHN data mart provides critical support in assessing improvement activities such as the provision of patient education, and the surveillance and treatment of ST Ds. In 2020 PHN support of the Elimination of Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS in Indian Country CJ - 140 Initiative will be developed, and the data mart will be used to monitor prevention and treatment activities provided by PHNs. In FY 2017, the PHN grant program awarded 9 grants; these awards have a narrow and defined area of focus, seeking to improve specific behavioral health outcomes and to support the efforts of AI/AN communities toward achieving excellence in holistic behavioral health treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention services for individuals and their families (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.2) . The purpose of this IHS PHN grant is to improve specific behavioral health outcomes through a case management model with the PHN as a case manager. In addition to reducing the cost of health care, case management has worth in terms of improving rehabilitation, improving quality of life, increasing client satisfaction and compliance by promoting client self -determination. The community based case management model addresses the PHN scope of practice of working with individuals and families in a population-based practice to provide nursing care services in the community setting. Currently, there are only 8 grant programs which are focusing on patient care services for behavioral health and coexisting conditions such as chronic disease management, maternal child health care, and medication patient education services. A PHN Consultant is being hired to oversee the PHN grant program particularly to provide technical assistance and share best practice for replication. In 2019, the program increased home visits for behavioral health follow up and increased coordination and collaboration with the local Behavioral Health Department to improve overall patient services. The FY 2018 target for the PHN Program measure was 381,314 encounters. The final result of 329,980 encounters did not meet the target by 51,334 encounters, a 13 percent decrease. Data exporting processes have impacted the overall PHN performance outcome as several tribal programs have migrated away from the IHS Patient Management System (RPMS) resulting in less visits being exported to the agency's National Data Warehouse database. The end result has been a decrease in the number of PHN activities being reported. In FY 201 8, additional PHN data briefs are be ing created and posted on the PHN data mart to reflect the PHN activity in meeting several Agency goals (such as decreasing STI rates, childhood immunizations) and to supplement the PHN program 's accomplishments report . These reports provide an avenue to monitor the PHN program's support of the health care delivery services in the community , and provides available data to inform I/T/U decision -making (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.3) . In FY 2019 and continuing into 2020, the PHN Documentation Manual is being updated to include PHN electronic health record templates and information on the PHN data mart reports to improve reporting of outcome .

Permanent 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts, Self-Governance Compacts, and Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service (IHS ) proposes a new funding line item, Community Health, which will include the Community Health Aide Program (CHAP), the Community Health Representatives (CHR) program , and the Health Education (HE) program . Merging funding for these programs increases flexibility for community health programs that are primari ly administered by Tribes and is requested in response to Tribal input . The new Community Health line aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 by supporting the goals to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people (IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1 .1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; and Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization & 2.2 Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities ). The collaborative approach also aligns with the HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018- 2022 by expanding safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encouraging innov ation and competition; improving Americans' access to healthcare and expanding choices of care and service options; and strengthening and expanding the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs and increase acce ss to quality healthcare services (Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options, & 1.4 Stren gthen and expand the healthcare workforce to meet America's diverse needs). The National CHAP will provide a network of health aides trained to support licensed health professionals while providing direct health care, health promotion, and disease prevention services. The se providers work within a referral relationship under the supervision of licensed 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, f or impacted funds. CJ - 144 clinical providers that includes clinics, service units, and hospitals. The program will increase access to direct health services, including inpatient and outpatient visits. The funding level directly supports IHS's efforts to provide high quality health care across the Indian health system . The CHAP has become a model for efficient and high quality health care delivery in rural Alaska providing approximately 300,000 patient encounters per year2 and responding to emergencies twenty -four hours a day, seven days a week. Specialized providers in dental and behavioral health were later introduced to respond to the needs of patients and address the health disparities in oral health and mental health amongst Ame rican Indian and Alaska Natives. The funding would allow for this community -based, culturally responsive, and efficient model of health care to be expanded nationally, to the contiguous 48 states to federal and Tribal facilities , consistent with the 2010 Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA ) amendments, at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1616l(d)(l)- (3), which authorizes the HHS Secretary acting through the IHS to establish a national CHAP outside of Alaska. The Community Health Representatives (CHRs) program began in 1968 and was established to meet the following four goals: (1) greater involvement of AI/AN people in their own health and in the identification and treatment of their health problems; (2) greater understanding between AI/AN people and IHS staff; (3) improving cross -cultural communication between the AI/AN community and health service providers; and, (4) increasing basic health care and instruction in AI/AN homes and communities. The CHR program supports the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1 and 2.2 to empower CHR patients to make informed choices for healthier living through the prevention, treatment, and control of communicable diseases and chronic conditions. Today, CHRs play a role in the health care delivery system to link the patient to the Indian health care system and are intended to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions and emergency department visit s through home visits to patients with chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. The aim of the CHR Program is to help AI/AN patients and communities achieve an optimal state of well-being by providing health promotion and disease prevention, wellness and injury prevention education, translation and interpretation, transportation to medical appointments, and delivery of medical supplies and equipment within their tribal community (IHS Strategic Plan, Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services) . The Health Education Program has been in existence since 1955 to educate American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) patients , school age children and communities about their health HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018-2022 Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Support strong families and healthy marriage, and prepare children and youth for healthy, productive lives ). The program focus es on the importance of educating patients in a comprehensive, culturally appropriate manner that empowers them to make positive choices in their lifestyles and how they utilize health services (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ). Accreditation requirements at IHS and tribal facilities specifically require the provision and documentation of patient education as evidence of the delivery of quality care (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.1 Improve communication within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public & 3.2 Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources. ). The FY 2017 data from the CHAP electronic health records portal https://www.ihs.gov/ehr/chap/ CJ - 145 Health Education Program provides critical support for direct health care services relating to health promotion and disease prevention focused on strengthening the collaborative partnerships among direct care providers, patients, communities, and internal and external stakeholders. The collaborative efforts of the Health Education Prog ram supports the agency's priority and integrates the Department's Strategic Goal to protect the healt h of Americans where they live., learn, work, and play (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018- 2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Empower people to make informed choices for healthier living , 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions, 2.3 Reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery, & 2.4 Prepare for and respond to public health emergencies). In FY 2018, there was a decline of 12.84 percent or 411,365 patient visits from the previous year . Staffing shortages significantly impact ed provision of patient services, which was reflected in the decrease in documented patient education encounters for FY 2018. Data exporting processes have impacted the overall Health Education patient education encounters a s several tribal programs have migrated away from the IHS Resource Patient Management System (RPMS), resulting in less encounters being exported to the agency's National Data Warehouse database. The end result of the migration has been a decrease in the n umber of Health Education patient education encounters being reported. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Community Health Aide Program: CHAP as it currently exists in Alaska, is a robust network of health aides trained to support licensed health professionals while providing direct patient care, health promotion, and disease prevention services to patients . The CHAP was authorized by Congress to promote the achievement of the health status objectives in the Indian Health Care Improvement A ct (IHCIA) in rural Alaska. These objectives are broad in scope and address virtually every aspect of health care, access, delivery, and status. Specialized training (medical, dental, and behavioral health) and certification furthers those objectives by cr eating opportunities for these health aides to focus their training and practice on particular health issues and delivery strategies. The CHAP model has not only proven to be an effective model of expanding access to care in the country's most rural and remote areas, but it has also provided a great return for Tribal communities and exponential benefit. In 2012, two dental health aide providers saw over 1,300 patients who received oral health care for the first time. These providers provided an added reimbursement value to the Tribal organizations in excess of over $200,000 above their salary. In Minnesota, one dental health aide provider saw over 1,700 patients and generated over $30,000 in revenue for the local clinic. CHAP providers address needs in areas where there may be a healthcare shortage and provide a great return of investment in both health outcomes for patients and for healthcare facilities across the US. The continued expansion of the CHAP to include the lower 48 would lead to increased acc ess to care and a reduction in health disparities faced by American Indians and Alaska Natives in primary care, oral, and behavioral health. The IHS National CHAP program will include Behavioral Health Aides, Community Health Aides and Dental Health Aides who will work directly under the supervision of a licensed provider at both IHS and Tribally -operated facilities in the contiguous 48 states. This program will establish a network of health Aides to improve access to care, health, wellness and the overall quality of life. CJ - 146 Community Health Representatives: As CHR programs have transitioned from IHS direct care services to local community control via Tribal contracting and compacting, IHS's role has transitioned to providing support for training CHRs and providing technical assistance to expand and enhance high-quality culturally -informed programs (IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people ). CHRs are frontline public health workers who are trusted members of the community and serve as a link between the Indian health system, including associated health programs, and AI/AN patients and communities. In FY 201 8, tribes who provided data reported 999,421 CHR patient contacts. In addition, CHR reported patient contacts for visits made to patients with chronic diseases was 423,151. In FY 2019 IHS trained 442 CHRs in basic CHR training, in -person and specialty training (e.g. diabetic care, dressing changes, and blood pressure readings). The training better equipped CHRs to assist patients by increasing health knowledge and providing care to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions and emergency department visits. Additionally, the training allowed CHRs to be more effective in home visits, case finding and case management of patients with chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes and hypertension. With \"Protecting the Health of Americans Where They Live, Learn, Work and Play\" as one of the priorities identified in the Department of Health and Human Services 2019-2023 Strategic Plan , IHS offered train ing to CHRs across the n ation in the Family Spirit curriculum, an evidence - based home visiting program with the goal of assisting paraprofessionals in their ability to help young parents learn skills to address emotional and behavioral functioning including substance abuse prevention. . In addition, this training provides CHRs established curriculum with positive parenting techniques and health promotion material to strengthen families. Health Education : In FY 2019, the National Patie nt Education Committee continued to collaborate with the Office of Information Technology to update the RPMS/Electronic Health Record (EHR) coding, to streamline the patient education documentation process (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and infor mation systems to support data driven decisions; HHS Strategic Plan 2018 -2022 Goal 5, Objective 5.4 Protect the safety and integrity of our human, physical, and digital assets). The Health Education Program maintains data tracking of key program objective s. Tracked data include s educational encounters , the number of patients who received patient education services, provider credentials of who delivered the patient education , site location where patient education was provided , health information provided, amount of time spent providing patient health education , patient understanding, and behavior goals . The Health Education program targeted the following activities in FY 2019 which aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan 2019- 2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce. Provided site visit/program reviews to the following IHS Service Units and Tribal Programs; Wewoka Service Unit, Lawton Service Unit, and Navajo Nation to strengthen collaborative relationships, improve patient education and coordination of prevention activities, and address health disparities unique to those communities.

It continues to provide this service in addition to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness and the medical management of persons with hepatitis and liver disease. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program - The Hib Program started in 1989 with a targeted Haemophilus Influenzae type b prevention project in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta and now focuses on maintaining high vaccine coverage in a continued effort to prevent communicable disease by providing resourc es, training, and coordination to Tribal facilities throughout Alaska. Alaska's geography necessitates innovation in program delivery and use of technology as many Tribal facilities are located in remote areas off any continuous road system. The Program maintains immunization practice procedures in partnership with Alaska's statewide Community Health Aide Program to ensure Health Aides working in both urban and remote Tribal facilities have the resources needed to provide high quality vaccination services where Alaska Native families live and play (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 -2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions ). Through strong collaboration with local Tribal health partners and regional immunization coordinators, the State of Alaska Immunization Program and the IHS Area Immunization Program, the Hib Program offers clinical expertise in advancing vaccine reporting and data management capacity in an environment of evolving and expanding electronic health record systems (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions). In collaboration with statewide partners, the Hib Program advocates for continued access to affordable vaccine through public vaccine funding programs (HHS Strategic 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019.

CJ - 156 Plan 2018-2022, Goal 1, Objective 1.2 Expand safe, high-quality healthc are options, and encourage innovation and competition). The program works with Tribal public relations to address parental immunization hesitancy and highlight the importance of vaccines, utilizing locally developed culturally appropriate marketing materia ls and social media campaigns (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1 Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ). In alignment with the President's Management Agenda priority of information technology modernization (PMA Goal 5.3), the Hib Program continues to focus on optimizing available information technology to advance capacity in maintaining high vaccine coverage rates, through refining electronic health record processes and expanding capacity for training, social marketi ng and consultation throughout Alaska statewide. The Hepatitis B Program and the Hib Program of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium , in collaboration with Alaska Tribal Health Care System partners, provide s clinical expertise and consultation, tr ainings, research, evaluation and surveillance with the goal to reduce the occurrence of infectious disease and improve access to healthcare in the Alaska Native population. The programs support immunization, patient screening, development of electronic health record reminders and systems, providing an infrastructure to maintain high vaccine coverage, and high clinical management coverage of hepatitis B and C in Alaska Natives. The Program promotes semi -annual screening of chronic hepatitis patients for both liver cancer and liver function (enzyme testing). The program s' activities support the IHS priorit ies on quality and partnerships as delineated in the IHS Strategic Plan. Working with partners with the Alaska Tribal Health System to meet IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 and the HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018- 2022 the program s provide both direct and telehealth patient care and health provider education to not only increase access to quality care, but also expand the options available (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services, IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities, and HHS Strategic Plan 2018 -2022, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options). Both program s are actively engaged in preventing and treating communicable and chronic diseases (HHS Strategic Pla n 2018-2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions ). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Immunization Alaska Program comprised of both the Hepatitis B and Hib Programs has several performance measures to m onitor progress in achieving the goal of high vaccine coverage for Alaska Native people as described below. Hepatitis B Program The Hepatitis B program continues to prevent and monitor hepatitis B infection among a large population of Alaska Natives with or susceptible to the disease. The program evaluates hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination coverage of Alaska Natives, and the total number of Alaska Native patients targeted for screening and the total number of patients screened for hepatitis B and hepatitis C as well as other liver disease that disproportionately affect the Alaska Native population. Due to the opioids crisis, new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have increased 69 percent from 2015-2018 compared to the 2011-2014 time period. I n response to this crisis, the Program is actively engaged in a statewide hepatitis C elimination project. This involves recruiting patients for treatment through our local outpatient clinic, field clinics and video clinics CJ - 157 (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities) as well as performing provider in-person and webinar education seminars on treating hepatitis C to build capacity (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services) . The Program website 6 provides online treatment documents and a treatment algorithm for Alaska Tribal healthcare providers. Also, Program staff conduct monthly A laska HCV E xtension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) collaboratives providing remote assistance for hepatitis C case review and treatment recommendations. Since 2014 , over 85 0 American Indian/Alaska Native persons have been treated for HCV through the A laska Tribal Health System (HHS Strategic Plan 2018 -2022, Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions) . The recent acquisition and fielding of two non - invasive elastography devices allows for the safe, non -invasive monitoring of liver disease progression without having to perform an invasive liver biopsy . One is a portable machine that is transported to field clinics thus reducing the need for patients to travel to Anchorage or alternative site for their care (HHS Strategic Plan 2018 -2022, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options) . In FY 201 9: Hepatitis A vaccination coverage did not achieve the target, and hepatitis B vaccination coverage exceeded the target. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage was 88 percent (90 percent target) and hepatitis B vaccination coverage was 9 5 percent (90 percent target). Overall, at least 73 percent of AI/ANs with eithe r chronic hepatitis B (6 8.5 percent screened ) or hepatitis C (78 percent screened ) infection were screened for liver cancer and for liver aminotransferase (enzyme) levels. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program The Hib program continues to provide resources, training and coordination to Tribes in Alaska to maintain high vaccine coverage among Alaska Native people. Vaccine coverage data is collected for each Tribal region and measured in collaboration with regional Tribal health immunization coordina tors (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization) . Technical consultation for the varying electronic health record (EHR) systems within each Tribal health organization is p rovided to support improve d vaccine coverage for all Tribes. Statewide Alaska Native vaccine coverage rates (including influenza) are reported to IHS National Immunization Program for infants 3 -27 months, 19-35 months, adolescents, adults . Flu vaccine coverage rates for healthcare personnel working at Tribal facilities are also reported to IHS National Immunization Program . Efforts pursuing information technology to advance capacity in maintaining high vaccine coverage rates include: participation as clinical experts on national EHR advisory workgroups regarding immunization -related product development; local advocacy for implementation of clinical decision support system (vaccine forecaster) in electronic health record systems; and collaboration with the State of Alaska immunization program in expanding coverage reporting capacity in the state's Immunization Information System (SIIS) (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 - 2022, Goal 5, Objective 5.3 Optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals) . Improvement in vaccine coverage relies on data capture and quality in electronic health record systems, facilitated by data interfaces, and in conjunction with clinical resources and training. CJ - 158 During FY 201 9: Immunization Coverage for Alaska Natives age 19-35 months was 7 3 percent, which is approaching the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80 percent for child vaccine coverage with 4:3:1:3* :3:1:4 series (4 DTaP, 3 IPV, 1 MMR, 3 Hib, 3 Hep B, 1 Var, 4 PCV). Achieved 90 percent coverage with full series Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccine in children age 19-35 months , which is much higher than the US all -races rate of 8 0.7 percent in 2017, the most recent data available. Achieved 78 percent Tdap vaccine coverage in all patients 19 years and older who had received Tdap within the past 10 years. Achieved 9 0 percent pneumococcal vaccine coverage in patients 65 years and older who received pneumococcal vaccine in the past ever. Assisted Tribal facilities using new electronic h ealth record (EHR) systems or the IHS EHR immunization package in maintaining or establishing interface connection with the State of Alaska Immunization Information System (SIIS) to share vaccine records. o Provided consultation with six facilities that implemented new EHRs on immunization documentation and facilitate d SIIS interface implementation. Collaborated with the Alaska Community Health Aide Program in the development and implementation of immunization standing orders on the electronic Health Aide practice procedures to further increase access to vaccination in remote Tribal facilities. Collaborated with State of Alaska Immunization Program to improve capacity of Alaska SIIS in adult vaccine and flu va ccine coverage reporting; streamline processes for reporting 3 -27 months, 19-35 months and adolescent's vaccine coverage. Assisted Tribal facilities in utilization of Alaska SIIS patient reminder system. Assisted Tribal facilities throughout Alaska to implement new State policy and procedures associated with vaccine electronic inventory management, delivery systems and documentation. A summary of immunization results is included below: Immunization Measure Age Group Alaska Native coverage as of 4:3:1:3 *:3:1:4 19-35 months 19 years and older 78% IHS vaccination rates compare favorably with overall National vaccination rates. The CDC conducts National Immunizations Surveys which allows self-reporting of vaccines. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vaxview/index.html The Hib program continues to collaborate with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in networking with IHS , State, and T ribal agencies to provide technical assistance regarding EHRs. Challenges include the diversity of EHRs employed by Tribal organizations that may result in temporary loss or delay of Area- wide reporting of vaccine coverage. Regular r eporting of immunizations is critical in assuring sufficient monitoring and follow -up with facilities experiencing vaccination administration issues. Technical assistance to sites will continue to be addressed through coordinated efforts by the Hib Program, IHS , State, and T ribes.

BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2021 budget submission for Alaska Immunization is $2.2 million, which is $ 38,000 above the FY 2020 Annualized CR level . FY 20 21 Funding Increase of $38 ,000 includes: Current Services: +$ 23,000 for current services including: o Inflation +$ 23,000 to cover inflationary costs of providing immunization services in Alaska. Program Adjustments: +$15,000 to maximize funding for direct patient care services. The FY 20 21 funding will provide coordination of vaccine coverage reporting for Tribal facilities, training of Tribal immunization coordinators, and clinic staff in vaccine recommendations and documen tation, consultation in the migration to alternate EHRs, and regular notification to hepatitis patients of the need to complete liver function screenings so that program clinicians can identify serious liver disease or liver cancer when it is at an early and treatable stage. Hepatitis B Program - The program will conduct outpatient clinics five days a week at the Alaska Native Medical Center, travel to regional health centers to conduct outpatient clinics, and will continue its web -based application for video-conferencing (Adob e Connect ) that is accessible to the statewide Alaska Tribal Health System (ATHS) audience to provide relevant clinical information to assist in the care and management of hepatitis and liver disease patients. Continue AK HCV ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) virtual field clinics where primary care physicians collaborate with program staff for the treatment of hepatitis C cases. Annual field clinics will be conducted across Alaska to provide direct patient care, clinical updates to ATHS staff, and to recruit and conduct follow -up on participants enrolled in the program's research studies. Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccine coverage for Alaska Natives will be measured. In addition, the total number of Alaska Nativ e patients targeted and screened will be measured for hepatitis B, hepatitis C , and other liver disease that affects Alaska Natives. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program - The budget request will allo w staff to provide continued expertise and support to regional T ribal programs on-site and for many partner location s, including rural and isolated location s. Funding of these activities allows maintenance of current program support of Alaska Tribal immunization activities, statewide CJ - 160 and national im munization advocacy and technical support, and Area reporting to IHS Headquarters.

Formula Contracts and Competitive Formula Grants awarded to Urban Indian Organizations PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service (IHS) Office of Urban Indian Health Program s (OUIHP) was established in 1976 to make health care services more accessible to Urban American Indians /Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). The IHS OUIHP 2017-2021 Strategic Plan guide s, support s, and improve s access to high quality , culturally appropriate health care services for Urban AI/ANs. The OUIHP Strategic Plan aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 to support health care solutions that fit the diverse circumstances of Urban AI/ANs and the tribal communities they serve. The input from Urban Indian Organization Leaders through the Urban Confer process helped inform the development of the IHS Strategic Plan. The IHS Strategic Plan will guide the work of OUIHP as we continue to strengthen our partnership with UIOs to address the three overarching goals of the IHS Strategic P lan, including improv ing access to care, quality of care, and management and operations of the Agency. The IHS enters into limited, competitive contracts and grants with 41 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations to provide health care and referral services for Urban AI/ANs in 22 states. These IHS contracts and grants with Urban Indian Organizations ( UIOs) address the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by ensuring that comprehensive, cul turally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people. Awarding of these contracts and grants to UIOs also addresses HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play . UIOs define their scope of work and services based upon the service population, health status, and unmet needs of the Urban AI/AN community they serve. Each Urban Indian Organization is governed by a Board of Directors that must include at least 51 percent Urban AI/ANs. UIOs provide uni que access to culturally appropriate and quality health care services for U rban AI/ANs. The 41 UIOs are an integral part of the Indian health care system and serve as resources to both tribal and urban communities. Urban AI/ANs are often invisible in the urban setting and face 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, for impacted funds. CJ - 163 unique challenges when accessing health care. A large proportion of Urban AI/ANs live in or near poverty and face multiple barriers such as the lack of quality and culturally relevant health care services in cities. UIOs are an important support to Urban AI/ANs seeking to maintain their tribal values and cultures and serve as a safety net for our urban patients. Social determinants of health play a key role in health and wellness and UIOs are addressing a range of factors which contribute to improved health outcomes. Urban AI/ANs in need of substance use disorder treatment commonly exhibit co-occurring disorders. UIOs integrat e behavioral health into primary care offered within a culturally appropriate framework . UIOs provide d 653,614 health care visits for approximately 75,194 Urban AI/ANs who do not have access to the resources offered through IHS or tribally operated health care facilities because they do not live on or near a reservation. Urban Indian Organization program sizes and services vary from full ambulatory care, limited ambulatory care, outreach and referral, and residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment programs, as follows: o Full A mbulatory Care: Programs providing direct medical care to the population served for 40 or more hours per week. o Limited Ambulatory Care: Programs providing direct medical care to the population served for less than 40 hours per week. o Outreach and Referral : Programs providing case management of behavioral health counseling and education services, health promotion/disease prevention education, and immunization counseling but not direct medical care services. o Residential and Outpatient Substance Abuse Treatment: Programs providing residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment, recovery, and prevention services. Included in the above 41 UIOs funded through contracts and grants , are the following : o Oklahoma City Indian Clinic and Indian Health Care Resource Center of Tulsa: These two urban sites, initially demonstration projects , are now permanent programs within the IHS' s direct care program and must continue to qualify as a n Urban Indian Organization under the IHCIA definition , 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1660b. o Former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Programs: IHS has transitioned administrative oversight of five former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism programs (former -NIAAA programs) that receive an award from IHS and have been confirmed to be a n Urban Indian Organization as defined by the IHCIA at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(29) from the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) to the OUIHP. IHS's transition of management of the current award funds and the proposed transfer of funds from the ASAP to the OUIHP will fully implement the transfer authorized by IHCIA at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1660c - Urban NIAAA transferred programs. Awarding of these contracts to UIOs addresses HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.3, to reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders t hrough prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support . UIOs provide high quality, culturally relevant prevention, early intervention, outpatient and residential substance abuse treatment services, and recovery support to meet the needs of the Urban Indian communities they serve. The other major Urban Indian Health focus areas and activities are: o 4-in-1 Grant Program: In FY 2019, t he OUIHP awarded 4 -in-1 grants to 33 UIOs. The grantees are awarded for a three-year funding cycle from April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2022. These grants provide funding to UIOs to support four health program areas: health promotion and disease prevention services; immunization services; alcohol and substance abuse related CJ - 164 services; and mental health services. Grantees are required to participate in a national evaluation of the 4-in-1 grant program, which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization. The national evaluation includes reporting on the cultural interventions integrated into the 4-in -1 program activities, and practice based and evidence based approaches that are implemented to meet the needs of the Urban Indian service population. These grants expand safe, high quality health care options, and encourage innovation and competition, which meets HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2. o Urban Indian Education and Research Organization Cooperative Agreement: Provides national education and research services for UIOs and OUIHP through a cooperative agreement. The cooperative agreement include s five p roject areas: (1) public policy; (2)research and data; (3) training and technical assistance; (4) education, public relations, and marketing; and (5) payment system reform/monitoring regulations. This cooperative agreement meets IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2, to build, strengthen, and sus tain collaborative relationships. o Albuquerque Indian Dental Clinic: Provide s dental services through the Albuquerque Area IHS Dental Program. These services address the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by ensuring that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people. The provision of dental services also addresses HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, to protect the health of Americans where they live, learn, work, and play. UIOs are evaluated in accordance with the IHCIA requirements. The program is administered by OUIHP at IHS Headquarters. OUIHP integrates Enterprise Risk Management by annually reviewing UIO progress with set goals and objectives. The IHS Urban Indian Organization On-Site Review Manual is used by the IHS Area s to conduct annual onsite reviews of the IHS funded UIO s to monitor compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation contractual requirements that are established through legislation . The results are submitted to OUIHP for review and follow -up to ensure that corrective action plans are successfully completed prior to continuation of funding. The requirements in the manual are based on best -practice standards for delivering safe and high quality health care and are similar to standards used by accrediting organizations. Many UIOs are seeking or maintaining accreditation from several accreditation organizations such as the Joint Commission, Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare (AAAHC) , Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, and National Committee for Quality Assurance. In Fiscal Year 2019, through an IHS contract with AAAHC, accreditation services were provided to 24 out of the 41 UIOs to meet IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1, to create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization; and HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, to reform, strengthen, and modernize the Nation's health care system. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS UIOs fulfill IHS data reporting requirements including the IHS Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) report and the Diabetes Non -Clinical Audit report. UIOs currently participate in the IHS Improving Patient Care (IPC) Initiative and are now in the Quality and Innovation Learning Network (QILN) implementing what they have learned across a wider variety of clinical and administrative options. From October 1, 2017, to September 30, 201 8, the Urban Indian Organization 2018 GPRA cycle accomplishments included: CJ - 165 65 percent of the UIOs reported on 26 of the 26 performance measures; 35 percent of the UIOs reported through the Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM); 23 UIOs reported through the Clinical Reporting System (CRS) ; 6 UIOs reported using 100 percent review of appropr iate data source (as opposed to sampling a smaller percentage of records) ; and FY 2018 was the first year of reporting GPRA data through the IDCS DM so there is no comparable prior year data to determine performance improvement for the UIOs. The IHS will proceed with plans to have all UIOs export data to the IHS National Data Warehouse (NDW). This includes working with UIOs utilizing commercial off the shelf systems to export data to the NDW. The OUIHP will continue to work with the IHS National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) staff to improve the export and accuracy of data for UIOs. The OUIHP , with the assistance of the IHS Office of Information Technology, will continue to provide training and technical assistance to UIOs on accurate and uniform data collection, so as to achieve standardization throughout the system. This work aligns with IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 2.1.1, to improve the transparency and the quality of data collected regarding health care services and program outcomes. It also aligns with HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Objective 5.3, to optimize information technology investments to improve process efficiency and enable innovation to advance program mission goals . Design requirements for the IHS' s IDCS DM, include an aggr egate Urban report to provide the clinical measure results reported in the Outputs and Outcomes Table of the Urban program's budget narrative. An aggregate Urban report requires data from individual facility reports to produce national results. IHS expects the aggregate Urban reports to be ready by December 31, 2019.

Authorizing Legislation ......................................................................... 25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act; 42 U.S.C. 2001, Transfer Act; Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), as amended 2010 FY 20 21 Authorization .................................................................................................... Permanent Allocation Method ................................................................. Direct Federal, Grants and Contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) P ublic. Law 94-437, as amended, authorizes the Indian Health Service (IHS) Scholarship program, Loan Repayment program (LRP), health professions training related grants, and recruitment and retention activities. The IHS made its first scholarship program awards in 1978 when Congress appropriated funds for the Indian Health Professions (IHP) program. The IHP programs work synergistically and directly supports IHS' FY 2019-2023 Strategic Plan, Goal 1, Objective 1.1 through the recruitment and retention of health care professionals to provide high- quality primary care and clinical preventive services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The IHP programs also directly support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2 through critical support in continuing to strengthen collaborations between the IHS, Tribes/Tribal organizations, Urban Indian organizations (I/T/U) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to increase the number of sites eligible to participate as National Health Service Corps (NHSC) approved sites for the NHSC Scholarship program and LRP. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The IHP program has seen much success throughout the years including, but not limited to, the following: Enabling AI/ANs to enter health care professions through a carefully designed system of preparatory, professional, and continuing educational assistance programs. 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, f or impacted funds. CJ - 169 Serving as a catalyst in developing AI/AN communities by providing educational opportunities for AI/ANs to become health care professionals and return to their local communities to provide health care. Developing and maintaining American Indian psychology career recruitment programs as a means of encouraging AI/ANs to enter the mental health field. Assisting AI/AN health programs to recruit and retain qualified health professionals. Collaborating with the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program that received an additional $15 million for loan repayment awards to clinicians working at IHS facilities, Tribally -operated 638 health programs, and Urban Indian programs to combat the nation's opioid crisis. Consulting annually with IHS Area Directors, Tribal health directors, and Urban Indian health directors regarding their health professions priorities eligible for Scholarship and Loan Repayment Program funding. While the IHP programs have seen successes, IHP continue s to strive to improve performance and identify areas of risk. Placement of new scholars within 90 days of completing their training continues to be a challenge. The use of online manuals, e -Newsletters, emails, and referral of graduates to recruiters have all been used to facilitate the 90 day scholar placement. In FY 2019, 42 percent of scholars had a hire letter within 90 days (target was 78 percent). Failure to meet this g oal was primarily due to scholars not completing their licensing boards and finding positions within the 90 day period. The Scholarship program continues to seek new ways to assist IHS scholars to meet this requirement. Assuring scholars and loan repayment recipients meet their service o bligation is another critical component of the IHP programs. Annual employment verification through personnel rosters and certification by Tribal employers assist in this process. Scholarship program and LRP databases allow staff to identify when health professionals are expected to complete their service obligation and allow for timely follow -up. Loan Repayment Program (Section 108) : The LRP is an invaluable tool for recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals by offering them the opportunity to reduce their student loan debts through service to Indian health programs with critical staffing needs. Applicants agree to serve two years at an Indian health program in exchange for up to $20,000 per year in loan repayment funding and up to an addition al $5,000 per year to offset tax liability. Loan repayment recipients can extend their initial two -year contract on an annual basis until their original approved educational loan debt is paid. In FY 201 9, a total of 1, 524 health professionals were receiving IHS loan repayment. This included 565 new two -year contracts, 481 one -year extension contracts and 478 health professionals starting the second year of their FY 2018 two-year contract. Applicants who apply for but do not receive funding, are identi fied as \"matched unfunded\" applicants are health professionals employed in an Indian health program. The \"unmatched unfunded\" applicants are health professionals that either decline a job offer becau se they did not receive loan repayment funding or those unable to find a suitable assignment meeting their personal or professional needs. In FY 2019 , there were 532 \"matched unfunded\" applicants (including 193 nurses, 61 behavioral health providers, 14 dentists, 48 mid-level providers and 52 pharmacists, among others) and 153 \"unmatched unfunded\" health professionals (including 3 physicians, 14 behavioral health providers, 11 dentists, 31 mid-level providers and 64 nurses among others). The inability to fund these 685 health professional applicants is a significant challenge for the recruitment efforts of the agency. A more detailed breakout of loan repayment awards in FY 2019 by discipline is included in a table at the end of the narrative. CJ - 170 Scholarship Program (Sections 103 and 104) - Section 103 scholarships include the preparatory and pre -graduate scholarship programs that prepare students for health professions training programs. Graduate students and junior - and senior -level undergraduate students are given priority for funding for programs under Section 103, unless the section specifies otherwise. Section 104 includes the Health Professions Scholarship program, which provides financial support consisting of tuition, fees and a monthly stipend f or AI/AN students from federally recognized Tribes enrolled in health profession or allied health profession programs. Students accepting funding for programs under Section 104 incur a service obligation and payback requirement. In FY 201 9, there were 675 new online scholarship applications submitted to the IHS Scholarship program. After evaluating the application for completeness and eligibility, a total of 334 of these new scholarship applications were considered eligible for funding. The IHS Schola rship program was able to fund 146 new awards. The IHS Scholarship program also reviewed applications from previously awarded scholars that were continuing their education. A total of 142 continuation awards were funded in FY 2019 . A detailed breakout of scholarships awarded by discipline in FY 2019 is included in a table at the end of the narrative. Extern Program (Section 105) -Section 105 of the IHCIA, is designed to give IHS scholars and other health professions students the opportunity to gain c linical experience with IHS and Tribal health professionals in their chosen discipline. This program is open to IHS scholars and non-scholars. Students are employed up to 120 days annually, with most students working during the summer months. In FY 2019 , the Extern Program funded a total of 34 student externs . A breakout of extern awards in FY 2019 by Area Offices is included in a table at the end of the narrative. In FY 2019, IHS implemented a new standard operating procedure that will actively recrui t IHS Scholarship recipients into the Extern Program as well as offering Extern Program positions to non-Scholar health professional students.

Discretionary competitive grants to Tribes and Tribal organizations PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Tribal Management Grant (TMG) program was authorized in 1975 under Sections 103(b)(2) and 103(e) of Public Law (P.L.) 93-638, Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), as amended. Under the authority of the ISDEAA, the program was established to assist all federally recognized Indian Tribes and tribally -sanctioned tribal organizations (T/TO) to plan, prepare, or decide to assum e all or part of existing Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, functions, services, and activities (PFSA) and to further develop and enhance their health program management capability and capacity. (IHS Strategic Goal 1, Objective 1.1 : Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce and Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships .) The TMG program has provide d discretionary competitive grants to T/TO , to establish goals and performance measures for current health programs, assess current management capacity to determine if new components are appropriate, analyze programs to determine if T/TO management is practicable, and develop and enhance infrastructure systems to manage or organize PFSA. The nature of the T MG program allow ed T/TO the option to enter or not enter into ISDEAA contracts/compact agreements which are equal expressions of self -determination. (IHS Strategic Goal 3, Objective 3.1: Improve communication within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public .) The IHS established four funding priorities for the TMG program: Tribes that receive federal recognition or restoration within the last five years with implementing or developing management and infrastructure systems for their organization T/TO that need to improve financial management systems to address audit material weaknesses 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019.

Permanent Allocation Method ............................... 93 -638 Self -Determination Contracts, Self-Governance Compacts, and Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Direct Operations budget supports the Indian Health Service (IHS) provision of Agency -wide leadership, oversight, and executive direction for the comprehensive public and personal health care provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Funds are used to promote the efficient and effective administ ration and overs ight of national functions such as: human resources (HR), financial management , acquisitions, internal control and risk management, health care and facilities planning, health information technology, Contract Disputes Act claims analysis, and other administrative support and systems accountability. These types of direct operations performed at the Headquarters and Area Office levels provide the foundation necessary to carry out the Agency m ission. The IHS Headquarters provides overall program direction, authorities, and oversight for the 12 IHS Areas and 170 Service Units; formulates policy and distributes resources; provides technical expertise to all components of the Indian health care system, which includes IHS direct, Tribally operated programs, and urban I ndian organizations (I/T/U); maintains national statistics and public health surveillance; identifies trends; and projects future needs. The IHS Headquarters works in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and sister agencies to formulate and implement national health care priorities, goals, and objectives for AI/ANs within the framework of its mission. The IHS Headquarters also works with HHS to formulate the annual budget and necessary legislative proposals, respond to congressional inquiries, and collaborate with other governmental entities to enhance and support health care services for AI/ANs. By delegation from the IHS Director, the 12 Area Offices distribute resources, carry out policies and internal controls, monitor and evaluate the full range of comprehensive healthcare and community -oriented public health programs, and provide technical support to local Service Units 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, for impacted funds. CJ - 179 and I/T/U staff. They ensure the delivery of quality health care through the 170 Service Units and participate in the development and demonstration of alternative means and improvement techniques of health services management and delivery to promote the optimal provision of health services to Indian people throughout the Indian health system. Direct Operat ions funding supports all three goals of the IHS Strategic Plan. Recruitment, development, and retention of a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce (Goal 1, Access, Objective 1.1) is the foundation for improving quality (Goal 2) and strengthening management and operations (Goal 3). These funds are essential for sustaining a human resources program that can enhance and retain a workforce to carry out the agency's mission. The f unds also support quality improvement capabilities (Goal 2, Quality, Objective 2.1) to ensure a quality healthcare program that promotes accountability, integrity, and stewardship. Woven through all of these components are the concerted efforts to continually strengthen IHS program management and operations through improved communication (Goal 3, Objective 3.1), secure and effective management of IHS's assets and resources (Goal 3, Objective 3.2), and modernization of information technology and systems to support data driven decisions (Goal 3, Objective 3.3). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Direct Operations budget is critical for continue d progress in assuring an accountable, quality, and high -performing Indian health system . Examples of significant agency activities made possible by Direct Operations funds are provided below. To establish long term goals for quality implementation and outcomes, the IHS developed a five - year (2019 -2023) Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan was published in February 2019 after extensive gathering of stakeholder input. The IHS initiated Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer on the IHS Strategic Plan initial framework and formed an IHS Federal -Tribal Strategic Planning Workgr oup to review all comments and recommend a list of final goals and objectives for IHS leadership review and approval. The plan promotes a culture of accountability, quality, and patient safety across the agency, and serves as a roadmap for continual quali ty improvement. In December 2018, the Office of Quality (OQ) was formally established within the IHS Headquarters to continue elevation of and national coordination and oversight for quality across the IHS health care system. The focus of the OQ is to pro vide a structure to promote accountability and oversight through quality assurance to promote and sustain compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and accreditation organizations; quality improvement through innovation and implementation of quality improvement science; improve patient safety and reduce all cause harm; and enterprise risk management to ensure that high risk agency systems and processes are identified, monitored, and mitigated. Through the national leadership of the OQ in F Y 2019, the IHS has made significant strides in addressing priority areas for quality improvement including implementing credentialing and privileging software agency-wide; hiring an IHS credentialing program manager at headquarters; and awarding a new con tract for an adverse events reporting and tracking system. The IHS is committed to making improvements and ultimately to being removed from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) High Risk list. Although the IHS is still on the list, significant pro gress has been made. The GAO cited 14 open recommendations in the High Risk Reports. Of those 14 recommendations cited in the High Risk Reports, GAO closed 11 recommendations. CJ - 180 Like other rural healthcare providers, the IHS historically has difficulties recruiting and retaining healthcare providers. To address these challenges, IHS continues to maximize the use of available recruitment and retention tools such as recruitment, retention, and relocation incentives; and use of Title 38 pay authorities. Most recently, t he IHS worked to convert podiatrist salaries to Title 38 to aid in the recruitment and retention of these critical healthcare providers. The IHS has also increased its competitive stance in the healthcare labor market through Title 38 Special Salary Rate (SSR) pay tables and developed a new table for licensed practical nurses and dental hygienist s who serve in our hospitals and health centers. Additionally, pay rates have been increased in Title 38 SSRs for physician assistants and optomet rists to ensure we are able to offer competitive salaries. To strengthen human resource management, the IHS implemented the Security Manager System . This system support s the entire life cycle of IHS's personnel security and suitability processes, to include capturing and managing background investigations. Security Manager has a customized workflow that ensure s proper case management with a complete audit trail into the personnel security process. Use of this electronic system provides a simplified, streamlined, and standardized personnel security management process across the IHS. In FY 201 9, the IHS continued to expand the use of data analysis and visualization tools to enhance reporting and data -driven decisions . Building on the successful completion of the IHS 3rd Party Revenue Dashboard \u2014a Qliksense based application developed to enhance reporting, trend analysis, and monitoring of third-party resources (e.g. Medicare and Medicaid) collected by federally -operated facilities \u2014the IHS completed the \"Follow the Money\" Dashboard. This dashboard allows non -technical users to review funding status and spending data related to Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) instantly. Both applications democratize data previously held only in the proprietary accounting and reporting system s, Unified Financial Management System and Financial Business Intelligence System. Users are able to access data in a non -technical format that can be quickly sort ed and compared by parameters such as type, Area, Service Unit, month, and fiscal year. This capability eliminates delays in accessing data through production financial systems, provides more financial information more widely, and reduces the requirement for a skilled financial analyst to produce labor intensive reports on demand, thereby freeing valuable time for value added analysis. The IHS is committed to ensuring quality care for all patients and is actively working on deploying innovative strategies with a focus on achieving and sustaining improvements in quality of care, accountability and data-driven decision making, and recruiting and retaining a high performing workforce.

Direct Federal, Cooperative Agreements, and Self-Governance Funding Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of Tribal Self-Governance (OTSG) is responsible for a wide range of agency functions that are critical to the IHS's efforts to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2) with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) nations, Tribal organizations, and other AI/AN groups. Since 1993, the Indian Healt h Service (IHS), in cooperation with Tribal representatives, developed formula methodologies for identification of Tribal shares for all Indian Tribes. Tribal shares are those program and administrative funds that Tribes are eligible to assume through self-determination contracts and self -governance compacts.1 Today, Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations administer over one -half of IHS resources through ISDEAA self - determination contracts and self-governanc e compacts . The Self-Governance budget supports several activities: Develops and oversees the implementation of Tribal self-governance legislation and authorities in the IHS that build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships (IH S Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2) that increase access to quality health care services (Strategic Goal 1, Objective 1.3) and provides care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities (Strategic Goal 2, Objective 2.2) .

PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The IHS Tribal Self -Governance Program has grown dramatically since the execution of the initial 14 compacts and funding agreements in 1994. In Fiscal Year 2019, IH S transferred approximately $2.4 billion of the total IHS budget appropriation to Tribes and Tribal organizations to support 104 ISDEAA self -governance compacts and 1 30 funding agreements. 2 The Self-Governance budget brings health care quality expertise to the IHS, and Tribes, by: Providing support for projects that assist Tribally operated health programs that build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2) to enhance information technology infrastructure that create quality improvement capability at all levels of the 2 For FY 20 20, the IHS estimates an additional five to ten Tribes will be entering into Title V ISDEAA compacts and funding agreements. This estimate corresponds to the number of Self -Governance Negotiation Cooperative Agreements available each fiscal year. Eligibility requirements for these agreements mirror the statutory requirements that Tribes must meet to participate in the IHS Tribal Self -Governance Program (25 U.S.C. \u00a75383; 42 C.F.R. Part 137, Subpart C). For this pool, an average estimate of $5 million per Tribe is used to project estimates for Tribes entering into a Title V ISDEAA compacts and funding agreements, inclusive o f both tribal shares and Contract Support Costs.

Authorizing Legislation .................................................Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Pub. L. 94-437, as amended by Pub. L. 111-148, title X, \u00a710221(a), Mar. 23, 2010, 124 Stat. 935); the Social Security Act sec. 1880 & 1911, 42 U.S.C 1395qq &1396j and the Economy Act (31 U.S.C 1535). PROGRAM DESCRIPTION In 1976, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorized the Indian Health Servic e (IHS) to collect Medicare and Medicaid (M&M) reimbursements for services provided in IHS facilities to patients with M&M eligibility. The IHCIA was later amended to allow IHS to collet Private Insurance (PI) reimbursements for services provided in IHS facilities for patients with PI. In 2010, the IHCIA was amended to authorize the IHS to be reimbursed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense for services provided through the IH S to beneficiaries eligible for services from either such Department. In 2012, the IHS and the VA signed an agreement under which VA to reimburses IHS for direct care services provided through the IHS to eligible American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) veterans. In fiscal year (FY) 2019 , $1.140 billion was collected from third party insurers, of which $995 million was Federal M&M collections and $138,349 million was collected from private insurers. The FY 2021 estimates above are based on the FY 2019 actual collections. Public and private collections represent a significant portion of the IHS and Tribal health care delivery budgets. Some IHS health care facilities report that 60 percent or more of their yearly budget relies on revenue collected from third party payers. In order to fulfill the IHS Mission, IHS continues its efforts to improve the revenue generation process by including the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 Goals and Object ives. Collection efforts from all payers by IHS facilities supports Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people as well as Objecti ve 1.3, Increase access to CJ - 188 quality health care services. Accreditation -In accordance with IHCIA authorization for collections, the IHS places the highest priority on meeting accreditation and certification standards for its healthcare facilities. Third party revenue is essential to maintaining facility accreditation, certification and standard of health care through organizations such as The Joint Commission or the Accreditation Associatio n for Ambulatory Health Care. Collection funds are ultimately used to improve the delivery and access to healthcare for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. This activity supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2: To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization . Feedback obtained from accreditation organizations during the review process is used by IHS facilities to support Objective 2.1, Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization. Monitoring - The IHS employs an online system to monitor the third party reimbursement process for IHS operated facilities. The Third Party Internal Controls Self-Assessment Tool provides necessary information for local managers and Headquarters staff to monitor compliance with applicable policies and procedures during the third party revenue collections process so they can take necessary actions and improve overall program activity. The IHS has also implemented Third Party Revenue Collections and Third Party Alternate Resource (health insurance coverage) Dashboards to monitor collections and insurance coverage at the National, Area, State and local level. Training of revenue cycle staff to use the dashboards effectively to identify areas for improvement began in FY 201 8 and will continue in FY 2020. In FY 2020, IHS will focus on development and implementation of a standard site review/site assessment/site internal auditing template. In FY 2020, IHS will continue to strengthen its revenue generation policies and management practices, includ ing internal controls, patient registration, patient benefits coordination, provider documentation training, certified procedural coding training, third party billing, electronic claims processing, accounts receivable, and debt management . Priority activities will include enhancement of third party billing and accounts receivable software to improve effectiveness and to ensure system integration with its business processes, compliance with M&M regulations, and industry standards and changes in operational processes. Improvements for IHS operated facilities are coordinated with concurrent enhancements in Purchased Referred Care business practices related to alternate resources. IHS has developed and implemented various tools including reports to analyze a facility's service population and identify opportunities to increase revenue. These efforts support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations, and specifically, Objective 3.2, Secure and effectivel y manage the assets and resources, as well as Objective 3.3, Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions. In addition, IHS continues to ensure compliance with statutory rules and regulations that impact third party collections directly and indirectly. Rules pertaining to the Medicare and Medicaid programs continue to have a direct impact on revenue generation. IHS has formed workgroups to maximize the positive impact for all IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health program facilities, such as the National Business Office Committee, which serves as a subcommittee to the National Council of Executive Officers. These efforts support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations, and Goal 3, Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen and sustain collaborative relationships. Partnerships - IHS is working to develop and enhance partnerships with federal and state agencies in support of IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships. IHS continues to work with CMS and the state Medicaid agencies to identify patients who are eligible to enroll in M&M and the state Children's Health Insurance Programs. IHS also continues these partnerships in the implementation of provisions in the IHCIA, and the Children's Health CJ - 189 Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. Enrollment and collections depend, in large part , on IHS 's successful partnerships/relationships, state participation in Medicaid expansion, and awareness and willingness of IHS users to enroll in Medicaid and other programs. IHS Areas have begun implementing care coordination agreements between IHS facilities and non -IHS providers, including urban Indian health care organi zations for the purpose of facilitating 100 percent reimbursement to the states by Medicaid for payments they make to IHS and tribal health care providers when they treat IHS -eligible and Medicaid enrolled American Indian and Alaska Natives. Some states have committed to dedicate any cost savings to increasing services and access to care for Indians. IHS anticipates that in -network contracting with health plans may work for many facilities and is working with CMS to identify ways to provide informational resources for implementation. IHS is continuing to implement, train, and participate in the Medicare Payment Reform /Quality Initiative efforts by CMS. This include s increasing awareness, training and implementation of the Quality Payment Program under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). IHS is working on implementation of the Merit -Based Incentive Payment System and Advanced Alternative Payment Models with the end goal of improving quality and access to care. IHS collaborates with CMS and the Tribes on a number of matters, including implementation of and training regarding recent changes in legislation, eligibility policies, covered services policies, reimbursement policies and payment methodologies, claims processing, denials, training and use of information technology resources at IHS and Tribal sites to increase the enrollment of M&M eligible AI/AN patients. IHS continues to coordinate outreach, education, and training efforts in collaboration with other federal, state and Tribal partners. IHS has partnered with CMS to provide a number of training sessions nationwide for Tribal and IHS employees, focusing on outreach and improving access to M&M programs. These training activities support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objec tive 1.1, Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce and Goal 3, Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources In December 2012, IHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) signed the VA/IHS Natio nal Reimbursement Agreement that facilitates reimbursement by the VA to the IHS and Tribal facilities for direct health care services provided to eligible AI/AN veterans. In January 2017, IHS renewed its interagency agreement with the VA to facilitate the use of the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) System by the IHS. The intent of this agreement is to cost -effectively expand clinical and support capabilities of participating facilities through use of VHA CM OP resources and by combining participating facilities ' prescription needs with VHA's. Improved efficiencies are gained through more efficient and effective use of staff, reduction in medication error costs, and reduction in medication error litigation. In June 2018, the IHS and VA signed an amendment to the agreement that extends the period of the reimbursement agreement through June 30, 2022 . This was a significant step in continuing to ensure implementation of Section 405 of the IHCIA. The agreement represents a positive partnership to support improved coordination of care and non-duplication of resources between IHS federal facilities and the VA and it paved the way for agreements negotiated between VA and tribal health programs. IHS will continue to work directly with the VA to implement billing practices to ensure IHS receives proper payment for care provided at IHS and Tribal facilities to AI/AN veterans. Monitoring, auditing, and compliance with the agreement will continue to be a focus for FY 201 9 through FY 2022. These efforts focus on the IHS Strategic Plan Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships. Training -IHS provides continuous training to health care facility staff in areas related to v arious functions within the revenue cycle, including patient registration, benefits coordination, coding, third party billing, accounts receivable and other aspects of the revenue cycle. Programs are expected to CJ - 190 ensure sufficient resources and training for staff to capture insurance in the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) system and bill accordingly. Area I/T/U staff are highly encouraged to participate in annual CMS trainings. IHS hosts a n annual Partnership Conference to provide the most current information related to finance, information technology, health information management, Purchased/Referred Care, and business office functions; special emphasis is also provided for the specific management needs of Tribes and urban programs. These training activities support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.1, Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce and Goal 3, Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources. Claims Processing Improvements -IHS continues to work to enhance each IHS operated facility's capability to identify patients who have private insurance coverage and improve claims processing. The local service units utilize private insurance funds to improve services, purchase medical supplies and equipment, and to improve local service unit business management practices in support of maintaining accreditation. The IHS continues to make use of private contractors to pursue collections on outstanding claims from private payers. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS With the Memorandum of Understanding and amended Reimbursement Agreement between the VA and IHS in place, IHS developed and executed an implementation plan to collect at all IHS federal sites serving eligible Veterans. The VA has approximately 114 agreements with Tribal Health Programs in addition to the agreements at federal sites. This partnership with the V A and implementation of VA reimbursement at IHS sites serve to support the IHS Strategic Plan Objective 1.2:Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships, Goal 3, Objective 3.2, Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources and enable s IHS to provide further services to local communities funded with these collections. The IHS HQ has also entered into cooperative agreements since 2010 with organizations such as the National Indian Health Board and the National Congress of American Indians to coordinate and conduct consumer centered outreach and education, training and technical assistance on a national scale for the 573 Federally -recognized AI/AN Tribes and Tribal organizations on the changes and authorities of the new legislation for the ACA and the IHCIA. The national organization partners have provided well over 100 training sessions and webinars for Tribes and tribal members, helped coordinate numerous enrollment events, created toolkits for youth and elders and offered technical assistance to AI/AN and non -AI/AN enrollment assisters. Through the IHS National Indian Health Outreach and Education (NIHOE) Initiative, the IHS continues to partner with national and regional Tribal/Indian organizations to educate consumers and tribal governments on the health care insurance options available, the process for enrollment, financial assistance, the exemption options for American Indians and Alaska Natives, eligibility determinations, the tribal employer mandate, and maximizing revenue. This activity supports IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen and sustain collaborative relationships . In June 2019, the IHS Office of Resource Access and Partnerships hosted a joint Partnership Conference with nearly 1000 I/T/U attendees from the Business Office, OIT, Health Information Management, Purchased/Referred Care, Finance, and other components of t he Revenue Cycle. The IHS HQ provided Area Revenue Cycle training in FY 2017, FY 2018, and FY 2019 to most facilities within the Agency. This included Tribal partners as well as Federal sites. Over 500 attendees participated in the training, which cover ed aspects of the entire revenue cycle. This training focused on Third Party Billing and Accounts Management, and Resource Patient Management CJ - 191 System (RPMS) Process Training. In addition, IHS hosted an Accounts Reconciliation Workshop in FY 2019, which included finance and business office staff from every IHS Area. In FY 2020, similar trainings will be offered to all Areas on the Revenue Cycle. In FY 2019 , the IHS revised and updated the Revenue Operations Manual (ROM). The ROM provides a system-wide reference resource available to all I/T/U facilities across the United States, to assist staff with functions related to business operat ion procedures and processes. IHS is now in this proc ess of developing training materials consistent with the IHS Third Party Internal Controls Policy and a training plan to be implemented in FY 2020. In FY 2019, IHS began working with Treasury Fiscal Services to further protect, control, and monitor all th ird party collections. Treasury mandates require that all Federal Agencies move towards an electronic environment for funds transfers and accountability of funds. IHS, in Partnership with Treasury Fiscal Services, PNC Bank (Fiscal Agent) and other Financial Institution began laying the groundwork for converting all paper checks received by the Agency to be settled in a more secure and timely manner. IHS continues to work towards a complete electronic patient account environment, and actually is surpassing industry standards in this arena. In FY 2019 IHS drafted a Pharmacy Benefits Manager Contract Review Process in order to more efficiently review, respond, negotiate, and track contract offers, modifications, and amendments. In FY 2020, the process will be fully implemented. Finally, in FY 2020 IHS will update the Third Party Internal Controls Self-Assessment Tool questions and collaborate internally on the update of the IHS Debt Management Policy . FY 2019 -2021 Collections Estimates The FY 2019 estimate of collections is based on collections by month through June 30 th, 2019; with the remaining 3 months estimated by straight line average. The FY 2020 and FY 2021 amounts are estimated based on the FY 2019 estimate, inflated by the average rate of annual increase from FY 2011 to FY 2018, by collection program. VA Reimbursements were based on a shorter period of average increases, based on it the limited period of time since the establishment of the agreement between IHS and VA to collect these fund s. Medicare and Medicaid (M&M) --The FY 2021 Budget estimate assumes collections of $1.269 billion , $49.8 million over estimated FY 2019 collections : Medicaid - The FY 2021 budget estimate assumes collections of $845.7 million, $38.1 million over estimated FY 2019 collections. IHS continues to educate its users on the benefits of Medicaid enrollment. IHS continues to monitor its user population and insurance coverage and is making all possible efforts to maximize Medicaid enrollment in all States and to maintain current collection level s. Medicare - The FY 202 1 budget estimate assumes collections of $260 .3 million, $11.6 million over estimated FY 2019 collections. IHS hospitals and clinics have taken strong steps to increase enrollment of its population in Medicare. In addition, IHS has expanded efforts to improve the quality of care and maintain current collections. Private Insurance - The FY 202 1 budget estimate assumes collections of $154.3 million, $45.1 million over estimated FY 2019 collections . IHS will continue to monitor its user population and increase direct assistance to stabilize and expand insurance coverage whenever possible to maintain CJ - 192 and maximize private insurance collections. VA/IHS National Reimbursement Agreement - The FY 202 1 budget estimate assumes collections of $8.8 million, -$19.3 million below estimated FY 2019 collections . The FY 2020 estimate is based on the FY 201 9 estimated collections. The estimate includes actual collections received by IHS for Federal. IHS and VA have agreed to continue to monitor FY 2019 actual reimbursements and work together to improve the quality of care for all veterans and maximize payments whenever possible. IHS continues to work with the VA in identifying the actual number of AI/ANs with VA benefits eligibility and, of those, how many receive direct care from IHS. IHS and the VA continue to work in partnership to identify and resolve billing and reimbursement issues and provide sites with on -going support and training. All IHS sites have signed implementation plans and have the ability to bill the VA for Veterans Services.

Authorizing Legislation ................................ ................................ ......... 25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act; 42 U.S.C. 2001, Transfer Act; Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), as amended 2010 FY 2021 Self -Determination Contracts Self -Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Maintenance and Improvement (M&I) funds are the primary source of funding to maintain, repair, and improve existing Indian Health Service ( IHS) and Tribal health care facilities, which are used to deliver and support health care services. M&I funding supports federal, government - owned buildings and tribally -owned space where health care services are provided pursuant to contracts or compacts executed under the provisions of the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638). M&I funds are necessary to achieve and maintain accreditation, to meet building codes and st andards, to maintain and repair the physical condition of health care facilities, to modernize existing health care facilities to meet changing health care delivery needs, and to implement mandated requirements (e.g., energy conservation, seismic, environm ental, handicapped accessibility, security, etc.). Efficient and effective buildings and infrastructure are vital to delivering health care in direct support of the IHS mission and priorities. Maintaining reliable and efficient buildings is an increasing challenge as existing health care facilities age and additional space is added into the real property inventory. The average age for IHS-owned health care facilities is approximately 36 years , whereas the average age, including recapitalization of privat e-sector hospital plants, is 9 to 10 years.1 Many IHS and Tribal health care facilities are operating at or beyond capacity, and their designs are not efficient in the context of modern health care delivery. In addition, as existing health care facilitie s continue to age, the operational and maint enance costs increase. IHS hospital administrators have reported that old or inadequate physical environments challenged their ability to provide quality care and maintain compliance with the Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation. Further, the administrators reported that maintaining aging buildings and equipment is a major challenge. Over one third of all IHS hospital deficiencies have 1 The 'average age of hospital plant' measures the average age of the facility including capital improvements, replacement of built-in equipment and modernization. CJ - 197 been found to be related to facilities with some failing on infection control criteria and others having malfunctioning exit doors. The physical condition of IHS -owned a nd many tribal ly-owned healthcare facilities is evaluated through routine observations by facilities personnel and by in -depth condition surveys. These observations and surveys identify facility, fire -life-safety, and program deficiencies, and are used to develop IHS' estimate of the Backlog of Essential Maintenance, Alteration, and Repair (BEMAR). The BEMAR is a measure of the condition of health care facilities in the Indian health system and establishes priorities for larger M&I projects. T he BEMAR fo r all IHS and reporting Tribal health care facilities as of October 1, 2019 , is $767.3 million. When IHS replaces an older, obsolete hospital or clinic with a new facility, all deficiencies associated with the old facility are removed from the backlog. The Facilities Management Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Obje ctive 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, and Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. Additionally, Facilities Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations; Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources. M&I Funds Allocation Method The IHS M&I funds are allocated in four categories: routine maintenance, M&I projects, environmental compliance, an d demolition: 1. Routine Maintenance Funds - These funds support activities that are generally classified as those needed for maintenance and minor repair to keep the health care facility in its current condition. Funding allocation is formula based. The B uilding Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences has determined that approximately two to four percent of current replacement value of supported buildings is required to maintain (i.e., 'sustain') facilities in their current condition.2 2. M&I Proj ect Funds - These funds are used for major projects to reduce the BEMAR and make improvements necessary to support health care delivery. Funding allocation is formula based. 3. Environmental Compliance Funds - These funds are used to address findings and recommendations from environmental audits, to improve energy efficiency and water efficiency, to increase renewable energy usage, to reduce consumption of fossil -fuel generated electricity, and to implement o ther sustainability initiatives. These funds are available to Federal and Tribal health care facilities on a national basis. 4. Demolition Funds - The IHS has a number of Federally -owned buildings that are vacant, excess, or obsolete. Demolition funds are used to dispose of these excess assets. These funds may be augmented with Environmental Compliance Funds as available for demolition and disposal to the extent that the proposed action reduces hazards, environmental concerns, or liability to IHS. Based upon recent interpretation of the Administrative 2 Committing to the Cost of Ownership -Maintenance and Repair of Public Buildings, The National Academies Press (1990), available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog . CJ - 198 Provision related to Demolition of hazardous, obsolete federal buildings, the inventory of this federal inventory continues to grow as does the potential liability. IHS Strategic Plan and how the Facilities programs are implementing : In consultation with Tribes and the Federal healthcare sites, IHS is allocating funding to the IHS Area Offices to complete BEMAR projects t o make renovations and improvements necessary to support health care delivery in the health care facilities and to modernize the health care facilities and staff quarters to expand access to quality health care services. FUNDING HISTORY /REQUEST Fiscal Year Amount 2017 $75,745,000 2018 $167,527,000 2019 2020 Enacted $168,952 ,000 2021 President's Budget $167,948 ,000 TRIBAL SHARES Maintenance & Improvement funds are subject to Tribal shares and are transferred to Tribe s when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities at a Federal or Tribal healthcare site . Tribe s may also contract or compact to perform individual Maintenance & Improvement projects that are awarded to federally owned sites BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2021 budget submission for Maintenance and Improvement is $167.9 million , which is $1.0 million below the FY 2020 Enacted Level . FY 2021 Funding of $ 167.9 million of +$ 1.8 million, including: Inflation: +$1.8 million to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. Program Adjustment -$2.8 million -The budget proposes to prioritize other direct services while redirecting/reducing funding for other activities, such as Maintenance and Improvement. Approximately $91.0 million is the projected amount for routine maintenance and repair to sustain the condition of federal and Tribal healthcare facilities buildings. These funds will support facilities activities that are generally classified as those ne eded for 'sustainment' of existing facilities and provided to the IHS Area Offices and to Tribe s for daily maintenance activities and local projects to maintain the current state of health care facilities. These Routine Maintenance Funds may be used for Area and Tribal M&I projects to fund small er elements of the backlog of work to address the old and antiquated facilities plant infrastructure (e.g., mechanical and electrical BEMAR) and program enhancements. CJ - 199 Approximately $ 73.9 million would be available for major Area and Tribal M&I projects to reduce the BEMAR deficiencies and to improve healthcare facilities to meet changing healthcare delivery needs. The FY 2020 Budget Request continues funding critical projects to address the old and antiquated facilities plant infrastructure (e.g., mechanical and electrical BEMAR) , accreditation standards, and program enhancements , all of which is essential to support health delivery . Approximately $ 3 million would be available for environmental compliance pro jects. The IHS places a high priority on meeting Federal, State, and local legal/regulatory environmental requirements, including allocating funding to address findings and recommendations from environmental audits. The IHS has currently identified appro ximately $ 6.6 million in environmental compliance tasks and included them in the BEMAR database. M&I funds , a portion from above categories retained by Headquarters, also provide resources for the demolition of IHS facilities that are no longer needed. The IHS has approximately 120 Federally -owned buildings that are vacant, excess, or obsolete . Many of these buildings are safety and security hazards. IHS plans for orderly demolition of some of these buildings, in concert with transferring others, reduci ng hazards and liability. Demolition Funds may be used in concert with environmental compliance funds as available for demolition of the Federal buildings to the extent that the proposed action reduces hazards, environmental concerns, or liability to the Indian Health Service. Since FY 2000 when funds were first set aside for the demolition of Federal buildings, associated demolition costs have risen significantly due to inflation, environmental regulations, recycling and landfill diversion requirements, a batement of hazardous material, etc. For example, many IHS locations are very remote which significantly increases the cost to haul the demolition waste off the reservation to approved landfills and recycling facilities. OUTPUT S / OUTCOME S The Outcomes for this program are measured through BEMAR, i.e., progress in addressing maintenance needs and facility deficiencies. Maintaining effective and efficient healthcare buildings improve the eas e and access to care, facilitate successful behavioral health se rvices, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment to deliver services. IHS target s the M&I funding , and supplements these funds with collections where available, towards major projects to red uce the BEMAR and improve the condition of existing Federal and Tribal healthcare sites. A few e xample s of these projects include: renovating/expanding pharmac y space , improvements to dental clinics to serve more users, remodel ing reception/waiting areas, construction of CT suite and new digital radiology rooms , repaving parking lots, emergency department renovations, new heating -ventilation -air conditions systems, sustainability projects to reduce utility costs, etc. Continued investment in the BEMAR whic h is currently at $767.3 million , will enable IHS and the Tribe s to maintain accreditation standards and delivery quality health care services.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improve ment Act (IHCIA) requires the Indian Health Service ( IHS) to identify the universe of sanitation facilities needs for existing American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN ) homes by documenting deficie ncies and proposing projects to address their needs . These projects prevent communicable diseases by provid ing new a nd existing homes with s ervices such as water wells, onsite wastewater disposal systems , or connections to community water supply and wastewater disposal systems. These projects can also include provision of new or upgraded water supply or waste disposal systems. These outcomes support both the HHS and IHS Strategic Plans . (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2018 - 2022, Objective 2.2: \"Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions \" and IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services . Strategy 14, \" Develop and coordinate environmental engineering, environmental health, and health facilities engineering services to provide effective and efficient public health services... \"). The four types of sanitation facilities projects funded through IHS are: (1) projects to serve existing housing; (2) projects to serve new or like -new housing, such as Indian homes being constructed or rehabilitated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) -Home Improvement Program, Tribe s, individual homeowners, or other nonprofit organizations; (3) special projects (studies, training or other needs related to sanitation facilities construction); and (4) emergency projects. Projects that serve new or like-new housing are funded based on a priority classification system. Projects that provide sanitation facilities to existing homes are selected for funding in priority order each year from the Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS). The SDS is an inventory of the sanitation deficiencies of federal ly recognized AI/AN eligible homes and communities; th e sanitation deficiencies include needed water, sewer, and solid waste facilities for existing AI/AN homes. These actions support Strategy 1, \" Improve the transparency and quality of data collected regarding health care service and program outcomes \" (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ). Project selection is driven by CJ - 201 objective evaluation criteria including health impact, existing deficiency level, adequacy of previous service, capital cost, local Tribal priority, operations and maintenance capacity of the receiving entity, availability of contributions from non -IHS sources, and other conditions that are locally determined. The SDS priority position of each unfunded project is reevaluated with the Tribe s in each Area annually. Sanitation Facilities Construction (S FC) projects can be managed by IHS directly or by Tribe s that elect to use the Title I or Title V authorization under P.L. 93 -638, the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act. Sanitation facilities projects are carried out cooperat ively with the Tribe s that will be served, and construction is performed by either the IHS or the Tribe s (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ). Projects start with a Tribal project proposal and are funded and implemented through execution of an agreement between a Tribe and IHS. In t hese agreements , the Tribe s also assume ownership responsibilities, including operation and maintenance. The overall SFC goals, reporting requirements, eligibility criteria, project planning, and funding priorities remain the same, regardless of the delivery methods chosen by a Tribe . The SFC Program leverages its capabilities in partnering with Tribes by also partnering with other Federal agencies in co nstructing or financing construction of water supply , wastewater and solid waste disposal projects addressing sanitation deficiencies faced by Tribes. One way in which the SFC Program engages in such partnerships is through the Infrastructure Task Force ( ITF), a partnership of Federal agencies focused on finding ways to better serve Tribes through cooperative efforts (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The SFC Program is an integral component of IHS disease prevention activities. IHS has carried out the program since 1959 using funds appropriated to provide water and waste disposal facilities for eligible AI/AN homes and communities. As a result, infan t mortality rates and mortality rate s for gastroenteritis and other environmentally -related diseases have declined. Research supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state s populations in regions with a lower proportion of homes with w ater service , reflect significantly higher hospitalization rates for pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus .1 Researchers associate d the increasing illnesses with the restricted access to clean water for hand washing and hygiene. The SFC P rogram works collaboratively with Tribe s to assure all AI/AN homes and communities are provided with safe and adequate water supply and waste disposal facilities as soon as possible. In FY 2019 , IHS provided service to 40,684 AI/AN homes and completed construction on 244 projects with an average project duration of 3.6 years. However, at the end of FY 2019 about 6,626 , or 1.6 percent of all AI/AN homes tracked by IHS lacked water supply or wastewater disposal facilities ; and, about 110,552 or approximately 27 percent of AI/AN homes tracked by IHS were in need of some form of sanitation facilities improvements. The individuals who live in homes without adequate sanitation facilities are at a higher risk for gastrointestinal disease, respiratory disease and 1 Thomas W. Hennessy, Troy Ritter, Robert C.

American Journal of Public Health: November 2008, Vol. 98, No. 11, pp. 2072 -2078. CJ - 202 other chronic diseases .2 Many of these homes without service are very remote and may have limited access to health care which increases the importance of improving environmental conditions. The total sanitation facility need reported through SDS has decreased approximately $0.10 billion or 3.5 percent from $ 2.67 billion to $2.57 billion from FY 2018 to FY 2019 . In FY 2019, the Indian Health Service was appropriated $ 0.19 billion to address sanitation deficiencies and support provision of sanitation facilities to eligible AI/AN homes and communities. The magnitude of the sanitation facility needs decrease is not directly commensurate with the appropriated funds due to the underlyi ng challenges of construction cost inflation, population growth, an increasing number of regulations, and failing infrastructure. Failing infrastructure is presumably the largest factor, a result of the infrastructure age and inadequate operation and main tenance. Under the IHCIA, the IHS is authorized to provide operation and maintenance assistance for, and emergency repairs to, Tribal sanitation facilities, when necessary to avoid a health hazard or to protect the Federal investment in sanitation facilities , however resources have not been appropriated specifically for this purpose . During FY 2019 287 construction projects to address water supply and wastewater disposal needs were funded with a construction cost of $169 M . Once constructed , these sanitation facilities will benefit an estimated 140,000 AI/AN people and help avoid over 79,000 inpatient and outpatient visits related to respiratory, skin and soft tissue , and gastro enteric disease. The health care cost savings for these visits alone is estimated to be over $173M . These outcomes support Strategy 14, \"Develop and coordinate environmental engineering, environmental health, and health facilities engineering services to provide effective and efficient public health services... \" (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services ). The SFC Program will continue in FY 2021 focusing on improving quality of data reported through the SDS on the sanitation facility needs supporting AI/AN homes and communities (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ). These effo rts will ensure the sanitation facilities needs included in SDS are: Adequately documented ; Reflect an update of current needs ; and Include only sanitation facilities fun dable by the SFC program for AI/AN eligible homes and communities and consistent with the prescribed Deficiency Levels referenced in the IHCIA . Additionally, in FY 2021 the SFC Program will continue to focus on maintaining average construction project duration to 4.5 years. In order to achieve this outcome , funds will only be obligated to projects that have been certified by the SFC Program Areas as \"ready to fund\" ; this means they have a well -defined scope, a detailed cost estimate, a completed preliminary design and that known potential risks to project co nstruction, operation and maintenance have been considered and mitigated.

CJ - 203 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2021 budget submission for Sanitation and Facilities Construction is $192.9 million , which is -$646,000 below the FY 2020 Enacted Level . FY 2021 Funding amount of $192.9 million includes : Program Adjustment -$2.5 million -The budget proposes to prioritize other direct services while redirecting/reducing funding for other activities, such as Sanitation and Facilities Construction. Current Services of +$ 1.9 million, including: Inflation +$1.9 million to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. The FY 2021 Budget request of $ 192.9 million - provides funding in the following allocation categories: Approximately $ 130.0 million may be distributed to the Areas for prioritized projects to serve existing homes, based on a formula that considers, among other factors, the cost of facilities to serve existing homes that: (a) have not received sanitation facilities for the first time , or (b) are served by sanitation facilities that are in need of some form of improvement . Another element of the distribution formula is a weight factor that favors Areas with larger numbers of AI/AN homes without water supply or sewer facilities, or without both. Up to $ 2.9 million will be reserved at IHS Headqua rters: Of this amount , $1.0 million will be used for emergency projects as requested by Areas to address water supply and waste disposal emergencies caused by natural disasters or other unanticipated situation that require immediate attention to avoid a health hazard or to protect the Feder al investment in sanitation facilities. Remaining emergency unused funds at the end of the fiscal year may be distr ibuted to address the SDS projects in the Areas. The remaining $ 1.9 million is for funding special projects. Starting in FY 2019 and endin g in FY 2021 up to $1 .0 million annually (total anticipated funding $3 .0 million ) may be utilized for the purpose of updating the inventory of open dumps currently identified in the IHS data system to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Indian L ands Open Dump Cleanup Act (PL103 -399). An amount up to $500,000 will be used to incorporate a g eographical information system (GIS) functionality into the SFC Program data system. The primary benefit of incorporating a GIS into the SFC Program's data sys tem is to improve the Program's ability to access, store and update sanitation facilities composite as-built drawings. The graphical interface will allow for the collection, uploading and editing of field -collected data on installed sanitation facilities. It will allow users to update sanitation facilit ies as-built drawings for the purpose of aiding in needs identification, planning, design, construction , and technical assistance. An amount up to $ 400,000 will be used for redesign of the SFC Program data system to facilitate development of an improved user interface, reporting, and program oversight. The remaining special project funds will be used to pay for research studies, training, or other needs related to sanitation facilities construction, but whic h are not eligible for construction funds. Approximately $60 million will be used to serve new and like -new homes, which are non - Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) homes (HUD homes are served under HUD authorities and appropriations ). Some of these funds may also be used for sanitation CJ - 204facilities for individual homes of the disabled or sick , with a physician referral , indicating an immediate medical need for adequate sanitation facilities in their home.3 As needed, amounts to serve ne w and like -new homes will be established by Headquarters after reviewing Area proposals. Priority will be given to projects under the BIA Housing Improvement Program (HIP) to serve new and like -new homes with the exception of \"Category A\" BIA HIP homes whi ch are considered existing homes and will be served with the funds described in the first bullet of this section . The IHS appropriated funds for sanitation facilities construction are prohibited by law from being used to provide sanitation facilities for new homes funded with grants by the housing programs of HUD. These HUD housing grant programs for new homes should continue to incorporate funding for the sanitation facilities necessary for those homes. From this distribution, up to $5.0 million may be used for projects to clean up open dump sites and upgrade solid waste sites that present a health hazard on Indian lands and Alaska Native lands pursuant to the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act of 1994,4 pending coordination with the EPA on oversight and evaluation of Tribal solid waste management programs.

The IHS is authorized to construct health care facilities and staff quarters, support Tribal construction of facilities under the Joint Venture Construction Program (JVCP), provide construction funding for Tribal projects Under the S mall Ambulatory Program (SAP) , and provide funding to construct new and replacement dental uni ts. The construction and modernization of IHS infrastructure through the health care facilities construction program helps ensure the IHS commitment to the Department of Health and Human Services Strategic Objectives 1.2: Expand safe, high -quality healthc are options, and encourage innovation and competition; and 1.3: Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choice of care and service options . The health care facilities constructed by the IHS ensure access to quality, culturally competent health c are for one of the lowest income populations in the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The focus of the IHS health care service programs provided in these facilities is on prevention and delivery of comprehensive primary care in a community setting. The HCFC program is funded based on an IHS -wide list of priorities for construction projects. During FY 1990, at the direction of Congress , the IHS established the Health Facilities Construction Priority System (HFCPS) methodology. The HFCPS ranks proposals using factors reflecting the total amount of space needed , age and condition of the existing health care facility, if any, degree of isolation of the population to be served in the proposed health care facility , and availability of alternate health care resources. The remaining health care facilities projects on the HFCPS list, inclu ding those partially funded, total approximately $2. 02 billion as of March 2019. The reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) includes a provision, \"any project established under the construction priority system in effect on the date of enactment of the Act of 2009 shall not be affected by any change in the c onstruction priority system taking place after that date... \" Total need for the HCFC Program is approximately $14.5 billion for CJ - 206 expanded and active authority facility types according to The 2016 Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment Report to Congress . The Joint Venture Construction Program ( JVCP ) authorizes IHS to enter into agreements with Tribes that construct their own health care facilities. The Tribe provides the resources, whether from its own funds, through financing, grants, contributions, or a combination thereof, for the construction of its health care facility . IHS health care facility construction appropriations are not used for construction of facilities in the JVCP but may be used to equip the health care facility. Tribes apply for the JVCP during a competitive process and the approved projects are enter ed into agreements with IHS. Based on the date of projected completion of construction by the respective Tribe, the IHS agrees to request a funding increase from Congress for additional staffing and operations consistent with a fully executed beneficial occupancy of the health care facility. The Small Ambulatory Program (SAP) provides funding for small Tribal health care facilities . The SAP is authorized by Section 306 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Public Law 94-437, and projects are competitively selected for funding as funds are appropriated. The SAP program is available for AI /AN Tribes or Tribal organizat ions to competitively obtain funding for the construction, expansion or modernization of tribally owned small ambulatory health care facilities. The selected projects will not be a part of the IHS HFCPS. These three programs implement the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by increasing access to culturally appropriate health care services for American Indian and Alaska Native people . IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 is supported when a new facility is completed . A new facility is designed to meet the demand for health services from a growing population by providing more healthcare providers and exam rooms, dentists and dental chairs, improved imaging systems, and expanded services such as eye care and audiology. Each new facility includes a component to address behavioral health issues. Administration staff is increased to strengthen management, collections and bring health care quality expertise to the replacement facility. Each facility also incorporates additional space for Tribal health programs which compl ements IHS programs and how the HCFC programs are implementing. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Each healthcare facility project that is completed increases access to much needed health care services. Each completed replacement facility is typically larger to meet the increased demand for health services from a growing population. Tribes typically provide land, at no cost to the Federal Government, for the new or replacement health care facility. In FY 2019 one facilit y was completed : The Northern Californ ia Youth Regional Treatment Center in Davis, CA . The FY 201 9 appropriation completed funding for the Dilkon Alternative Rural Health Center, Dilkon, AZ ; Pueblo Pintado Health Center Pueblo Pintado, to the Whiteriver Hospital, Whiteriver, AZ; Bodaway Gap Health Center, The Gap, AZ ; and Albuquerque West Health Center, Albuquerque, NM projects. The FY 201 9 appropriation funded planning activities for and the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ and the Gallup Indian Medical Center, Gallup, NM. CJ - 207 The FY 201 9 appropriation also contributed $ 15.0 million to the IHS SAP and $10 million to the Staff Quarters Program . The project s have been selected and agreements are being reached to award the funds . The JVCP has saved the Federal Government over $1.15 billion dollars in capital expenses since its inception. The outcome of the JVCP provides the same accomplishments as described above. The federal construction and the Joint Venture programs bring new and increased health c are capacity to AI/AN communities where there is a great need. These activities increase the acces s to quality healthcare in these underserved communities.

The programs directly and indirectly support all of the IHS facilities performance measures and improved access to quality health services. The programs and staff at the IHS Headquarters, Area Office, and Service Unit levels work collaboratively with Tribes and other agencies to promote and provide access to improvements in public health through surveillance, education, intervention activities, construction of sanitation facilities and health care facilities. These activities are aligned in sub - CJ - 210 activities: Facilities Support , Environmental Health Support, and Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Support. In addition to personnel salary and benefits costs, funding under this activity is used for utilities, certain non -medical supplies and personal property, and biom edical equipment repair. The IHS may use a limited amount of these FEHS funds for centrally charged assessments that benefit the staff and activities funded through the Indian Health Facilities appropriations. To date, the majority of IHS's assessments ha ve been paid through the Indian Health Services appropriation; however, the amount of assessment costs have exceeded the amount of funds available within Services. In order to continue the emphasis on direct patient care, these FEHS funds that provide othe r types of administrative support for the Facilities appropriation may share in appropriate asse ssment charges proportionate to the underlying activities. For example, a centrally managed assessment for payroll services that is charged by the number of emp loyees may be proportionately paid under both the Services and Facilities appropriations according to the number of staff supported by each appropriation.

This level of funding provides for the following allocation categories: FACILITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Facilities Support Account (FS) provides funding for Area and Service Unit staff for facilities - related management activities, operation and maintenance of real property and building systems, medical equipment technical support, and planning and construction management support for n ew and replacement health facilities projects. The sub -activity directly supports the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 priorities: (1) People -Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, caring workforce collaborating to achieve the IHS mission ; (2) Partnerships -Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships that advance the IHS mission ; (3) Quality -Excellence in everything we do to assure a high -performing Indian health system ; and (4) Resources -Secure and effectively manage the assets needed to promote the IHS mission. The IHS owns approximately 10,220 ,000 square feet of facilities (totaling 2,119 buildings) and 1,758 acres of federal and trust land. The nature of space varies from sophisticated medical centers to residential u nits and utility plants. Facilities range in age from less than one year to more than 167 years , with an average age greater than 39 years. A professional and fully - functional workforce is essential to ensure effective and efficient operations. An estimated 600 Federal positions (fulltime equivalents) are funded under this sub -activity. Typical staff functions funded may include: Facilities engineers and maintenance staff responsible for ensuring that building systems are operated properly, facil ities and grounds are maintained adequately, utilities are managed appropriately, environmental compliance requirements are met, and buildings are safe; Specialized clinical engineers and technicians who maintain and service medical equipment; Realty staff that manages the real property requirements and quarters; and Facilities planning and construction -monitoring that assist in the planning and construction of projects. In addition, FS provides partial funding for related Area and Service Unit operating c osts, such as utilities, building operation supplies, facilities -related personal property, and biomedical equipment repair and maintenance. Accomplishments include supporting health delivery through the attainment of accreditation and the maintenance of the environment of care of buildings, utility systems, life safety systems , and medical equipment. Adequate facilities/maintenance staffing both at the Area Offices and service units are paramount to maintain accreditation, for the continuity of health se rvices, and ensur ing that major building system s function correctly . Workload for the facilities and biomedical staff has continued to increase to meet the Agency's emphasis on accreditation standards and supporting program enhancements/expansion, which is predominately funded with collections. The Facilities Management Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are CJ - 212 available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , and Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services . Additionally, Facilities Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management and operations ; Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources . In consultation with Tribes and the Federal healthcare sites, IHS is coordinating with and alloc ating funding to the IHS Area Offices to complete BEMAR projects to make renovations and improvements necessary to support health care delivery in the health care facilities and to modernize the health care facilities and staff quarters to expand access to quality health care services including modern medical equipment . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS In FY 2019 , total utility costs were $ 13.5 million and total utility costs per Gross Square Feet (GSF) were $ 2.70/GSF. In FY 2021, the total utility cost is expected to be $ 14.6 million reflecting a 4.0 percent annual increase. The cost per GSF is expected to rise to approximately $2.92/GSF. IHS makes conscious efforts to help stem the growth in utility costs to ensure appropriations are sufficient to fund th ese needs. For example, IHS constructs new space that is at least 30 percent more energy efficient than building code requires and expects LEED Silver certification at those facilities. In June 2018, IHS placed into service a new Fort Yuma Health Care Ce nter in Winterhaven, CA , that consumed 114,300 BTU/SF in fiscal year 2019 compared to the average IHS building that consumed 135,000 BTU/SF in fiscal year 2019 . Maintaining effective and efficient healthcare buildings and equipment improve the eas e and access to care, facilitate successful behavioral health services, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment to deliver services. This is all integral to quality health care for AI/ANs. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Environmental Health Support Account (EHS A) provides funding for IHS Area, District, and Service Unit management activities and environmental health staff which include engineers, environmental health officers, engineering aides, injury prevention specialists, and institutional environmental healt h officers. More than 70 percent of these IHS and Tribal staff live and work in Tribal communities; another 20 percent provide regional services to Tribes or IHS facilities; and less than 10 percent of our staff are administrative managers. AI/ANs face h azards in their environments that affect their health status, including communities in remote and isolated locations, severe climatic conditions, limited availability of safe housing, lack of safe water supply, and lack of publi c health and safety legislat ion (e.g., lack of local solid waste ordinances, vehicle safety laws, or food safety laws). In accordance with congressional direction, these funds are distributed to the Areas based upon the workload and need associated with the two programs noted below. Sanitation Facilities Construction Program (SFC) - This program is an integral component of IHS disease prevention activities. IHS has carried out the program since 1959 using funds appropriated for SFC to provide safe water supply and waste disposal facilities for AI/AN people and communities. As a result, infant mortality rates and mortality rates for gastroenteritis and other environmentally -related diseases have been reduced. Research CJ - 213 supported by the Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention state s populations in regions with a lower proportion of home s with water service, reflect significantly higher hospitalization rates for pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus .1 Researchers associate the increasing illness es with the restricted access to clean water for hand washing and hygiene. The absence of clean water to sanitation facilities for tribal households exacerbate concern for the Indian Health Service Clinical Health Care program; further decreasing the qual ity of life for A I/ANs . Efforts by other public health specialists such as nutritionists and public health nurses are much more effective when safe water and adequate wastewater disposal systems are available in the home. In addition, the availability of s uch facilities is of fundamental importance to social and economic development, which leads to an improved quality of life and an improved sense of well -being. The SFC Program work s collaboratively with tribes to assure all AI/AN homes and communities are provided with safe and adequate water supply and waste disposal systems as soon as possible (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships) . Under this program in FY 2019, staff manage d and/or provided professional engineering services to construct 436 sanitation projects with a total cost of over $ 275 million . The program manages annual project funding that includes contributions from Tribes, states, and other federal agencies. The SFC Program is the environmental engineering component of the IHS health delivery system. Services funded include management of staff, pre -planning, consultation with Tribes, coordination with other federal, state and local governmental entities, identifying supplemental funding outside of IHS, developing local policies and guidelines with Tribal consultation, developing agreements with Tribes and others for each project, providing professional engineering design and/or construction services for water supply a nd waste disposal facilities, assuring environmental and historical preservation procedures are followed, and assisting Tribes where the Tribes provide construction management. Consistent with the 1994 Congressional set aside for \"...tribal training on the operation and maintenance of sanitation facilities,\" $1 .0 million of these support funds are used for technical assistance, training, and guidance to Indian families and communities regarding the operation and maintenance of water supply and sewage disposa l facilities. In accordance with the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the staff annually updates its inventory of sanitation facilities deficiencies for existing Indian occupied homes.2 This is accomplished through extensive consultation with Tribes. The SFC staff also develops and updates an inventory of all open dump sites on Indian lands as required under the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act.3 Both of these inventories are widely used by other governmental agencies in their evaluation and funding of sanitation facilities construction projects. Enviro nmental Health Services (EHS) - National priority areas include: food safety, children's environments, healthy homes, vector borne a nd communicable disease, and safe drinking water. The EHS Program identifies environmental hazards and risk factors in Tribal communities and proposes control measures to preven t adverse health effects. The EHS 1 Thomas W.

American Journal of Public Health: November 2008, Vol. 98, No. 11, pp. 2072 -2078. 2 Title III, Section 302(g) 1 and of P.L. 94 -437. 3 P.L. 103 -399. CJ - 214 Program monitor s and investiga tes disease and injury . The program provides inspections to identify environmental hazards in homes, healthcare facilities, food service establishments, Head Start centers, and many other types of Tribal establishments . In addition, EHS provides training, technical assistance, and project funding (including cooperative agreements ) to enhance the capacity of Tribal communities to address environmental health issues. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 , 3 and 5 (see goal descriptions below) EHS provides access to public health services to AI/ANs. Examples include referrals for home investigations to reduce environmental triggers for asthma patients; home investigations to reduce exposure to lead -based paint or other lead hazards (including drinking water sources) for patients with elevated blood -lead levels; animal bite investigations in Tribal communities and potential patient exposure to rabies virus; home investigations to address fall risk for elderly and other patients at risk for falls; and referrals for investigation of community disease outbreaks from multiple patient exposures to contaminated food or water. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 and 3 (see goal descriptions below) The IHS Injury Prevention Program (IPP) leads IHS efforts to address injury disparities in AI/AN com munities. AI/AN experience injury mortality rates that are 2.5 to 8.7 times higher than the U. S. all races rates. The IPP works with AI/AN, other agencies, and IHS programs to prevent unintentional injuries (motor vehicle -related, falls, burns, drowning, poisoning) and intentional injuries (suicide and violence -related) through technical assistance, training, and the Tribal Injury Prevention Cooperative Agreement Program (TIPCAP). Technical assistance is provided in the areas of data collection for project evaluation, building partnerships, implementing evidence -based strategies or innovative interventions, and develo ping tribal injury prevention programs. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 and 3 (see goal descriptions below) The IHS Institutional Environmental Health (IEH) Program identifies environmental hazards and risk factors in the built environment and proposes control measures to prevent adverse health effects to patients, staff, and visitors in health care and other community facilities . The IEH program supports development and management of safe, functional health care facilities which contribute to the quality of c are and workforce retention. The IEH program collaborates with entities such as the National Institutes of Health, Administration for Children and Families, and Uniformed Services University to improve IEH practices in IHS facilities and in our tribal comm unities. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 and 3 (see goal descriptions below) HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2: Protect the Health of Americans Where They Live, Learn, Work, and Play by: Preventing and Controlling communicable and environmental diseases; and Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. HHS Strategic Plan Goal 3: Strengthen the Economic and Social Well -Being of Americans across the Lifespan by Safeguarding the public against preventable injuries and violence or their results. HHS Strategic Goal 5: Promoting Effective and Efficient Management and Stewardship. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS EHS staff accomplishments reduce the need for direct healthcare services when environmentally related diseases and injuries are reduced. For example , the IHS Injury Prevention Program has been instrumental in reducing the injury mortality rate of AI/ANs by implementing a public health approach based upon effective strategies and initiatives to reduce the devastating burden of CJ - 215 injuries. Preventing severe, debilitating injuries reduce s the cost and need for healthcare service ; however, the challenge remains that unintentional injuries are still the leading cause of death for AI/ANs ages 1 -44.4 From 1997 -2019 the TIPCAP funded 106 fulltime tribal injury prevention positions and provided over $31 million in funding. Through these efforts the IHS IPP has contributed to the 58 percent decrease in injury mortality rates since 197 3 and continues to invest in preventing injuries in the first place, instead of treating the impacts of injury and violence through our health care delivery system. President's Management Agenda Goal 3 Cross Agency Priority Goal - Develop ing a Workforce for the 21st Century. The IEH Program provides extensive technical assistance and training to safety and facility management staff as well as the many inter -related medic al program and leadership staff . These efforts have led to a reduction in the IHS total occupational injury case rate which has decreased from 4.35 injuries/100 employees in 2004 to 1. 84 injuries/100 employees in 201 8. The IEH program supports healthcare management by providing local accreditation support including mock environment of care surveys in which regulatory requirements and conditions for general safety, environmental infection control, fire safety, and chemical safety are a ssessed and recommendations for corrective action are provided. The IEH Program works to foster multi - disciplinary engagement amongst all levels of the organization to improve transparency and efficiency. Staff engage Tribal, county, and state public health and public safety officials in Tribal communities. For example, staff engage local Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement or Tribal police to enhance motor vehicle related injury prevention efforts through child safety seat interventions and enhanced police enforcement activities such as seat belt usage or driving un der the influence checkpoints. Staff work extensi vely with Tribal, county, and state health departments on a variety of public health issues including response to food -borne (i.e., salmonellosis), vector -borne (i.e., bubonic plague, Rocky Mountain spotte d fever, hantavirus), and water -borne (i.e. legionellosis) disease outbreaks. Other examples of collaboration include surveillance activities related to emerging diseases and public health emergency preparedness.

In FY 2019, 69.5 percent of drivers wore seat b elts (EHS -3) and 3.5 percent of food borne illness risk factors were out of compliance (EHS - 4). The FY 2020 target is based on 100 percent of all participating Areas distributing model practices and highlighting challenge s to Tribes. *The FY 2020 targets are not comparable to FY 2019. Performance Discussion Injury Intervention: During the 2016 -2020 performance cycle, in FY 2016, Area EHS Programs identif ied targeted communities from which a national baseline measure of seatbelt use was developed (64 percent) . For the FY 201 7 target, 8 of 10 (80 percent) of the Area programs implement ed comprehensive interventions using at least three effective strategies to increase seatbelt usage rate in targeted Tribal communities. Examples include: d eveloping or strengthening tribal seat belt laws, i ncreas ing partnerships with T ribal police , provid ing classroom curriculum for motor vehicle crash prevention at reservation schools . For the FY 2018 target, measure interim seat belt use to determine effectiveness of interventions and propose adjustments to interventions based on interim driver seat belt use findings, 64 percent of drivers wore seat belts (no change from the FY 2016 baseline year) and Areas modified their strategies to address identified intervention barriers. In FY 2019, Area programs co nducted their final driver seat belt use rates, 69.5 percent of drivers used their seat belt. The results show an 8 percent increase in observed seat belt use when compared to the 64 percent baseline. In FY 2020, Area programs will share success stories with Tribes highlighting interventions which had the greatest impact at improving driver seat belt usage .

Examples include: develop ing and implement ing active managerial control and corrective action plan process es with local operators , focusing food inspection surveys on targeted risk factors, and providing a ccess to training through the IHS Online Food Handlers Training Course. For the FY 2018 target, conduct an interim assessment of poor employee health and hygiene foodborne illness risk factors to determine effectiveness of interventions and adjust interventions based on interim findings, 3.4 percent of food borne illness risk factors were out of comp liance (a decrease from the FY 2016 baseline year) and Areas continued their comprehensive interventions. In FY 2019, Area programs co nducted their final assessments and data collection, 3.5 percent of food borne illness risk factors were out of complianc e. The results show a 31 percent reduction in food borne illness risk factors that were out of compliance when compared to the 5.1 percent baseline. In FY 2020, Area programs will share success stories with Tribes highlighting interventions which had the g reatest impact at improving driver seat belt usage. IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. HHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2.2. The FY 2016 - 2020 EHS performance measures focus on reducing the risk of foodborne illness in children's environments and reducing the risk of motor vehicle -related injuries and deaths through increased use of seatbelts. Barriers that may impact the program's ability to me et these targets include competing local, regional and national priorities, staff turn -over, lapsed vacant positions, and a decentralized approach to program management that can result in non - standardized processes across the country. To help mitigate the se barriers , EHS provides ongoing competency development through specialized training programs; strategic planning efforts that support uniform program management; and data management tools to support local staff. GRANT AWARDS In FY 2018, the Injury Prevention Program awarded $ 1.3 million in cooperative agreements to fund 32 Tribal programs. In FY 2019, (year four of the five -year agreements) $ 1.3 million in continuation funds were awarded to the 31 Tribal programs. OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The IHS Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Support activity (OEHE) provides funds for executive management activities, personnel, contracts, contractors, and operating costs for the OEHE Headquarters. Personnel have management responsibility for IHS facilities and environmental health programs, provide direct technical services and support to Area p ersonnel, perform management functions and have responsibility for all construction contracting in excess of $150,000 .

These programs includ e behavioral health services. The OEHE facilities programs integrate strategic planning, performance, and program integrity into the office's daily business practic es. One example is the Sanitation Facilities Construction Strategic planning efforts and identification of needs (Strategy 1, \" Improve the transparency and quality of data collected regarding health care service and program outcomes \" from IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ). Implementation of th is plan has improved project management, reduced project durations and transformed the data system used by IHS and federal partners to manage sanitation programs in Indian country. Another example is the Environmental Health program strategic visioning and the Ten Essential Environmental Health Services as a framework. Implementation of both of these initiatives is o ngoing.

It directly supports the Agency's priorities of Partnerships and Quality. Accurate clinical diagnosis and effective therapeutic procedures depend in large part on health care providers using modern and effective medical equipment/systems to assure the best possible health diagnosis . The IHS and T ribal health programs manage approximately 90,000 devices consisting of laboratory, medical imaging, patient monitoring, pharmacy, and other biomedical, diagnostic, and patient equipment valued at approximately $500 million. With today's medical devices/s ystems having an average life expectancy of approximately six years and rapid technological advancements, medical equipment replacement is a continual process making it necessary to replace worn out equipment or provide equipment with newer technology to e nhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment. To replace the equipment at the end of its six-year life would require approximately $84.0 million per year. Many of the IHS hospital administrators reported that old or inadequate physical environments challenged their ability to provide quality care and maintain compliance with the Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation. Further, the administrators reported that maintaining agin g buildings and equipment is a major challenge. Over one third of all IHS hospitals ' deficiencies have been found to be related to facilities with some failing on infection control criteria and others having malfunctioning exit doors. Equipment Funds Allo cation Method The IHS Equipment funds are allocated in three categories: Tribally -constructed health care facilities, TRANSAM program, and new and replacement equipment: CJ - 221 1. Tribally -Constructed Health Care Facilities - The IHS provides medical equipment fu nds to support the initial purchase of equipment for tribally -constructed health care facilities. The Budget Request supports approximately $5.0 million for competitive awards to Tribes and Tribal organizations that construct new or expand health care fac ilities space using non -IHS funding sources. Tribes and Tribal organizations will use these funds to serve approximately 500,000 patients with newly purchased medical equipment. 2. TRANSAM Program - Equipment funds may be used to acquire new and like -new excess medical equipment from the Department of Defense (DoD) or other sources through the TRANSAM (i.e., Transfer of DoD Excess Medical and Other Supplies to Native Americans ) Program and to procure ambulances for IHS and Triba l emergency medical services programs.1 The Budget includes $500,000 for the TRANSAM Program from the Equipment budget. Under the TRANSAM Program, excess equipment and supplies, at an annual estimated value of $5 .0 million, are acquired for distribution to federal and Tribal sites. 3. New and Replacement Equipment -Approximately $19.7 million will be allocated to IHS and Tribal health care facilities to maintain existing and purchase new medical equipment, including the replacement of existing equipment used in diagnosing illnesses. The funding allocation is formula based. The Facilities Management Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Objective 1.1: Recruit, develo p, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, and Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. Additionally, Facilities Program addresses the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 3: To strengthen IHS program management an d operations; Objective 3.2: Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources. IHS Strategic Plan and how the Facilities programs are implementing: In consultation with Tribes and the Federal healthcare sites, IHS is allocating funding to the IHS Ar ea Offices to replace and modernize medical equipment to support health care delivery and expand access to quality health care services.

Authorizing Legislation ........................ 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 450 et seq., Indian Self-Determination Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act ( ISDEAA), Public Law 93-638, provides Tribes or Tribal Organizations ( T/TO) the authority to contract with the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Indian Health Service (IHS), to operate Federal programs serving eligible persons and to receive not less than the amount of funding that the Secretary would have otherwise provided for the direct o peration of the program for the period covered by the contract (otherwise known as the \"Secretarial amount\"). The 1988 amendments to the Act authorized Contract Support Costs (CSC) be paid in addition to the Secretarial amount. CSC are defined as necess ary and reasonable costs for activities that T/TO must carry out to ensure compliance with the contract and prudent management but that the Secretary either did not normally carry out in his or her direct operation of the program or provided from resources other than those transferred under contract. The IHS CSC policy was established in 1992 and most recently revised on August 6, 2019, which updates from the October 2016 policy revisions,3 an update to reflect necessary changes. These changes include the method by which Congress has funded CSC , and moves from limited to uncapped awards, and the provision of CSC to an indefinite appropriation. CSC is administered for IHS by the Office of Direct Services and Contracting Tribes (ODSCT), an office with resp onsibility for three primary functions that directly impact the relationship with each Indian T/TO.

IHS updated its CSC Policy on August 6, 2019 that incorporates the changes applicable to the section of the policy relating to an alternative method for calculating indirect costs (IDC) associated with recurring Service Unit shares - also referred to as the \"97/3 method\" or \"97/3 split\". In May of 2017, IHS initiated Tribal Consultation and used the comments received to reinstate the \"97/3\" provision that requires agreement by both IHS and the Tribes to determine the appropriate method to calculate IDC associated with recurring Service Unit shares. IHS SP Goal 1, Objective 1.2 . IHS Headquarters reconciles CSC fund requests on a quarterly basis and allocates funds to each Area office to pay tribes. IHS SP Goal 3, Objective 3.2 IHS uses the CSC automated data system to track and monitor all CSC activity. The CSC data set is used to track all CSC funds, including any new and expanded assumption, renegotiation of CSC amounts, and distribution and payment of funds. IHS also uses the system to project CSC need based on the most current data. IHS SP Goal 3, Objective 3.3 - Moderniz e Information Technology and information systems to support data -driven decisions. IHS continues to use the internal electronic database to monitor each Title I and V ISDEAA negotiation, including CSC negotiations. The database monitors each phase of a negotiation to ensure that IHS uses a consistent agency business approach, meet statutory deadlines, and accurately calculate required funding amounts. In addition, the database tracks new and expanded assumptions and is used to determine the status of funds, workload, planning of resources, and subsequent years' funding needs. IHS SP Goal 3, Objective 3.3 IHS continues to make progress in resolving Contract Disputes Act claims from T/TO for additional CSC funding for prior years. As of August 25, 2019, the IHS has extended settlement offers on 1,564 of the 1,624 claims, with settlement payments of approximately $880 million that has been tentative or confirmed for payment from the Judgment Fund.

Permanent Allocation Method .................................. P.L. 93 -638 Self -Determination Contract and Compacts, Lease Cost Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act ( ISDEAA ), at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324( l), also referred to as Section 105( l), requires the Indian Health Service (IHS ) to enter a \"lease\" upon the request of a Tribe or Tribal Organization furnishing a tribally owned or leased facility used in support of its tribally operated ISDEAA contract or compact . IHS does not directly use or occupy the tribal facility under the lease. Through regulations contained in 25 C.F.R. Part 900, Subpart H , IHS identified elements of c ompensation included in a Section 105( l) lease. A 2016 Federal Court's decision (Maniilaq Association v. Burwell) prohibits IHS from capping funding under Section 105(l) at the level that IHS would have otherwise spent to operate a facility if it were to carrying out the Federal health programs. There is no statutory or regulatory limitation on when proposals may be submitted to the IHS, so IHS cannot reliably project annual costs or provide reliable estimates during a single fiscal year. Lease costs have grown exponentially, since the Maniilaq decision, and have quadrupled between FY 2018 and FY 2019. Because IHS does not have dedicated funding for leases, IHS has been forced to reprogram funds twice in FY 2019 totaling over $70 million and once in FY 2018 totaling $25 million. Absent a change, IHS will continue to divert increasing amounts of resources from direct services to pay for leases. IHS cannot legally reduce the amount of funds provided to self -determination Tribes and tribal organizations, s o the only funds available for reprogramming come from Tribes that IHS serves directly. The prevalence of Section 105(l) leases in FY 2017 was largely confined to the Alaska Area. However, by FY 2019, leases have proliferated throughout the IHS system and proposals have been received in 10 of 12 IHS Areas. 1 Reflects Services account adjustments related to formal reprogramming notifications submitted to Congress in FY 2019. Amounts by \"Sub IHS Activity\" will continue to be adjusted during the period of availability, which conclude on September 30, 2020, f or impacted funds. CJ - 229 The Budget provides full funding for Section 105(l) leases at an estimated $101 million through a new, separate indefinite discretionary appropriation, and also includes reforms to improve management of tribal lease payments. The Budget includes legislative proposals and appropriations language to support this new indefinite appropriation, which were developed in collaboration with the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). IHS will continue to work with BIA and BIE to develop additional policies and guidance, in consultation with Tribes and tribal organizations, to clarify procedures and improve management of tribal lease payments. This new, separate funding source supports IHS Strategic Plan goals and objectives for increasing access to care by establishing a dedicated funding source for these required costs and preventing the redirection of other IHS funds intended for health care services (Goal 1, Access, Objective 1.3, Increase access to quality health care services). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS In FY 2019, the IHS received 205 proposals, totaling nearly $101 million, an amount four times higher than in FY 2018 and 17 times higher than in FY 2017. Based on the exponential growth of Section 105( l) leases from 37 proposals totaling $6 million in FY 2017, to 83 proposals totaling $25 million in FY 2018, and 205 proposals totaling $101 million in FY 2019, costs for future years are expected to continue growing as more Tribes and Tribal Organizations across the country submit additional proposals. In FY 2019, the IHS received an increase of $25 million in the Services Hospitals and Health Clinics (H&HC) budget line for tribal clinic operational c osts. This amount supplemented the $11 million included in the IHS's base funding level for a total of $36 million for tribal clinic operational costs, including Village Built Clinics (VBCs) in Alaska. Based on prior agency decisions made through consult ation with Alaska Tribes, approximately $6 million of the base funds were transferred to the Alaska Area on a recurring basis primarily for VBCs. The remaining $30 million was allocated for Section 105( l) leases; however, additional resources were required to meet the full need. Under current appropriations, the IHS is legally required to fund Section 105( l) leases from the IHS's \"Indian Health Services\" lump sum appropriation account. Similar to FY 2018, the IHS provided formal notice to Congress and re programmed funding from within the IHS's Services appropriation account to meet FY 2019 funding requirements, shifting funds from direct patient care to lease costs. The IHS conducted Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer in FY 2018 and again in FY 2019 on short -term and long -term options for meeting requirements of the ISDEAA related to Section 105(l). Tribal and Urban Indian Organization feedback strongly recommended seeking additional resources, such as through a separate indefinite appropriation, and remained critical of any redirection of existing funding, which diminishes the Indian health system's ability to provide direct health care services. At the recommendation of Tribes and Tribal Organizations, the IHS established a technical team to help collect and analyze information necessary for developing cost projections. The team includes representatives from the IHS Tribal Self -Governance Advisory Committee, the IHS Direct Services Tribes Advisory Committee, the IHS Facilities Appropriation Advisory Board, the IHS National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup (NTBFW), and subject matter experts from the IHS. This team serves as a technical resource to the NTBFW and their on -going work is included in the IHS's annual Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer on the budget.

Grants and Contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) grant program provides funding for diabetes treatment and prevention t o approximately 3 01 Indian Health Service (IHS), Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) Indian health grant programs. Funds for SDPI were first author ized in FY 1998; as such, FY 2021 would be the 24 th year of the SDPI. SDPI is currently authorized through May 22, 2020. The IHS Office of Clinical and Preventive Services (OCPS) Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) provides leadership, programmatic, administrative, and technical oversight to the SDPI grant program. The mission of the DDTP is to develop, document, and sustain public health efforts to prevent and control diabetes in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) by promoting collaborative strategies through its extensive diabetes network . This mission aligns with Goal 1 of the IHS Strategic Plan, To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people and Objective 2.2 of the HHS Strategic Plan , Provide care to better meet the health care needs of CJ - 232 American Indian and Alaska Native communities . The diabetes network consists of a national program office, Area Diabetes Consultants in each of the 12 IHS Areas, and approximately 301 SDPI grants and su b-grants at I/T/U sites across the country. Target Population: American Indians and Alaska Natives Diabetes and its complications are major contributors to death and disability in nearly every Tribal community. AI/AN adults have the highest age-adjusted rate of diagnosed diabetes (15.1 percent) among all racial and ethnic groups in the United States, more than twice the rate of the non-Hispanic white population (7. 4 percent).1 In some AI/AN communities, more than half of adults 45 to 74 year s of age have diagnosed diabetes, with prevalence rates reaching as high as 60 percent.2 Allocation Method In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress instructed the IHS to use SDPI funds to \"establish grants for the prevention and treatment of diabetes\" to address the growing problem of diabetes among AI/ANs. The entities eligible to receive these grants were I/T/Us . The IHS distributes this funding to approximately 301 I/T/U sites annually through a process that includes Tribal consultation /Urban confer, development of a formula for distribution of funds, and a formal grant application and administrative process. This process is consistent with IHS Strategic Plan Objective 1.2 to \"build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships \". Strate gy The SDPI brings Tribes together to work toward a common purpose and share information and lessons learned. The Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee, established in 1998, reviews information on the SDPI progress and provides recommendations on diabetes -related issues to the IHS Director. Through partnerships with federal agencies, private organizations, and an extensive I/T/U network, DDTP undertook one of the most strategic diabetes treatment and prevention efforts ever attempted in AI/AN communities an d demonstrated the ability to design, manage, and measure a complex, long -term project to address this chronic condition. Because of the significant costs associated with treating diabetes, I/T/Us have used best and promising practices for their local SDP I funding to address the primary, secondary , and tertiary prevention of diabetes and its complications. These efforts increase the availability and accessibility of comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services to AI/AN people, which supports Goal 1 of the IHS Strategic Plan and Objective 1.3 of the HHS Strategic Plan. This collaborative approach supports the strategic planning process necessary to identify the goals and objectives needed to achieve the intended SDPI outcomes.

Each of the communities served by the SDPI grant program is unique in that its diabetes treatment and prevention needs and priorities are defined locally. Based on these local needs and priorities, the SDPI grant programs implement interventions to address the diabet es epidemic. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 established statutory authority for SDPI to implement a best practices approach to diabetes treatment and prevention. As such, the SDPI has incorporated Indian Health Diabetes Best Practices into the SDPI g rant application process used throughout AI/AN communities. This effort is used to promote excellence and quality within the SDPI programs, which aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2. Grant programs are required to document the use of one SDPI Diabetes Best Practice, 3 corresponding evaluation measures, and progress in achieving program objectives in order to enhance accountability. Grantees receive training on how to collect, evaluate, and improve their data collection and use it to improve their outcome results. Impact of the SDPI Grant Programs SDPI funding has enabled staff and programs at the local and national levels to increase access to diabetes treatment and prevention services throughout the Indian health system. The following table demonstrates substantial increases in access to many activities and services: Diabetes treatment and prevention services available to AI/AN individuals Access in 1997 Access in 2018 Absolute Percentage increase Diabetes clinics 31% 76% +45% Diabetes 3 Available at https://www.ihs.gov/sdpi/sdpi-community-directed/diabetes-best-practices/ CJ - 234 Diabetes treatment and prevention services available to AI/AN individuals Access in 1997 Access in 2018 Absolute Percentage increase Access to registered dieticians 37% 86% +49% Culturally tailored diabetes education programs Access to physical activity specialists Adult weight management programs 19% 82% +63% Clinical Diabetes Outcomes d uring SDPI At the same time that access to these diabetes services increased, key outcome measures for AI/ANs with diabetes showed improvement or maintenance at or near national targets. These results have been sustained throughout the inception of SDPI. Examples include: Improving Blood Sugar Control Blood sugar control among AI/ANs with diabetes served by the IHS has improved over time. The average blood sugar level (as measured by the A1C test) decreased from 9.0 percent in 1996 to 8.1 percent in 201 9, nearing the A1C goal for most patients of less than 8 percent. Improving Blood L ipid Levels Average LDL cholesterol (i.e., \"bad\" cholesterol) declined from 118 mg/dL in 1998 to 90 mg/dL in 2019 , surpassing the goal of less than 100 mg/dL. Reducing Kidney F ailure The rate of new cases of kidney failure due to diabetes leading to dialysis declined by more than half (54 percent) in AI/AN people from 1996 to 2013. This is a much larger decline than in any other racial group in the US. 4 2. Diabetes Data and Program Delivery Infrastructure The IHS has used funding from the SDPI to strengthen the diabetes data infrastructure of the Indian health system by improving diabetes surveillance and evaluation capabilities. The SDPI supports the development and implementation of the IHS Electronic Health Record, and the IHS Diabetes Management System in all 12 IHS Areas, which supports Objective 3.3 of the IHS Strategic Plan . Facilities associated with SDPI programs participate in the annual IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit. The Diabetes Audit is the cornerstone of the IHS DDTP diabetes care surveillance system, tracking annual performance on diabetes care and health outcome measures. Data collection for the Diabetes Audit follows a standardized protocol to ensure statistical integrity and comparability of measures over time. The 2019 Diab etes Audit included a review of 127,474 patient charts at 3 29 I/T/U health facilities. The Diabetes Audit enables IHS and the SDPI programs to monitor and evaluate yearly performance at the local, regional, and national levels, as well as enhance quality improvement capabilities across AI/AN communities. These innovative efforts align with Objective 2.1 of the IHS Strategic Plan . DDTP provides D iabetes Audit training through online and webinar formats. DDTP receives evaluations on all trainings provided to guide improvements for future sessions. 4 Bullock A, Burrows NR, Narva AS, et al. Vital Signs: Decrease in Incidence of Diabetes -Related End -Stage Renal Disease among American Indians/Alaska Natives \u2014 United States, 1996 -2013. 235 Key Performance/Accomplishments Annual SDPI assessments have shown significant improvements in the availability of diabetes clinical care and community services provided over time when compared to the baseline SDPI assessment in 1997 (see table above titled \"Diabetes treatment and prevention services available to AI/AN individuals\"). Ongoing efforts to improve blood glucose, blood pressure , and cholesterol values will continue to reduce the risk for microvascular, as well as macrovascular complications (see \"Outputs/Outcomes \" table below). Reporting In addition to internal monitoring of the SDPI Grant Program, the DDTP has completed f ive SDPI Reports to Congress to document the progress made since 1997 . The SDPI Reports to Congress are as follows: January 2000 Interim Report to Congress on SDPI ; December 2004 Interim Report to Congress on SDPI ; 2007 SDPI Report to Congress: On the Path To A Healthier Future ; 2011 SDPI Report to Congress: Making Progress Toward A Healthier Future ; and 2014 SDPI Report to Congress: Changing the Course of Diabetes: Turning Hope into Reality.

IHS supports substance abuse treatment and prevention services as part of this mission. CJ - 239 METHODOLOGY The IHS includes the appropriation for Alcohol and Substance Abuse (excluding the amount designated as Adult Alcohol Treatment) and the portion of Urban Indian Health Program (UIHP) funds that partially come from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism programs transferred to the IHS under the UIHP budget. BUDGET SUMMARY In FY 2021 , IHS requests $ 118.0 million for its drug control activities . This is a de crease of $526,000 below the FY 2020 Enacted level. Alcohol and Substance Abuse FY 20 21 Request : $11 4.4 million In FY 2021, the IHS budget request for its drug control activities supports ONDCP funding priorities as well as the Strategy . The Strategy emphasizes the partnership between Federal agencies and their state, local, tribal, and international counterparts and reduce drug -induced mortality. IHS is also working with Federal partners to implement ONDCP's efforts to address the current opioid crisis and reduce the number of American's dying from dangerous drugs. The Administration's Office of National Drug Control Strategy guides and expands Federal government efforts to reduce the size of the drug-using population through 1) prevention and education, 2) increasing access to treatment services for those suffering from substance use disorder and 3) reducing the availability of dangerous drugs. The Administration's Strategy offers a valuable opportunity for IHS to advance its mission by strengthening existing programs to control and reduce substance use and eliminate its deleterious effects on the health and safety of AI/AN patients and communities. In FY 2021, IHS will continue to serve AI/ANs impacted by substance use disorders and dependence through IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian operated substance use disorder treatment and prevention programs and Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YR TCs). In addition to direct services, the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse grant and federal award program support s the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 to provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/AN communities and Goal 1 to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate services in the prevention, treatment and recovery of alcohol and substance use disorders. The IHS Division of Behavioral administers community -based grants that promote the use and development of evidence -based and practice-based models that represent culturally -appropriate prevention and treatment approaches to substance use from a community -driven context. In particular, the IHS Opioid Grant Program and the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention program (SASP) wi ll support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships and Objective 1.3 to increase access to quality health care services. IHS Opioid Grant Program: In FY 2019, IHS received $10 Million in fiscal year (FY) 2019 funding under the Special Behavioral Health Pilot Program (SBHPP) for American Indians and Alaska Natives to be targeted at opioid specific activities. In FY 2019, IHS held Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer to support the development of a grant program that will promote the documentation, and sharing of locally -designed, culturally -appropriate prevention, treatment, recovery, and aftercare services for mental health and substance use disorders in American Indian CJ - 240 and Alaska Native communities . A funding opportunity for the SBHPP will be released in FY2020. IHS Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention (SASP) : The SASP is a nationally -coordinated grant program, focuses on providing targeted substance abuse and suicide prevention and intervention resources to AI/AN communities with the greatest need for these programs. There is mutual development and implementation of the SASP, formerly known as the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative, with Tribes, Tribal programs, and other Federal agencies which now provides support to 175 IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health programs nationally. This initiative promotes the use and development of evidence -based programs (EBP) and practice- based models that represent culturally -appropriate prevention and treatment approaches to methamphetamine abuse and suicide prevention from a community -driven context. Data f rom FY 2017-2018 indicate that 93 percent of grantees reported use of an EBP, and 86 percent of grantees have integrated cultural services into project activities over 16,500 community members have been trained i n suicide and substance use prevention. IHS awarded 108 projects to Tribes, Tribal organizations, Urban Indian Organizations, and federal facilities under the MSPI (GenI Initiative) to promote early intervention strategies and implement positive youth programming aimed at reducing risk factors for suicidal behavior and substance abuse. Funded projects work with Native youth, up to and including age 24, on increasing access to prevention activities for youth to prevent methamphetamine use and other substance use disorders that contribute to suicida l behaviors, in culturally appropriate ways. All projects funded have a training objective to increase and expand the types of healthcare providers trained in SUD screening, assessment or treatment including Brief Intervention and Motivational Interviewin g and to hire additional behavioral health staff (i.e., licensed behavioral health providers and paraprofessionals, including but not limited to peer specialists, mental health technicians, and community health aides) specializing in child, adolescent, and family services who will be responsible for implementing project activities that address all of the required objectives listed. The IHS Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTCs) provide residential substance abuse and mental health treatment services to AI/AN youth. Congress authorized the establishment of these YRTCs in each of the 12 IHS Areas, with two (northern and southern) specifically authorized for the California Area. The YRTC in Northern California is expected to be operational in early 2020. The 12 currently funded YRTCs provide quality holistic behavioral health care for AI/AN adolescents that integrate traditional healing, spiritual values and cultural identification. In FY 2019 all federal YRTCs in operation 18 months or longer increased ha ve achieved accreditation status. Two YRTC facilities, Desert Sage and the Healing Lodge of the 7 Nations are in the last year of an after pilot project that focuses continued support for youth upon completion of program. This Aftercare pilot had an emphasis on developing culture -based treatment and aftercare services pilot programs within that prevent alcohol and substance abuse relapse among youth discharged. While evaluations are in place, current data indicates that these programs have resulted i n improved coordination around aftercare and case management, increased training of community supports for the adolescents, improved identification of transitional living, increased awareness of the use of social media, and improved follow -up with data col lection after discharge. This pilot program will continue to support YRTC's ability to support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate services in the prevention, treatment and recovery of alcohol and substance use di sorders. CJ - 241 The strategic goal is to support Tribal and Urban Indian programs in their continued substance use prevention, treatment, and infrastructure development. These efforts represent an innovative partnership with IHS to deliver services developed by the communities themselves, with a national support network for ongoing program development and evaluation. Substance use disorders continue to rank high on the concern list of Tribal partners. IHS believes that a shift in emphasis to earlier intervention is required to be successful in reducing the consequences of substance use disorders. IHS proposes focusing on early intervention with adolescents and young adults and preventing further progression by recognizing and responding to the source of the a buse. IHS promotes expanded health care services, such as mental and behavioral health treatment and prevention, by providing training on substance use disorders to IHS, Tribal, and UIOs at annual conferences, meetings, and webinars. Continuing medical education and Continuing Education Units are offered in these training opportunities provided to primary care providers. Patients treated for substance use disorder often present with a need to address co -occurring mental disorders. The IHS Division of Behavioral Health currently funds 12 grantees through the Behavioral Health Integration Initiative, a nationally -coordinated grant program that provides funding to Tribes, Tribal organizations, Urban Indian Organizations and federal facilities to plan, develop, implement and evaluate behavioral health integration with primary care. The grantees have focused on increased screening and early detection of mental health diagnoses, such as depression, anxiety and Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder. As a result of the funding, grantees are reporting an increase in access to care and increased coordination of care among providers. IHS encourages all healthcare providers to screen patients both at the time of consideration of use of chronic opioid therapy and periodi cally during active treatment. Screening surveys may be helpful to a clinician in determining the risk of aberrant drug behaviors and guiding the frequency of monitoring. Screening surveys could be incorporated into the triage/nurse screening process prior to seeing the clinician. Indian Health Service developed a Pain Management website: https://www.ihs.gov/painmanagement/substancescreening/ IHS continues to support the integration of substance use disorder treatment into primary care and emergency services through its activities to implement the Strategy . Integrating treatment services into outpatient primary care offers opportunities for healthcare providers to identify patients wit h substance use disorders, provide them with medical advice, help them understand the health risks and consequences, and refer patients with more severe substance use-related problems to treatment. 1 One integration activity is Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), which is an early intervention and treatment service for people with substance use disorders and those at risk of developing these disorders. IHS has increased efforts to implement the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) across IHS facilities as an evidence-based practice to identify patients with alcohol and/or substance related problems. In FY 2019 percent of AI/AN ages 9 -75 screened using SBIRT was 8.9 percent and this target was achieved with a final result of 14.9 percent screened. IHS promotes the use of this tool by training providers in clinical and community settings. SBIRT is intended to meet the public health goal of re ducing the harms and societal costs associated with risky use by reducing diseases, accidents, and injuries. SBIRT screens for all levels of substance use, not just dependency. As an additional resource, Indian Health Service 1 ONDCP. Integrating Treatment into Healthcare. Available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/integrating-treatment-and - healthcare. CJ - 242 developed an Alcohol and Subs tance Abuse Program webpage: https://www.ihs.gov/asap/providers/sbirt/ The IHS established a multi -disciplinary workgroup to form the IHS National Committee on Heroin, Opioids, and Pain Efforts (H OPE). The HOPE Committee is comprised of a multidisciplinary membership to include clinical representation from family medicine, pharmacy, behavioral health, nursing, pediatrics, physical therapy, and injury prevention. The HOPE Committee work plan supp orts the HHS 5 -Point Strategy to Combat the Opioid Crisis with a specific focus on 1) better pain management; 2) improving access to culturally relevant prevention, treatment, and recovery support services; 3) increasing availability and distribution of opioid overdose reversing drugs; and 4) improved public health data reporting and surveillance. Reducing the Number of Drug Overdose Deaths: The IHS has expanded access to harm reduction interventions that include increased access to the opioid overdose reversal medication, naloxone. Since 2015, the IHS has maintained an ongoing collaboration with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to train and provide naloxone to BIA Law Enforcement Officers (LEO) for responding to opioid overdoses. These initial effor ts have evolved into a robust harm reduction strategy that includes a combination of policy and workforce development efforts. In March 2018, the IHS implemented a policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 35) entitled Prescribing and Dispensing of Naloxone to First Responders to require IHS Federal pharmacies to provide naloxone to Tribal law enforcement agencies and other trained first responders. The IHS has also created a naloxone toolkit for tribal communities that includes a culturally responsive training video and a digital story from two Law Enforcement Officers involved in a naloxone 'save'. This toolkit also contains a train the trainer curriculum and standardized forms to support first responder initiatives. In November 2019, the IHS develo ped and released a health education video that shared best and promising practices surrounding naloxone distribution and the way IHS and the Red Lake Nation are responding to the opioid crisis. The IHS has further adapted the toolkit and strategy to equip community first responders and paraprofessionals with training on opioid overdose response and naloxone. These expanded collaborations with local law enforcement and community first responders resulted in an initial pilot community -health naloxone train-the -trainer program to include naloxone distribution. Ninety -six community -health workers completed training as naloxone trainers for their tribal communities in one week. Increase Mandatory Prescriber Education and Continuing Training on Best Practices and Current Clinical G uidelines: The IHS implemented the \"Chronic Non- Cancer Pain Management Policy\" to promote appropriate pain management as a primary prevention tool. In February 2018, IHS released a revised policy to include clinical practice guidelines contained in the 2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. This revised policy adopts the 2016 \"CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pa in\" and specifically requires IHS sites to establish and implement local chronic non-cancer pain protocols and procedures; requires prescribers to complete training on appropriate and effective use of controlled substance medications; and establishes the requirement to initiate opioid treatment as a shared decision between the prescriber and the patient to respect and support the patient's right to optimal pain assessment and management. CJ - 243 In August 2018, the IHS released its \"Dental Acute Pain Management Guideline\" for prescribing opioids for acute pain secondary to common general dentistry conditions and procedures. Guideline implementation, prescriber training, and evaluation are ongoing. The IHS has also implemented IHM Chapter 32 \"State Prescripti on Drug Monitoring Programs\" that establishes policy requirement for Federal facilities to participate with state -based Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP). Controlled substance prescribers working in IHS federal -government -operated facilities mu st query state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program databases prior to prescribing opioids for pain treatment longer than seven days and periodically throughout chronic pain treatment. To reduce barriers to nation-wide PDMP implementation and integration and data sharing efforts to improve interoperability of systems In FY 2019 IHS has developed and released software programming to automate controlled substance dispensing reports to state-based PDMPs to near real-time reporting to improve the fidelity of I HS dispensing data in state PDMP databases. The IHS has been in preliminary planning and design discussions to evaluate feasibility of PDMP interoperability into the IHS Electronic Health Record. These efforts supporting the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Obj ective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions. In March 2019, the IHS released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on American Indian/Alaska Native Pregnant Women and Women of Childbearing Age with Opioid Use Disorder developed in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Women's Health. This resource will help providers improve maternal participatio n in early prenatal care, improve screening for substance use disorder, and increase access to MAT for pregnant women and women of child -bearing age. The goal of these clinical recommendations is to foster relationships and improve awareness surrounding tr auma -informed approaches to maternal opioid use that may lead to recovery, hope, and healing. Additionally, the IHS and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Native American Child Health (CONACH) recently released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome that includes clinical recommendations on the prevention and management of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. These recommendations provide standards of care for screening, diagnosing, support, and treatment of pregnant mothers and infants affected by prenatal opioid exposure Proper Pain Management and Opioid Stewardship and Training: The IHS has created and released a comprehensive Opioid Stewardship workbook to assist sites with creating best practices surrounding safe opioid prescribing and increasing access to integrative pain treatments. The workbook emphasizes utilizing opioid surveillance strategies to evaluate population health outcomes, target opioid interventions, enhance clinical decision support, and create professional practice evaluation strategies. The IHS opioid stewardship program evaluation considers metrics that eval uate trends in Morphine Milligram Equivalents versus a restricted focus on total opioid prescription fills. The IHS has also created a robust workforce development strategy to include didactic training. In September 2019, the IHS launched its Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder Continuing Medical Education webinar series. The IHS has hosted learning sessions in this series that include buprenorphine prescribing in pregnancy as well as an auricular acupuncture -training program. Additional sessions are scheduled in FY 2020. The IHS has also recently facilitated dedicated access to tele-consultation services for IHS clinicians to receive on -demand substance use expert recommend ations and tailored clinical guidance for IHS healthcare providers of all CJ - 244 experience levels. This service is also av ailable to assist IHS health systems with creating clinic policies and procedures to support creation of integrated MAT services in IHS facilities. In May 2016, the IHS implemented a policy on mandatory opioid training requiring all federally controlled substance prescribers to complete the \"IHS Essential Training on Pain and Addiction\" with required refresher training every 3 years. This training is now available on demand with continuing medical educati on credits. The IHS released its Refresher training course in January 2018 , including four sessions of its mandatory five -hour training course for providers on proper opioid prescribing. In FY 2019, 302 new clinicians completed this course. The mandate also includes an additional refresher training after three years. In FY 2019, 7251 clinicians completed the Essential Training on Pain and Addiction Refresher course. In FY 2019, IHS provided three webinars that addressed pain management, opioids, and opi oid misuse with a total of 108 attendees. Opioid Use and the Adolescent Brain Initiating Buprenorphine as Medication Assisted Treatment for Pregnant Women with Opioid Use Disorder Medication Assisted Treatment -MAT In FY 2019 the IHS delivered live, instructor-lead, intensive pain management training course to include myofascial pain management techniques that includes half -and-half Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) waiver training. This course were offered in multiple IHS Areas and a total of 35 clinicians attended these trainings. The IHS is committed to increasing general health system employee knowledge surrounding opioids and plans to create additional training modules in FY 2019 with content focused on non -prescribing clinicians on the fundament als of pain management and safe opioid prescribing as well as training for community members on opioid safety initiatives. The IHS has also created a robust workforce development strategy to include didactic training. In September 2019, the IHS launched its Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder Continuing Medical Education webinar series. The IHS has hosted learning sessions in this series that include buprenorphine prescribing in pregnancy as well as an auricular acupuncture -training program. Addit ional sessions are scheduled in FY 2020. The IHS has also recently facilitated dedicated access to tele-consultation services for IHS clinicians to receive on -demand substance use expert recommend ations and tailored clinical guidance for IHS healthcare p roviders of all experience levels. This service is also av ailable to assist IHS health systems with creating clinic policies and procedures to support creation of integrated MAT services in IHS facilities. To provide ongoing clinical support for providers, IHS, in partnership with the University of New Mexico Pain Center, provides a weekly Chronic Pain and Opioid Management ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes). ECHO is a case-based learning model in which consultation is offered through virtual clinics to primary care clinicians by an expert team to share knowledge and elevate the level of specialty care available to patients. In FY 2019, 178 IHS, tribal, and urban clinicians participated in ECHO. The ECHO continues in FY 2020. In 2019, IHS hosted a webinar series for healthcare providers titled, Substance Use and the Adolescent Brain. The series provided educational lectures specifically related to understanding the impact of substances (Cannabis, Stimulants, Synthetic drugs, Inhalants, etc.) on the adolescent brain development and functioning. This series provided participants with psychosocial and evidence-based medication intervention strategies. The series included an overview of treatment CJ - 245 services and how to refer youth to the I HS and Tribal Youth Regional Treatment Centers, which address the ongoing issues of substance abuse and co -occurring disorders among American Indian and Alaska Native youth. The IHS collaborated in FY 2018 with the CDC to participate in the CDC Opioid Qu ality Improvement Collaborative to implement five opioid quality improvement measures at four IHS sites. Communication to employees and stakeholders involving best and promising practices and resources addressing pain management and addiction is achieved through our expanded internet presence. The IHS released a combined website for opioids in FY 2018 located at www.ihs.gov/opioids . Increasing Access to Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) Services: In June 2019, IHS released the Special General Memorandum Assuring Access to MAT that requires Federal Indian Health Service Facilities to create an action plan to identify or create local medication assisted treatment resources and coordinate patient access to these services when indicated. Key components of these approaches include enhanced screening and early identification of Opioid Use Disorders; improved care coordination and patient referral for treatment; and workforce development strategies to increase education and resources surrounding using medications in the support of recovery. In FY 2018, buprenorphine and suboxone became part of the IHS Core Formulary. Buprenorphine and suboxone are common medications used to treat opioid use disorder. Wit h these added to the Core Formulary, all IHS facilities with pharmacies have these medications readily available for their patients. Data related to buprenorphine and suboxone will be captured in reporting tools that will support regional -level efforts to better monitor MAT and SUD treatment across IHS. The Indian Health Service does face challenges in providing MAT in certain sectors within Indian Country. The rural and frontier nature of where American Indians/Alaska Natives live creates barriers to accessing health facilities. This is especially evident in Alaska where patients often only have access to a community health aide serving within a village-based clinic, hours away by plane from a larger health center. Additionally, IHS has felt the impact o f a declining supply of specific health professionals who could support the IHS workforce and address behavioral health needs. The IHS recognizes that telemedicine is one tool for increasing access to specialized medical services, such as MAT. The IHS h as published a policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 38) entitled Internet Eligible Controlled Substance Prescriber Designation to assure access to MAT using telemedicine models for remotely located Tribal members. In May 2019, IHS hosted a webinar for healthcare providers on Medication Assisted Treatment, which provided participants with training on how to recognize the signs/symptoms of different types of substance use disorders, and pharmacotherapy options to trea t substance use disorders. IHS hosted the 2019 IHS National Combined Councils Meeting, an agency wide meeting which provides opportunities for multidisciplinary collaboration focusing on the clinical and administrative needs of the agency. This year con tinuing education trainings were provided for healthcare providers, and session topics included: 1) Addressing the Opioid Crisis in Indian Country, 2) Exploring Best Practices in Chronic Pain Management, and 3) Evaluating Options for Creating and Sustainin g Integrated Primary Care Medication Assisted Treatment Models. IHS also provided a 4.25 hour training, titled \"Prescriber Data Waiver Training.\" This training session CJ - 246 assisted participants with meeting the SAMHSA and DEA requirements to apply for a DATA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder. Reducing Availability of Illicit and Dangerous Drugs : The IHS supports the safe and effective disposal of unused pharmaceuticals at the enterprise level through the provision of reverse distributor services at Federal pharmacies for unopened expired controlled substances. The agency has participated in interagency efforts to support proper collection and disposal of pain medications. I/T/U pharmacies have continued to enroll as DEA collectors and to participate in prescription drug disposal efforts. IHS collaborated with the State of North Dakota to achieve 100 percent of IHS sites in the state (both Federal and Tribal) to be registered as DEA collectors. In FY 2019, the IHS expanded patient level disposal through the addition of 29 Federal Pharmacy sites as registered DEA controlled substance collectors. This included funding for supplies and technical assistance with DEA requirements. On the IHS pain management website, I HS provides resources for tribal and urban Indian communities on Take -Back Event, Permanent Collection Sites, Mail-Back Programs and Environmentally Safe Options from Home. The website also has two sessions focused on safe storage of medications and medication disposal for providers on proper opioid disposal. https://www.ihs.gov/painmanagement/disposal/patientdisposal/ Increase Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Interoper ability and U sage: The IHS is working to improve public health data surveillance and reporting and has developed a data reporting system that will provide prescribing and diagnosis data on national, regional, and local levels. This will enable IHS to tra ck emerging trends, evaluate changes in prescribing practices, monitor overdose rates and emergency department utilization, and assess changes with access to MAT. The IHS will evaluate expanded partnerships and data-related resources with other Federal partners and Tribal Epidemiology Centers in FY 2019. These reporting and surveillance tools will strengthen IHS program management and operations by improving communication within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholde rs, and with the general public Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 1.1 Improve communication within the organization, Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public . The availability of community health workers (spec ifically Behavioral Health Aides) serving in AI/AN can create a robust peer recovery training program to equip and support peer recovery services. The new Behavioral Health Aid positions under the Community Health Aid Program (CHAP) has the potential to fi ll this need. The program includes building capacity for both peer recovery specialists and community health workers. Urban Indian Health Program - Alcohol and Substance Abuse Title V Grants FY 20 21 Request: $ 3.6 million The 41 Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) are an integral part of the Indian health care system and serve as resources to both tribal and urban communities. Urban Indians are often invisible in the urban setting and face unique challenges when accessing healthcare. A large proportion of Urban Indians live in or near poverty and face multiple barriers such as the lack of quality and culturally relevant health care services in cities. UIO s are an important support to Urban Indians CJ - 247 seeking to maintain their tribal values and c ultures and serve as a safety net for our urban patients. UIOs that offer inpatient and outpatient substance use disorder treatment have become reliable referral sites for Tribes and Urban Indians . In FY 20 21, IHS is proposing $3.6 million for the urban ONDCP budget. AI/AN people who live in urban centers present a unique morbidity and mortality profile. Urban AI/AN populations suffer disproportionately higher mortality from certain causes in sharp contrast to mainstream society. These unique challenges require a targeted response. Existing UIOs see their efforts in health education, health promotion, and disease prevention as essential to impacting the behavioral contributors to poor health 2: Alcohol -induced death rates are 2.8 times greater for urban AI/AN people than urban all races. Chronic liver disease death rates are 2.1 times greater for urban AI/AN people than urban all races. Accidents and external causes of death rates are 1.4 times greater for urban AI/AN people than urban all races. Alcoh ol and drug-related deaths continue to plague urban AI/ANs. Alcohol-induced mortality rates for urban AI/ANs are markedly higher than for urban all races. All regions, with the exception of eastern seaboard cities in the Nashville Area, show dramatically higher rates for urban AI/ANs than for urban all races who live in the same communities: the Billings Area is 4 times greater, the Phoenix Area is 6 times greater, the Tucson Area is 6.7 times greater, and the Great Plains Area has a 13.4 times greater al cohol -induced rate of mortality. 3 Urban AI/AN populations are more likely to engage in health risk behaviors. Urban AI/ANs are more likely to report heavy or binge drinking than all -race populations and urban AI/ANs are 1.7 times more likely to smoke cigarettes. Urban AI/ANs more often view themselves in poor or only fair health status, with 22.6 percent reporting fair/poor health as compared to 14.7 percent of all races reporting as fair/poor. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is a term used to describe a range of effects that can occur in someone whose mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders include disorders such as fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol -related neuro developmental disorder, and alcohol -related birth defects. Interventions are needed in urban centers to address prevention efforts for urban AI/ANs with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The IHS policy on conferring with UIOs identifies fetal alcohol spectrum disorders as a provision that requires the IHS to confer with UIOs \"to develop and implement culturally sensitive assessment and diagnostic tools including dysmorphology clinics and multidisciplinary fetal alcohol spectrum disorders clinics for use in Indian communities and urban centers.\" Heavy drinking during pregnancy can cause significant birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading and most preventable cause of intellectual disability. The rates of fetal alcohol syndrome are higher among AI/ANs than the gen eral population. Screening with intervention has been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol misuse in pregnancy and to reduce the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome. 2 Indian Health Service, Report to Congress: New Needs Assessment of the Urban Indian Health Program and the Communities it Services at 10 (Mar. 31, 2016) (hereinafter New Needs Assessment), available at https://www.ihs.gov/urban/includes/themes/newihstheme/display_objects/documents/ReportToCongressUrbanNeedsAssessment.pdf . 3 Ibid. CJ - 248 The UIOs emphasize integrating behavioral health, health education, health promotion and disease prevention into primary care offered within a culturally appropriate framework, which leads to positive outcomes for urban AI/ANs. Urban AI/ANs in need of substance use disorder treatment commonly exhibit co-occurring disorders. UIOs have recognized the need for more mental health and substance use disorder counselors to adequately address the needs presented by AI/ANs with co -occurring disorders. Stakeholders reported the need for more age and gender - appropriate resources for substance use disorder outpatient and residential treatment. While male AI/ANs can encounter wait times for treatment admission up to six months, treatment options for youth, women, and women with children can be greater than six months. Some of the most successful AI/AN treatment programs for youth, women, and women with children are administered by UIOs. Affecting lifestyle changes among urban AI/AN families requires a culturally sensitive approach. UIOs have operated culturally appropriate initiatives to reduce health risk factors. The continued efforts of UIOs to target behavioral or lifestyle changes offer the best hope for impacting the major health challenges of the urban AI/AN population. The IHS has contracts and grants with 41 UIOs to provide health care and referral services for Urban Indians in 22 states. These IHS contracts and grants with UIOs address the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by ensuring that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people. Awarding of these contracts and grants to UIOs also addresses HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.3, to reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prev ention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support . UIOs provide high quality, culturally relevant prevention, early intervention, outpatient and residential substance abuse treatment services, and recovery support to address the unmet needs of t he Urban Indian communit ies they serve. Social determinants of health play a key role in health and wellness and UIOs are addressing a range of factors which contribute to improved health outcomes. According to the most recent urban Indian data , more than 75,000 AI/AN patients access services through UIO programs. Also, UIOs perform more than 650,000 visits for AI/AN patients including medical, dental, behavioral health, other professional and enabling services directly or by paid referra l. Data also indicates that members from 540 of the 574 (94 percent) federal ly recognized tribes accessed services from at least one of the 41 UIOs. In FY 2019, t he IHS Office of Urban Indian Health Programs awarded 4 -in-1 grants to 33 U IOs. The grantees are awarded for a three -year funding cycle from April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2022. These grants provide funding to U IOs to make health care services more accessible for AI/ANs residing in urban areas. Funding is used to support four health program areas: health promotion and disease prevention services; immunization services; alcohol and substance abuse related services; and mental health services. Grantees are required to participate in a national evaluation of the 4-in -1 grant program , which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization. The national evaluation includes reporting on the cultural interventions integrated into the 4 -in-1 program a ctivities, and practice based and evidence based approaches that are implemented or modified to meet the needs of the Urban Indian service population. These grants expand safe, high quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, whi ch meets HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2. CJ - 249 PERFORMANCE Information regarding the performance of the drug control efforts of IHS are based on agency GPRA/ GPRAMA documents and other information that measure the agency's contribution to the Strategy. In FY 202 1, the IHS will t rack the number of unique patients receiving office -based MAT (buprenorphine and naltrexone) within the Indian Healthcare System. The IHS will continue to track the number of naloxone prescriptions as part of efforts to increase access to naloxone. The table and accompanying text below represent highlights of IHS achievements during FY 2018 , the latest year for which data are available. The selected performance measures reported in the table provide targets and resu lts from both Tribally Operated Health Programs and Federally Administered Health Programs. Indian Health Service Selected Measures of Performance FY 2019 Target FY 2019 Achieved \u00bb Universal alcohol screening \u00bb Accreditation rate for Youth Regional Treatment Centers in operation 18 months or more \u00bb Report on number of emergency department patients who receive SUD intervention \u00bb Report on number of SUD services in 133,210 40.7% comprehensive routine screening, IHS retired the alcohol screening measure for female patients and expanded the new alcohol screening measure to include all patients 9 through 75 years of age. The FY 2019 universal alcohol screening target of 37 percent was met with final results achieving 40.7 percent screened. The accreditation measure for YRTCs reflects an evaluation of the quality of care associated with accreditation status by either The Joint Commission, the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), state certification, or regional Tribal health authority certification. For youth with substance use disorders, the YRTCs provide invaluable treatment services. In FY 2019, all YRTCs in operation 18 months or longer achieved accreditation status. The IHS monitors two program measures on the number of substance use disorder (SUD) encounters provided in emergency departments and primary care clinics. The final results for the FY 2019 number of SUD encounters provided in emergency department was 46,272 while SUD enco unters provided in primary care clinics totaled 142,040. In addition, starting in FY 2017, IHS tracked overall substance use disorder encounters provided in all clinical settings across the health system to aid in promoting integrated substance use disorder services. The final results for FY 2019 SUD intervention services provided across all IHS clinics was 657,402 encounters.

N/A CJ - 256 Modernization of the Public -Facing Digital Services 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act On Dec. 20, 2018, President Trump signed the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA), which requires data -driven, user -centric website and digital services modernization, website consolidation, and website design consistency in all Executive Agencies . Departments across the federal landscape are beginning to implement innovative digital communications approaches to increase efficiency and cr eate more effective relationships with their intended audiences . The American public expects instant and impactful communications - desired, trusted content available when they want it, where they want it, and in the format they want it . If the consumer is not satisfied they move on and our opportunity for impact is lost. Modernization Efforts In FY 2019 HHS engaged Department leadership and developed a Digital Communications Strategy that aligns with the requirements of IDEA. As the result of a compre hensive review of costs associated with website development, maintenance, and their measures of effectiveness, HHS will prioritize: modernization needs of websites, including providing unique digital communications services , and develop estimated costs for achieving performance metrics. Over the next five years HHS will continue to implement IDEA by focusing extensively on a user -centric, Digital First approach to both external and internal communications and developing performance standards. HHS will fo cus on training, hiring, and tools that drive the communication culture change necessary to successfully implement IDEA. Over the next year, HHS Agencies and Offices will work together to continue to implement IDEA and the HHS Digital Communications Strat egy across all communications products and platforms.

In addition, the agencies should determine if it would be appropriate to designate a lead agency in this effort. Concur NA In Progress In March 2018, GAO informed the Indian Health Service (IHS) that in order to close this recommendation the implementation plan must be finalized by the interagency workgroup. The implementation plan will require additional review by the full workgroup before the workgroup will be able to finalize the plan. The implementation plan is still in final draft, which is under review by the workgroup led by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). IHS provided additional feedback to HUD regarding the final draft implementation plan in July 2018. In June 2019, IHS contacted HUD the IHS Principal Deputy Director sent a letter to the HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Native American Programs requesting a status update on HUD actions to move the workgroup forward to finalize the plan. At this time, no additional meetings have been scheduled by the workgroup. IH S has raised the issue of Native American housing with the HHS Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs to make it a priority moving forward. GAO - 15-588 Buy Indian Act: Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Services Need Greater Insight into Implementation of Regional Offices 7/9/2015 To ensure consistent implementation of the Buy Indian Act procurement authority across the agencies and to enhance oversight of implementation of the Act at regional offices, the Secretaries of the Interior and Health and Human Services should direct the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service respectively, to clarify and codify their policies related to the priority for use of the Buy Indian Act, including whether the Buy Indian Act should be used before other set -aside programs. Concur NA In Progress The Indian Health Service is in the process of developing new policy guidance related to the Buy Indian Act. The draft rule is currently pending publication for comment in the Federal Register. CJ - 261GAO - 15-588 Buy Indian Act: Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Services Need Greater Insight into Implementation of Regional Offices 7/9/2015 To ensure consistent implementation of the Buy Indian Act procurement authority across the agencies and to enhance oversight of implementation of the Act at regional offices, the Secretaries of the Interior and Health and Human Services should direct the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service respectively, to collect data on regional offices' implementation of key requirements , such as challenges to self -certification. Concur NA In Progress Once the Indian Health Service (IHS) has promulgated its new Buy Indian policy, which is currently pending publication for comment in the Federal Register, the IHS will revisit how to collect data on regional/area offices' implementation of key policy requirements, including monitoring authentication of contractor credentials. GAO - 16-333 Indian Health Service: Actions Needed to Improve Oversight of Patient Wait Times 4/28/2016 The Secretary of HHS should direct the Director of IHS to monitor patient wait times in its federally operated facilities and ensure corrective actions are taken when standards are not met . Concur NA In Progress On June 12, 2019, the Indian Health Service (IHS) released a new wait time standard for Emergency Departments (ED) and updated the standard for primary care visits in IHS direct care facilities (IHS Circular No. 19 -02 and No. 19 - 03). IHS is implementing systems to facilitate monitoring and oversight for both sets of standards. IHS anticipates requesting GAO close this recommendation as implemented by the end of 2019. GAO - 17-181 Indian Health Service: Actions Needed to Improve Oversight of Quality of Care 1/9/2017 To help ensure that quality care is provided to AI/AN people, as part of the implementation of its quality framework, the Secretary of HHS should direct the Director of IHS to ensure that agency -wide standards for the quality of care provided in its federally operated facilities are developed, that facility performance in meeting these standards is systematically monitored over time, and that enhancements are made to its adverse event reporting system. Concur NA In Progress In July 2019, the Indian Health Service (IHS) requested GAO close this recommendation as implemented. GAO provided feedback that once the new IHS adverse event reporting system is fully implemented across the agency they will be ready to close this recommendation. IHS anticipates full implementation by the end of March 2020. GAO - 18-309 Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure: Opportunities Exist to Enhance Federal Agency Needs Assessment and Coordination on Tribal Projects 6/14/2018 The Director of IHS should implement a targeted, resource- efficient method to identify additional eligible Indian homes that may have existing deficiencies to include in IHS's Home Inventory Tracking System (HITS). Concur NA In Progress The Indian Health Service (IHS) Headquarters office of Sanitation Facilities Construction (SFC) Program issued a memo in August 2018 to IHS Area SFC Directors, directing them to leverage the annual sanitation needs data gathering and reporting period to work collaboratively with tribes to identify additional eligible Indian homes with deficiencies that can be included in HITS. IHS anticipates requesting GAO close this recommendation as implemented by the end of 2019. CJ - 262GAO - 18-309 Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure: Opportunities Exist to Enhance Federal Agency Needs Assessment and Coordination on Tribal Projects 6/14/2018 The Director of IHS should implement a mechanism to indicate in HITS whether each home with a deficiency level of 0 has been assessed. Concur NA In Progress The Indian Health Ser vice is implementing a new mechanism to indicate in HITS when a home currently classified with a deficiency level (DL) of 0 has been assessed. IHS anticipates requesting GAO close this recommendation as implemented by the end of 2019. GAO - 18-309 Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure: Opportunities Exist to Enhance Federal Agency Needs Assessment and Coordination on Tribal Projects 6/14/2018 The Director of IHS should reassess the point distribution across the Sanitation Deficiency System scoring factors as part of its program guidelines update, in light of trade- offs between funding projects that address the most severe sanitation deficiencies and projects that meet other needs. Concur NA In Progress The Indian Health Service (IHS) invited tribes t o provide comments on whether the priority ranking scoring system appropriately meets the needs of Tribal communities. IHS received comments from Tribes and Tribal organizations echoing GAO's recommendation to assess the scoring weights and consider revisions that provide more weight for projects that address high deficiency level needs. Based on these responses, the IHS Sanitations Facilities Construction Program implemented scoring changes in the updated Sanitation Deficiency System Guide released in September 2019. IHS anticipates requesting GAO close this recommendation as implemented by the end of 2019. GAO - 18-309 Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure: Opportunities Exist to Enhance Federal Agency Needs Assessment and Coordination on Tribal Projects 6/14/2018 The Director of IHS, in cooperation with other members of the tribal infrastructure task force, should review the 2011 task force report and identify and implement additional actions to help increase the task force's collaboration at the national level. Concur NA In Progress In March 2019, the Indian Health Service shared with the Infrastructure Task Force (ITF), led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a table summarizing comments/actions taken in response to the 2011 task forc e report in addition to the remaining challenges associated with implementing the recommended actions. Further discussion and action with the ITF is needed. GAO - 18-309 Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure: Opportunities Exist to Enhance Federal Agency Needs Assessment and Coordination on Tribal Projects 6/14/2018 The Director of IHS, in cooperation with other members of the tribal infrastructure task force, should direct IHS area offices to identify and pursue additional mechanisms to increase their collaboration. Concur NA In Progress The Indian Health Service (IHS) hosted on May 1, 2019, a joint face to face meeting with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to discuss areas for increased collaboration. The meeting included representatives from the IHS Area Offices, EPA HQ and EPA Regions. During the meeting there was discussion on data sharing, best practices for identifying sanitation facilities projects for joint funding collaboration, and report outs on progress made with managing interagency agreement close outs. In May 2019, IHS requested GAO close this recommendation as implemented. GAO responded that IHS reported activities only satisfied a portion of the recommendation and that IHS needs to show increased collaboration with other IT F agencies CJ - 263as well. GAO - 18-580 Indian Health Service: Agency Faces Ongoing Challenges Filling Provider Vacancies 8/15/2018 The Director of IHS should obtain, on an agency -wide basis, information on temporary provider contractors, including their associated cost and number of full -time equivalents, and use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing. Concur NA In Progress Challenges in rolling -up contractor inf ormation on a national level stem from the fact that the Indian Health Service (IHS) often uses single contract vehicles, such as staffing companies, to hire multiple providers for temporary periods of time. IHS contract databases do not centrally track th e numbers of individual providers through such staffing contracts. The ability to analyze and compare detailed actual costs of federal hires vs. contract hires is currently limited to local information sources and on a narrow area of focus, such as one provider category or one facility at a time. IHS is implementing a monthly reporting requirement to IHS Areas and plans to use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing.

The Committee directs IHS to examine its existing processes and determine what changes are needed to develop and manage an advance ap propriation and report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act on the processes needed and whether additional Congressional authority is required in order to develop the processes. (p. 114). Action taken or to be taken : IHS is committed to working together and with Congress to examine its processes and procedures needed to ascertain the potential benefits and challenges of managing an advance appropriation. Current Services. \u2014The recommendation includes an increase of $81,333,000 for fixed cost increases, $20,830,000 above the budget request. The Committee directs IHS to submit the full estimated costs for current services based on the prior enacted level to the Committee each year at the same time IHS submits its annual budget justification. (p. 114). Action taken or to be taken : The FY 2021 Congressional funding request for Current Services is $42,440,000. 105(l) Leases. -The recommendation includes $53,000,000 for section 105(l) lease costs, $17,000,000 above the enacted level and $42,000,000 above the budget request. These funds are to supplement existing funds available for operational costs at Village Built Clinics and tribal clinics operated under an Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act compact or contract where health care is delivered in space acquired through a full- service lease. The Committee directs IHS to consider whether costs associated with these leases should be a separate line item in the budget and funded in the same manner as contract support costs and repo rt its determination to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Additionally, the Committee directs IHS to submit the estimated amounts for the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year estimate at the same time the budget request is submitted. (p. 115). Action taken or to be taken : Funding for leases under the ISDEAA Section 105(l) program is proposed to be an indefinite discretionary appropriation and is moved from the Hospitals and Health Clinics line item to this new appropriation in the amount of $101,000,000. Accreditation Emergencies. -The recommendation includes $58,000,000, as requested, to assist IHS- operated facilities that have been terminated or received notice of termination from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare program while under operation by the IHS. Funding shall be allocated to such facilities in amounts to: restore compliance; supplement purchased/referred care, including transportation, in the event of temporary closure of such facility or one or more of its CJ - 269 departments; and compensate for third-party collection shortfalls resulting from being out of compliance. Primary consideration should be given to facilities that have been without certification the longest. Shortfalls shall be calculated relative to the average of the collections in each of the two fiscal years preceding the year in which an agreement with CMS was terminated or put on notice of termination. Until all facilities have obtained CMS cert ification, the Committee rejects the proposal to allow these funds to be used for other purposes. The Committee is concerned about financial losses from loss of CMS accreditation or of the requirement to divert patients at Service -operated facilities. The Committee considers the loss or imminent loss of accreditation to be an emergency. Funds allocated to a facility may be made available to Tribes newly assuming operation of such facilities pursuant to the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (P.L. 93-638) and shall be used by such Tribes to cover the following: replacement of third party revenues lost as a result of decertification, replacement of third -party carryover funds expended to respond to decertification, and reasonable c osts of achieving recertification, including recruitment costs necessary to stabilize staffing. Additionally, the Committee urges IHS to develop new strategies to improve how IHS programs, including those operated by Tribes under the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (P.L. 93-638), can be supported to avoid these challenges and to refocus on both the quality of health care delivery and the improvement in health outcomes for, and health status of, Indian health program beneficiaries. This requires full Tribal consultation and the participation of the Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and State Medicaid and S -CHIP programs. (p. 115-116). Action taken or to be taken : In 2016 the IHS established the Quality Framework to address Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS Hospital certification and accreditation failures in serval IHS hospitals. By FY2019 most of the elements of the Q uality Framework were either implemented with work on optimization in progress. In FY 2019 IHS establish the IHS Strategic Plan which assumed the elements of the Quality Framework and focused IHS programs and activities on improving quality, safety, and sustained compliance across the IHS healthcare system. IHS established and filled the Deputy Director for Healthcare Quality position and established the Office of Quality (OQ) to guide the implementation of the IHS Strategic Plan and IHS priorities for he althcare quality and safety. In FY 2019, IHS establish an education course to educate staff on quality improvement science and methods theory and application to increase quality improvement capacity across the IHS healthcare system. The OQ began implement ing a Quality Assurance (QA) program to program consultation and training to IHS staff on CMS regulations and accreditation standards; implemented a credentialing and privileging software in all IHS healthcare facilities and are currently optimizing the sy stem; and purchased a replacement Adverse Events Reporting software and successfully pilot tested the system in three IHS facilities with anticipated implementation for all IHS facilities in February 2020. The OQ worked in collaboration with the IHS Chief Medical Officer, the Office of Information Technology, and IHS Area Offices to establish primary and emergency department wait time measures. The result of this work, in FY 2018 and 2019, 41 surveys in IHS Hospitals and Health Centers have been conducted by CMS, the Joint Commission, (TJC) or the Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). The surveys resulted in compliance with CMS CoP and ongoing certification or full accreditation by TJC or AAAHC. Additionally, 25 of IHS hospitals an d Health Centers received designation by either TJC or AAAHC. CJ - 270 Electronic Health Records. -The recommendation includes $25,000,000, as requested, to improve the current IT infrastructure system in order to support the deployment of a new or modernized Electronic Health Records solution. The bill includes language prohibiting IHS from obligating or expending funds to select or implement a new IT infrastructure system unless IHS notifies the Committee at least 90 days before such funds are obligated or expended. The Committee expects IHS to include in the notification: (1) The criteria being used to select a new IT infrastructure system; (2) whether and how the new system will be interoperable with the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) new electronic health record system; and (3) the total projected cost for the modernization and the number of years required to implement the new system. Additionally, the Committee urges IHS to review the VA's new electronic health record system and determine whether that system, in whole or in part, may be feasible for IHS and tribally operated facilities. IHS should also compare the cost of adopting the VA system, in whole or in part, to an entirely new system and report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act on any additional costs required to modify the VA system to IHS and tribal needs, as well as any cost savings that may occur by adopting the new VA system, in whole or in part. Finally, the Committee encourages IHS to work with other Federal agenc ies to find funding to upgrade network bandwidth at hospitals, health centers, and health stations. (p. 116-117). Action taken or to be taken : The final bill included $8 million to support the IHS modernization effort. IHS in the process of reworking the project plan and deliverables to adjust from $25 million over 12 months to $8 million over 8 months due to the change in final funding and length of the CR. Initial activities will include the creation a project governance body and a project man agement office to support the project. IHS does not plan to select a new system with the $8 million provided and does not anticipate notification until October 1, 2020, or upon a final 2021 budget enacted with additional funds to support the procurement process. The planning in 2020 will allow IHS to support the requested information in the notification. IHS will continue to document outreach to other federal agencies such as the VA, DOD, FCC, CMS, ONC, and OMB. Electronic Dental Records .\u2014The Committee applauds the Service for successfully installing an electronic dental record (EDR) system. The Committee understands that 240 dental centers have been brought into the system. With sufficient continued funding for maintenance and computer enhancements, the EDR could allow dentists and pharmacists to communicate directly about opioid prescriptions for oral pain. This will be a vital addition for addressing the opioid crisis in Indian Country. Within the amounts requested, the Committee in cludes $2,500,000 to enable the Service to complete the implementation process for 10 dental centers and manage the current electronic dental record system. The Committee also understands that the Service is currently evaluating the electronic health records system to examine the needs of the program. The Committee directs the Service to include EDR in its assessment and incorporate EDR in overall efforts to enhance the electronic health records system. (p. 117). Action taken or to be taken : Since 2008, the IHS has implemented the IHS version of the Dentrix Electronic Dental Record (EDR) system to more than 240 IHS dental clinics (Federal/Tribal/and Urban). After Tribal shares have been allocated from the $2.5M, the remaining funds would be directed towards implementing EDR at the 10 non-EDR equipped IHS dental clinics currently in the implementation queue. Any remaining funds would be used for planning / developing greater data / information exchange between the IHS [medical] Electronic Health Record (EHR) system and the EDR system. IHS is already planning for updating its overall Health Information Technology (HIT) platform and the existing IHS EDR system is actively CJ - 271 discussed and engaged in the current HIT update dialogue. Development of improved connectivity between the existing EDR, (RPMS -based) EHR system and the Health and Human Services (HHS) data repositories will be planned to ensure their functionality beyond the eventual IHS EHR HIT modernization development and implementation. Indian Health Care Improvement Act. -It has been over nine years since the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), yet many of the provisions in the law remain unfunded. Tribes have specifically requested that priori ty areas for funding focus on diabetes treatment and prevention, behavioral health, and health professions. The Committee requests that the Service provide, no later than 90 days after enactment, a detailed plan with specific dollars identified to fully fu nd and implement the IHCIA. (p. 119). Action taken or to be taken : A comprehensive plan, including dollar amounts would require significantly more time than the 90 days allotted in the report. Maternal and Child Health. -The Committee encourages IHS to establish a pilot program to determine the most effective ways to: (1) educate IHS health care providers on how to evaluate risk factors that could interfere with successfully meeting breastfeeding goals; (2) provide necessary support to AI/AN mothers to prevent or address delayed initiation of milk production during the critical period immediately following birth; and (3) provide support to AI/AN mothers to help them understand the benefits of long- term breastfeeding and improve clinically recommended rates, particularly when they return to work. The Committee also directs IHS, where possible and within scope of agency authority, to encourage breastfeeding support recommendations within the workplace which encourage job retention. (p. 119). Action taken or to be taken : The IHS participates in the Baby -Friendly Hospital Initiative to support breastfeeding. All IHS fe deral facilities that provide route obstetric delivery services have been designated Baby -Friendly, with re - designation occurring every 5 years. In 2019, five IHS federal facilities completed, or are in the process of, re-designation. Designation includes provision of staff education on risk factors that could interfere with breastfeeding as well as education and support to AI/AN mothers to prevent or address delayed initiation of milk production following birth, and to help them understand the benefits of long- term breastfeeding. To educate and assist staff in supporting breastfeeding breastfeeding, including a link to this toolkit, was highlighted in August 2019 as part of National Breastfeeding Month. https://www.ihs.gov/newsroom/announcements/2019-announcements/august- is-national - breastfeeding -month/ In 2020, the IHS will begin development of a culturally appropriate educational handbook/app for AI/AN women to promote healthy pregnancies, which will include breastfeeding advice, tips, support and education. The IHS has encouraged public health nurses (PHN) to obtain International Board of Lactation Consultant certifications and to provide lactation education and support during prenatal and post-partum public health nursing visits. This postpartum support can assist in improving breastfeeding rates, including when women return to work. The first PHN program to be 100 percent certified is expected in Oct ober 2020. Since 2017 the IHS Lactation Support Program has supported American Indian and Alaska Native women, infants, children, and families by allowing women who choose to breastfeed to express or pump CJ - 272 breast milk at work for a period of one year after returning to work . https://www.ihs.gov/ihm/pc/part - 4/p4c7/ Green Infrastructure. -The Committee includes $10,000,000 to incorporate planning, design, and operations of buildings to reduce costs, minimize environmental impacts, use renewab le energy and incorporate green infrastructure and the most current energy efficiency codes and standards to the maximum extent practicable. The Committee directs IHS to submit a report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act explaining how it proposes to use the funds provided for green infrastructure and renewable energy. (p. 120). Action taken or to be taken : IHS intends to purchase and install renewable energy collection equipment (e.g. photo voltaic panels) at existing healthcare facilities. Facilities will be chosen at a later date based on engineering considerations. CJ - 273 INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FY 2021 CONGRESSIONAL JUSTIFICATION Senate Report 116-123 Significant Items Village Built Clinics . -The Committee has provided resources for village built clinics [VBCs] leasing costs and other associated leasing costs. The Committee is aware the Service has testified that these resources are being used not only to pay for the traditional VBCs but also for new costs relating to litigation which requires that section 105( l) of the Indian Self- Determination Act (Public 114 Law 93-638) mandates payment of leasing costs when Tribal facilities are used to operate IHS programs. The Committee has not included proposed language in this recommendation for the 105(l) costs but does believe these costs should be accounted for separately in the fiscal year 2021 budget request from those funded needed for village built clinics. (p. 113-114). Action taken or to be taken : Funding for leases under ISDEAA Section 105(l) is proposed to be an indefinite discretionary appropriation and is moved from the Hospitals and Health Clinics line item to this new appropriation. Alcohol and Substance Abuse. - The recommendation includes $247,828,000 for alcohol and substance abuse programs, an increase of $2,262,000 above the enacted level. The bill also continues $10,000,000 for opioid abuse and is described below. The bill retains increases provided in previous fiscal years of $6,500,000 for the Generation Indigenous initiative; $1,800,000 for the youth pilot project; and $2,000,000 to fund essential detoxification related services as provided herein. The Committee has continued bill language which allocates $2,000,000 to continue funding for essential detoxification and related services provided by the Service's public and private partners to IHS beneficiaries and expects these funds to be allocated in a manner consistent with previous years. The Service is directed to report to the Committee within 60 days of enactment of this act regarding distribution of these funds. The Service shall continue its partnership with Na'Nizhoozhi Center in Gallup, N.M., and work with the Center and other Federal, State, local, and Tribal partners to develop a sustainable model for clinical capacity, as provided by the statement to accompany Public Law 115-31. (P .115). The Committee is concerned that alcohol and opioid use disorders continue to be some of the most severe public health and safety problems facing American Indian and Alaska Native [AI/AN] individuals, families, and communities. To address this problem, the Committee continues to direct IHS to increase its support for culturally competent preventive, educational, and treatment services programs and partner with academic institutions with established AI/AN training and health professions programs to research and promote culturally responsive care. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Service to employ the full spectrum of medication assisted treatments [MAT] for alcohol and opioid use disorders, including non- narcotic treatment options that a re less subject to diversion combined with counseling services. (P .115). Action taken or to be taken: In the 2017 Senate Appropriations Committee Report 114-281, the Committee directed IHS to \"allocate $2,000,000 of the increase provided for the alcohol and substance abuse program to fund essential detoxification and related services.\" Specifically, in the report the number of alcohol related deaths in the community of Gallup, New Mexico was addressed with the report CJ - 274 stating, \"these deaths underscore the urgent need for substance abuse treatment, residential services and detoxification services\" in this community. In response, the IHS used the increased appropriated funds provided to address this urgent need in the city of Gallup, New Mexico. In addition to Gallup, New Mexico, IHS was aware of the urgent need for alcohol detoxification services in the Great Plains Area after the removal of liquor licenses in White Clay, Nebraska, leading to the potential for increased mortality if services were unavailab le for alcohol detoxification. As a result, funds were also made available to address this urgent need. The funds provided to Gallup, New Mexico and the Great Plains Area (specifically the Oglala Sioux Tribe) to address the need for social detox services were made available in FY 2017 through a competitive cooperative agreement. The funding announcement was released in FY 2017 and two projects were selected and funded. The project period is for 5 years and will run from September 15, 2017, to September 14, 2022. In FY 2019, the Gallup site has been able to support admission of approximately 30,000 clients in their social detoxification program ; with the majority of those clients males; the services expanded through this work include increased coordinati on to safe housing and transportation services with the Emergency Department. Finally , a contract with the Gallup Police Department was establish ed and provides transport ation services to the detoxification center. The Great Plains' site , has used funding to implement a recovery support coach model to provide additional services for follow- up care and treatment compliance. These funds also supported increase coordination with behavioral health programs, provided additional screenings and brief interventions to individuals incarcerated in jails, and serve as an immediate placement for individuals who are in need of treatment services following detoxification. In fact, of the nearly 1,000 unique clients served in this program, 851 alcohol and drug assessments were completed to identify an appropriate level of care. In June 2019, IHS released the Special General Memorandum Assuring Access to MAT that requires Federal Indian Health Service Facilities to create an action plan to identify or create local medication assisted treatment resources and coordinate patient access to these services when indicated. Key components of these approaches include enhanced screening and early identification of Opioid Use Disorders; improved care coordination and patient referral for treatment; and workforce development strategies to increase education and resources surrounding using medications in the support of re covery. The Indian Health Service does face challenges in providing MAT in certain sectors within Indian Country. The rural and frontier nature of where American Indians/Alaska Natives live creates barriers to accessing health facilities. This is especially evident in Alaska where patients often only have access to a community health aide serving within a village- based clinic, hours away by plane from a larger health center. Additionally, IHS has felt the impact of a declining supply of specific health pr ofessionals who could support the IHS workforce and address behavioral health needs. The IHS recognizes that telemedicine is one tool for increasing access to specialized medical services, such as MAT. The IHS has published a policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 38) entitled Internet Eligible Controlled Substance Prescriber Designation to assure access to MAT using telemedicine models for remotely located Tribal members. The IHS has also created a robust workforce development strategy to include didactic training. In September 2019, the IHS launched its Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder Continuing Medical Education webinar series. The IHS has hosted learning sessions in this series that include buprenorphine prescribing in pregnanc y as well as an auricular acupuncture- training program. Additional sessions are scheduled in FY20. The IHS has also recently facilitated dedicated access to tele- consultation services for IHS clinicians to receive on -demand substance use expert recommendations and tailored clinical guidance for IHS healthcare providers of all experience levels. This service is also available to assist IHS health systems with creating clinic policies and procedures to support creation of integrated MAT services in IHS facilities. I n 2019, CJ - 275 IHS also provided a 4.25 hour training, titled \"Prescriber Data Waiver Training.\" This training session assisted participants with meeting the SAMHSA and DEA requirements to apply for a DATA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine in the trea tment of opioid use disorder. To provide ongoing clinical support for providers, IHS, in partnership with the University of New Mexico Pain Center, provides a weekly Chronic Pain and Opioid Management ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes). ECHO is a case-based learning model in which consultation is offered through virtual clinics to primary care clinicians by an expert team to share knowledge and elevate the level of specialty care available to patients. In FY 2019, 178 IHS, tribal, and ur ban clinicians participated in ECHO. The ECHO continues in FY 2020. IHS Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention (SASP) : The SASP is a nation ally-coordinated grant program that focuses on providing targeted substance abuse and suicide prevention and intervention resources to AI/AN communities with the greatest need for these programs. There is mutual development and implementation of the SASP, formerly known as the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative, with Tribes, Tribal programs, and other Federal agencies which now provides support to 175 IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health programs nationally. This initiative promotes the use and development of evidence-based programs (EBP) and practice- based models that represent culturally -appropriate prevention and treatment approaches to methamphetamine abuse and suicide prevention from a community -driven context. Data from FY 2017-2018 indicate that 93 percent of grantees reported use of an EBP, and 86 percent of grantees have integrated cultural se rvices into project activities over 16,500 community members have been trained in suicide and substance use prevention. IHS will focus on establishing academic partnerships that can provide evaluation of culturally - informed behavioral health services. Currently, IHS, Division of Behavioral Health has partnerships with academic institutes to support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 Objective 1.1 to recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent and caring workforce . IHS will work with tribal communiti es, especially SASP grantees, to encourage collaborative efforts that support documentation and sharing of successful interventions that have integrated cultural and traditional practices into evidence-based programs. Opioid Grants. - To better combat the opioid epidemic, the Committee has continued funding of $10,000,000 and instructs the Service, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Abuse, to use the funds provided to continue a Special Behavioral Health Pilot Pro gram as authorized by Public Law 116-6. The Director of IHS, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, shall award grants for providing services, provide technical assistance to grantees under this section collect, a nd evaluate performance of the program. (p. 116). Action taken or to be taken: IHS initiated tribal consultation and urban confer on June 17, 2019 regarding the development of an IHS Opioid Grant Pilot Program to distribute the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 opioid funding. T he open comment period closed on September 3, 2019 and IHS received 119 comments from representatives of all 12 IHS areas . In the immediate future, IHS plans to issue a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) in the spring of 2020, taking into consideration the recommendations submitted from the Tribal Consultation and Confer. Objectives, eligibility criteria, and allocation details will be outlined in the NOFO. Alth ough the language specifies the use of the SDPI program as a model for funding distribution, the total of $10,000,000 limits the application of the SDPI model to effectively address and target services at the opioid epidemic. CJ - 276 Prescription Drug Monitorin g. -The Committee is concerned that IHS and tribally operated health facilities are not participating in State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and emergency department information exchanges. The Committee strongly encourages these facilities to part icipate in these programs. Accordingly, within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Service shall provide the Committee with a report outlining by State such facilities that are participating and those that are not, and any issues preventing facilities from uploading data to these programs or exchanges. (p. 117). Action taken or to be taken: The IHS has also implemented IHM Chapter 32 \"State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs\" that establishes policy requirement for Federal facilities to participate w ith state -based Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP). Controlled substance prescribers working in IHS federal -government -operated facilities must query state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program databases prior to prescribing opioids for pain treatment longer than seven days and periodically throughout chronic pain treatment. To reduce barriers to nation- wide PDMP implementation and integration and data sharing efforts to improve interoperability of systems In FY 2019 IHS has developed and released software programming to automate controlled substance dispensing reports to state- based PDMPs to near real -time reporting to improve the fidelity of IHS dispensing data in state PDMP databases. The IHS has been in preliminary planning and design discuss ions to evaluate feasibility of PDMP interoperability into the IHS Electronic Health Record. These efforts supporting the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions. IHS Facilities are configured to report to PDMPs in all federal facilities except one in Nebraska. Reporting to PDMPs is required by IHS's policy on State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (Chapter 32) of the Indian Health Manual. 82 out of 83 facilities with pharmacies participate in state PDMPs. 17 out of 18 States that have an IHS facility with a pharmacy are coordinating with state PDMPs. Exception: Nebraska An MOA has been submitted to the state of N ebraska to have access, and we are awai ting approval.

Because the cost of vaccines for children < 19 years of age is covered by the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program , only the costs for vaccine administration, which are not covered by the VFC program, are included for this age group. Vaccine administration fees were based on an average of the CMS Maximum Regional Charges for vaccine administration , multiplied by the number of doses of vaccine routinely recommended for each age group ( e.g., 25 total vaccine doses for children 2 yrs ). Estimated immunization expenditures include projected costs for routine, on -schedule immunization s among core patient demographic groups based on current age -appropriate immu nization schedules . Other individuals outsi de these core patient group s may be regular recipients o f immunizations (e.g., health care workers; patients at specific increased risk for certain vaccine -preventable diseases).

Costs for monitoring of immunization coverage were also included and represent a 3.9 percent increase over the FY 20 20 estimate : FY 2017 Estimated Costs = FY 201 6 cost plus 3.7 percent FY 201 8 Estimated Costs = FY 201 7 cost plus 3.9 percent FY 201 9 Estimated Costs = FY 201 8 cost plus 3. 9 percent FY 20 20 Estimated Costs = FY 201 9 cost plus 1.0 percent FY 20 21 Estimated Costs = FY 20 20 cost plus 3.9 percent For FY 2021, $101,348, 400 is estimated for vaccine costs, and $ 143,984 for immunization monitoring costs, for a total of $101,492,384 estimated for all immunization expenditures. This represents a $19,904,498 increase from the FY 20 20 estimate attributable to enhanced stratification of age groups that captures additional patients receiving immunizations, changes in recommendatio ns including expanded age ranges for select vaccines (e.g., Zoster, HPV), changes in vaccine costs, shifting population sizes among age categories targeted for immunization , and progress towards immunization coverage goa ls aligned with Healthy People 2020 targets (i.e., fewer individuals still needing vaccination which translates to reduced forecasted costs) .

CJ - 282 FISCAL YEAR 2021 DHHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Contractibility of IHS Facilities by Unanimous Resolutions Proposal : Ensure Indian Health Service (IHS) health care facilities serving more than one Tribe may be contracted or compacted by an eligible Tribe or Tribal Organization (T/TO) only if approved through Tribal resolution by all Tribes primarily benefitting from th e IHS health care facility. Current Law : The Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) enables T/TOs to contract or compact for IHS -operated health programs or portions thereof. In instances where an IHS facility serves more than on e Tribe, each Tribe could contract for its share of that program. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5321(a)(1), 5324(i)(1). This would create a division wherein part(s) of the program is/are carried out by one T/TO and part(s) of it is/are carried out by IHS or the other T /TO. Alternately, a T/TO may contract/compact for a greater portion of the program if it obtains supporting Tribal resolutions from one or more of the other Tribes served by that facility. See, e.g. , 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304(l), 5381(b); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 900.8(d). Rationale : When programs in one facility must be divided, it creates a myriad of practical issues. It also inevitably reduces the scope of the overall program due to a reduction in economies of scale. For example, if an IHS -operated health care facility p redominantly serves two Tribes and the IHS receives an ISDEAA proposal to assume one -half of the programs at the facility, the IHS must consider how the division of health care services would affect health care to eligible members, particularly if the Trib e that wants to contract does not want to serve the Tribe that did not provide a resolution to contract on its behalf. Problems include, but are not limited to: 1) Whether and how to operate two separate health programs in the same facility (they may be required to operate as two separate and distinct legal entities, with separate entrances, waiting rooms, privileging, credentialing, billing arrangements, Medicare enrollment requirements, accreditations, etc.); 2) How to divide the space and/or how to pay for new space (perhaps through section 105( l) lease funding or contract support costs (CSC)) for one of the programs; 3) How to divide equipment and/or how to pay for new equipment (perhaps through CSC funding) for one of the programs; 4) How to ensure the contrac ting T/TO follows IHS's \"Open Door\" Policy, which would require it to provide services to members of the other Tribe without receiving funding associated with those patients; and 5) What to do if all beneficiaries choose one program over the other (even thou gh the funding has been split). Budget Impact : None Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 283 FISCAL YEAR 2021 DHHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Elevating the IHS Director to Assistant Secretary of Indian Health Proposal : Amend Federal law to designate the Director of the Indian Health Service (IHS) to be a reference to the Assistant Secretary of Indian Health. Current Law : The IHS was established by statute as an agency of the Department of Health and Human Service (HH S) and is headed by a Director whose position was established by the same law. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1661. Rationale : The IHS is the principal federal health care provider and health advocate for American Indian and Alaska Native people, and its mission is to rais e their health status to the highest level. IHS was established to carry out the responsibilities, authorities, and functions of the United States, as provided in Federal statute or treaties, to provide health care services to Indians and Indian tribes. In carrying out such responsibilities, the IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of 57 4 federally recognized tribes in 37 states. Elevating the position of Director to Assistant Secretary would enable the head of IHS to more effectively carry out the government's health care responsibilities to Indians, bring greater access and collaboration among the sister agencies, HHS offices and the Public Health Ser vice on matters concerning Indian health, and emphasize the work being done throughout HHS to meet the Secretary's Priorities as they relate to American Indians and Alaska Natives. In addition, memorializing the Director as an Assistant Secretary in 25 U.S .C. \u00a7 1661 would bolster the statutory framework of IHS, which would help to show that IHS exists in statute, independent from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law No. 111 -148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010). Budget Impact : None. Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 284 FISCAL YEAR 2021 HHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Medicare Extend Medicare Telehealth S ervices for IHS and Tribal F acilities Proposal: Permit all Indian Health Service (IHS) and Tribal facilities to bill Medicare for telehealth services under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) when they host a Medicare beneficiary who receives telehealth from a distant provider, even if the facility does not meet the requirements for being located i n certain rural or shortage areas. Dis tant care p hysicians and practitioners providing telehealth care to a beneficiary located in an IHS or Tribal facility , regardless of their location in another state , would be able to bill Medicare for their services, so long as they otherwise meet Medicar e eligibility requirements. Payment to the IHS and Tribal facilities for telehealth care would align with existing Medicare PFS reimbursement, which includes a flat fee to the originating site and applicable reimbursement for the service provided by the e ligible physician or practitioner at a distant site. Current Policy : Currently, Medicare covers some telehealth services, but does not expressly cover telehealth services provided across state lines. Telehealth practitioners in the IHS system are often located in a different state from the patient and are not licensed, registered, or subject to the law of the state where the patient is located and receiving such services. Under section 1834(m) of the Social Security Act, Medicare pays the dista nt site for the physician service and the originating site a facility fee, but the originating site must meet certain requirements, which some IHS sites do not meet. Rationale : The Snyder Act and the I ndian Health Care Improvement Act provide broad authority for IHS and tribal health programs to operate telehealth programs, including the provision of telehealth services between originating and distant sites that operate across state lines. Explicitly au thorizing IHS and tribal health programs to receive applicable Medicare reimbursement when telehealth services are provided across state lines will accommodate the unique structures and federal authorities that allow IHS and tribal health programs to operate across state lines and without regard to state licensure requirements. Federal law exempts tribal employees and health programs from in -state licensure requirements. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621t and 1647a, respectively. Because state laws are generally inapplicable to such programs, IHS and tribal health programs are in a unique position to implement telehealth programs that operate across state lines in any number of ways that are not curre ntly recognized or reimbursed by Medicare. While this gives IHS and tribal health programs gre ater flexibility to operate telehealth programs to serve patients living in remote areas, it does not guarantee that the program will be reimbursed for such services if a patient is covered by Medicare. Budget Impact : None. Effective Date : Upon enactment. Key Information : As a general principle of law, state laws are inapplicable to federal employees and federal contractors performing within the scope of their duties. The Supreme Court held in Miller v. Arkansas , 352 U.S.187 (1956), that a state may not require a federal contractor to be licensed by the state as a precondition of being able to perform under a federal contract. Accordingly, state licensure laws are inapplicable to federal contractors in performance of their duties. These legal prin ciples apply to federal health care practitioners. See Taylor v. United States , 821 F.2d 1428, 1431 (9th Cir. 1987); see also Lucas v. United States , 807 F.2d 414 (5th Cir. 1986). CJ - 285 FISCAL YEAR 2021 HHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service To Authorize the Indian Health Service to Establish Concurrent Federal and State Jurisdiction at IHS Federal Enclave Property Proposal : Amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) to authorize the Indian Health Service (IHS) to establish concurrent federal and state jurisdiction at IHS federal enclave property by adding a new subsection (3) to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1661(d). Problem: IHS is an independent landholding agency and owns approximately fourteen properties, such as hospitals in Claremore, Oklahoma and Winslow, Arizona, under exclusive federal jurisdiction due to the land's status as \"federal enclave\" property. Since federal crimi nal law applies to the exclusion of state law at these locations, the property is often left without a response by nearby first responders with law enforcement authority because they lack criminal jurisdiction. Rationale : This is problematic for IHS in a variety of ways related to community safety, opioid abuse, and law enforcement. Some locations have been hampered by threats and assaults on patients, health care providers, and staff, while other locations have experienced drug -related crime. Also, when IHS patients are in need of mental health and substance abuse services that IHS is unable to provide, the lack of concurrent jurisdiction means that patients are not able to access state benefits such as transport by state law enforcement to non -IHS facili ties for examination, emergency detention, protective custody, and inpatient services. Last, the lack of response by first responders affects retention of health care providers, who are vulnerable to the threats and assaults by patients and visitors to the facilities. While IHS has worked creatively with federal and state law enforcement officials to develop partial patchwork fixes at these locations, legislation is necessary to resolve the problem. Prior IHS interactions with Congress on this issue have r esulted in a recommendation that IHS and other stakeholders develop an administrative, rather than legislative, solution. In a few cases, an administrative solution can be achieved (for example, cross -deputization agreements); however, in most cases, a leg islative solution is required. Some Tribes and local governments in some locations may be reluctant to embrace cessation of exclusive federal jurisdiction. A discretionary authority -authorizing IHS to cede authority where it determines doing so is neces sary -would give IHS the ability to interface with these stakeholders FY 2021 to develop the best solution on a case -by-case basis, while respecting the sovereignty of Tribal, state, and local governments. Federal law authorizes concurrent State -Federal jurisdiction for numerous agencies including Veterans Administration; Departments of Defense, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior (Fish and Wildlife, Park Service); NASA; and General Services Administration (on easements). It is an accepted remedy for addressi ng issues faced by federal agencies in similar jurisdictional situations. A detailed list of examples is provided below. The proposal has direct bearing on the Presidential initiative to address the opioid epidemic. Due to the opioid epidemic, and the ill egal drug epidemic generally, the lack of security at IHS facilities and the lack of response by first responders to these facilities has become a great concern for the Agency. Providing IHS with another tool to curb drug diversion and ensure physical secu rity for its patients and providers at its facilities would further the Presidential initiative. CJ - 286 Budget Impact : None. Effective Date: Upon enactment. Locations of Potential Use: Claremore, OK and Winslow, AZ. Both of these locations are federal enclave properties with little access to federal law enforcement agencies, but located in municipalities with state and local law enforcement nearby. 911 calls from these locations are directed to local law enforcement agencies with no criminal jurisdiction on fac ility grounds. The Claremore facility is federally owned and operated. The Winslow facility is federally owned but contracted by Winslow Indian Health Care Center, a tribal organization operating under an Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act compact. Examples of Federal Laws authorizing concurrent state -federal jurisdiction: Department of Veterans Affairs - 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 8112 The Secretary, on behalf of the United States, may relinquish to the State in which any lands or interests therei n under the supervision or control of the Secretary are situated, such measure of legislative jurisdiction over such lands or interests as is necessary to establish concurrent jurisdiction between the Federal Government and the State concerned. Such partia l relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction shall be initiated by filing a notice thereof with the Governor of the State concerned, or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the laws of such State, and shall take effect upon acceptance by such State . Department of Defense - 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2683(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary concerned may, whenever he considers it desirable, relinquish to a State, or to a Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, all or part of the legislative jurisdiction of the United States over lands or interests under his control in that State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession. Relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction under this section may be accomplished (1) by filing with the Governor (or, if none exists, with the chief executive officer) of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession concerned a notice of relinquishment to take effect upon acceptance thereof, or (2) as the laws of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession may otherwise provide. Department of Agriculture - 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2268 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Agriculture may, whenever he considers it desirable, relinquish to a State all or part of the legislative juri sdiction of the United States over lands or interests under his control in that State. Relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction under this section may be accomplished (1) by filing with the Governor of the State concerned a notice of relinquishment to ta ke effect upon acceptance thereof, or (2) as the laws of the State may otherwise provide. CJ - 287 FISCAL YEAR 2021 DHHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) Coverage for Urban Indian Organizations Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS) requests approval of the proposal to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) to provide Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) coverage to IHS -funded Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) in the same manner as Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) contractors and mandate that all medical malpractice claims and judgments be paid from the Department of Treasury's Judgment Fund. This amendment would cover medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and behavior al health counseling related health care services including ancillary services provided to eligible Urban American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) pursuant to grants and contracts awarded by the IHS, as authorized by 25 U.S.C. Subchapter IV - Health Ser vices for Urban Indians of the IHCIA. Current Law : It is well settled law that Congress must specifically authorize, in statute, the extension of federal tort coverage to certain groups or individuals. Currently, federal law extends FTCA coverage to ISDE AA contractors' employees and personal services contractors. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321(d). Federal law does not provide tort liability coverage for injuries to Urban AI/AN patients that result from health care services provided by UIOs with IHS funds. Rationale : The IHS enters into limited, competing contracts and grants with forty -one (41) 501(c)(3) non - profit organizations to provide health care and referral services for Urban Indians throughout the United States. UIOs are defined by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(29) as a no nprofit corporate body situated in an urban center, governed by an Urban Indian controlled board of directors, and providing for the maximum participation of all interested Indian groups and individuals, which body is capable of legally cooperating with ot her public and private entities for the purpose of performing the activities described in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(a). UIOs define their scope of work and services based upon the service population, health status, and documented unmet needs of the Urban Indian com munity they serve. In calendar year 2017, 35 UIOs provided 653,614 health care visits for 75,194 Urban Indians, who do not have access to the resources offered through IHS or tribally operated health care facilities because they do not live on or near a reservation. This does not include six UIOs that provide residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment programs and that did not report. UIOs are evaluated in accordance with the IHCIA, as amended, at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1655. The IHS UIO On - Site Review M anual is used to conduct annual onsite reviews of the IHS -funded UIOs to monitor compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation contractual requirements that are established through legislation. Currently, UIOs are seeking or maintaining accreditation from several health care accreditation organizations, including the Joint Commission (JC), Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare (AAAHC), Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), and National Committee for Quality Assuranc e (NCQA). Some UIOs have also achieved recognition as Patient Centered Medical Homes (PCMH), with additional UIOs currently working towards PCMH recognition, as well as AAAHC accreditation. UIOs are expending scarce resources to purchase malpractice insu rance, when those resources could be better utilized to expand services available to Urban AI/AN patients. The rising cost of medical malpractice insurance and the general cost of providing health care services adversely impact the ability of UIOs to provi de needed services. As a result, certain kinds of staff and health services, such as dental services, have been substantially reduced or eliminated. UIOs are an integral part of the IHS health care CJ - 288 system and they provide high quality, culturally relevant health care services and are often the only health care providers accessible to Urban AI/AN patients. Amending the IHCIA to extend FTCA coverage to IHS -funded UIOs would be consistent with the current and long -standing policy of providing FTCA coverage f or other providers in the IHS health care system that provide services to AI/AN, the IHS, and Tribal facilities. The extension of FTCA coverage under this provision would be limited to services provided to Urban AI/AN patients who are eligible for services under the IHCIA and would not cover services to other individuals, which would need to be covered by other resources, such as private malpractice insurance maintained by the UIO or FTCA coverage already provided under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233(g) -(n) to Health Cent er Program grantees that obtain deemed employee status for purposes of FTCA coverage for those activities. Currently, seven IHS -funded UIOs are also Health Center Program grantees that have obtained deemed employee status for purposes of FTCA coverage for the activities provided under that grant, but the FTCA coverage does not extend to activities performed under their contracts/grants from IHS. The IHS -funded UIO is distinct from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) federal community h ealth center (CHC) program. For example, the IHS -funded UIOs are much smaller in terms of the size of the population served. Therefore, the level of FTCA claims that might arise in relation to the IHS-funded UIOs is not expected to rise to the level of FTC A claims associated with the Health Center Program. If Congress were to authorize settlement payments and judgments be paid from the Judgment Fund, as they are for IHS and tribal contractors, there would be no direct impact on the IHS budget. In the 11 5th Congress, the bills H.R. 5874 and S. 1250 included a section that provided liability protections to employees of IHS UIOs. The Urban AI/AN population is often invisible in the urban setting and faces unique challenges when accessing health care services. There is also a lack of sufficient data on Urban AI/AN health care issues. UIOs are an important support to Urban AI/AN fami lies and individuals seeking to maintain their values and ties with each other and with their tribal cultures. UIOs provide a wide range of programs that serve as a safety net to Urban AI/AN children and families. To address these challenges and meet the g rowing needs of this diverse Urban AI/AN population, UIOs need to recruit and hire more providers. Extending FTCA coverage to UIOs in the same manner as ISDEAA contractors will provide additional funding for health care services, increase the ability of UI Os to attract and recruit highly qualified clinicians by removing the high cost of medical liability insurance as a hindrance, and ultimately, improve and expand health care services available to Urban AI/AN patients. Budget Impact : None Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 289 FISCAL YEAR 2021 HHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Provide Federal Tort Claim Act (FTCA) Coverage for Persons Volunteering their Services at the Indian Health Service Hospitals and Clinics and in Authorized Community Settings Proposal : To amend the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233) to provide Federal Tort Claim Act (FTCA) coverage for persons volunteering their services at the Indian Health Service (IHS) hospitals and clinics, and in authorized com munity settings where IHS services are being provided. Current Law : It is well settled law that only Congress may authorize FTCA coverage because it is a limited waiver of the federal government's sovereign immunity. FTCA is the exclusive remedy for acts of malpractice and other negligence committed by commissioned officers or employees of the Public Health Service (PHS). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233. Currently, federal law does not provide FTCA coverage for volunteers providing services at IHS hospitals and cli nics, or in authorized community settings. This is despite the fact that federal law allows volunteers to be used in the operation of a PHS health care facility. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 217b. Rationale : To ensure FTCA coverage of volunteers at IHS hospitals and clinics, and in authorized community settings, federal law at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233 should be amended to specifically include coverage of volunteers under the FTCA. Should such coverage be extended, IHS volunteers would be considered federal employees only for F TCA purposes. Providing FTCA coverage has the potential to help IHS address significant health care provider shortages in IHS hospitals and clinics by increasing the number of health care providers available to treat IHS beneficiaries. It will also enabl e IHS to expand access to care by facilitating health care delivery in authorized community settings. The proposal is expected to improve the ability of the IHS to attract and recruit highly qualified volunteers by removing the high cost of medical liabili ty insurance as a hindrance. Budget Impact: None Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 290 FISCAL YEAR 2021 DHHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Waiver of Indian Preference Proposal : Amend 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5117 to authorize the HHS Secretary to waive Indian Preference laws, and issue related regulations, applicable to IHS positions that fall under specific conditions in order to fill positions in cases where the Secretary determines there is an urgent staffing crisis or chronic persistent vacancies in health professions. Problem : In August 2018, GAO reported that the IHS had a 25 percent vacancy rate for providers, including physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants (GAO -18-580). This equates to over 1,400 current vacancies in IHS in these health professions. Long -standing vacancies have a negative effect on patient access, qu ality of care, and employee morale. IHS needs additional flexibilities to rapidly address chronic staffing needs. While extremely important, Indian Preference sometimes impacts the Agency's ability to hire highly competent personnel for essential provider or facility Chief Executive Officer (CEO) positions (e.g., in circumstances when an Indian Preference candidate is only qualified at the most basic level, or where an Indian Preference candidate has poor references, a record of disciplinary issues in Feder al employment, or both). Allowing the HHS Secretary to waive Indian Preference under specific circumstances, as proposed , may help to mitigate the persistent vacancies experienced across the Agency for providers and CEOs. Rationale : The proposal would al low the HHS Secretary to grant a waiver of the application of Indian Preference laws without the written waiver now required at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5117(c) from concerned tribal organizations, for any personnel action involving filling a vacant position at an IHS service unit in which 15 percent or more of the total positions or specific health profession positions in the service unit are not filled by a full -time employee of the IHS for a period of 6 months or longer. This flexibility will help IHS expedite recrui tment and hiring for critical provider positions or a CEO position at any facility that is not able to fill vacancies for an extended period of time under the Indian Preference laws. Also, it can be impractical to obtain a Tribal waiver, as is currently re quired, at locations where an IHS facility serves multiple Tribes, for example the IHS Rapid City Service Unit. The IHS will provide the Secretary adequate justification for the waiver when a situation at a facility meets the criteria. Budget Impact : IHS currently uses temporary contractors, at 2 -3 times the cost of federal staff, to fill vacancies. If the proposal is approved, there could be a significant cost savings as federal employees and commissioned officers would be used instead of contracted pers onnel. Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 291 FISCAL YEAR 2021 DHHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service ISDEAA Section 105( l) Lease Authority Proposal : To provide a new appropriation account for the IHS with a lease prospectus requirement for compensation provided to a Tribe or Tribal organization for a lease under section 105( l) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA). Current Law : The Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324( l), also referred to as section 10 5(l), requires the IHS to enter a cost agreement, or \"lease,\" with a Tribe or Tribal organization for reasonable costs associated with a facility used by the Tribe in support of its tribally operated ISDEAA contract or compact. A 2016 Federal Court's decis ion (Maniilaq Association v. Burwell , 170 F. Supp. 3d 243 (D.D.C. 2016)) prohibits IHS from capping funding under section 105( l) at the level that IHS would have otherwise spent to operate a facility if it were carrying out the Federal health programs. Sin ce IHS receives funds for operational expenses through the lump -sum \"Indian Health Services\" (Services) appropriation account, the entire Services account is legally available and required to be used for funding the mandatory ISDEAA leases. Tribes had neve r before asserted such a mandatory entitlement to section 105( l) during the first twenty years that the law was in effect. Rationale : IHS does not have a dedicated funding source to pay for ISDEAA section 105 (l) leases . Due to IHS's lump -sum Services app ropriation, IHS will continue to be forced to divert increasing amounts of resources from direct health care services to pay for 105( l) leases. Since the IHS cannot reduce the amount of funds provided to Tribes and Tribal organizations through existing ISDEAA contracts and compacts, the only funds remaining available for reprogramming are those intended for the IHS -operated health servic es for non -contracting/compacting Tribes. A new indefinite discretionary appropriation for section 105 (l) leases would ensure that IHS could fund the lease costs without impacting the other Services budgets and programs. Adding a facility size and leas e prospectus requirement to a new section 105( l) appropriation account would impose a Congressional approval requirement for costly section 105( l) leases supporting major medical facilities. Leases up to 40,000 square feet, the typical size of a health cen ter, would continue to be funded up to the amount appropriated by Congress. A prospectus requirement is common among agencies with independent leasing authority and is necessary and appropriate for the purposes of mitigating unfettered Federal real propert y acquisition and engaging Congress in its fiscal accountability and oversight roles Budget Impact : An estimated $101 million in FY 2021. Approval and implementation of this discretionary proposal would mitigate the need for congressional reprogramming r equests and protect resources allocated for direct health services. Personnel Requirements : Approval and implementation of this discretionary proposal may generate a need for additional staff to process increasing 105( l) lease proposals and agreements. S ince FY 2017, when the first leases were negotiated, existing IHS staff have processed 105( l) lease proposals as collateral duties. As the number of proposals increases, additional staff would be needed to ensure appropriate and timely review, evaluation, and negotiation of proposals. Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 292 FISCAL YEAR 2021 HHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Meet Loan Repayment/Scholarship Service Obligations on a Half -Time Basis Proposal : Permit both Indian Health Service (IHS) scholarship and loan repayment recipients to fulfill service obligations through half -time clinical practice, under authority similar to that now available to the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program (LRP) and Scholarship Program. Authority similar to Section 331(i) of the Public Health Service Act would allow IHS loan repayment and scholarship recipients more options and flexibility to satisfy their service obligations through half -time clinical work (a minimum of 20 hours per week) for double the amount of service time (e.g., clinician who works 20 hours a week performing clinical duties with a two -year service obligation would increase to a four -year service obligation) or to accept half t he amount of loan repayment award in exchange for a two-year service obligation. This would provide parity with NHSC programs and enable IHS to make better use of these tools to recruit and retain key professionals in a highly competitive environment. Current Law : Sections 104 and 108 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act require employees who receive IHS scholarships or loan repayments to provide clinical services on a full -time basis. Section 331(i) of the Public Health Service Act was amended by \u00a7 10501(n) of the Affordable Care Act to permit certain NHSC loan repayment and scholarship recipients to satisfy their service obligations through half - time clinical practice for double the amount of time or, for NHSC loan repayment recipients, to accept half the loan repayment award amount in exchange for a two -year service obligation. Section 331(j) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 254d(j)) defines \"full-time\" clinical practice as a minimum of 40 hours per week, for a minimum of 45 weeks per year. It also defines \"half -time\" as a minimum of 20 hours per week (not to exceed 39 hours per week), for a minimum of 45 weeks per year. Rationale : The IHS, as a rural healthcare provider, has difficulty recruiting and retaining healthcare professiona ls. Recruiting physicians and other primary care clinicians has been especially challenging. Permit ting IHS scholarship and loan repayment health professional employees to fulfill their service obligations through half -time clinical practice for double th e amount of time and to offer half the loan repayment award amount in exchange for a two -year service obligation could increase the number of providers interested in serving in the Indian health system. Additional half -time direct care employees could also reduce the number and cost of Purchased/Referred Care program referrals, especially at sites that do not need full -time specialty care services. There are also a number of smaller rural IHS sites where clinicians will be able to provide a minimum of half -time clinical services with the remainder of their time devoted to much needed administrative/management responsibilities. This proposal will provide flexibility for providers who might not otherwise consider service in IHS by allowing part -time practice in IHS to coincide with a part -time private practice, as well as part -time practice in IHS combined with part-time administrative duties within the IHS. The NHSA was authorized to establish a demonstration project permitting loan repayment recipients to meet their service obligations through less than full -time clinical service in response to requests from clinicians and sites. The Affordable Care Act replaced this demonstration with permanent authority for two specific kinds of NHSC options (described abo ve under Current Law). The IHS is equally concerned with the requests from clinicians and prospective candidates for loan repayment awards for half -time service by clinicians. Having similar authority as the NHSC would increase the ability for the IHS to recruit and retain healthcare clinicians to provide primary healthcare and specialty services (e.g., Surgery, OG/GYN, Psychiatry, Radiology, and Anesthesiology) and otherwise support the IHS and HHS priorities. CJ - 293 The ability to provide scholarship and loan repayment awards for half -time clinical service would make these recruitment and retention tools more flexible and cost -effective, providing incentives for an additional pool of clinicians and other medical providers that otherwise may not consider a commi tment to the IHS federal, Tribal and Urban Indian sites. Having similar authority as the NHSC would increase the ability for the IHS to recruit and retain healthcare clinicians to provide primary healthcare and specialty services and otherwise support the IHS and HHS priorities. Budget Impact : This is a budget related and discretionary proposal. Direct hire medical staff costs are lower than the costs to hire temporary, contractor staff. Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 294 FISCAL YEAR 2021 DHHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Subsequent Adjustment of ISDEAA Funding in Unique Circumstances Proposa l: Allow the Indian Health Service (IHS) to reduce an Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) contractor's or compactor's ISDEAA funding in subsequent years if an increase in the contractor/compactor's funding was made pursuant to a statutory or regulatory \"deemed approved\" provision. Current Law : The ISDEAA provides that the Secretary is directed to enter into ISDEAA contracts (under Title I of the ISDEAA) or compacts (under Title V of the ISDEAA) upon the request of any Tribe or Tribal organization (T/TO) for its share of IHS programs, services, functions, and activities. Under Title I, once a contract proposal is received by the IHS, unless an extension is awarded by the proposed contractor, the Agency has ninety days to \"approve the proposal and award the contract\" or decline the proposal under five limited statutory criteria. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321(a)(2)(A) -(E). The implementing regulations provide that if the proposal is not declined within the ninety days, it is \"deemed approved\". 2 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 900.18 ; Seneca Nation of Indians v. Nashville Area Chief Contracting Officer, Indian Health Service , IBIA 12 -041 (June 30, 2016); see also Navajo of Interior , 852 F.3d 1124 (D.D.C. 2017). Conversely, under Title V, the par ties may continue to negotiate with no statutory limitation. However, if the parties reach impasse on an issue, the proposed compactor may submit a \"final offer\". 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 a \"final offer\" received by the IHS, the Agency must either acce pt the final offer or reject it based on four limited rejection criteria within forty -five days. Id. at (b), (c). \"In the absence of a timely rejection of the offer . . . [it] shall be deemed agreed to by the Secretary.\" Id. at (b). The effect of these pro visions is that, if IHS misses the statutory or regulatory deadline, the proposal or final offer, no matter how inequitable or incorrect the proposed funding may be, will be \"deemed approved\". Additionally, the ISDEAA at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5325(b) (referred to as \"the reductions clause\") provides that funding required by subsection (a) \"shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to\" the following: (A) a reduction in appropriations from the previous fiscal year for the program or function to be contracted; (B) a directive in the statement of the managers accompanying a conference report on an appropriation bill or continuing resolution; (C) a tribal authorization; (D) a change in the amount of pass -through funds needed unde r a contract; or (E) completion of a contracted project, activity, or program The effect of the reductions clause, when read together with the statutory and regulatory deadline provisions, is that IHS is prohibited from reducing any \"deemed approved\" fu nding made due to a missed deadline in subsequent years, resulting in a possible windfall to those contractors/compactors in perpetuity. For example, a contractor who receives $7 million annually could propose an increase of $15 million, and IHS would be required to pay that amount in perpetuity, should the IHS fail to decline by the 90 -day deadline. This issue cannot be addressed through either negotiated rulemaking or internal Agency policy. As explained above, the \"deemed approved\" provision is found in the ISDEAA's implementing regulations for Title I contracts and in the ISDEAA itself for Title V compacts. Therefore, while negotiated rulemaking may be able to address the issue on the Title I side, it would not solve the problem on the CJ - 295 Title V side. In addition, it is unlikely that the Tribes would agree to this change through negotiated rulemaking or tribal consultation. With regards to the implementation of Agency policy and internal safeguards to prevent missing deadlines, IHS currently works diligently to track the deadlines and has already implemented internal safeguards to limit the concern. However, there are actual logistical issues that impact IHS's ability in this regard. Neither the ISDEAA nor the regulations provide what constitutes a proposal under Title I or who may accept a proposal. This results in uncertainty as to whether any commu nication from a T/TO, written or verbal, given to any IHS staff member at any location could constitute a proposal starting the ninety - day clock. Additionally, much of the work that goes into negotiating a contract under the ISDEAA takes a significant amou nt of time. For example, in negotiating leases under section 105( l) of the ISDEAA, the required assessment of the operating expenses is impossible to complete within the ninety days allotted by the statute. While the IHS may request an extension to this timeline, the contractor/compactor has sole discretion as to whether or not to grant the extension. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321(a)(2). Rationale : Providing the authority for the IHS to reduce ISDEAA funding in subsequent years, for that portion of increased funding that was awarded as a result of missing a statutory or regulatory deadline, would ensure the Agency will not be required to pay inappropriate funding amounts in perpetuity. This will still ensure the contractor/compactor is awarded its proposed funding am ount in the year in which the IHS failed to timely award or decline the proposal, in accordance with the statute. Currently, when the IHS misses a statutory or regulatory deadline, the IHS must allocate its services appropriation funding, which is meant to be used for healthcare, as the IHS is not appropriated any additional funding for this purpose. Additionally, as neither the statute nor regulations provide any limitation to the \"deemed approved\" provisions, requiring the IHS to pay any amount that a contractor/proposes, in perpetuity could have devastating effects on the Agency and the beneficiaries it serves. Budget Impact : None. Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 296 FISCAL YEAR 2021 HHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Provide Tax Exemption for Indian Health Service Health Professions Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS) seeks tax treatment similar to that provided to recipients of National Health Service Corps (NHSC) and Armed Forces Health Professions scholarships, to allow scholarship funds for qualified tuition and related expenses rec eived under the Indian Health Service Health Professions Scholarships to be excluded from gross income under Section 117(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and to allow participants in the IHS Loan Repayment Program to exclude from gross income payme nts made by the IHS Loan Repayment program under Section 108(f)(4) of the IRC. In addition, IHS is seeking exemption from any Federal Employment Tax (FICA), making the IHS programs comparable to the current NHSC status. Current Law : Generally, benefits a warded in the form of scholarship awards and loan repayments are regarded as federal taxable income by the IRS under Title 25 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, three federal laws currently provide for the non -taxability of federal scholarship awards a nd loan repayment programs: Section 413 of P.L. 107 -16, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, provides that tuition, fee, and other related cost payments by the National Health Service Corps and F. Edward Hebert Armed Forces Heal th Professions Scholarships and Financial Assistance Program scholarships are not taxable. This tax exemption was made permanent by Congress in December 2012 but did not include IHS scholarships. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 108(f)(4) provides that funds received through the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program authorized under 338B(g) of the Public Health Service Act or a state loan repayment program described in section 338I of the Public Health Service Act are permanently not subject to federal income ta x. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(a)(19) excludes NHSC loan repayment from federal employment tax. As IHS programs are not included in the exceptions, IHS health professions scholarships and loan repayment awards are taxed under the IRC. Rationale : The IHS, as a ru ral healthcare provider, has difficulty recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals. There are over 1,330 vacancies for healthcare professionals including: physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. The IHS Health Professions Scholarship Program and the Loan Repayment Program play a significant role in the recruitment and retention of the healthcare professionals needed to fill these vacancies. The IHS Health Professions Scholarship and IHS Loan Repayment Program are very similar to other programs that receive preferred tax treatment, and should therefore receive similar tax treatment. Currently, benefits awarded through IHS in the form of loan repayment and scholarships are regarded as federal taxable inc ome to the recipient; however, the same benefits offered under the NHSC are not taxable. This disparate tax treatment of IHS -funded scholarship and loan repayment awards increases the overall tax bracket for the participants and creates a financial disince ntive for those otherwise willing to serve American Indian and Alaska Native patients by working in Indian health facilities. The ability to exempt scholarship and loan repayment funds from gross income would make this recruitment and retention tool more attractive to potential participants. Based on our calculations, exempting the IHS Loan Repayment Program would allow IHS to award an additional 190 loan repayment contracts in a given year. Thus the IHS would be better able to increase the number of CJ - 297 healthcare providers entering and remaining within the IHS to provide primary healthcare and specialty services. Budget Impact : Federal Tax Revenue Foregone (in 2016 dollars): Loan $8,920,705 Scholarship $267,222* Total $9,187,927 indicates taxes withheld by IHS at student's request . Budget impact is the amount of tax revenue withheld by IHS from IHS Health Professions Scholarship and Loan Repayment and forwarded to the Internal Revenue Service. This also includes the tax liability owed by the scholarships recipients. Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 298 FISCAL YEAR 2021 HHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Provide the Indian Health Service Discretionary Use of all Title 38 Personnel Authorities Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS) is seeking the discretionary use of all United States Code Title 38 authorities under Part V, Chapter 74, \"Veterans Health Administration - Personnel\", that are primarily available to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA ) in relation to health care positions. The term \"health care occupations\" refers to positions, other than positions in the Senior Executive Service, that provide direct patient -care services or services incident to direct patient -care which would normally be covered by Title 5 of the United States Code. Current Law : Title 38 Part V, Chapter 74, governs all aspects of personnel administration for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) unless expressly overridden by another law or regulation. In many are as of personnel administration, the VHA is exempt from Title 5 laws and regulations by virtue of Title 38. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), under the authority of section 1104 and 5371 of Title 5 of the United States Code, has authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use the Title 38 provisions pertaining to pay rates and systems, premium pay, classification, and hours of work. This delegation of authority is described in a delegation of agreement between OPM and HHS - the latest version of which was effective March 6, 2019. If HHS, or an HHS Operating Division under the delegation of authority, chooses to use a Title 38 provision, the comparable authority under Title 5 is waived. However, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5371 does not provide authority to apply all personnel provisions of Title 38 in lieu of comparable Title 5 provisions. Rationale : The IHS, as a primarily rural healthcare provider, has difficulty recruiting healthcare professionals. The IHS has critical hiring needs for hea lthcare professionals in IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian programs including, but not limited to physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. The ability to use Title 38 for pay purposes as discussed above is benef icial because the IHS can offer market pay to physicians and dentists, and special salary rates to individuals in other health care occupations. However, the IHS's use of these compensation authorities is not adequate by itself to compete with other public sector agencies and private sector organizations. Typically, the private sector and the VHA can offer candidates better scheduling options and paid time off \u2014 particularly important benefits to providers who serve in remote and rural locations. The IHS faces specific public sector competition in the area of annual leave accrual. The VHA provides 1 day of annual leave per pay period for all (including new) physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and chiropractors and 8 hours of annual leave accru al per pay period for all (including new) nurses, physician assistants, and expanded -function dental auxiliaries. Due to the limited scope of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5371, the IHS does not have 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421. \"Personnel Administration: in ge neral\" that includes \"leaves of absence of employees\". Thus, when a candidate with just a few years of experience is choosing between the IHS and the VHA, he or she will invariably choose the organization offering 1 day/8 hours of annual leave accrual per pay period, as opposed to just 4 or 6 hours of annual leave accrual per pay period that the IHS offers. Supervisors report anecdotally that the IHS has lost many candidates due to this difference in accrual rates. In addition to better scheduling option s and paid time off, the IHS is seeking access to other Title 38 authorities to increase its competitive stance in the healthcare labor market and to create a more efficient and effective human resources program. This would include the potential for instit uting two -year probationary periods for staff appointed under Title 38 and to have jurisdiction over appeals for adverse actions involving professional conduct or competence pertaining to direct patient care and clinical competence instead of going through the Merit Systems Protection Board. Title 38 also exempts the VHA CJ - 299 from collective bargaining and associated grievance procedures relating to issues concerning professional conduct competence, and peer review. In contrast, Title 5 permits the establishment of grievance procedures on any issue through the collective bargaining process. Budget Impact : This proposal is budget neutral. The IHS will accommodate funding requirements within existing resources. Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ - 300 Withholding Annuity and Retiree Pay for Retired Civil Service Employees Convicted of Moral Turpitude Proposal : Amend 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8312 to allow for withholding or revoking of annuity and retiree pay for retired civil service employees convicted of moral turpitude, including crimes against children and rape, during the commission of their federal duties. Current L aw: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8312, a retired civilian employee's annuity and retiree pay may only be withheld for specific high crimes of treason, aiding the enemy, perjury, and subordination of perjury. The federal government needs additional authorities to addr ess the pay of retirees who commit certain egregious and reprehensible crimes that outrage and offend the American Public's moral sensibility. Expansion of the list of offenses minimally should include crimes against children and rape perpetrated by feder al employees during the commission of their federal duties, on federal property, or while otherwise using their federal position. Rationale : In September 2018, a former U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer and civil service employee at t he IHS was convicted of sexual assault and exploitation of children, for crimes he committed while an active duty Corps officer assigned to the IHS facility in Browning, Montana. He was also convicted in South Dakota for similar allegations while assigned to the IHS facility in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. The sexual assailant 's conviction exposes the limitations of current statute to fully address and adjudicate crimes of moral turpitude committed by retired federal employees during the commission of their duties while in the federal civil service. In keeping with the limited scope of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8312, the proposed amendment may be limited to the commission of crimes against children and rape, specifically while on duty, on federal property, or while using or misusing the authority of their federal position. This proposed amendment is in line with the Department's mission of protecting vulnerable, underserved populations, and the Presidential Task Force on Protecting Native American Children in the Indian Health Service System. The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps has proposed a related amendment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 212 to allow for the involuntary recall of an officer from retirement in order to potentially change the characterization of his/her service from Honorable to Other than Honorable and withhold retiree pay for crimes of moral turpitude. Both amendments are needed to address the Commissioned Corps as a uniformed service in Title 42, separate and apart from the federal civil service, go verned under Title 5. Budget Impact : None. Effective Date: Upon enactment. CJ - 301 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FY 2021 Performance Budget Submission to Congress TABLE OF CONTENTS Self Determination Page Self-Determination Self-Determination ............................... 303 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Indian Health Service Indian Self Determination Indian Health Service Philosophy - The Indian Health Service (IHS) implements t he Indian Self - Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), Public Law (Pub. L. No.) 93 -638, as amended, which recognizes the unique legal and political relationship between the United States and American Indian and Alaska Native peoples. Accordin gly, the IHS supports Tribal sovereignty: (1) by assisting Tribes in exercising their right to administer the IHS health programs, or portions thereof, and (2) by continuing to directly provide services to Tribes that choose the IHS as their health care pr ovider. A Tribal decision to enter or not enter into ISDEAA agreements are equal expressions of self -determination. Title I Contracts and Title V Self -Governance Compacts - Titles I and V of the ISDEAA provide Tribes the option to exercise the right to self -determination by assuming control and management of programs previously administered by the federal government. Since 1975, the IHS has entered agreements with Tribes a nd Tribal organizations to plan, conduct, and administer programs authorized under Section 102 of the Act. Today, over $3.2 billion of the Agency's appropriation is transferred to Tribes and Tribal Organizations through Title I contracts and Title V compac ts. Under Title I, there are 210 Tribes and Tribal Organizations operating 244 contracts and annual funding agreements.
