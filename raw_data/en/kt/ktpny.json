[CBS 4](http://cbs4.com/health/health.care.health.2.1271157.html) reports: \"Health care costs are soaring. Thousands of people are without jobs and without the benefits afforded them.

Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration has mounted an aggressive campaign against products making unproven or unapproved claims to fight swine flu.\" Despite a lack of evidence around homeopathic medicines, an increasing number of Americans are \"using it to battle a panoply of ailments, including arthritis, herpes and flu.\" \"A federally funded survey in 2007 found that in the previous year nearly 5 million Americans used homeopathic remedies, made from substances including duck liver, heavy metals such as arsenic, herbs and poison ivy, and diluted in water until they are virtually undetectable. ... Unlike vaccines or prescription or over-the-counter drugs, homeopathic medicines, which account for annual U.S. sales of more than $200 million, do not need to demonstrate safety or effectiveness, although they must be labeled with a list of ingredients and the conditions for which they are being used\" (Boodman, 10/27).This is part of the Morning Briefing, a summary of health policy coverage from major news organizations.
