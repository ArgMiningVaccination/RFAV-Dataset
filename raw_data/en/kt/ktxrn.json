There are varying [grades of Shilajit](/blogs/journal/how-to-test-shilajit/#shilajit_grades). This guide addresses use of the highest grade (Gold Grade). Before taking any product, do your homework to ensure it is real Shilajit and not a synthesized imitation. Note that powder forms are most often imitations created with fulvic acid from fertilizer and inactive, cheap fillers. The usual supplement disclaimer: This product has not been evaluated by the FDA therefore instructions herein do not claim to diagnose, cure, or treat any disease. Advice of an Ayurvedic or healthcare professional is recommended, especially if you take other medications or supplements, are pregnant, or are lactating. Taking Shilajit is a Personal Endeavor Shilajit, like any supplement or even food, interacts with each person's body differently. As our [Authentic Shilajit customer feedback](https://shop.lotusbloomingherbs.com/products/authentic-shilajit) and [Facebook comments about Shilajit](https://www.facebook.com/AuthenticShilajit/timeline) reveal, each person's experience is different. Varying reactions are from immediate tangible sensations to benefits realized after a few weeks of use. Of course, the more healthful choices each Shilajit user makes, like healthful diet and exercise, the greater and longer lasting the benefits to overall health. As you follow these guidelines for how to take Shilajit, we recommend that you record your experiences. Many find a daily journal of food and activity choices, along with mood and physical feeling, help them discover what Shilajit resin dosage works for them. Recording your experience will help you more easily identify the Shilajit dosage that works best for you. When you have 2-3 days in which you feel the benefits you desire, you are on the right amount. Plus, in case you have changes to your routine such as travel or fighting a cold, you should record your experiences on those days, but wait to increase your Shilajit dosage until you are back to your routine. Remember to share how you found your best Shilajit dosage level here or on our Facebook page to help others with their journey to better health and vibrant living. Finding Your Shilajit Dosage To find your optimal Shilajit dosage, begin by taking a piece about the size of a grain of rice (~100 mg) once per day. In a few days, take the same amount 2-3 times per day. Then gradually increase the amount of Shilajit taken with each dose up to a large pea size (~300 mg) until you achieve the desired benefits. Do not be greatly concerned with getting the portions exactly right or exactly the same each time you take it. Use the same shape (elliptical like rice or round like a pea) each time to ensure that you have a relatively consistent Shilajit daily dose. By following these recommendations, you will find how much Shilajit you should take. Factors that will affect how much Shilajit you should take per day include: - Body size - Body mass index (BMI) - General health - Metabolism - Food and other lifestyle choices - Benefits sought - Your personal molecular chemistry (granted, this one is a mystery!) As with any new experience for your body, you may experience undesired effects such as difficulty sleeping or digestive discomfort. These are usually temporary and an indicator that you should step down the Shilajit dosage for a few more days then try to increase the amount taken giving your body more time to adjust. Of course, if you experience any symptom that you would describe as stronger than mild seek consultation with your healthcare professional. How to Take Shilajit Following the Shilajit dosage recommendations above, remove the appropriate sized portion of your resin. Tip: Ayurveda practitioners recommend taking Shilajit with one or a combination of the following organic ingredients to increase delivery of the adaptogenic effects to the body: - hot milk (we recommend organic goats milk) - ghee (clarified butter) - raw, unpasteurized honey - sesame oil Vegans may prefer to use coconut oil, herbal teas, or spring water. Do NOT use chlorinated water which comes from your kitchen tap if you are connected to city water services. Experimenting with various solutions and recording your experiences will help you find the best way to take Shilajit for you. You can also try our delicious [Shilajit latte recipe!](https://lotusbloomingherbs.com/shilajit-dandy-latte.html) Shilajit dissolves in a warm liquid within a couple of minutes. Flattening the portion with the back of a spoon and stirring speeds the process. When to Take Shilajit To maximize absorption, the best time to take your dosage of Shilajit is on an empty stomach in the morning. If you find that Shilajit produces immense energy then don't take it in the evening as it may cause sleep difficulty for some people.
