ANNUAL ACCOUNTS including the consolidated Annual Accounts for the financial year 2018/19. ANNUAL REPORT1 Performance report 1.1 O verview of performance The purpose of the Performance Report is to provide an overview of our organisation, its purpose, the key risks to achieving our objectives, and our performance during the year. Chairman's and Chief Executive's overview Introduction Welcome to our 2018/19 Annual Report The high level of public interest in the challenges affecting the NHS referred to in our report last year continued unabated in 2018/2019. The familiar concerns over inadequate funding and the need to deliver high quality care to increasing numbers of patients with progressively more complex needs were further complicated by the political and organisational challenges associated with the ongoing upheaval created by Brexit. Notwithstanding these challenges the Trust continued to make good progress, the credit for which must as always go to our incredibly talented, hard- working and committed staff. They in turn have been well supported by our Clinical Commissioning Group, other health care organisations and GPs, the London Borough of Hackney and the City of London Corporation, our patients, and the wider community. Much is said about the need for health care to become better integrated to be more effective and patient centred, and this is only possible through these various groups working closely together. Quality and Patient Care It is our key responsibility to ensure that the quality of the clinical and other services we provide to our patients, coupled with their overall experience while they are in our care, is as good as it can be. The quality of our care is substantially dependent on the quality, relevance and coverage of the information generated within the Trust and elsewhere. A particular example over the past year is in the considerable improvement made in the reporting of serious incidents, and the timeliness of their evaluation. It is important that we should be a continuously learning organisation. The success of the Trust in this all -impo rtant area has been underlined in the recent past by a series of \"Good\" CQC reports, culminating in the CQC's overall evaluation of the acute site and the Trust as a whole in the current financial year. Not only is the whole Trust rated \"Good\", but our A&E Department continues to be rated as \"Outstanding\", and our Medical Services are now also rated at this highest level. Financial Performance Within the context of the continuing financial constraints imposed on the NHS as part of the Government's austerity programme, and despite in year pressures, the Trust has continued to perform well financially. After achieving our control total last year, resulting in additional funding from the Government, we are pleased to have achieved the same this year, 2018/2019. 2The consequence of this, coupled with a determined and successful effort by the Finance Team over the past year to recover overdue debt, is a significant improvement in the Trust's cash position. This is vital to the future successful development of the Trust as it puts us in a stronger position to invest in capital developments, aimed at improving both the quality and reach of the services we provide to our patients. Strategic Development The strategic development of the Trust can be considered at two levels, borough (both Hackney and the City) and the local geographical area of east London. As far as Hackney and the City are concerned, good progress has been made in partnership with our Clinical Commissioning Group in developing more integrated care. T he foundation for this is a series of workstreams based on eight \"neighbourhoods\", where action is being taken to develop more integrated care pathways across our own acute and community services, GPs, the local authorities, and other health and care agenc ies. There have been a number of developments in the East London Health and Care Partnership (ECHLP and previously the Sustainability and Transformation Partnership) involving greater integration of some of the CCGs in the area, and other activity relevant to the Trust. The Trust not only works as part of ELCHP but also with the inner ELCHP providers and commissioners, between whom there is more pathway flows of patients. The inner area includes the two acute trusts, Barts and Homerton. There is some sense in this given the plans that we are already developing in partnership with Barts. The first of these plans is a possible pathology partnership, which continues to be the subject of complex negotiations between the two trusts. People None of what we have achieved would have been possible without the excellent performance of all our staff and the support of the organisations with which we work. We are both very conscious of and grateful for this. Turning to the B oard, Sheila Adam, our Chief Nurse, retired during the year ; our Finance Director Jonathan Wilson left to take up the same position at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; and Daniel Waldron, our Director of Organisational Transformation, left the Trust to take up a senior position at the Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. We are very grateful for the work they did whilst at the Trust. We are delighted that Dr Deblina Dasgupta, as Medical Director ; Catherine Pelley as Chief Nurse and Director of Governance; Phill Wells as Finance Dire ctor; and additionally Frances O'Callaghan as Director of Strategic Implementation and Partnerships ; have all joined the team of executive directors, and all are already making excellent contributions to our progress. We would also like to acknowledge the excellent work done by Susan Osborne and Polly Weitzman during their time as non- executive directors on the Board and thank them for their services. We are delighted that Dr Shree Datta and Cherron Inko- Tariah have recently joined in a similar ca pacity. 34About Homerton Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is an integrated care trust which provides hospital and community health services for Hackney, the City and surrounding communities. The Trust provides a full range of adult, older people's and children's services across medical and surgical specialties . The Trust operates acute services from a single site: Homerton University Hospital, which has almost 500 beds spread across 11 wards, a nine bed intensive care unit and maternity, paediatric and neonatal wards. There are three day surgery theatres and six main operating theatres and the types of surgery performed include general surgery, trauma, orthopaedics, gynaecology, maxillofacial, urology and ear nose and throat (ENT). Community services o perate from over 60 partner sites in Hackney and the City of London, and include sexual health, locomotor services, school nursing and diabetes eye screening. The Trust also provides continuing health care at the Mary Seacole Nursing Home which in Hoxton, east London . A range of specialist care is offered in obstetrics and neonatology, foetal medicine, fertility, HIV and sexual health, asthma and allergies, bariatric surgery and neuro-rehabilitation across east London and beyond. The clinical services are led and operated by three divisions within the Trust : surgery, women's and sexual health services (SWSH) ; children's services, diagnostics and outpatients (CSDO) ; and integrated medical and rehabilitation services (IMRS) . The corporate directorates which operate in support of these include finance, estates and facilities, governance, information technology and workforce. The Trust's s trategic vision in 2018 /19 Homerton was one of the first trust s to gain foundation status in 2004. Since this time, The Trust has maintained its reputation as a high performing NHS provider, delivering quality patient and service user care , whilst maintaining compliance with all key performance and regulatory requirements. The Trust's strategy 'Achieving Together' was established in 2014 and is the blueprint for developing Homerton's services over five years . It sets out the Trust's ambitions and priorities for building on our current high standards and establishing the Trust as one of the country's foremost health providers, with a reputation for quality, innovation and leading the way on service integration. In consultation with a wide range of Trust staff and key stakeholders, three strategic priorities were identified: Quality , Integration , and Growth; each supported by clear aims and objectives to realise our mission: 'Safe, caring, effective health and social care provided to our communities with a transparent, open approach.' We recognise that successful delivery depends as much on the approach we take, as on the priorities themselves. We have developed a set of organisational values which describe the approach we will take in delivering the services and the standards we will uphold and set out in the document 'Living our Values'. 5'Achieving Together' outlines the priorities for the next stage of our development and the values of the Trust. These values provide a framework for how we make our decisions and engage with patients, staff, carers, governors, and the Trust's membership. We are proud of the services we offer at Home rton and the reputation the Trust has developed for providing high quality care. 'Achieving Together' ensures we continue to build on this reputation both locally and nationally. We have a number of initiatives supporting our strategic direction to ensure we maintain high standards of operational performance. These include a continued focus on organisational development and workforce engagement; a productivity and efficiency strategy; and a quality agenda designed to further embed high- quality provision and a positive patient experience. In 2018/19 the Trust continued to support the work of the East London Health and Care Partnership which brings together the area's eight councils and 12 NHS organisations, who are combining their expertise and resources to ensure health and care services meet the needs of local people, now and in the future. The Trust has also been a core partner and leader within City and Hackney in developing integrated working with commissioners and providers of health and social care at a local level. This programme aims to deliver an integrated, effective and financially sustainable local system which listens to and meets local people's needs and works as part of the wider north east London footprint. The Trust's s trategic objectives in 2018 /19 The Trust's mission - 'Safe, caring, effective health and social care provided to our communities with a transparent, open approach' - will continue in the coming year and also our commitment to 'Achieving Together'. The Quality , Integration , and G rowth strategic priorities established within the context of the five year strategic plan, 2014 - 2020 , continue to be supported by the following objectives: Quality Safe - Continuously strive to improve patient safety and provide harm free care. Effective - Provide services based on the latest evidence and clinical research. Positive patient experience - Ensure all patients have an excellent experience of our services through providing person -centred care that takes into account each patient's or service user's needs, concerns and preferences. Integration Pathways - Ensure care pathways, across the health system, are designed around the needs of the individual. Prevention - Focus on early intervention to improve health and wellbeing and reduce the cost of health care provision. Partnership - Create seamless services in which organisational boundaries are not evident to the patient or service user. Growth Scale - Ensure core services are of a sufficient scale for long term sustainability and effectiveness. Reputation - Develop a national reputation and profile for leading the way in the provision of high quality and innovative health care services. Turnover - Establish an ability to respond to the financial and quality challenges facing health care providers by increasing turnover to \u00a3400m by 2020. 6Key risks to delivering our strategic objectives The key risks that could impede us from achieving our strategic objectives are: failure to develop an engaged and motivated workforce may undermine the Trust's ability to deliver its services in accordance with its values and desired staff behaviours, resulting in a poor experience for the patient ; a patient receives avoidable harm from poor practice as a result of a failure to comply with required Trust safety policies and lessons learned ; if the culture within the Trust is not a learning one with openness and transparency supporting learning and improvement, it may result in the Trust falling short in the quality of care delivered to patients; a lack of adherence to la test research, or practice which is not compliant with the best evidence could lead to a less effective service provision; failure to achieve financial targets may result in difficulties in funding future investment plans and threaten the organisation's fi nancial autonomy; poor reviews or reports on performance outcomes by regulators, other bodies, the press and public may result in a damaged reputation that diminishes the Trust's ability to gr ow; failure to expand and retain sufficient activity through a failure to adapt and engage in local collaborative healthcare arrangements may limit the Trust's ability toincrease turnover and maintain clinically sustainable services. The risks that threaten achievement of the strategic objectives are identified within the Board Assurance Framework, which is reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors and Risk Committee. The Trust's risk management processes are designed to assess the impact of all risks identified on the Trust' s Risk Register , and ensure that they are appropriately mitigated and managed. Throughout the year the Board of Directors reviewed the risks that may prevent the Trust from achieving its objectives, complying with its NHSI Licence Conditions and fulfilling the requirements of the operating and financial plan. The Board also assesses outcomes through regular review of performance reports . During the year the Trust also made appropriate preparations for the impact of the UK's departure from the European Union. All trusts were provided with guidance by the Department for Health and Social Care to support their preparations for the possibility of a no- deal departure from the EU on 29th March 2019. The Trust complied with this guidance in full and was an active participant in discussions across the r egion. Internally a Brexit Board, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, was established to oversee this activity and the Trust Board was updated regularly. The Government has now agreed a new date for the UK's departure from the EU which is expected to be no later than 31st October 2019. Going concern disclosure After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the NHS Foundation Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the A ccounts. 7Performance against strategic priorities 2018 /19 We have recorded a number of achievements during the year : Overall, CQC inspectors rated Homerton University Hospital as ' Good' following their inspection of four core inpatient services in April 2018. Urgent and emergency services and medical care (including care of the older person) were rated as Outstanding. We remain one of the best performers for A&E services in London and nationally; consistently delivering over 90% for the 4- hour wait target and achieving 94. 34% overall against the 95% target in 2018/1 9 We continue to achieve good compliance against the key operational and quality requirements with a strong performance against the 18 week referral to treatment standard (best performing England and Wales) and improving access to p sychological therapies We met our financial control total and successfully implemented a new financial transactions process in partnership with NHS Shared Business Services We retained the Planet Mark accreditation for a second year by showing good practice in sustainability including achieving a 9.6% total carbon footprint reduction in 12 monthsand decreasing carbon emissions from buildings by 9.7%. We exceeded the midwifery continuity of carer target, ensuring the delivery of a more holistic care model for expectant mothers An overseas recruitment campaign led to the employment of 49 new nurses last year We launched the Lighthouse Programme to help nurses achieve the NMC clinical examination qualification and also to provide welfare support to overseas nurses The inpatient cardiac arrest rate of 0.5% is well below the national average of 1.6% The Acute Pain Team was recognised as the Team of the Year by the National Ac ute Pain Symposium Throughout the year some of our clinicians were also shortlisted for a number of awards, including Nurse Leader of the Year We successfully im plemented a new voice recognition system to facilitate the informatio n entry in electronic notes and letter production. Our d octors are using new technology to access cardiology, endoscopy and radiology images and a new phone app allows clinician to safely take clinical photographs. A significant improvement for us i n the 2018 staff survey was the staff recommendation of the organisation as a place to work or receive treatment We delivered harm free care to 96.4% of Homerton patients 81.2 Performance analysis Review of financial performance The Trust had an Income & Exp enditure (I&E) surplus of \u00a316.8 m for the financial year 2018/19, compared to the planned surplus of \u00a311.4 m. The main source of income for the Trust is contracts with commissioners in respect of health care services, the Trust's main commissioner being City and Hackney Clinical Commissioning Group. A comparison of planned and actual performance (excluding impairments) is shown in the table below. Plan Actual Variance 2018/19 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Income Clinical Other income 23.9 25.3 1.4 STF Funding 11.0 16.4 5.4 Total income 326.1 335.5 9.4 Expenses Pay -206.2 -213.3 Net Surplus/(Deficit) 11.4 5.4 *E Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation Income was \u00a34.0m (1.3%) above plan and was driven by increases in activity above plan in accid ent and emergency, daycase, outpatient and non- elective activity . Sustainability and Transformation Funding (STF) income totalled \u00a316.4m for the year and was higher than plan by \u00a35.4m. The Trust achieved \u00a310.3m of savings during the year as part of its Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) agenda. Projects included staffing and skill mix reviews, reduction in premium rates for additional clinical workload, service reconfiguration, negotiation with suppliers and more efficient use of our capacity. 9Capital expenditure Capital expenditure for the year totalled \u00a311m, of which \u00a34.9m related to new and r eplacement medical equipment including endoscopy stacks and x- ray machines, \u00a32.2 m related to IT projects and \u00a33.9m related to Estates projects, the most significant of which was the refurbishment of Lloyd Ward. The Trust's liquidity position improved in- year due to the income and expenditure surplus of \u00a316.8m and improved performance on the collection of aged debt. The Trust ended the year with debtors \u00a32.9m lower than at the last year -end and the closing cash balance \u00a321.4m higher. The Trust strives to pay all suppliers in line with the agreed terms for each supplier but in any event no later than 30 days from receipt of goods or services or the invoice date if later. The Trust's treasury management strategy is routinely reviewed by the Audit Committee, a committee of the Board. The Committee has not identified any immediate liquidity concerns. The Trust is confiden t that it has sufficient funds t o remain as a going concern. Operational performance The Trust delivered against the majority of its key performance indicators in year; however, there were some significant challenges in relation to the delivery of some of the regulatory national standards. The following table sets out performance against the key indicators contained within the Risk Assessment Framework. The performance has been presented on a cumulative basis for the year, although we, as with all trusts, were required to report to NHS on a range of measures quarterly. Key Performance Indicators 2018/19 Target 2018/19 Performance A&E patients discharge d < 4hrs 95% 94.34% Cancer 2 Week Wait 93% 95.9% 96% 99.4% 62 Day 2 Clostridium difficile RTT Indicator 92% 96.71% IAPT Indicators 6 week target 95% 99.52% 10With regard to the delivery of key operational milestones, the Trust has performed strongly throughout the year in relation to the Incomplete RTT standard ( for patients who have been referred on to consultant -led referral to treatment pathways ), and strong performance is expected to continue in to 2019/ 20, although increasing demand for the Trust's services is anticipated to present a new set of challenges for the Trust to overcome. In 2018 /19, the Trust has again performed comparatively strongly against the 4- hour Accident and Emergency standard but, as in 2016/17 and 2017/18, has found maintaining compliance throughout all four quarters challenging and, as a result, did not deliver the annual 95% performance standard, although the Trust did successfully meet its target to achieve additional PSF funding. As in previous y ears the following variables in particular prove challenging: available staffing particularly, although not exclusively, associated with medical posts, increasing patient acuity and rising activity volumes - particularly in relation to surges within ED attendances. It should also be noted that the Trust did not open its escalation ward throughout 2018/19, thus being able to manage its emergency demand through its core bed base. In 2018/19, the Trust has also seen increases in its level of activity driven by ambulance arrivals. The challenge in relation to meeting this standard has again been flagged as a risk in the Trust's 2019/ 20 Operating Plan. Similarly, the Trust generally performs well against the suite of cancer standards. Nevertheless, and in line with historical trends, Trust performance with regard to the 62- day standard oscillated in the early part of the year; however , the Trust successfully met the standard for six consecutive months from September 2018 to March 2019. As stated in previous report s, it should be noted that the Trust only delivers a limited number of treatments on- site and is therefore disproportionately reliant on partner organisations to achieve compliance with the standard, although with the expected introduction of the new perfo rmance standards in 2019/20, it is anticipated that performance in general will be much more within the Trust's ability to control. Despite the strong performance in the second half of the year, the challenge with regard to meeting this standard has been h ighlighted as a risk in the Trust's 2018/19 Operating Plan. As in previous years, the Trust was set challenging targets for MRSA and Clostridium difficile (C.diff ) infection. Further details regarding the actions being taken to minimise hospital acquired infections are detailed in the Quality Account. The Trust has continued to perform strongly against both the 6 week and 18 week Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT ) indicators, whilst also performing strongly against the access and recovery s tandards. Monitoring quality and performance Performance against key metrics is monitor ed and reviewed by the executive directors at senior team meetings . The Trust Board considers detailed performance and quality information each month. Details of perfo rmance against key quality indicators that were prioritised throughout 2018 /19 are presented in the Quality Account. 11Environmental matters and sustainability The NHS Sustainable Development Unit, via its Carbon Reduction Strategy, requires NHS organi sations to reduce carbon emissions by 34% by 2020. The latest report published in January 2016, shows that the NHS carbon footprint in England is 22.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (MtCO2e) and the carbon footprint r educed by 11% between 2007 and 2015. The NHS carbon footprint comprises three key areas: travel, building energy use and procurement . Homerton along with other NHS organisations support s the agenda for driving down carbon emissions in these areas. The Trust is working towards its carbon reduction target via a number of strategic energy efficiency infrastructure improvements in the estate, and through increased activity to support wider sustainable outcomes over the next year. The Board approved the Sustainable Development Management Plan (SDMP) in 2017/ 18 which includes climate change adaptation planning. The SDMP details carbon reduction through energy efficiency, as well as looking at other environmental aspects such as waste, water, community engagement and travel . It will also seek to integrate and embed sustainability through governance, workforce and procurement functions. Homerton became the first NHS Trust in the country to be accredited with a Planet Mark sustainability certificate in recognition of its ongoing environmental commitment in 2017 and was reaccredited in 2018 for its ongoing commitment to year -on-year progress in carbon footprint reduction. Holders of the certificate have a minimum requirement to reduce their carbon emissions by 2.5 per cent every year. The Trust met these requirements by April 2018, reporting a carbon footprint of 2.04 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per employee, totalling in 7,074 tCO2e overall. This equates to a 9.6% reduction on the previous year against a target of 5%. The Trus t's assessment also included emissions from energy use in the building, with electricity accounting for nearly three quarters and natural gas a quarter of the total emissions. Trust Resource Usage Resource 2016 -17 2017 -18 2018 -19* Electricity * Estimated usage In addition, to the Planet Mark award, the Trust also received the Acre of Rainforest Certificate which ensures through contin uous sustainability efforts that an acre of rainforest is protected from deforestation. Our acre is locat ed in Ashaninka, Northern Peru. This award protects 240 trees, 245 animal shelters, 22 endangered species and suppl ies 76,000 litres of water to the community. 12The Trust has int roduced a new green travel plan which supports sustainable travel modes by staff, patients and visitors to support the reduction of car parking, renewable travel options and reusable energy sources such as a decrease in the use of petrol cars in favour of electric bicycles and cars. A new parking policy was implemented in April 2018 and the Trust actively promotes how staff, visitors and patients can better access the H omerton sites via public transport in partnership with Hackney Council. To achieve our sustainability goals, the Trust relies on the support of all staff to ensure the best possible environmental working practices at H omerton. Simple interventions like switching off lights and equipment when not in use, and closing doors and windows helps to improve resource efficiency , reduce waste, achieve cost savings, and reduce the Trust's carbon footprint. Social community and human rights issues The Trust is committed to ensuring that services meet the needs of people with prot ected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010: Age Disability Gender reassignment Marriage and civil partnership Pregnancy and maternity Race Religion or belief Sex Sexual orientation This is also in accordance with our public sector equality duties under the NHS Constitution. The Trust recognises the importance of respecting and protecting the human rights of patients, staff and members, in line with Equality and Human Rights Commission guidance. The Trust's equality objectives and Equalities Report which sets out how we meet specific employment duties are available on the website at www.homerton.nhs.uk The Trust is committed to safeguarding all patients and work s with partners through local multi - agency Safeguarding Boards to safeguard vulnerable adults and children. Safeguarding child and adult leads are in place to ensure that policies and procedures are applied in response to safeguarding issues. All staff receive safeguarding training as part of their mandatory training requirements. To meet the needs of a diverse population, a telephone interpreting service is available and key information leaflets are provided in other languages and in a user friendly format. A multi- faith spiritual care team which reflects the different faiths and beliefs of the local population is also available to support patients and relatives . 13 14 2.

Terms of reference set out the responsibilities of each committee and this structure monitors and provides assurance to the Board on the delivery of the Trust's objectives and other key priorities. 19 Contacting the Board Board members may be contacted via the Trust's Company Secretary as follows: Telephone: 020 8510 5555 or Email: huh-tr.Enquiries @nhs.net WAu dit Committee Membership and attendance The Audit Committee is chaired by Martin Smith, a non-e xecutive director, and includes three other non-executive directors . Sir John Gieve and Jude Williams were non-e xecutive members of the Audit Committee throughout 2018/19, and Polly Weitzman was a member until the 31 October 2018 when she stood down from the Board. From 1 November 2018 she was replaced by Cherron Inko- Tariah. The Audit Committee met six times in 2018/19. Name Attendance Martin Smith (chair) 6/6 Sir 2/3 How the Audit Committee discharges its responsibilities The Audit Committee's primary purpose is to provide assurance on the adequacy and effective operation of the Trust's overall system of control. It is directly accountable to the Board. The Committee assures the Board of Directors that probity and professional judgment is exer cised in all financial matters. It advises the Board on the adequacy of the Trust's systems of internal control and its processes for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness. 20Significant issues considered During the year the Committee considered 13 reports from the Internal Auditors that sought to provide assurance to the Trust on the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management, control and governance processes. Overall, the internal auditors concluded that the organisation had an adequate and effective framework for risk management, governance and internal control. Their work identified further enhancements to ensure that it remained adequate and effective. During the year, the i nternal auditors provided one substantial assurance (green), four reasonable assurance (amber green) opinions, and seven partial assurance (amber red) opinions. The remaining report was advisory and therefore did not result in a formal opinion. For all reports, management provides an action plan to address any issues identified. Progress against these action plans is reviewed at each Audit Committee and further testing is undertaken by Internal Audit to ensure their recommendations are embedded in the organisation. The Committee has also reviewed key policy documents and discharged its duties by reviewing the schedule of tender waivers to ensure any such waivers are in line with the Trust's policy. Other areas of the Committee's work include: reviewing the Trust's progress on budget setting and business planning; considering the Trust's medium term financial strategy; reviewing arrangements for Clinical Audit; considering the Trust's compliance with the Overseas Visitors Mandatory Up Front Charging legislation; and reviewing the Trust's proposals for implementing NHS Improvement's Costing Transformation Programme. The Audit Committee has also considered significant financial matters as part of its ongoing work, including consideration of debtor balances and their recoverability (note 11 to the accounts), and the valuation and accounting treatment of the Trust's property estate (note 9.1 to the accounts). Auditors The Trust's internal auditors are RSM, appointed by the Trust in December 2012. Their role is to provide the Trust with an independent and objective opinion on the degree to which risk management, control and governance support the achievement of the organisation's agreed objectives and to provide independent support to help management improve the organisation's risk management, control and governance arrangements. The external auditors for Homerton are KPMG LLP, appointed by the Council of Governors in December 2016. Their fees for audit services undertaken in 2018/19 were \u00a373,825. KPMG's accompanying report on the Trust's financial statements is based on their audit conducted in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the Financial Reporting Manual issued by NHS Improvement. Their work includes a review of the Trust's system of internal control which is used to inform the nature and s cope of their audit procedures. The external auditors confirmed in their Audit Plan, which was approved by the Audit Committee, that the significant audit risks being reviewed are: valuation of land and buildings, management override of control, operating income from patient care activities and fraudulent expenditure recognition. The external auditors may also perform non- audit work where the work is clearly audit related and the external auditors are best placed to do that work. For such assignments the Audit Committee approved protocol is followed which ensures all such work is properly considered. 21The processes in place ensure auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded. There was no non- audit work carried out during 2018/19. Remuneration and Nomi nation Committee The Remuneration and Nomination Committee determines the pay and employment policy for the executive directors and other staff designated by the Board. Remuneration is reviewed with due regard to benchmarking information and survey data of other comparative senior posts within the NHS. The committee also considers the performance of the executive directors. The Committee has been chaired by Sir Tim Melville- Ross, Chairman of the Board and all of the non-executive directors are members. The Committee met on one occasion in 2018 /19. Details of salary and pension entitlements for Board members are set out in the Remuneration Report on page 32. Ri sk Committee The Risk Committee was established by the Board to support the development of the Trust's risk management systems and processes. It ensures that the Trust Risk Register is fit for purpose and that risks are subject to robust scrutiny to achieve the Trust's principal objectives and deliver its core business . The Committee receives annual compliance reports from key areas of the business to provide assurance to the Board that quality and risk management arrangements are appropriate and robust. The Risk Co mmittee is chaired by Vanni Treves and met four times in 2018/19. Homer ton Hope - the Trust's Charitable Fund The Trust's Charitable Fund (known as Homerton Hope) is an NHS Charity as defined within the NHS Charities guidance and was established in March 1997. The Trust is the charity's Corporate Trustee, which means that the executive and non-executive directors share the responsibility for ensuring that the Trust fulfils its responsibilities in managing the charitable fund. The Trust Board has delegated this responsibility to the Charitable Funds Committee, which comprises the Director of Finance (chair), the Trust Chair, the Medical Director and the Chief Executive. The D irector of Finance is responsible for the day -to-day management and administration of the charitable fund, and in particular, for ensuring that expenditure is in accordance with the objectives and priorities agreed by the Charitable Funds Committee and the Trust Board. Char ity objectives The charity is funded by donations and legacies received from patients, their relatives, the general public, and other organisations. The charity's objective is \"to provide support for any charitable purpose or purposes relating to the National Health Services provided by Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust including services provided to the community\" This objective is met by ensuring that all expenditure by the charity relates to one of the following three areas: 22Patient expenditure - Purchase of items of equipment, provision of services, and the provision of facilities not normally provided by, or in addition to, normal NHS provision; Staff expenditure - Purchase of educational material and conference/course fees in addition to those provided from the Trust's training and development budgets. Enhanced staff facilities and services that improve staff wellbeing; and Capital equipment - Purchase of equipment in addition to that provided by NHS funds through the Trust's Capital Programme. Review of achievements During 2018/19, the charity continued to support a wide range of charitable and health related activities, benefiting patients and staff in a variety of areas. Generally, funds are used to provide specialist staff, goods and services which would not have been possible using NHS funding. Some of the activities which continued over the past year are described below . Peer navigators project With the help of another donation from the MAC Aids Fund the Charity has been able to support the running of a peer navigator s' programme. This project helps patients build confidence to seek employment , navigate the complex and ever changing social care system, and also provide support in living well with HIV. Art programme The therapeutic value of art in health and in speeding recovery is well documented. The Trust has always displayed art work in its wards, corridors and courtyards. Based in the heart of Hackney, the hospital provides an excellent blank canvas for artists to display their work to patients, staff and visitors. Thanks to a grant from the Postcode Lottery we have been able to continue our art therapy sessions in the Elderly Care Unit , the Graham Ward Stroke Unit and the Regional Neurological Rehabilitation Unit (RNRU) . Christmas presents for inpatients The charity continued its annual tradition of providing small gifts to patients who were staying in hospital during Christmas 2018. Staff welfare The charity provided funding for a number of courses, conferences and award ceremonies attended by staff including food and entertainment for the summer staff barbeque. Contributions were also made to support the work of the Healthy Homerton Project . Equipment purchased for patient s Over the last year charitable funds were used to purchase a number of items of equipment and to provide additional services to benefit patients , for example: Asthma awareness kits for Starlight uni t Cancer awareness kits for families NHS 70 anniversary staff celebrations 23Hackney Ark roof garden improvements Memorial garden improvements Diabetes volunteer group garden Donations The charity mainly receives donations from organisations such as the Justgiving and Virgingiving websites and members of the public. Total funds received were in excess of \u00a330,000 (excluding fees). The charity also received \u00a330,000 from MAC Aids for the peer navigator role. We also received: \u00a36000 from Tesco Groundworks whi ch helped fund the memorial garden redevelopment, and the purchase of la rge toys for the children's ward and children's A&E \u00a318,000 from the Postcode Lottery funding to provide art classes for RNRU, the stroke unit and the elderly care unit \u00a3765 from the John Lewis Stratford, Barbican and Highbury & Islington communitymatters programme for children's services \u00a32500 from London Catalyst to help us provide grants for patients with HIV and cancer The charity continues to actively fund raise through a variety of activities, for example, in September 2018 a group of celebrities hosted an event to raise awareness about hair loss. This event raised over \u00a38500. Board, committee and directors' evaluation The Board of Directors is satisfied that its balance of knowledge, skills, and exper tise is appropriate to fulfil its function in accordance with the requirements of the NHS Foundation Code of Governance and the Trust's Terms of Authorisation. The annual appraisal of the Chairman involves collaboration between t he Senior Independent Director and the Lead Governor of the Council of Governors to seek the views of directors and governors. The performance of n on-executive directors is evaluated annually by the Chairman. The Chief Executive reviews the performance of the executive directors during their annual appraisal. Governors and members The Trust is accountable to the communities it serves and members of the public are able to become members and if elected, governors of the Trust. Being a member provides people with the opportunity to find out more about the Trust and to get involved. We have t wo membership constituencies as set out in the Trust constitution: Public Staff 24Membership is open to any member of the public over the age of 16 who lives in the London Borough of Hackney, the City of London or the outer area. The outer constituency includes Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Newham, Redbridge, Barking, Havering, Camden, Islington, Haringey, Enfield, Lambeth, Southwark, Westminster and Epping Forest District. There is no separate patient constituency. The staff constituency is divided into clinical and other staff categories. Any staff on permanent employment contracts or those who have worked at the Trust for at least 12 months, including contractual staff or those holding honorary contracts, will be welcomed as members unless they choose to opt out. The Trust is committed to recruiting a diverse membership which is reflective of the community that it serves. There is no set limit on the number of people who can register as members within the eligibility criteria. The public membership continues to be broadly representative of the local population in terms of ethnicity and gender but is under represented in the 16- 39 age category. The Trust ended the year with 4, 781 public members and 3, 743 staff members which represents a relatively stable position. Membership engagement and strategy The Trust's Membership Strategy (2017- 2020) sets out the engagement and communication priorities to engage with members and to increase H omerton's membership, with particular emphasis on recruiting younger people. The Trust has established a Membership Engagement and Communication Committee , which has oversight of membership activities and is chaired by a public governor. During the year, membership recruitment sessions, supported by governors, were held at the hospital and other venues across the borough. 'Memberlink ' newsletters were sent to all public members providing information, election details and news about the Trust's s ervices. Governor s also include updates about their work in 'Homertonlife ', the Trust's magazine. A member is able to vote for, or stand for election as a candidate to become a governor. There is an opportunity for interested members to ask questions abou t the role at the Annual Members' Meeting or at membership engagement events which are hosted by governors . Council of Governors The Council of Governors represents the views of patients, public members and staff and it comprises elected public and staff members, together with representatives of partner organisations, local authorities and commissioners. The Council has 25 Governors including: 14 Public Governors (elected) 6 Staff Governors (elected) 5 Appointed Governors nominated from partnership organisations. On 31 March 2019, 21 of the 25 governor seats were occupied. Governors normally hold office for three years and are eligible for re- election or re -appointment at the end of their first term. Governors may not hold office for more than nine consecutive years. 25The Council also elects one of its members to be the lead governor. John Bootes has held the position since July 2014. The following table confirms the names of our governors, their terms in office and attendance at Council meetings during 2 018/19.

This establishes an important link between the two bodies and helps governors to fulfil their statutory duties. The Chairman ensures that governor views on key strategic issues are considered at the Board of Directors meeting as part of the decision- making process. The Council of Governors and the Board of Directors hold regular joint meetings during the year. Executive d irecto rs and n on-executive directors regularly attend Council meetings to gain an understanding of governor views and the membership constituencies they represent. In turn governors have the opportunity to ask Board members questions about areas of concern or wish to receive further information. The L ead Governor holds regular meetings with governors to keep in touch with opinion , to seek views about future agendas and to enhance communication between the Council and the Board. The governors held five meetings in 2018 /19 including two joint meetings of the Council and the Board.

Committees of the Council The Council of Governors has responsibility for approving the reappointment or appointment of non-executive directors as recommended by the nomination committee or by a non- executive or chair appointment panel. Non-exec utive directors are appointed by the Council for an initial period of three years and subject to satisfactory appraisal appointments may be extended for a further three years. In exceptional circumstances a non -executive director can serve for a further year. The Council may also remove the Chairman or another non- executive director in accordance with the provisions set out in the constitution. Nomination Committee The Nomination Committee of the Council of Governors comprises public and staff governors and is chaired by the Trust C hairman. Its purpose is to select n on-executive directors and approve non- executive reappointment. 28In 2018/19 the committee met on four occasions and during the year the terms of reference and membership w ere reviewed.

NHS Improvement (NHSI) well-led framework In 2017/18 the Board commissioned an external well- led governance review which was carried out by Grant Thornton UK LLP1. The review w as based on the NHSI well -led framework and the details were reported in last year's Annual Governance Statement. In this reporting year the Board has taken assurance from the CQC's well -led inspection in May 2018 that there are robust arrangements in place to ensure that services are well -led. Further details may be found in the Annual Governance Statement on page xx. Before his departure , Sir Tim Melville Ross completed an evaluation report which concluded that the Board was performing well. Patient care activities The Quality Account at part 3 describes what the Trust is doing to develop its services and improve patient care. Stakeholder relations The Trust continues to maintain and develop relationships within the NHS, the local authority and education partners a nd community and patient representati ve groups. The Trust work s jointly with local commissioners and providers within the City and Hackney Transformation Board which oversees the strategy for integrating health and social care services across the boroughs. The Trust maintains good representation at each of the four associated workstreams, including the Unplanned Care Board which is chaired by the Trust 's Chief Executive. The Trust continues to work with NHS and l ocal authority partners as part of the East London Health and Care Partnership. The Trust is an executive partner of University College London Partners and a member of NHS Quest, a network of high performing NHS Foundation Trusts. The Trust has a statutory duty to collaborate with partners in health and social care. We have representation at Hackney HealthWatch meetings and we also attend Health Scrutiny Commission meetings which are held in public . The Trust is also actively engaged in the Health and Wellbeing Board for Hackney and is represented within its formal sub -structures. 1 Grant Thornton produced an independent report and has no other connections with the Trust 30Some of our key stakeholders have nominated representatives on the Council of Governors which enables them to receive regular service and performance updates al ong with elected representatives of members of the public living in local boroughs . Income disclosures Section 43(2A) of the NHS Act 2006 (as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2012) requires that the income from the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England must be greater than its income from the provision of goods and services for any other purposes. The Trust complies with this requirement as can be seen in the following table: \u00a3'000 Health care income 331,016 Non-health care income 4,493 Total income 335,509 The Trust has included within \"health care income\": all income from contracts for patient services , Sustainability & Transformation Fund income, and income for the use of the Trust's buildings and facilities where it is from another NHS body engaged in the provision of health care. During t he year the Trust received a total of \u00a316.4m funding in relation to Sustainability & Transformation funding. The Trust has included within \"non- health care income\": income from private patients; rental income from non -healthcare bodies; income from overseas visitors, and other miscellaneous non-healthcare related income. This income makes an additional contribution towards the cost of providing NHS health care and improving the services that the Trust can provide to its patients. Disclosure to auditors As far as the d irectors are aware, there is no information relevant to the audit which has not been disclosed to the auditors. The d irectors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. 31Remuneration report For the purposes of this report the disclosure of remuneration to senior managers is limited to executive and non-e xecutive directors of the Trust. In accordance with the c onstitution , executive director remuneration is determined by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board, comprising the Chairman and all n on- executive directors. The remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee of the Council of Governors. Both committees work to common principles and procedures. Remuneration levels are set taking into account the requirements of the role, market rates, the performance of the Trust, benchmarking information (NHS and public sector) and affordability. The committees are authorised to obtain external or other professional advice on any matters within their terms of reference, with due regard to probity and cost. No individual is involved in any decision that affects his or her own remuneration. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing, on behalf of the Board, the broad policy for the remuneration of very senior managers. It is also responsible for considering the performance of the Chief Executive and executive directors . The Trust does not award performance bonuses. The committee meets at least annually to review the Board structure, size and composition, to consider succession planning and to identify the required board level skills and knowledge. The committee must also meet as part of the process of appointment for e xecutive directors and decide on their remuneration. During 2018/19 Dr Deblina Dasgupta, Frances O'Callaghan, Catherine Pelley and Philip Wells were appointed as executive directors. Executive directors are required to give six months' notice to terminate their employment contracts. Non- e xecutive directors are required to provide three months' notice. All d irectors have permanent contracts. Non -executive directors are appointed for a period of three years in accordance with the Constitution. The Trust currently carries a provision of \u00a30.325m for early retirements relating to ex -members of staff. The Trust is required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration of the highest paid director and the median remuneration of the workforce. The remuneration of the highest paid director in the Trust in 2018/19 was \u00a3195,604 (2017/18 \u00a3167,407). This was 5.8 times (2017/18 5.3 times) the median remuneration of the workforce, which was \u00a334,027 (2017/18 \u00a331,754). The remuneration of the highest paid director increased in 2018/19 due to the receipt of a clinical excellence award by the incoming medical director . The remuneration of two Executive Directors is greater than \u00a3150,000. 2 In consideration of benchmarking information compared with peer trusts, the scope of the job roles and their responsibilities and the continued probity of the Remuneration Committee the Trust is satisfied that the remuneration is fair and reasonable. A further 18 employees received a salary which exceeded \u00a3150,000 when pro -rated. 2 \u00a3150,000 is the threshold used i n the Civil Service for approval by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury as set out in guidance issued by the Cabinet Office. Although the Cabinet Office approvals process does not apply to NHS Foundation Trusts the threshold is used as a benchmark for disc losure. 32Audited Analysis of Staff Costs 2018/19 2018/19 Other Total and wages 161,898 817 162,715 795 795 755 Social Security costs 17,457 17,457 15,679 Employer contributions to NHS Pensions Agency 18,787 18,787 17,960 Pension Cost - Other 14 14 5 Termination Benefits 41 41 255 Agency staff 13,527 13,527 12,187 198,992 14,344 213,336 202,484 The f ollowing table provides information on the remuneration of senior managers in the Trust in 2018 /19.

The Trust is well served by its Governors and volunteers who are not paid for their services. The element of the Medical Director's salary that related to their clinical role in 2018/19 was approximately \u00a338k. The following table provides information on the remuneration of senior managers in the Trust in 2017/18.

One of the Trust's directors during 2018 /19 is a member of the 1995 scheme and their normal retirement age is 60. The outgoing Director of Finance opted out of the NHS Pension scheme on commencing employment with the Trust in August 2016. There are no additional benefits receivable in the event of early retirement and no rights under more than one pension scheme arising for the Directors. There were no payments in the year in respect of \"golden hellos\", compensation for loss of office, or benefits in kind for any of the senior managers. As n on-executive directors do not receive pensionable remuneration, there are no entries in respect of pensions for n on-executive directors. A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is the actuarially assessed capital value of the pension scheme benefits accrued by a member at a particular point in time. The benefits valued are the member's accrued benefits and any contingent spouse's pension payable from the scheme. A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme, or arrangement to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme or arrangement when the member leaves a scheme and chooses to transfer the benefits accrued in their former scheme. The pension figures shown below relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total mem bership of the pension scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which the disclosure applies. The CETV amounts, and from 2004/ 05 the other pension amounts, include the value of any pension benefits in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to the NHS Pension Scheme. They also include any additional pension benefit accrued to the member as a result of their purchasing additional pensionable service in the scheme at their own cost. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Real Increase in CETV - This reflects the increase in CETV effectively funded by the employer. It takes account of the increase in accrued pension due to inflation and contributions paid by the employee (including the value of any benefits transferred from another pension scheme or arrangement). The CETV at 31March 2018 is discounted by the HM treasury discount rate. A common market valuation factor is then applied to the differ ence between this and the CETV as at 31 March 2019 to calculate the real increase in CETV. If a director or senior manager started during the year, the opening pension or cash equivalent transfer value (CETV) values will not normally be available and therefore the opening value or increase in year will be set to nil. Jonathan Wilson, Director of Finance, left the NHS Pension scheme on commencing employment with the Trust in August 2016 therefore the pension figures in the table below have been set to nil. 36Audited Pension Benefits of Senior Managers Name an d title Real increa se in pension at Pension Age Real increase in pension lump sum at Pension Age Total accrued pension at pension age at 31 March 2019 Lump Sum at pension age related to accrued pension at 31 March 2019 Cash Equivalent Transfer Value at 31 March 2019 Cash Equivalent Transfer Value at 31 March 2018 Real Increase in Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (bands of \u00a32,500) (bands of \u00a32,500) (bands of \u00a35,000) (bands of \u00a35,000) Executive 2.5-5.0 5.0-7.5 55-60 130-135 997 811 177 Jones D - Chief Operating Officer 2.5-5.0 2.5-5.0 25-30 55-60 382 279 101 Wells P - Director of Finance - - 0-5 - 11 - - Adam S - Chief Nurse and Director of Governance - - 50-55 155-160 - - - Pelley C - Chief Nurse and Director of Governance - - 30-35 100-105 612 - - Dasgupta D - Medical Director - - 40-45 110-115 811 - - Wilson J - Director of Finance - - - - - - - Kuper M - Medical Director - - 55-60 135-140 1,043 953 80 Waldron D - Director of Organisation Transformation 0.0-2.5 - 15-20 - 227 173 52 Nom ination and Remuneration Committee - Chairman's r eport The Nomination and Remuneration Committee met in October 2018 to consider e xecutive director performance and r emuneration. The meeting was chaired by Sir Tim Melville -Ross and also present were Sir John Gieve, Martin Smith, Susan Osborne, Vanni Treves and Polly Weitzman and Jude Williams . The meeting was also part attended by the Chief Executive and fully attended by the Company Secretary . 37The Committee considered the external context and wider salary and workforce situation at the Trust as well as current director salaries and benchmarking information. Following discussion , the Committee agreed to increase exe cutive director salaries taking into account individual performance , national pay awards and comparative benchmarking salary data. The components of senior management remuneration are confirmed in the table below. The Committee also met in May 2018 to consider executive director vacancies and approve the recruitment process for the Chief Nurse, Finance Director and Director of Strategic Implementation and Partnership. Components of Senior Management Remuneration Component Purpose Operation Opportunity Performance measu res Recovery Salary The Trust has 3 strategi c priorities Quality Integration Growth Executiv e directors are set annual performance objective s aligned to these priorities and lead on the deliver y of divisional busines s plans structu red around the same priorities. Executiv e directors are on spot salaries, which are agreed upon appointment. Salarie s are reviewed annually by the remuneration committe e who conside r both the market rate for the position, any alterations to scope and the performanc e of the individua l as assesse d in their PDR. A remuneration benchmarking report , based on a baske t of simila r trusts , is prepared for the Remuneration Committee. Executiv e directors are paid a flat salary that is not linked to performance outcomes. Based on performance and benchmarking decision s are made by member s of the Remuneration Committe e in respec t of the potential for pay awards. Executive directors along with all staff are assessed against both what they achieve (objecti ves) and how they achieve it (values and behaviours) as part of their annual PDR. There are no provisions for withholding payments. 3839f Staff report The number of staff directly employed by the Trust increased by 76.46 full-time equivalent (FTE) in . Excluded from these figures are pre and postgraduate health care practitioners who were placed with us for training, bank and agency employees , staff holding honorary contracts and catering and domestic personnel. In respect of the staff groups the Trust employs, this is presented below: Average number of whole time equivalent (WTE ) employees 2017/18 2018/19 Medical and dental 519 525 Ambulance staff 0 0 Administration and estates 804 701 Healthcare assistants and other support staff 740 756 Nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff 1,357 1,372 Nursing, midwifery and health visiting learners 0 0 Scientific, therapeutic and technical staff 552 651 Other 98 88 Total average numbers 4,070 4,093 Of these staff, 69% work primarily in an acute setting, 22% primarily in a community setting and 9% in corporate functions. Gender and Disability Analysis Gender 2017/18 % 2018/19 % Male 846 152 4% In total, 79% of our staff are female whic h is typical of NHS organisations. This proportion has increased by 1% since last year. At the end of the year there were seven male and six female members of the Board of Directors. 40Homerton publish ed its gender pay g ap report du ring the year a nd this i s accessible via the Trust's website. The pay gap has narrowed since reporting began in 2017/18 and we aim to build on this progress. I n the recent staff survey, 12% of staff declared they had a long- standing illness, health problem or disability. This represents a higher number than the recoded disability data. Supporting staff with their health and well-b eing is a key priority for the Trust. Staff performance indicators Performance against workforce indicators overall remains consistent, with the Board and the service managers receiving monthly performance information. Vacancy rates have steadily decreased over the last financial year from 8.89% at March 2018 to 7.50% at March 2019. The staff turnover rate has decreased over the last financial year by 0.08 percentage points. The highest increase in the turnover rate has been within the staff groups Add Prof Scientific and Professional and Allied Health Professionals. Staff support and wellbeing Employee health and wellbeing is a commitment that organisations must make throughout the employment lifecycle. This starts with health clearance at the pre -employment stage, ensuring staff are fit to undertake their appointed role and they will not be putting themselves or others at risk . This is followed by an on- going commitment from the organisation to ensure that the employee's health and wellbeing is not negatively impacted by the work or work environment. These are essential components for good employee relations and the provision of safe patient care. The T rust's occupational health (OH) service team has worked closely against a targeted action plan and has delivered some significant improvements. Firstly, close working with our recruitment team has led to an improved turnaround time for pre- employment health screening checks . Secondly , OH ha s performed well against key performance indicators (KPIs) for management referrals. In March alone, 77% of referrals resulted in staff being able to remain at work, with appropriate support. Similarly, early indications in relation to the Trust's Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) , implemented in January 2018, show that its therapy service has begun to have a positive impact on employees. Following therapy intervention 38% of employees returned to work. The Trust's sickness absence rate averaged 3.18% for the 2018/ 19 financial year. This is above our 3% target and is large ly attributable to a number of long -term absences. In 2018/19 the average working days lost to sickness per WTE based on a calendar year is shown below : Total Days Lo st 25,289 Total Staff years 3,517 Average working days lost (per WTE) 7 The si ckness management policy is widely used to ensure appropriate support is provided and attendance is managed in the interests of service delivery. The OH team regularly review s core employee health metrics, including reasons for referral and referral s by staff group and division. M ental health and musculo- skeletal concerns have been identified as the most common reasons for referrals. Further work is ongoing in these areas, including plans to deliver stress awareness workshops and an enhanced physiotherapy service. The OH service was recently re-a udited and remains SEQOHS accredited. 41Influenza Vaccinations During 2 018/19 NHS England set a Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) scheme to improve the uptake of frontline healthcare workers receiving the influenza vaccine to above 75%. This year's campaign saw a total of 2,391 (70.2%) frontline healthcare workers at Homerton receiving the vaccine; a slight decrease of 0.5% in comparison with the 2017/19 campaign. The Trust achieved a significant year -on-year improvement in the vaccinations for clinical staff where the uptake increased from 34% in 2016 /17 to 68% in 2017/ 18 and 79% in 2018/ 19. Planning for the 2019 /20 influenza campaign has already begun, to ensure appropriate resources are in place to provide as many vaccinations as possible. Staff involvement and engagement The Trust has a range of mechanism s to support the involvement of staff and staff representatives in the planning and development of services. The monthly 'Team Brief' system, involving presentations from the Chief Executive and other senior leaders is used to cascade key messages across t he Trust on a monthly basis. This is complemented with a printed quarterly staff newsletter (HomertonLife) , an electronic weekly newsletter (HomertonLite) and weekly managers ' briefing. In addition, quality impr ovement and learning opportunities are shared with staff through a monthly electronic bulletin (QTC). The Trust intranet continues to act as the primary information source for staff and it is kept up to date with news items and feature articles on developments across the Trust. This is supplemented by regular updates on the Trust Twitter feed and Facebook account. The Trust intranet continues to act as the primary information source for staff and it is kept up to date with news items and feature articles on developments across the Trust. This is suppl emented by daily updates on the Trust Twitter feed and Facebook account. The Trust's website and intranet have been subject to review during the year to ensure they are informative, relevant and easy to use. The Trust's staff engagement group oversees the development and delivery of the annual staff engagement improvement plan. The plan is informed by the annual staff survey, the quarterly staff friends and family survey, exit interview data and other local research. Building on the ICE creates work, which commenced in 2017/ 18; a range of tools has been launched to help embed our values in everything that we do. The tools include: the story of Homerton - statement of the Trust's purpose our values - a refreshed set of values, designed to better engage sta ff across the organisation the Homerton way - an articulation of what leadership means across the organisation and at all levels, so that it means something to everyone four functions of successful teams - a map for team success and how each member of staf f can identify with where and how they fit. 42The Joint Staff Consultative Committee and the Local Negotiating Committee (for doctors) are well established and meet regularly throughout the year. At year end, all elected staff governor positions were filled and their participation in Council of Governors' meetings supported. Staff survey In broad terms our 2018 staff survey tells us that our staff are proud of the care that they provide to our patients and they positively rate the safety culture, managers and engagement . However, ratings for morale, health and well- being, bullying and harassment as well as diversity and inclusion, do not score as highly and these are areas we are seeking improvement. The 2018 Staff Survey ran between September and November 2018 and was based on a whole Trust sample of 3,668 eligible staff. The Trust achieved a 52.4% response rate with 1,921 colleagues completing the survey which asked 90 core questions. This is an increase on last year's 50.4%; the average response rate for similar trusts was 40% and the best 53.8% . For the purposes of benchmarking, Homerton is categorised as a combined acute and community trust, of which there are 43 in total. In terms of our benchmarked group the Trust was above the average for the following themes: Immediate managers Quality of appraisals (= best) Quality of care Safe environment - violence Safety culture Staff engagement Our top five scores were: 2018 T op 5 scores (compared to average) 2017 Score Average Score 50% Q19e.

An action plan has been developed by the group's membership to ensure t he Trust can positively respond to the findings and act on the feedback provided. 44The action plan is built around a number of key themes and the actions are informed by feedback from a range of sources including an engagement project delivered in partnership with ICE Creates. Our focus has been on targeting support in the areas where poor staff experience has been reported. For example, the trust's employee assistance programme has been in place for a full year and is already starting to show ben efits to those who have used it . The delivery of the action plan is overseen by t he Workforce Committee. The table below summarises they key actions against each theme.

Tr ade Union Facility Time In acc ordance with the Trade Union (Facility Time Publication Requirements) Regulations 2017, the Trust is required to disclose it meets the criteria of having at least one trade union representative and at least 49 full time equivalent employees during any seven of the 12 month period of the annual report. The following disclosure is provided under Schedule 2 of the above Regulations and follows the guidance provided by the Cabinet Office.

There was a particular focus on Information Governance which reached 85%, its highest percentage since 2015. The compliance rate with regard to Adult Basic Life Support and Moving and Handling People remained above 80% in spite of staffing shortfalls. With the recent permanent appointments to both roles, we anticipate an improvement over the coming year. WRAP training (Workshop to Raise Awareness about PREVENT) , part of the government's approach to tackling radicalisation was introduced during the year . In th e first year it has been completed by 1883 people, 70% of the workforce. Work will continue over the next 12 months to raise staff awareness of this subject area and to improve compliance to a minimum of 90%. Leadership development The Trust ran successful leadership programmes in 2018- 19. A total of 45 staff took advantage of these opportunities and have provided positive feedback. The quality improvement (QI) element was strengthened within some programmes, and staff created impressive poster presentations of their work -based QI projects. In response to the staff survey which indicated that BAME staff are disproportionately represented in lower bands, the leadership programmes aimed specifically at Black, Asian and Ethnic Minority (BAME) staff (REACH) were oversubscribed and positively received. An analysis of the impact of these programmes on staff mobility and career development is being undertaken to understand the broad impact of these interventions. Through our work with our organisational development partner, 'ICE creates', we will be further refining and refreshing the content of our leadership programmes to ensure that Trust values and behaviours are integrated into the taught elements. In addition, we are developing a team leadership skills programme which will be made available to all staff with management responsibilities. We continue to offer a range of stand- alone leadership workshops to provide staff with key business and personal -effectiveness skills to succeed in their roles. The organisation continues to expand the Trust mentoring service to provide ongoing support and development for aspiring leaders and talented staff within the organisation. Apprenticeships The apprenticeship programme at Homerton has seen an increased number of apprenticeships in comparison to previous years. We have also seen staff progress with their development through higher level apprenticeships. There were a number of posts where it was not possible to fill with an apprentice due to a lack of suitable candidates. Nevertheless, there has been a creation of career development apprenticeship opportunities for exis ting staff in all pay bands. For instance, staff have been placed on the Assistant Project Manager Level 4 and Nursing Associate Level 5 apprenticeship courses. The Trust is continuing to offer apprenticeship courses in business administration, health care support, team leading and management. In addition to this, the Trust has procured the following apprenticeship courses: 47Business Administration Human Resource Management (CIPD) Nursing Associate Service Improvement Technician The Trust aims to continue pr ocuring and expanding the training opportunities for staff as new apprenticeship standards are approved and mapped to career pathways. We are working in partnership with NHS Trusts across London to procure a llied health professions apprenticeship degree courses, including p hysiotherapy and o ccupational therapy apprenticeship degrees, and continue to work with the North -East London Implementation Group for the Nursing Associate Apprenticeship. We have seen growth in our w ork experience programme in partnership with local schools and colleges . We have offered 35 administrative and clinical (non- medical) placements for work experience students between April 2018 and March 2019. We also hosted a number of career awareness sessions for students from local school s to introduce them to the variety of NHS health care roles. These were extremely popular and we will continue to support school careers fairs in 2019- 20. Workforce education and development The Trust continues to provide programmes of workforce education and training to support all staff in the delivery of safe, effective care and a positive patient experience. As part of our focus on increasing educational opportunities for front -line staff we have developed and commissioned new courses, such as Effective Receptionist , Professional Telephone Techniques and Effective Customer Care in Challenging Situations . We have developed a career pathway tool for non -clinical staff in pay bands 1- 7 and we are currently developing a similar model for staff in clinical s upport worker roles. Our mental health training for staff working in physical settings, delivered by our mental health colleagues, has been very popular and has increased staff awareness and resourcefulness in this area. The Trust is also continuing to us e simulation and e- learning as part of a blended approach to education and development . We have commissioned training with service user organisations to promote increased awareness of the experience of patients and their carers, particularly those with sig ht or hearing disabilities, when using our services. Our preceptorship programmes for newly qualified nurses have expanded with taught modules and support provided for 12 months following recruitment into post . Our Band 5 nurse post graduate programme cont inues to attract a full cohort of 12 staff each year. The Trust has taken advantage of the targeted funding from Health Education England (HEE) with regard to advanced clinical practice education programmes , for both allied health professionals and nursin g staff. 48We continue to review and refresh a number of programmes in response to feedback from staff and managers for both acute and community staff; we have provided Care Certificate training for a further 120 support staff, and have put in place assessment and Care Certificate training for a further 250 support staff. We continue to fully utilise our budget allocation from HEE to respond to workforce and education priorities and to take advantage of new low -cost initiatives, such as the shared learning approach to integrated urgent care pathways and the development of sector -side work - based learning for neonatal specialist training. Medical education In 2018/19 the Trust continued to demonstrate its commitment to the delivery of undergraduate and post graduate medical education. The results from the national GMC survey of d octors in training were positive. Feedback from the Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry Quality Visit was also very positive. The Trust has increased the numbers of medical students on placements and continued to accommodate physicians' associate students on placements. Initial feedback from students is good. H omerton has delivered regional teaching days for several specialties. Three Grand Rounds also took place during the course of the year and were well received. Dur ing the summer the trust accommodated 21 City and Hackney sixth form students for medical work experience. The simulation team also ran an 'Inspiring Future Doctors' day. The simulation centre was again successful in securing bids and delivering numerous courses, many in collaboration with other centres across the region and pan London. Among these were Return to Practice simulation for returning staff, a Transfer course delivered by the NE/NC London Adult Critical Care Network and Mental Capacity Assessment. The simulation team developed and delivered an innovative new programme in 2018, Resuscitative and Interventional Procedures in Simulation (RIPS). This was multi -professional for emergency medicin e trainees and senior Emergency Department and Resuscitation nurses. HEE are funding RIPS in 2019 and additional funding has been requesting to support the demand. In situ simulation is now embedded across the Trust as are regular courses. During the year , the eighth Homerton Simulation Conference 'Advances in Simulation and Virtual Reality for training: Even better than the real thing?' was held and received good feedback. The Newcomb Library continues to offer a much appreciated service to Trust staff and students on placement. The team is supporting quality improvement (QI), pathway development and patient care by providing literature searches ; 75 searches have been completed since April 2018. These are followed up with a questionnaire to determine current and future impact of the search. The Newcomb Library team were awarded third prize in the 2018 Health Education England Sally Hernando Innovation Awards that celebrate innovation in NHS libraries. The library team submitted an entry under the title, \"Understanding the Person: Insights into the Patient Experience\", outlining the impact of the library's collection of medically -themed graphic novels, cartoon books, memoirs and novels. The books in this collection enable health care professionals to gai n an insight into medical conditions from a patient perspective and can also be used in conjunction with other patient information to assist patients in the understanding of their conditions. 49Equality and d iversity Given the diversity of the population of Hackney well as the profile of staff employed by Homerton , the Trust is committed to do all it can to ensure it operates as an employer in the most inclusive manner possible. In doing this the Trust will be able to enhance its ability to deliver high quality health outcomes for patients and provide a positive employment experience for staff. The Trust's lead for equality and diversity is the Director of Organisational Transformation. The latest Equalit ies Report, performance against the Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) and our equality objectives are available on the Trust's website. All publication duties have been met. Diversity data Th e below table confirms the Trust's diversity data. In total 52% of staff at the Trust identify as from black and minority ethnic ( BME ) backgrounds. This is more diverse than the local population (45%) . Representation of BME staff at a senior level remains a priority for the Trust and in the last year our Board has become more reflective of the wider organisation. Ethnicity 2017/1 8 % 2018/ 19 % White 1737 45.2% 1743 44.3% Mixed 28.9% Asian or Asian British 15.7% Other Specified 164 4.3% 189 4.8% Stated 78 2.0% 64 16 0.4% 70 1.8% Total 3,841 3,937 To meet our equality objectives a Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Strategy is being developed and will outline what the Trust will do to support the cultural transformation set out in the NHS England Long Term Plan and the Trust's diversity aspirations. St aff Policies Rai sing Concerns (Whistleblowing) We encourage staff to raise concerns with senior managers about patient safety, criminal offences, breaches of legal obligations, miscarriages of justice, or the deliberate concealment of information. Our Raising Concerns at Work policy guides this process. Our Freedom to Speak Up Guardians offer confidential advice to support staff to raise issues with senior management. We continue to raise the profile of this service so that staff are aware of its benefits. 50Co unter fraud, anti- bribery and corruption The Trust has counter fraud, corruption and bribery policies for dealing with suspected fraud, bribery and other illegal acts involving dishonesty or damage to property. Staff can contact nominated officers in confidence if they suspect a fraudulent act. The nominated officers are the Director of Finance and the local counter fraud specialist, provided by Grant Thornton. Consul tancy Expenditure The 2018 /19 expenditure on consultancy was \u00a31.2m (2017/18 \u00a31m) and this included the cost of consultancy work around organisational development and support, advice on the development of the clinical services surgical review and additional specialist procurement support .

The NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, most recently revised in July 2014, is based on the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 2012. For the year ending 31 March 2019 the Trust complied with all the provisions of the Code as set out in NHSI 's Annual Reporting Manual 2018/19. Throughout this A nnual Report the Trust describes how it has met the Code's requirements. The table below provides a summary of where information can be found on the issues the Trust is required to disclose.

The framework looks at five themes: Qualit y of care Finance and use of resources Operational performance Strategic change Leadership and improvement capability (well -led) 5315 15 26 and 2825 15 15 15 28 29 15 24 - 24 and 61 55 56 20 - 20 32 19 and 29 25 24 25 15 and 28Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will only be in segments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. Homer ton is currently in segment 1, with no support needs identified across the five themes. Current segmentation information for NHs trusts and foundation trusts is published on the NHS Improvement website. Finance and use of resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4', where '1' reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding into the Single Oversight Framework, the segmentation of the Trust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score here.

I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Trust Accountable Officer Memorandum. The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. The Audit Committee reports on the adequacy and effective operation of the Trust's overall control system. In part icular it reviews, monitors and evaluates all aspects of financial risk management and oversees the policies and procedures for counter fraud, bribery and corruption activity, as well as oversight for the internal audit programme. Capacity to handle risk Throughout the reporting year the Trust has ensured that its risk management system receives the appropriate leadership and management. The Chief Nurse and Director of Governance is the executive lead for risk management and the Director of Finance has lead responsibility for managing financial risk. The Board of Directors has established a Risk Committee to provide assurance to the Board that the Trust has effective risk management processes. The Risk Committee has been in operation since 2005 and is chaired by a non -executive director (NED). Meetings are held on a quarterly basis. The Risk Committee: a)ensures that the Trust Risk Register is fit for purpose and has an appropriate structure is in place for the regular scrutiny and monitoring of risks; b)is k ept informed about all aspects of risk management through a variety of reports from sub-committees and working groups on clinical and other organisational risks; c)receives scrutiny reports from both internal and external sources including the CareQuality Commission; 56d)receives annual compliance reports from the Improving Patient Safety Committee, Information Governance Committee, Improving Clinical Effectiveness Committee,Improving Patient Experience Committee and the Resilience Committee (foremergency planning and business continuity) ; e)supports the development of risk management systems and helps to promote aculture in which risk management is seen as an integral component of all aspects ofhealthcare delivery. T he Board Assurance Framework (BAF) is the mechanism which is used to record the Trust's strategic objectives and manage the associated risks that threaten their achievement. The BAF is reviewed on a monthly basis by the Executive Directors and is formally reviewed by the Risk Committee and Board of Directors to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and mitigating action is being taken against the key risks. All Executive Directors take responsibility for risk identification, management and mitigation within their designated areas of work. Operational and other corporate risks are reviewed by the Board as part of its regular monitoring of performance through reports received, or in the context of specific issues that arise. There are internal processes to ensure that incidents which fit the national criteria for serious incidents are reported on the Department of Health and Social Care's Strategic Executive Information System (STEIS). The Trust's Improving Patient Safety Committee has oversight of serious incidents and receives a monthly report on serious incidents declared and reports completed that month. The Board is provided with a monthly report on serious incidents. The corporate induction programme ensures that all new staff receive information on the Trust's risk management systems and processes. This includes the comprehensive induction of all junior doctors with regard to key policies, standards and practice prior to commencement in clinical areas. The mandatory training programme ensures that essential training is delivered to st aff members, which includes risk management processes such as health and safety, manual handling, resuscitation, infection control, safeguarding patients, blood transfusion and information governance. In addition, specialist risk training is identified by managers for individual job roles and agreed with staff through personal development plans. Board members receive training in risk management awareness and an overview of the risk systems. The Trust is committed to continuous improvement and learning; from incidents and complaints, outcomes from audits and the experiences of patients, other service users and staff. The divisional Quality and Patient Safety Managers report regularly via the Head of Quality and Patient Safety to the Chief Nurse and Director of Governance. Best practice is highlighted and shared across divisions through the divisional leads, the Improving Patient Safety Committee and Improving Clinical Effectiveness Committee and their respective sub- committees. We seek to learn from both int ernal and external sources of good practice. 57During the reporting year a new serious incident process was implemented which has strengthened the handling of clinical incidents within the divisions. In addition we have reviewed our risk management software system (Datix) with the aim of simplifying the reporting of incidents and maximising the system's functionality to identify themes and trends. The risk and control framework The Risk Management Policy was reviewed by the Risk Committee in November 2018 and approved by the Board of Directors in December 2018. It describes the Trust's overall risk management approach, corporate and divisional responsibilities for risk, the risk management process and the Trust's risk appetite. The policy was revised to include a greater level of detail on the processes for risk assessment, risk approval, risk review and on identifying actions to mitigate risk with the intention of providing a comprehensive guide to staff on how risks are escalated from the front li ne to the board. The updated policy is available to all staff via the Trust's intranet. As set out in the Risk Management Policy, associate medical directors, divisional operations directors, senior nurses, and other relevant senior managers are responsibl e for the management of risk within the workplace. Together they foster a culture of risk awareness throughout their divisions and ensure that risk assessments for all work -based activity are conducted. The revised policy includes guidance on the risk assessment matrix used to evaluate risks for inclusion in the Trust's risk registers. The Head of Quality and Patient Safety is responsible for the maintenance of the Trust's risk register. Risk registers are also held within the divisions and they are subject to regular scrutiny. The Risk Management Policy confirms which risks need to be escalated to the next management level and describes the risk escalation route. Risks are classified as low, moderate, major and catastrophic, based on a consequence and likelihood matrix approved by the Board. While the Board recognises that risk is inherent in the provision of healthcare and its services, the Trust has an extremely low risk appetite for risks that could affect patient safety. Incident reporting is openly encouraged through staff training and the Trust's positive risk management. Risks identified from serious incidents that impact on public stakeholders are managed by involving the relevant patient and/or their family. During the year the Trust's risk manage ment culture was subject to internal audit. The review report advised that the Board could take reasonable assurance that controls were in place to manage risk that were suitably designed and consistently applied. Quality governance arrangements The quali ty governance arrangements within the Trust are organised through the divisional structure with each division headed by an operational and clinical lead, and with a governance structure in place that supports the achievement of all quality priorities. The divisions review quality governance and performance information on a regular basis, including incidents and serious incidents; patient experience feedback including Friends and Family Test; survey reports; complaints; Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) enquiries; litigation; clinical audit data and NICE compliance. Divisional performance is also monitored and reviewed each month against a range of performance measures including quality and safety at divisional performance review meetings. 58The Trust Management Board (Quality and Operational Assurance), chaired by the Chief Executive, meets monthly and reviews and monitors quality issues for the whole Trust. The Risk Committee, the Improving Quality Board, Improving Patient Safety Committee and the Clinical Effectiveness Committee also have an important governance role in the oversight of quality. The above committees and their supporting sub groups are used as conduits to disseminate information from the wards, departments and divisions to the Board and vice versa. This approach supports the process for enabling that improvement action is delivered at the point of care and it also provides a route for escalation of concerns and monitoring of mitigating actions to the Trust Board. Performance assessment The Board is provided with an integrated monthly performance report to evaluate the Trust's performance. The report is designed around the CQC's five key lines of enquiry and provides metrics and commentary to update the Board on progress against the Trust 's key performance indicators. The Board of Directors receives performance information each month in relation to: performance against national targets, including infection control, A&E waiting times, cancer access and referral to treatment (RTT) standards, which are accompanied by improvement plans if there are concerns in relation to any particular targets key performance indicators related to patient safety and clinical effectiveness, such aspatient safety thermometer results, numbers of falls and pressure ulcers, delayedtransfers of care and standardised hospital mortality ratios exception report from the maternity services dashboard patient experience data, including Friends and Family Test, PALs and complaints data key workforce metrics, such as agency spend, vacancy rates, turnover and sickness absence key financial performance data, including income and expenditure and a summary of Cost Improvement Programme (CIP) performance progress reports on the Trust's financial plan The Council of Governors holds the Board of Directors to account on its performance, including quality and risk. The meetings are held on a regular basis throughout the year and members of the public are able to raise issues directly at these meetings and at the annual members meeting. The y ear-e nd key performance indicators are confirmed on page 10 of the annual report. The T rust did not achieve the A&E 4-h our wait target during 2018/19 and the 62 day cancer wait target in quarters one and two. CQ C Registration The Trust is full y compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. In April 2018, the CQC inspected four core inpatient services at the main hospital site which included; emergency and urgent care, medical care (including older peoples care), s urgery 59and maternity services. Overall, the CQC rated Homerton University Hospital as 'good'. Urgent and emergency services and medical care (including care of the older person) were rated as 'outstanding' overall. In May 2018 the CQC conducted a well -led inspection which resulted in an overall rating of 'good' for this domain. The CQC inspected the Trust's community health services and the Mary Seacole Nursing Home in 2017. A 'good' rating was received across all domains. The Risk Committee receives regular CQC updates and reviews the CQC Insight reports to identify areas of deteriorating performance. Major risks A Board Assurance Framework (BAF) detailing the principal risks to the achievement of the Trust's strategic objectives was in place for the financial year. The key risks to the achievement of the strategic objectives include: failure to develop an engaged and motivated workforce may undermine the Trust'sability to deliver its services in accordance with its values and desired staff behaviours, resulting in a poor experience for the patient; the patient receives avoidable harm from poor practice as a result of a failure to comply with required Trust safety policies and lessons learned; if the culture within the Trust is not a learning one with openness and transparency supporting learning and improvement, it may result in the Trust falling short in the quality of care delivered to patients; a lack of adherence to latest research, or practice which is not compliant with the best evidence could lead to a less effective service provision; failure to achieve financial targets may result in difficulties in funding future investment plans and threaten the organisation's financial autonomy; poor reviews and performance outcomes by regulators, other bodies, the press and public may result in a damaged reputation that diminishes the Trust's ability to grow; failure to expand and retain sufficient activity through a failure to adapt and engage in local collaborative healthcare arrangements may limit the Trust's ability to increase turnover and maintain clinically sustainable services. The most significant clinical risk for the Trust is the ability to recruit and retain medical and nursing staff to ensure the delivery of safe, harm free care for patients. The Trust continues to monitor the number of clinical post vacancies and it will remain a major focus in 2019/20. The financial pressures within the health economy and the risks associated with the delivery of cost improvement efficiencies will continue to challenge the Trust in the coming year and may impact on the Trust's achievement of its control total and other financial targets. The Trust has comprehensive plans in place to mitigate the above risks which are assessed regularly by the executive team and reviewed by the Trust Board on a monthly basis and quarterly by the Risk Committee. The Trust recognises its risk management approach will not totally eliminate risk, but it will provide the organisation with a means to identify, prioritise and manage the r isks. 60Wo rkforce The Board receives twice yearly reports on the Trust's staffing levels. The reports include information to demonstrate how the Trust complies with the ' Developing Workforce Safeguards' recommendations. The Trust has a 2017- 2020 Workforce Strategy in place which is overseen by the Workforce Committee. The Board receives an assessment of staffing levels based on agreed tools and quality metrics in accordance with National Quality Board guidance on a monthly basis. The Trust uses care hours per patient day (CHPPD) information to assess the number of care hours provided on the wards. This assessment is benchmarked against all trusts to review the Trust's performance. During the year the Board has reviewed the impact of recruitment and retention actions on the overall nursing and midwifery staffing levels. Positive action has resulted in a reduction in the overall nursing and midwifery vacancy rate. The Trust continues to work to ensure safe staffing in all clinical areas. Foundation trust governance requirements The Board sets the vision, values and strategic direction of the Trust and is collectively responsible for its performance. The Council of Governors receives regular updates on clinical and financial performance and service delivery. The Governors meet jointly with the non-executive directors (NEDs) twice a year and the NEDs are available to answer questions in formal and informal settings to enable the Governors to discharge their duties. The Board is supported by our four committees and two executive led committees with a remit to monitor the effectiveness of risk management, quality, performance, financial sustainability, internal control and assurance arrangements. The Board of Directors receives regular assurance reports from its sub committees. The Board made a self -declaration in June 2018 that it was compliant with the conditions of the NHS provider licence and with no significant risks identified in relation to the corporate governance statement. Well led framework As mentioned above the Trust received a 'good' rating following the CQC's well -led inspection in May 2018. The CQC reported that: The trust leadership team had the experience, capability and integrity to ensure that the strategy could be delivered and risks to performance were addressed. Executive and non- executive directors were visible and approachable across the trust. The trust leadership team were knowledgeable about issues and priorities for the qualityand sustainability of services and largely understood what the challenges were to addressthese. The trust had a clear vision and set of values that prioritised the delivery of safe and effective patient care. The trust strategy was aligned to local plans in the wider health and social care economy and services were planned to meet the needs of a diverse local population. 61T he trust had effective governance processes to support the delivery of its strategy and ensure quality and performance information was reviewed and escalated appropriately. T he Board considered t he results of the CQC inspection in September 2018 and paid close attention to the report's findings . The Board approved an action plan which had been developed to address the issues raised. There were no significant issues raised with regard to the gover nance of quality. The clinical governance arrangements within the divisions have been reviewed in response to comments received from the CQC inspection in April 2018. The Trust's governance structure will be reviewed in 2019/20 to further improve the reporting lines between the divisions and committees. Together with the 'good' rating achieved from the NHS Improvement assessment of the Trust's use of resources in May 2018, the Board received assurance on the organisation's well-led capability. Other control measures The Standards of Business Conduct Policy was revised during the reporting year to reflect the 'Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS ' guidance and the Trust has published an up - to-date register of interests for decision- making staff. Cont rol measures are in place to ensure that the Trust is compliant with equality, diversity and human rights legislation. An equality impact assessment is completed for all new and revised policies, which is considered by the relevant committee and the Trust's Policy Group. The Workforce Committee is responsible for progressing actions to advance equality in the Trust and meet the standards set out in the NHS Equality Delivery Systems (EDS2). As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. The Trust has undertaken risk assessments and has a sustainable development management plan in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The Trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with. Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources The Trust has established processes in place to ensure that resources are used economically, efficiently and effectively. In addition to the financial review of resources and the quarterly monitoring returns to NHS Improvement (NHSI), all budget holders are provided with monthly financial information for the purposes of monitoring and control. The Board also receives financial performance reports on a monthly basis. 62 Internal audit reports consider value for money and KPMG is required as part of their annual audit to satisfy themselves that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources and report by exception if in their opinion it has not. The Trust has an internal performance management review process which provides evidence of divisional performance and the actions being taken to ensure resources are being used effectively and efficiently. In addition productivity and efficiency opportunities are identified as part of the annual business planning process. The Trust has a comprehensive Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) Programme Board in place to identify and deliver efficiencies against the Trust target for savings which is chaired by the Director of Finance. The Board of Directors and Council of Governors receive regular updates on progress and the risks associated with the Trust's cost improvement plans. The Trust received a 'good' rating from NHS Improvement's use of resources assessment in May 2018. Information governance The Trust's information governance (IG) work is led by the Medical Director, as the Caldicott Guardian and the Chief Operating Officer in his role as Senior Information Risk Officer. The IG Manager is the Trust's designated Data Protection Offic er. The Information Governance Committee is responsible for monitoring and controlling risks relating to data security and has oversight of the IG risk register. The Information Governance Committee reports to the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis, which in turn reports to the Board. All Information Governance security related incidents were reported to NHS Digital during 2018/19 and there were no level two incidents reported during this period. Also no breaches were reported to the Information Commissioner in the last 12 months. The Trust submitted evidence in support of all the 100 mandatory elements of the new Data Security and Protection Toolkit in March 2019. The Trust did not meet the 95% mandatory IG training compliance standard and an improvement plan has been agreed with NHS Digital. Annual Quality Account The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. The Annual Quality Account 2018 /19 has been developed in accordance with relevant national guidance and legislative requirements. NHS Improvement has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual quality reports which incorporate the above legal requirements. There are a number of assurances and controls in place to ensure the quality of data within the Quality Account, which includes: 63The Chief Nurse and Director of Governance leads on the production of the Quality Account at Board level. The Head of Quality and Patient Safety is responsible for drafting the QualityAccount, managing the consultation processes for planning priorities and feedback, and managing the process of regular reporting to the Trust Management Board. Plans for the achievement of the main quality priorities are developed, reviewed andassured by the Trust Management Board. Consultation is carried out with internal and external stakeholders, including the Council of Governors, and fed back to the Trust Management Board before the quality priorities are set for the coming year. The content of the draft report is reviewed by the Board and the Council of Governors. The Trust Management Board approves the final content of the reportbefore it is presented to the Trust Board. The Trust has a range of policies and procedures in place to support the achievement of thequality priorities and the management and use of its data and the information derived fromit. The data used within the Quality Accounts is a combination of Trust and Health and SocialCare Information Centre (HSCIC) generated information, which is subject to inherentlimitations and these are referred to in the Chief Executive's statement. Data quality is audited internally and externally Data qual ity is scrutinised routinely by commissioners External assurance statements on the quality report are provided by local commissioners, the Overview and Scrutiny committee (OSC), Healthwatch and our Governors as required by Quality Account Regulations. The Trust's Information Services Team produces information which is used in the Quality Account and for operational performance management, including the management of elective waiting lists. All of the information which is generated is subject to approval by senior managers before internal distribution or national return submission. The HSCIC indicator portal is also used in the preparation of accounts to ensure that nationally reported figures align with those being reported internally. The Trust also has a dedicated data quality team and an established corporate data quality framework for managing data quality. The Board has regularly reviewed the Trust's elective waiting time performance and other national performance standards. The Trust's auditors are actively engaged in the validation of the data used in the preparation of the Quality Account and any data quality issues are reported to the Audit Committee. Further details of the Trust's data quality processes can be found in the Quality Account. 64Review of effectiveness As Accountable Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the information provided in this annual report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board, the Audit Committee and Risk Committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. In addition, I gain assurance from the following third party sources: reports from the internal and external auditors and the local counter fraud specialist patient and staff surveys Care Quality Commission review reports The Trust's regular reporting to NHS Improvement provides additional assurance with regard to compliance with our licence conditions. The key considerations of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control can be summarised as follows: The Board has been actively involved in reviewing the Trust's risk managementprocesses and the Board Assurance Framework. The Board has played a key role inreviewing risks to the delivery of performance objectives through monitoring and discussion of the Integrated Board Report. The Risk Committee has overseen the effectiveness of all the Trust's risk management arrangements including review and endorsement of the RiskManagement Policy, the on- going development of the risk register and all key clinical and non- clinical risks highlighted by other committees. The Audit Committee has overseen the system of internal control, especially with regard to corporate risk and counter fraud, and it has actively engaged in the oversightof the Trust's key financial challenges. Internal Audit has reviewed and reported on financial controls and financial reporting,cost improvement plans, clinical audit and risk management culture, based on an auditplan approved by the Audit Committee. Where scope for improvement was found,recommendations were made and appropriate action plans agreed with management. Internal Audit provided consistent support and advice with regard to the system ofinternal control. The head of internal audit opinion did not, based on the work they undertook during the year, highlight any significant control issues. The opinion was the Trust had an adequate and effective framewor k for risk management, governance and internal control. Some weaknesses were identified in the application of some internalcontrols and management actions to address these weaknesses were agreed and are progressing. 6566 QUALITY ACCOUNT201 8-19 Quality Account CONTENTS Part 1: Statement on quality .................................................................................................. 2 1.1 Statement on quality from the Chief Executive ............................................................... 2 Part 2: Priorities for improvement and statements of assurance from the Board ........... 5 2.1 Priorities for improvement during 2019/20 ...................................................................... 5 2.2 Statements of Assurance from the Board ....................................................................... 7 2.3 Reporting against core indicators ................................................................................. 23 Part 3: Other Information .................................................................................................... 33 3.1.

We are proud to continue to perform well against our key performance and regulatory requirements while delivering high quality care for our patients and service users. The ongoing focus given to the quality improvement work is key to these achievements. Our Improving Quality programme has continued to lead and support improvement projects throughout the year. This approach has increasingly been applied to improvement work within the Trust and it also influences the approach to change across the wider system, particularly within Hackney and The City. The Trust continues to be key partner in the work associated with the establis hment and development of Neighbourhoods, enhancing the opportunity for multi -disciplinary working. The strong partnership approach also positively impacts on the management of urgent and emergency patients within the system, with all partners contributing to the success seen in the performance management of these pathways. The internal quality transformation work has once again explored the benefits of technological and system advancements and considered how these could improve the way we are able to offer care and share information effectively. This has resulted in a shift to a paperless outpatients service with pathways managed entirely through the use of digital technology and enhancements to health systems, from referral to communication back to the GP. Our next area of focus now needs to result in ensuring such opportunities are available to patients. The Trust also remains high performing in key areas of quality measures: A&E 4 hr waits - one of the best performing Trusts nationally S tandardised Hospit al Mortality Index (SHMI) -.one of the lowest in the country R eferral to treatment (waiting times) - 96.7% of patients wait <18 weeks Diagnostic waiting times - 99.8% of patients wait < 6 weeks for diagnostic procedures I mproving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAP T) -- 99.5% of patients wait <18 weeks to begin treatment Homerton attributable C Diff levels significantly below the national threshold set for thetrust - 3 cases against a threshold of 10 We have also welcomed the Care Quality Commission during the past year when they carried out inspection visits to the acute services based on the hospital site. Four service areas were reviewed as part of this inspection and three of the four ratings were improved. Urgent & Emergency Services retained the Outstanding rating. Medical Care, including older people's care also received an Outstanding rating. Maternity and Surgery both improved and were rated Good. Overall the Acute services were rated as Good, combined with the previous inspections for Community services and Mary Seacole Nursing Home, the Trust overall was rated as Good. This is a significant achievement and recognition for all staff across the Trust, reflecting the quality of service they provide to patients and their families on a daily basis. There are many examples of innovative and quality improvement examples that were successfully implemented in 2018/19 and these include: P age 3 of 68 The Acute Pain Team was recognised as the Team of the Year by the National Acute Pain Symposium. The award is just the beginning for the service with further developmentsplanned for the future including the development of pain link nurse roles, developing nurseled telephone clinics and growing and expanding the team further with the addition of tw o new trainee clinical nurse specialists. A range of new technological innovations have been introduced in outpatients aimed atimproving quality, safety and efficiency. A new voice recognition system using Dragon,aids the information entry in electronic notes and letter production. Doctors now also abl e t o access cardiology, endoscopy and radiology images directly from EPR via a new image archive, whilst a new app allows clinicians to safely take a clinical photograph with a smartphone. After scanning the QR code, the photo is directly uploaded into the appropriaterecord and then automatically deleted thus maintaining patient confidentiality. A newest part of the Trust's network of sexual health clinics opened at 80 Leadenhall in the heart of the City of London. The centre provides a range of services including testin g f or sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) and administering post -exposure prophylaxis preventing HIV infection (PEP). The clinic welcomed over 4,000 client visits in the first four months of opening. An innovative team of advisers from Redthread Youth Violence intervention Programmewere introduced into the emergency department to offer support and counselling to youn g peopl e who have or might be victims of violence. The Trust retained its Planet Mark accreditation f or a second year by showing good practice in sustainability including achieving a 9.6% total carbon footprint reduction in 12months and decreasing carbon emissions from buildings by 9.7%. The Trust dismantled its remaining smoking shelters and replaced them with additional bike racks. The Elderly Care Unit welcomed animal friends to patients. The \"Pets As Therapy\" schemeincreases a person's level of interaction and can reduce agitation, something that can be particularly helpful for people with dementia who can show symptoms of distress and agitation when in hospital. The Care Certificate programme was expanded over the year with 104 members of staff completing the programme. The Trust introduced a scheme to provide employment experience opportunities to peoplewith learning disabilities. The Trust has signed a commitment to supporting members of the armed forces as theyseek new employment opportunities on leaving the services. The Armed ServicesCovenant ensures that Homerton pledges to recognise the value serving personnel, reservists, veterans and military families bring to the organisation as well as ensuring that no member of the Armed Services Community should face disadvantage. Homerton has joined other local public service leaders in signing a No Smoking pledge.The pledge has been designed by the Smokefree Action Coalition and is endorsed by NMHs England, Public Health England and Health Ministers. Talking Mats have been introduced by the speech therapy team. The mats are a tool whic h i s used as a visual communication tool that is used with children and adults with a wi de r ange of communication difficulties. New developments have improved the environment of Mary Seacole Nursing Home. Thegardens were completely refurbished and new door pictures for wards were installed wit h ol d photographs reflecting local landmarks in Hackney. Lloyd Ward has been completely refurbished complete with a new reception area for visitors.Pa ge 5 of 68 PART 2: PRIORITIES FOR IMPROV EMENT AND STATEMENT S OF ASSURANCE FROM TH E BOARD 2.1 PR IORITIE S FOR IMPROV EMENT DURING 2019/20 We have agreed our annual priorities for 2019/20 which support our Organisational Strategy a nd consider some of our challenges. The annual priorities were agreed following consultation with staff and stakeholders including Governors, City and Hackney Clinical Commissioning Group and Healthwatch. The quality priorities, the rationale for their sel ection and how we plan to monitor and report progress are outlined below. All quality priorities have a timescale for achievement by 31 March 2020 and progress to achieve them is to be monitored by our Trust Management Board. Pat ient Safety (Safe) Priorit y 1 To reduce the number of community and hospital attributed pressure ulcers - carried forward from 2018/19 Rationale The Trust is unlikely to have achieved this priority in 2018/19 therefore has agreed to continue with this priority in 2019/20. The development of a pressure ulcer can cause significant long term harm both physically and mentally to a patient. This coupled with the impact of the resultant extended inpatient/community care provision can create avoidable financial pressures. There is continued national focus on the need to reduce the number of pressure ulcers. Work to reduce the rate of community acquired pressure ulcers link to the wider development of neighbourhoods in City and Hackney. Monitoring Improving Patient Safety Committee Report ing Total number of avoidable community and hospital acquired pressure ulcers at grade 2 and grade 3+ Numbers of pressure ulcer free days. Priority 2 Appropriate identification and management of deteriorating patients - carried forward from 2018/19 Rationale The Trust has agreed to continue with this important priority through the deteriorating patient group to build upon the work established in 2018/19. This priority will also include the timely identification and treatment of patients with sepsis. Monitoring Critical Care Committee, Improving Clinical Effectiveness Committee Reporting Implementation and measures established through the deteriorating patient group. Sepsis measures to mirror sepsis CQUIN. Priority 3 Reducing physical violence and aggr ession towards patients and staff - New priority Rationale The most recent national staff survey shows that more than 15% of NHS employees have experienced violence from patients, their relatives or the public. Implementation of the NHS Violence Reduction Strategy is to be a priority for the Trust to reduce the impact on staff and patients through improved training and prompt mental health support for staff. Monitoring Health and Safety Committee Reporting Local implementation of the national strategy. Clinical Effectiveness (Effective) Priority 4 Improving management of end of life patients for adults - carried forward from 2018/19 Rationale The Trust has agreed to continue with this important priority through the End of Life Board to build upon the work established in 2018/19 and the implementation of the End of Life Strategy 2018- 21. The key elements of the strategy being personalised end of life care, supporting our staff, improving environment and communication & information. This will include the wider partnerships the trust has with community organisations including the local hospice. Monitoring End of Life Board Reporting Implementation and measures of strategy to be established through the end of life board. Priority 5 Making Every Contact C ount - New priority Rationale Making changes such as stopping smoking, improving diet, increasing physical activity, losing weight and reducing alcohol consumption can help people to reduce their risk of poor health significantly. Making every contact cou nt (MECC) is an approach to behaviour change that utilises the day to day interactions that organisations and people have with other people to encourage changes in behaviour that have a positive effect on the health and wellbeing of individuals, communities and populations. Implementing MECC means providing their staff with the leadership, environment, training and information so that staff have the competence and confidence to deliver healthy lifestyle messages, to help encourage people to change their behaviour and to direct them to local services that can support them. Initially being implemented in maternity then the wider Trust. The delivery of MECC in the trust will contribute the wider prevention work stream priority across City and Hackney Monitorin g Improving Quality Board Reporting Metrics based upon implementation programme. Priority 6 Learning from complaints, incidents , claims and compliments - New priority Rationale It is fundamental that we listen to our patients and learn from their exper iences. We will carry out an in depth review of complaints, incidents , claims and compliments to better develop actions to ensure learning is captured and fedback to staff and shared across the organisation and practice is changed to prevent recurrence. Monitoring Patient Safety Committee Reporting Metrics to be established. Patient Experience Priority 7 Improving the first impression and experience of the Trust for all patients and visitors - carried forward from 2018/19 Rationale Creating positive fi rst impressions of the Trust for patients and visitors who are visiting the Trust is important in building trust and confidence in our staff and services. Receptionists are on the front line in meeting and greeting patients and visitors and therefore play a pivotal role in this. We will continue to develop a range of measures to support receptionists and their managers create a positive first impression for every service user and visitor to the Trust at every visit. Monitoring Patient Experience Committee Reporting Metrics based upon results of 2018/19 priority outcome - to include training and compliance with first impression standards. Priority 8 Getting Patients Moving - New Priority Rationale Move, gro ove and improve - Trust wide implementation of t he 2018 national EndPJParalysis campaign. The campaign focuses on encouraging patients in hospitals, where possible, to stop wearing their pyjamas or hospital gown when they don't need to. This is because wearing pyjamas for many patients reinforces the 'sick role' and can prevent a speedier recovery. Obviously the patient and their condition need to be taken into consideration and this principle cannot apply to every single in- patient, however for many, it's a matter of enabling them to get up, get dressed and get moving. Monitoring Patient Experience Committee Reporting Metrics to be established. Priority 9 Improvements in staff health and wellbeing - New priority Rationale Aiming to create a working environment which is beneficial to the health and wellbeing of our staff. All staff will be supported to maintain and improve their health and wellbeing and are encouraged to take reasonable steps to improve their own health and wellbeing. The goal is to inspire our staff to take a greater interest in the ir own health and wellbeing. Monitoring Workforce Committee Reporting Metrics to be established. P age 7 of 68 2.2 STATEMENTS OF ASSURANCE FROM THE BOARD We are required to include formal statements of assurances from the Board of Directors which are nationally requested to give information to the public. These statements are common across all NHS Quality Accounts. 2.2.1 Review of S ervices During 2018/19 Homerton Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (HUHFT) provided and/or sub- contract ed 68 relevant health services. Homer ton Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has reviewed all the data available to them on the quality of care in all of these relevant health services. The income generated by the relevant health services reviewed in 2018/19 represents 100% of the total income gene rated from the provision of relevant health services by Homerton for 2018 /19. 2.2.2 Participation in clinical audit National clinical audits are primarily funded by the Department of Health and commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) which manages the National Clinical Audit and Patients Outcome Programme (NCAPOP). Although National Clinical Audits are not mandatory, organisations are strongly encouraged to participate in those that relate to the services they deliver. It is ma ndatory to publish participation in National Clinical Audits in a Trust's Quality Account. A high level of participation provides a level of assurance that quality is taken seriously and that participation is a requirement for clinical teams and individual clinicians as a means of monitoring and improving their practice. Local Clinical Audit is also important in measuring and benchmarking clinical practice against agreed standards of good professional practice. The Trust participates in relevant n ational audits and confidential enquiries programmes as listed through the HQIP. All the programmes listed were asse ssed for relevance in 2018/19. During 2018/19 , 37 national clinical audits and five national confidential enquiries covered relevant health services t hat Homerton provides. During that period H UHFT participated in 98 % national clinical audits and 100% national confidential enquiries of the national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries which it was eligible to participate in. The national clinical audits and confidential enquiries that the H omerton was eligible to participate in during 2018/19 are listed in Appendix A. The national clinical audits and confidential enquiries that H omerton participated in, and for which data collection was completed during 2018/19, are listed in appendix A alongside the number of cases submitted to each audit or enquiry as a percentage of the number of registered cases required by the terms of that audit or enquiry. The reports of 15 N ational Clinical Audits were reviewed by us in 2018/19 and the Trust intends to take the following actions to improve the quality of healthcare provided. Table 1: Examples of changes from a n ational audit Audit Trust Actions National Joint Registry (NJR) Low consent rates docume nted for NJR data collection.

Modify the neonatal clinic referral to highlight babies scheduled for outpatient echo. 2. 2.3 Research Clinical research remains high on the Government agenda with continued funding to Clinical Research Networks (CRN) ring -fenced for the promoti on of research within the NHS. Research is written into the NHS Constitution and this has recently been reinforced through the CQC inspection process. In September 2018 the Care Quality Commission (CQC) signed off the incorporation of clinical research into its Well Led Framework (NHS Trusts) 1. This formally recognises clinical research activity in the NHS as a key component of best patient care. Thus, clinical research is no longer perceived as just a 'nice to do' exercise in the NHS - it is now a key part of improving patient care. Furthermore, the government reflect this consensus through the continued funding of the National Institute of Healthcare (NIHR). Dame Sally Davies, Chief Medical Officer for England, stated that 'Research is central to the NHS... We need evidence from research to deliver better care. Much of the care that we deliver at the moment is based on uncertainties of experience but not on evidence. We can only correct that with research.' 2 Homerton is committed to this path growing research capacity year on year. During 2018 between 130 and 150 studies were recruiting at any given time, with a total of 222 studies recruiting patients during 2018. We aim to open studies that are particularly relevant to the patients who are treated and cared for at Homerton Hospital and the wider population. We confirm with potential Principal Investigators that studies are in line with local clinical practice. During the lifecycle of each study the R&D team ensure that all governance and regulatory processes are approved and adhered to; recruit patients who are eligible for the trial; collect and maintain necessary data and accurately record the data; and finally confirm secure archiving of all necessary trial related documentation at the end of the study. Participation in research remains important to patients with over 94% of a national consumer poll indicating that it is important for the NHS to carry out clinical research, with a similar number saying it was important so that new treatments could be offered by healthcare professionals 3. The number of patients receiving relevant health services provided or sub- contracted by the Trust in 2018/19 that were recruited during that period to participate in research approved by a research ethics committee was 3078. This increase in recruitment has led to a consequential increase in the number of personnel in the research team . In 2018 we were fortunate to be able to support an apprentice as well as research nurses, research practitioners and administrative staff . 1 Well Led Research in NHS Trusts : A Briefing for Clinical Research Network Staff about outputs from the work to establish research markers in CQC inspection 2 Excerpt from video Enhancing patient care through research 3 Results of Censuswide consumer poll of people in England in September 2014 The team provide both an excellent and efficient service and H omerton performs consistently well and once again is top for value for money when compared to other mid- sized acute trusts in North Thames . R&D department is committed to growing researc h both locally and nationally and the department supports novice researchers setti ng out on an academic pathway. Currently there are three researchers , all in allied health professions, who are being funded through NIHR grants t o achieve ether an MSc or PhD. Additionally four members of staff are being funded for PhD studies through research income. We also offer support and advice for those seeking funding for projects. Success ful grants in 2018 include \u00a3500k for a fertility study under Dr Priya Bhide, and \u00a31m for a study in neonatology under Dr Narendra Aladangady. We further promote, develop and support researchers at the annual conference offering the opportunity to share research findings and hear the exper iences of veteran researchers. The 2018 conference covered many topics and introduced us to our keynote speaker: Dr Chris Turner, University Ho spitals Coventry & Warwickshire; who spoke about \"Why Civility Counts in a Complex World\" a salient and important discussion. Patient involvement in research Both nationally and locally we seek to gain opinions and views of patients involv ed in all aspects of research. We encourage researchers to involve pati ents/lay members of the public in the design of their research thus enhancing the acceptability of the research to service users. We also host a stall in the reception area of the Trust to engage and inform members of the public in the research being under taken locally. Nevertheless, in our 2018 survey only 26% of our respondents were aware that Homerton were involved in research activity prior to being recruited to a study. A taste of research activity at Homerton STOPPIT 2 - Prematurity is thought to account for over 70% of twin neonatal deaths and adversely affects fetal survivors, with increased risks of future respiratory problems, motor and sensory impairment, learning difficulties and social and behavioural difficulties. Twins alone account for over 20% of neonatal unit cot stays, a significant excess given they comprise only 2% of all births. Together, the complications of preterm birth result in an estimated annual cost of \u00a32.9 billion to the public purse in England and Wales (2006 prices). There is a clear expressed need for innovative interventions to reduce preterm birth in both high - income and low -income countries. The 2011 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Multiple Pregnancy Guideline Group noted that bed rest at home or in hospital, progesterone, cervical cerclage and oral tocolytics are all ineffective at preventing preterm birth in twins, concluding that alternative effective interventions are urgently required. STOPPIT -2 is a multicentre open -label randomised controlled trial of the Arabin pessary (CE marked device) versus standard treatment in women with twin pregnancy recruited from NHS antenatal clinics. The study is in two phases: a screening phase, in which women with a short cervix (cervical length of 35 mm) are id entified, and a treatment phase, in which women with a short cervix will be randomised to either treatment with Arabin pessary or standard treatment. The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the Arabin cervical pessary reduces spontaneous preterm birth in women with a twin pregnancy and a short cervix (35 mm). The study, which commenced in January 2016, has consented 72 patients and has randomised 26 patients at Homerton. Homerton is the sixth recruiting site out of 56 participati ng Trusts nationwide and has played a key role in the achievement of the national target of 500 randomised patients. P age 13 of 68 Microbial Colonisation and Immune Responses in Preterm Babies - Necrotising Enterocolitis (NEC) and septicaemia disproportionately affect i nfants with extreme prematurity or low birthweight. Both carry high rates of mortality and morbidity and can impact significantly on neurodevelopmental outcomes in survivors. A number of previous studies have shown that the preterm microbiome is different from the microbiome of term babies with typically more potentially pathogenic bacteria seen. There have been some studies that suggest these abnormal pathogenic bacteria are associated with an increased risk of NEC and septicaemia. Little is known about how the immune system develops in preterm babies and what factors alter immune responses. This local study looked at the relationship between the developing immune system and the preterm intestinal microbiome. Babies admitted to the Homerton NICU and born between 23+0 to 31+6 weeks gestation were recruited with written informed consent. Stool samples were collected every day and weekly gastric aspirates were collected and stored to evaluate intestinal colonisation. Blood samples were also taken weekly and when babies were being evaluated for suspected infection to assess the immune responses. 143 babies and more than 6000 biological samples were collected during the study. To date, outputs from this study have been presented at: The European Federation of Microbiology (Valencia Spain); The Neonatal Society (Dublin, Ireland); The London Microbiome Meeting (GSST, London); The Pediatric Academic Society Meeting (Toronto, Canada) and the British Soc iety of Immunology (London). Discover Study - The DISCOVER stud y is a clinical trial of PrEP to test whether a combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) is as and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, F/TDF) at reducing the risk of HIV infection when used as PrEP. F/TAF was recently approved for HIV treatment, but it is not yet known whether it is effective as PrEP This international multi-site study is a double blind randomised controlled trial where participants in the study are randomly allocated to get either active Truvada\u00ae and placebo F/TAF or active F/TAF and placebo Truvada\u00ae. Neither the participants nor the study clinicians will know which drug the participant is taking until the end of the study. Participants are followed up three monthly for two years and are told which drug they were getting at the end of study follow up. The eligible population for this study is men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men. This study is funded by Gilead Sciences and enrolled 5000 patients at 92 study sites across the United States, Canada and Western Europe. Homerton recruited 49 patients in to this study and currently everyone in follow up. APPIPRA - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease and can affect any racial group with a higher rate in women. It causes painful, stiff and swollen joints that if left untreated can lead to deformity of synovial joints and significant disability. There is no cure for RA but Professor Andrew P Cope and his team at Kings College London are trying to determine if it can be prevented with their trial 'Arthritis Prevention in the Pre -Clinical Phase of RA with Abatacept' (APIPPRA). APIPPRA is one of 11 studies that Homerton is currently running within the Rheumatology Department. It is a randomised, multicentre, placebo controlled, double- blind clinical trial of abatacept. APIPPRA closed to recruitment earlier this year having met the target of 206 subjects, five of whom who were recruited here at Homerton. Abatacept is a new drug in the class of 'selective costimulation modulators' and is already licenced for the treatment of RA. Participants were eligible if they have the presence of arthralgia and are positive for rheumatoid antibodies but do not yet have joint swelling. They were given a year's course of either a placebo or abatacept. We are now in the follow- up phase of this trial and meet with each participant every three months for a further year. We are collecting data including DNA samples, routine bloods, x -rays, joint ultrasounds, Disease Activity Scores, clinical assessments and quality of life questionnaires. Patients benefit from being seen by their clinicians at three monthly intervals and from the potential to receive a medication that is not routinely available to those with pre- clinical RA. Their participation will help to determine the feasibility, efficacy and acceptability of abatacept for RA prevention for future patients in a similar position to themselves. 2.2.4 Goals agreed with Commissioners Use of the Commissioning for Q uality and Innovation ( CQUIN ) payment framework The CQUIN payment framework aims to embed quality at the heart of commissioner- provider discussions and indicates that we are actively engaged in quality improvements with our commissioners. Achievement of the CQUIN quality goals impacts on income received by the Trust. During 2018/19 the Trust continued to work with the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) scheme to drive quality improvements across the organisation. A proportion of the Trust income in 2018/19 was conditional on achieving quality improvement and innovation goals agreed between the Trust and any person or body they entered into a contract, agreement or arrangement with for the provision of relevant health services, through the Commi ssioning for Quality and Innovation payment framework. Further details of the agreed goals for 2018/19 and for the following 12 month period are available electronically at: https://www.engla nd.nhs.uk/nhs -standard- contract/ The monetary total for income in 2018/19 conditional on achieving quality improvement and innovation goals was \u00a36.146m and the monetary total for the associated payment in 2017/18 was \u00a35.464m. In 2018/19, the Trust continued to hold three major contracts that encompassed a number of CQUIN schemes; the acute services contract, the community health services contract and the NHSE contract (which encompasses specialised services, public health services and acute dental services). However in 2017/18 last year, there was a significant change to the way CQUINS were delivered. For the first time, NHSE published a programme of two year CQUIN schemes. The purpose was to provide more certainty and stability on the CQUIN goals leaving m ore time for health communities to focus on implementing the initiatives. The current CQUIN programme runs from 2017- 2019. Appendix B provides details of the Trust's 2018/19 CQUINs. 2.2.5 What others say about H omerton Care Quality Commission (CQC) Homert on University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is required to register with the Care Quality Commission. Its current registration status is 'registered with the CQC' with no conditions attached to registration.' The Care Quality Commission has not taken any enforcement actions against Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust during the reporting period 2018/19. There were no special CQC reviews or investigations during the reporting period for the Trust to participate in. P age 15 of 68 CQC Inspection of acute services. An inspection of Homerton acute services was carried out by the CQC during April 2018, followed by a 'wel l-led' inspection in May 2018. The four core services inspected were Urgent and Emergency Care; Medical Care; Surgery ; and Maternity care. The CQC took into account the current ratings of the other four services that were not inspected at the time and aggregated these with the services they did inspect, which resulted in the Trust achieving an overall rating of 'Good'. The core services of Urgent and Emergency Care and Medical C are, including older people's care each received the highest rating of 'Outstanding' overall. T he CQC found areas of 'Outstanding' practice across all the core services inspected which are highlighted in the inspection report. Examples of this include Urgent and Emergency Care There was an active quality improvement programme in place which was monitored by twoconsultants The service performed consistently better than the England average for patients admitted,transferred or discharged within four hours between February 2017 and March 2018 95% of patients between March 2017 and February 2018 would recommend the service tofriends and family There were good protocols in place for the recognition and management of sepsis Medical Care The division that managed medical services also included the delivery of local communityservices which facilitated the integrated delivery of care for patients on their transfer frominpatient to community teams Flow through the medical wards was excellent, facilitated by effective streaming of patients through the assessment unit and on to the speciality wards. Despite a busy winter period,patient f low was well managed enough to not need to use the hospital escalation ward The Trust had one of the highest rates of referral for patients with sickle cell anaemi a and t halassaemia in the UK. The Medical Day Unit provided specialised and targeted health promotion, diagnosis, treatment and follow up (as well as crisis support) for patients Medical w ards had access to a number of clinical nurse specialists to meet the needs of local patients. This included access to a dementia support team, mental health liaison,critical care outreach and various oncology nurse specialists The CQC highlighted a number of areas for improvement. These included: The need to improve the capacity and sustainability of the adult safeguarding team toensure timely completion of safeguarding referrals and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards(DoLS) assessments, monitor incidents, provide engagement with other agencies, andensure the consistent delivery of training for staff Increase the mandatory training completion rates for medical staff in Surgery and Maternityto meet the Trust target of 90% and for nursing staff in Surgery who did not meet T rust targets for most mandatory training modules Eliminate the inconsistent hand hygiene practices carried out by doctors and midwives i n m aternity services Reduce the varying understanding and gaps in the compliance of the WHO surgical s afety checklist and its use among staff in maternity services An action plan has been developed to address the CQC's recommendations. Good progress is being made against the actions which are monitored and reported on, through divisional and Trust -wide committees. 2.2.6 NHS n umber and General Medical Practice Code Validity The patient NHS number is the key identifier for patient records. Accurate recording of the patient's General Medical Practice Code (Patient Registration) is essential to enable the transfer of clinical information about the patient from a Trust to the patient's General Practitioner (GP). Homerton submitted records during 2018/19 to the Secondary Uses Service for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics which are included in the latest published data. T he percentage of records in the published data for April 18 - Mar19 : w hich included the patient's valid NHS number was: w hich included the patient's valid General Medical Practice Code was:SUS Dataset Trust London NationalPerformance against LondonPerformance against National age 17 of 68 The Trust continues to fo cus on this area to ensure that high quality information is available to support the delivery of safe, effective and efficient clinical services and support accurate and complete data submissions. 2.2.7 Information Governance (IG) Information Governance ensures necessary safeguards for, and appropriate use of, patient and personal information. The Information Governance Toolkit is a performance tool produced by the Department of Health (DH) and now hosted by NHS Digital. It draws together the legal rules and central guidance related to Information Governance and presents them in one place as a set of Information Governance requirements. The Trust submitted evidence in support of all the mandatory elements of the new Data Security and Protection Toolkit in March 2019. The Trust did not meet the 95% mandatory IG training compliance standard and an improvement plan has been agreed with NHS Digital. 2.2.8 Clinical coding error r ate Clinical coding translates the medical terminology written by clinicians to describe a patient's diagnosis and treatment into standard recognised codes. The accuracy of this coding is a fundamental indicator of the accuracy of patient records. Clinical c oders collect, collate and code clinical information, relating to the diagnosis and operations for the patients admitted to the hospital. This data is essential for the effective management of the Trust, and also forms the basis for clinical audit, clinical governance reporting and payment. Homerton was not subject to the Payment by Results (PbR) clinical coding audit during 2018/19 by the Audit Commission. The Audit Commission has closed. The Clinical Coding department supports patients' care by providing ICD -10 DIAGNOSTIC codes and OPCS procedure codes that are used for a variety of purposes, including payment and Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratios. The department codes around 70,000 admitted spells (approx. 93,000 FCEs) a year across a wide range of specialities. The Trust has an internal Clinical Coding Audit post that is responsible for auditing the accuracy of the Trust's clinical coding on a monthly basis. This is further supported through specific external audits undertaken by independent coding auditors to ensure that the accuracy of the Trust's coding is of a sufficient standard. In 2018/19, an external audit was undertaken in Trauma & Orthopaedics the results of which are set out below. The aims of these audits were to focus on improving the quality of our data and focus on providing a high quality, accurate coding service. Primary diagnosis correct 95.2% Secondary diagnosis correct 80.2% Primary procedures correct 85.1% Secondary procedures correct 83.9% * The results should not be extrapolated further than the actual sample audited. 167 FCEs were sampled.SUS Dataset Trust London NationalPerformance against LondonPerformance against to i mprove data quality Accurate and timely data is essential to provide robust intelligence and allow sound clinical and strategic decisions to be made. The Trust continues to ensure that high quality information is available to support the delivery of safe, effective and efficient clinical services and support accurate and complete data submissions. A Data Quality Committee chaired by the Chief Operating Officer met four times last year. Through the use of data quality indicators for both acute and community services the committee is a vehicle for data quality improvement and awareness within the Trust. The committee promotes and maintains robust processes for creating and managing accurate information within the organisation and ensuring that information that leaves the organisation is of the highest quality. The Trust will be taking the following additional actions to improve data quality in 2019/20. Engage in relevant national conferences and workshops in relation to clinical codin g s tandards . Develop further new data quality indicators . Provide staff with any additional training and developmental support required or identifiedto maintain skills, knowledge and data management. Implement a formal internal rolling programme of audit . Maintain close working relationships with clinical services . Continue to use benchmarking data to enable the Trust to identify areas of opportunity i.e. where the Trust is benchmarked as being a negative outlier . Develop internal programme of quality improvement to ensure the avai lability of clinical information is enhanced, thus ensuring clinical coders have easy and quick access to allrelevant clinical information. Engage an external auditor to undertake a comprehensive independent review of the Trust's clinical coding . 2.2.10 Learning from deaths This is section of the Quality Report that NHS Trusts are required to include was introduced in 2017/18. In March 2017 the National Quality Board published a document called 'National Guidance on Learning from Deaths: A Framework for NHS Trusts and NHS Foundation Trusts on Identifying, Reporting, Investigating and Learning from Deaths in Care'. The purpose of the guidance was to help initiate a standardised approach to learning from deaths. All deaths are reviewed by the primary clinical team and also discussed at a multi -professional forum to learn from every death. During 2018/19, 387 patients died at Homerton Hospital. This comprised the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: 91 in the first quarter 79 in the second quarter 112 in the third quarter 105 in the fourth quarter By 31 March 2019, 296 case record reviews and 10 investigations have been carried out in relation to 387 of the deaths during 2018/19 In 11 cases a death was subjected to both a case record review and an investigation. P age 19 of 68 The total number of deaths reviewed was 296. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record review or an investigation was carried out was: 75 in the first quarter 64 in the second quarter 98 in the third quarter 59 in the fourth quarter (as of 30th April 2019) 7 of the 387 (1.8%) of patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. In relation to eac h quarter, this consisted of: 3 of the 75 deaths (4%) reviewed for the first quarter 1 of the 64 deaths (1.6%) reviewed for the second quarter 1 of the 98 deaths (1%) for the third quarter 2 of the 105 deaths (1.9%) for the fourth quarter (as of 30th April 2019) 2 representing 1.3% of the patient deaths during quarter 4 of 2017/18 are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. These numbers have been achieved using the CESDI score methodology supported by the learning from deaths guidance. Please see below a summary of some of the learning identified following case record reviews and investigations for 2018/19: Lack of focus on advanced care planning in oncology patients Delayed transfers of care. Difficulty starting individualised end of life care plan when family may not agree Good palliative care input. Delays in transfers to Nursing Homes may add to risk of decline. Difficulty establishing preferred place of death/appropriate discharge location Death certification information/discharge letters not on EPR. Appropriateness of ITU interventions. Delays in discharge preventing meeting Preferred Place of Death (PPD). Communication with family as well as with professional teams. Delay in appropriately focused diagnosis and/or treatment. Please see below a summary of the actions which the Trust has taken in 2018/19 and actions it proposes to take following the reporting period as a result of the learning. Implementation of an online mortality review tool. D eveloped a formal checklist for blood gases to ensure entire sample is reviewed i n a s ystematic manner. Audit of NEWS scores Developed a Poster detailing all the vascular access mid lines and long lines utilised i n t he trust to be displayed in the CT contr ol room. Review by Thrombosis Committee of the two thrombolytic agents in use in the Trust. Staff to receive training on pain in delirium. Review of written consent process in gynaecology Raised awareness about aortic dissection. Please see below a summary of the impact of actions taken in 2018/19 Deteriorating Patients It was recognised that there were a number of issues with the management of deteriorating patients, including delays in escalation to ITU, lack of or slow escalation, tolerance of abnormal physiology and poor handover. As a result, the Deteriorating Patients task and finish group was relaunched at the request of the Medical Director in September 2018, with a remit to look at education, NEWS 2 implementation, to review the hospital at night model and to develop guidelines for escalation and referral to critical care. There have been a number of key achievements: Improved nursing escalation - from August to December 2018, the number of patients with a NEWS score of 5 or over who were escalated appropriately increased from 53%to 73%. The documentation is significantly better, and the changed assessment in EPRhas also helped. There has been a reduction in delayed ITU referrals, reduction in inadequate medicalteam response and delayed nursing response, and fewer incidents recorded of staff tolerating patients with high oxygen requirements. Reduced number of bleeps going to the wrong place at night time . The Group is led by the Medical Director, Chief Nurse and Clinical Lead for the Acute Care Unit, with support and input from the Chief Registrars, ITU, ED, IT, surgery, the Critical Care Outreach Team, the Simulation Lead, Education and Training and the Patient Safety Team. Online Mortality Review Tool The Trust ability to track and report on mortality reviews has improved since the introduction of the mortality review tool and additionally the number of reviews is increasing and all deaths are being reviewed in a multidisciplinary forum to facilitate learning. Over the last year, the Trust has been developing an online Mortality Review Tool. The tool has been developed under the guidance and leadership of the Medical Director and the Specialty Mortality leads, who have played a crucial role in ensuring the tool is fit for purpose. The tool is a liv e web - based system, linked to EPR, which is designed to help clinicians review deaths in a systematic and consistent way. It is based on the existing paper- based tool, and is accessible to all staff involved in the mortality review process. There are a number of advantages over the existing paper based system, including: Ability to identify and track themes and areas of good practice. Ability to record family concerns so that they can be linked to the review process Automatic link to EPR, so that teams can more easily identify the patient deaths requiring a mortality review Area to record details of SI investigations to better link up learning. Improved reporting so that data, themes and learning can be more easily identified, and so that reminders can be sent where reviews are overdue. Following implementation of our online mortality review tool in October 2018 we have been better able to draw together more comprehensive learning and aim to strengthen the way we share learning. This will have the net effect of providing clarity around themes which may not have been joined up across the organisation previously. The impact of the implementation of the online tool will in time allow identification of high impact communication streams and projects as a consequence of thematic learning as well as consolidating the existing newsletter process. P age 21 of 68 Coordinate My Care The Trust collaborates actively with City and Hackney primary care colleagues to allow system wide participation in Coordinate My Care (CMC). CMC is used as the shared urgent care plan to improve patient care. A CMC care plan supports a patient if they have an urgent care need. Health care professionals should be more informed about the patient they are attending to and better able to provide care in accordance with the patient's needs and wishes. A CMC care plan should help to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions as well as improving coordination of care for patients at the end of life by giving professionals the information they need at the first point of contact with a patient in an urgent care situation. CMC has been adopted in City and Hackney for the following groups of patients: End of Life Care Register Proactive Care Practice Based Register (including High Intensity Users) Proactive Care Home Visiting Register C&H Nursing Home Patients Patients with Dementia under the Diagnostic Memory Service (ELFT) The first phase has achieved the creation of care plans and work is continuing to ensure there is access to those care plans by the wider urgent care system and that the care plans are of sufficient quality to be fit for purpose. 2.2.11 Seven day services NHS t rusts are required to include a statement in their Quality Report regarding implementation of the priority clinical standards for seven day hospital services. Ten clinical standards for seven day services in hospitals were developed in 2013. These standards define what seven day services should achieve, no matter when or where patients are admitted. Four of the 10 clinical standards were identified as priorities on the basis of their potential to positively affect patient outcomes. These are: Standard 2 - Time to first consultant review Standard 5 - Access to diagnostic tests Standard 6 - Access to consultant -directed interventions Standard 8 - Ongoi ng review by consultant twice daily if high dependency patients, daily for others Homerton made good progress with implementation of the four standards and has m et both standards five and six. Two main challenges exist with regard to standard two. Firstly given the relatively low numbers of patients developing appropriate consultant rotas across surgical specialities has been a challenge. Following recent work undertaken the Trust would expect performance to improve in future. Secondly the challenge exists with regards to overnight admissions in terms of prioritising the review of acutely unwell patients against chronological review of all admissions on the morning post take ward round. It is important to stress that those patients not reviewed within 14 hours missed the expected timely review by a short margin. With regard to standard eight the Trust's current model is to have 12 hou r consultant presence on the Acute Care Unit seven days a week. This means all admissions during this period are reviewed in real time and critically unwell patients are reviewed as regularly as necessary. This model ensures the daily review of over 90% of emergency admissions, however it doesn't cater for two structured ward rounds as stated in the standard. There is no current evidence that this leads to any detriment in patient care or missed opportunities for early recognition of deteriorating patients. 2.2.12 Speak up Safely The Trust has a Freedom to Speak Up: Raising Concerns at Work (Whistleblowing) Policy and Procedure in place which details how staff can raise concerns informally and formally as well as the feedback mechanisms required when concerns are raised. It also includes protections for staff raising concerns. The Trust Board of Directors receives a six monthly Rais ing Concerns at Work report w hich includes content from the Freedom to Speak Up Guardians as well as additional information on live/closed formal cases that have occurred in the reporting period. In addition there are two Freedom to Speak up Guardians in t he Trust to promote the need for staff to speak up where issues of concern arise as well as support them in doing so. In addition there are two designated Board Leads one Executive Director and one Non- Executive Director. 2.2.13 Rota gaps Homerton has had a Guardian of Safe W orking in place since the implementation of the new junior doctors ' contract in 2016. Their role is to monitor the exception reports that come in and ensure any issues are addressed in a timely manner. Currently we have a 92% fill rate across medical and dental. Any vacancies in rota's are filled on a temporary basis by bank or agency doctors, whilst the post is advertised and a substantive/fixed term doctor is appointed. In the last six months we have advertised on 50 occasions for junior or senior clinical fellow posts. The Trust Board of Directors receives reports from the Guardian of Safe Working which includes details on fill rate and actions taken across the trust to support junior doctors. P age 23 of 68 2.3 REPORTING AGAINST COR E INDICATORS All NHS foundation trusts are required to report performance against a core set of indicators using data made available to the T rust by NHS Digital. Where the req uired data is made available by NHS Digital, a comparison has been made with the national average and the highest and lowest performing trusts. The data published is the most recent reporting period available on the NHS Digital website and may not reflect the Trust's current position (please note that the data period refers to the full financial ye ar unless indicated). All data provided is governed by standard national definitions. All T rusts are also required to include formal narrative outlining the reasons why the data is as described and any actions to improve. 1.Summary Hospital -level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) and patient deaths with palliative care The SHMI reports on mortality at trust level across the NHS in England. SHMI is the ratio between the number of patients that die following hospitalisation and the number of patients expected to die based on the national average and on the particular characteristics such as comorbidities of our patients. It reports on all deaths of patients who were admitted to hospital and either died whilst in hospital or within 30 days of discharge. The Standardised Hospital Mortality Indicator is unaffected by palliative care coding. SHMI has three bandings: higher than expected, as expected as and lower than expected. If the number of deaths falls outside the 'as expected' range, then the Trust will be considered to hav e either a higher or lower SHMI than expected. A 'higher than expected' SHMI should not automatically be viewed as bad performance, but rather should be viewed as a 'smoke alarm', which requires further investigation. Conversely, a 'lower than expected' SHMI does not necessarily indicate good performance. If you would like to know more about how these ranges are calculated, then please refer to the NHS Digital website at: https://digital.nhs.uk/data -and-information/areas -of-interest/hospital- care/quality - accounts Table 3: Summary Hospital Level Mortality Indicator data Indicator Reporting Period Homerton Performance National Average Highest Performing Trust Lowest Performing Trust (a) The value and banding of the summary hospital -level mortality indicator (\"SHMI\") for the Trust for the reporting period Oct 2016 - Sept 2017 Value: 0.87 3 (b) The percentage of patient deaths with palliative care coded at either diagnosis or speciality level for the Trust for the reporting period. Oct 2016 - Sept 2017 45.4% 31.6% 60% Data source: Latest figures available on NHS Digital Assurance statements The Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: The data is produced using a recognised national agency and adheres to a documented and consistent methodology. The Trust recognises and is assured by its benchmarked position as having one of the lowest SHMI in the country. The Trust intends to take the following actions to sustain and improve the SHMI, and so the quality of its services: Providing regular learning events and resources for all staff to facilitate learning fromincidents and findings from unexpected deaths. Ensuring that all inpatient deaths are systematically reviewed, and that any failings in carethat suggest a death may have been avoidable are identified, systematically shared, learned from, and addressed. 2.Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS ) Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) is a tool used to identify the quality and effectiveness of care delivered to NHS patients based on the patients' perception. It covers four clinical procedures: Hip replacements (primary and revisions) Knee replacements (primary and revisions) Groin hernia Varicose vein (Homerton Hospital does not participate in this PROM as we do not provide thistype of operation) A pa tient will complete two questionnaires: one prior to surgery and one six months after surgery. These questionnaires ask patients about their health and quality of life (as well as the effectiveness of the operation) before and after surgery. Completion of these questionnaires is voluntary and the patient's consent to participate must be granted in order for the data to be used.

Finalised data for groin hernia procedures up until September 2017 has been published. Submission figures of less than 30 do not allow calculation of the adjusted health gain. HUHFT submitted 25 groin hernia records between April and Sept 2017. P age 25 of 68 Assurance statements The Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: Homerton Hospital has processes in place to ensure that relevant patient cohorts are provi ded w ith pre and postoperative questionnaires. There has been sustained improvement in outcomes for total hip and total knee replacements. This is consistent with data collected by the trust for improvement projects, such as theopening of the ring fenced elective orthopaedic ward, and patient feedback questionnaires. The Trust intends to take the following actions to sustain and improve the PROMS, and so the quality of its services. Review of how we collect PROMS data. We are currently trialling an electronic system tocollect PROMS. It is anticipated this will allow for a fuller dataset, i.e. increased six month PROMS completion and allow the service to be more responsive to patient feedback . Review of Enhanced Recovery Protocol to improve the patient's immediate post op recovery . Revie wing PROMs data and findings and discussing these within relevant departments. Reviewing PROMS data on a bimonthly basis through the Improving Clinical Effectiveness Committee. 3.28 day emergency readmission rate This indicator on the NHS Digital portal was last updated in December 2013 for the 2011/12 reporting period. Due to their 'statistical method' in continuous inpatient spell (CIP) construction, we are unable to replicate the data produced by NHS digital (the national standardisation process involves external data sources that we do not have access to). However, the information provided below is based on our internal dataset and NHS digital methodology without the standardisation applied. Table 5: 28 day readmission rates for patients aged 0 - 15 and aged 16 and over.

Assurance statements The Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: The Trust has a robust clinical coding and data quality assurance process, and readmission data is monitored through the Trust Management Board on a monthly basis. The Trust intends to take the following actions to sustain and improve the 28 day readmission rate , and so the quality of its services. Working toget her with partners across Hackney to develop the concept of 'neighbourhoods' which will allow better coordination and integration of geographically based community services. A key metric for neighbourhoods will be to readmissions, asthe aspiration is that better coordinated and integrated services should allow patients to bedischarged more safely and cared for at home to prevent the requirement for readmission. We will work with the new Head of Information to develop our information capacity andsystems, so that local services can drill down seamlessly from Trust wide through divisional to local level in order to permit more real time tracking and interventions toreduce readmissions. 4.Responsiveness to personal needs of patients .

Whilst we have improved since 2016/17 we have performed just below the national average for our responsiveness to the personal needs of our patients in 2017/18. The Trust intends to take the following actions to sustain and improve the responsiveness to personal needs of patients , and so the quality of its services by: Improving communications between ward and community services to improve discharge planning Implementing improvements in the care of patients with dementia Implementing Learning Disability awareness training for s taff Implementing actions in relation to nutrition and hydration overseen by the Nutrition Steerin g G roup Implementing the 'Hearing the voice of the child' project on Starlight Ward Launching the trust End of Life care strategyP age 27 of 68 5.Staff recommending the Trus t as a place to work or receive treatment to Family and Friends . The National NHS Staff Survey provides the opportunity for organisations to survey their staff in a consistent and systematic way on an annual basis and benchmark their results against each other. Obtaining feedback from staff, and taking into account their views and priorities is vital for driving real service improvements across the NHS. Table 7: Staff recommending the Trust to family and friends Indicator Reporting Period Homerton Performa nce National Average Lowest Performing Trust Highest Performing Trust The percentage of staff employed by, or under contract to, the Trust during the reporting period who would recommend the Trust as a provider of care to their family or friends 2017 73.4 70.2 48.0 89.3 2018 75.1 source: National Staff Survey A ssurance Statements The Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: The Picker Institute conducted the survey on behalf of the Trust and all full and part time staff employed by the organisation on the 1st September 2018 (with certain specific exclusions) had the opportunity to complete the survey electronically between September to December 2018. The Trust achieved a return rate of 52.4%, which represented a 2.4% point increase from2017 (50%). We have performed above the national average for staff recommending friends and family asa place to be treated with the score improving by more than one percent since 2017. The Trust intends to take the following actions to sustain and improve the percentage of staff recommending the Trust to their friends and family, and so the quality of its services. We will act on this information responsively to drive further improvements in engagement levels by: Ensur ing the organisation acts fairly: career progression. Reviewing the Staff Engagement Action Plan in light of the 2018 Staff Survey results (keyfeatures of the plan including those areas where results were not so positive when benchmarked against comparator). Responding to our latest staff survey under the themes of equality and diversity; career progression and recognition; leadership strategy; staff health and wellbeing; reward andrecognition; and Trust values. 6.Patients recommending the Trust to Family and Friends The Friends and Family Test (FFT) is an important feedback tool that supports the fundamental principle that people who use NHS services should have the opportunity to provide feedback on their experience. Listening to the views of patients and staff helps identify what is working well, what can be improved and how. The FFT asks people if they would recommend the services they have used and offers a range of responses. When combined with supplementary follow -up questions, the FFT provides a mec hanism to highlight both good and poor patient experience. This kind of feedback is considered vital in transforming NHS services and supporting patient choice. Table 8 : Patients recommending the Trust to family and friends.

R ate of admissions assessed for VTE Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of mortality, long -term disability and chronic ill-health problems - many of which are avoidable. 1 in 20 people will have a VTE at some time in their life and the risk increases with age. It is estimated that as many as half of all cases of VTE are associ ated with hospitalisation for medical illness or surgery. VTE is an international patient safety issue and its prevention has been recognised as a clinical priority for the NHS in England.

Data source: Latest figures available on NHS Digital Assurance statements The Trus t considers that this data is as descr ibed for the following reasons: Homerton has consistently met or exceeded the national average for patients admitted who received a documented risk assessment for VTE. This is through an on -going programme for education, training and user prompts on the hospital -wide electronic medical record under the regular review of the Trust Thrombosis Committee. The Trust intends to take the following actions to sustain and improve the percentage of patients risk assessed for VTE, and so the quality of its services. All hospital acquired VTE s are recorded on Datix and investigated through the incident review process.

Working with the GP Confederation that has been commissioned to provide a communityanticoagulation service for Hackney to ensure patients receive an integrated service. 8.C lostridium difficile rate (C. difficile ) Acute hospitals in England are r equired to report all C.difficile toxin positive stool samples in those patients over two years of age. During the 2018/19 reporting period we have had three Homerton Hospital attributable cases against our national threshold of no more than 10 cases. This is significantly less than the 10 Homerton Hospital attributable cases in 2017/18. In addition the hospital has admitted patients who acquired C.difficile prior to admission. The Trust continues to report low number of cases when compared to other trusts across England. Review of these cases is still in progress by the Trust's clinical commissioning group. Patient management issues arising from the Root Cause investigations included the time from start of symptoms to taking a stool specimen & thus commence ment of appropriate precautions. The C.difficile rate per 100,000 days as shown is sourced from the DH website and is up to end July 2018. It represents the latest published comparable data available. It shows a slight increase in our rates from the previous year. However we compared favourably to other London trusts and we are significantly below the national average.

There is a defined process for checking data at a number of levels which include daily reports from the laboratory, reporting of cases as incidents with a post infection review and monthly sign off by the Director of Infection Prevention and Control. The Trust continues to work hard at reducing the risk of C -difficile infection to our patients including continuously improving our already embedded processes for risk reduction by antimicrobial stewardship, prompt identification of possible cases and laboratory testing processes. The Trust intends to take the following actions to sustain and improve the rate of C-d ifficile infection , and so the quality of its services. R aised profile of C.difficile mandat ory induction & update training. F ocus on timely isolation of all ward patients with diarrhoea whilst awaiting results.

Reporting them supports the NHS to learn from mistakes and to take action to keep patients safe. Patients should be treated in a safe environment and protected from avoidable harm. Homerton actively encourages its staff to report all adverse incidents that have either caused harm or have the potential to cause harm during their care at the Trust. This is to ensure an open and transparent culture and promote organisational learning from safety incidents with the intention of preventing similar incidents from reoccurring in the future. Like NHS England, the Trust considers its high reporting culture as a 'positive indicator of its healthy safety culture, giving organisations the chance to learn and improve'.

The Trust has a much higher rate of incidents reported per 1000 bed days than the nationa l av erage. The Trust has a lower rate of serious harm and death incidents than the national average. The Trust aims to promote a just culture to ensure that staff feel confident to report incidents and this is reflected in the numbers of incidents reported, particularly near misses and incidents resulting in low harm. In addition: The Trust has a robust process to ensure rigorous incident management. All incidents arerevie wed at weekly divisional or corporate CLIP (Complaints, Litigation, Incidents and PALS) meetings and themes and trends reviewed at monthly divisional governance meetings. Trust Management Board receives quarterly updates from the Divisions. During 2018/19, the Trust has worked to improve the electronic incident reporting system (Datix) so that staff can report and investigate incidents more effectively. This has includedtraining and engagement sessions with teams and individuals across the Trust. The Tr ust has strengthened its processes around Serious Incident (SI) and internal root cause analysis investigations, to ensure that reports are completed by appropriately trainedinvestigators within agreed timescales. An Assurance Panel has been established to quality assure and approve all SI and RCA investigation reports. This is chaired by the Chief Nurse and attended by the Divisional Leads to ensure a robust approval process. The Trust intends to take the following actions to sustain and improve this indicator further, and so the quality of its services. We continue to consider ways to improve our incident reporting processes through inducti on t raining and raising staff awareness to ensure staff feel confident and able to report incidents. Undertaking a full review of the incident reporting system (Datix) to identify areas for improvement across all the modules. In addition to induction training for new starters on incident reporting, the Quality and Patient Safety team will be delivering training on Datix and incident reporting to staff in both the acute and community settings. The aim is to further develop staff capacity and capability as well as confidence in reporting patient safety -related incidents. Further work to provide feedback to staff who report incidents, so that they can realise thebenefits or improvements to patient safety and care that have resulted from the incident(s) they reported. Improving the ways in which learning from investigations is shared across the organisation, using better and more consistent use of existing channels including divisional and team meetings. The aim is to also look at other ways of sharing learning and promoting change, including closer working with the Quality Improvement team and the Training a nd D evelopment teams . Continuing to build closer links with the legal, complaints and PALS teams to ensure that information is shared in a more useful and timely fashion, and so that themes that cut across complaints / incidents / claims etc can be identified. Ensuring that actions and lessons learned from investigations are followed up in a consistent and systematic way so that there is assurance across the Trust that actions have been completed.P age 33 of 68 PART 3: OTHER INFORMATION This section of the Quality Account provides information on our quality performance during 2018/ 19. Performance against the priorities identified in our previous quality account and performance against the relevant indicators and performance thresholds set out in NHS Improvement's Risk Assessment Framework and Single Oversight Framework are outlined. We are also proud of a number of initiatives which contribute to strengthening quality improvement systems. An update on progress to embed these initiatives is also included in this section. 3.1. REVIEW OF QUALITY PERFORMANCE Performance against priorities identified for improvement in 2018/ 19 We agreed a number of priorities for improvement in 2018/19 published in last year's Quality Account. These were selected in conjunction with internal and external sta keholders. Patient Safety (Safe) Priority 1 - To prevent the number of community and hospital attributed pressure ulcers. - Partially Achieved Background The development of a pressure ulcer can cause significant long term harm both physically and mentally to a patient. This coupled with the impact of the resultant extended inpatient/community care provision can create avoidable financial pressures. Our target was to reduce the number of avoidable grade 3 and 4 pressure ulcers in both the hospital and community by 10% and to reduce the number of avoidable grade 2 pressure ulcers in both the hospital and community by 5% Our success measures have been For the full year there has been a quarter on quarter reduction in the number of grade 3/4 community and hospit al acquired pressure ulcers. However the reported numbers remain high and the target of a 10% reduction in ulcers was met for hospital acquired but not community acquired. For grade 2 attributable pressure ulcers there has also a reduction quarter on quart er however the target of a 5% reduction has been met for community acquired ulcers but not for hospital acquired. What did we achieve to date? The format of the Pressure Ulcer Scrutiny Committee (PUSC) has been revised and relaunched in January 2019 with t he aim being to provide a more structured opportunity for shared learning, identification of contributing factors and how these can be addressed to aid reduction. The Trusts processes for the identification and management of pressure ulcers has been review ed and updated in line with the publication of the NHSI - Pressure ulcers: revised definition and measurement framework. We can evidence progress through Revised terms of reference for PUSC Minutes of meetings heldRevised guidance. What will we do in 2019 /20 to continue improvements? Continue with this important priority in 2019/20 . Review of the effectiveness of the revised PUSC Development of a pressure ulcer dashboard on Datix Provision of information at ward and team level to support the strategic inf ormatio n c urrently provided Quarterly thematic review of contributing factors identified in PUSC to ascertain what worked and any further action required. Priority 2 - Improve patients by appropriate management of their nutritional needs. - Partially Achie ved Background Nutrition and hydration are key factors influencing the health and well -being of patients across all healthcare settings and the Trust's policy for the treatment of malnutrition in adults is based upon the NICE clinical guideline 32: nutritional support in adults; which states that \"All hospital inpatients on admission and all outpatients at their first clinic appointment should be screened. Screening should be repeated weekly for inpatients and when there is clinical concern for outpatients\" . Our target was to ensure that patients have MUST score assessed and appropriate nutritional management based on the result of the MUST score. Our success measures have been The MUST audit completed on the Acute Care Unit in May 2018 indicated 55% of patients were screened within 24hrs of admission against a target of 95). This is a decrease from results of a large audit completed in February 2018 which indicated a 70% uptake and 82% uptake in November 2017. A subsequent MUST audit undertaken in August 2018 across 8 wards (80 patients) indicated a 73% record of MUST. MUST score is therefore not routinely being accurately recorded on the inpatients wards and work is continuing in collaboration with nursing staff to ensure this measure is assessed and recorded accurately. The most recent MUST audit undertaken in April 2019 across 10 wards (219 patients) indicated a 75% recording of MUST. Whilst improvements have been achieved since May 2018 MUST score is not routinely being accurately recorded on the inpatients wards and work is continuing in collaboration with nursing staff to ensure this measure is assessed and recorded accurately and acted upon appropriately. What did we achieve to date? A number of actions have been achieved such as: A standardised audit tool was produced in collaboration with nursing staff across 8 wards. Liaison has taken place with Practice Development Nurse's and training provision enhanced t o i nclude: HCA (care certificate) training and essential skills training, Mandatory Nutrition training for nurses increased to 60mins from 30mins New MUST training for Band 5 & 6 nurses lasting 1 hour Mandatory Nutrition training for nurses training length increased to 60minsP age 35 of 68 Online Elsiver training has been established but low uptake as staff pref er face to face training The Nutrition Steering Group (NSG) has been re- established - this provides a forum for discussing and recording adherence to quality standards, such as MUST Electronic Recording of MUST - Change request submitted to EPR to indicate if weight recorded is estimated/self - reported or accurate. We can evidence progress through Six monthly audits Nutrition steering group bi monthly Meetings What will we do in 2019/20 to continue improvements? MUST 'snapshot' audits to be undertaken twice yearly, including Mary Seacole. Nutrition Steering Group to meet bimonthly Development of automated MUST Audit reporting per ward via EPR. MUST Quality Improvement (QI) projects to be undertaken with support from the QI Team t o i dentifying the barriers and potential solutions to facilitate the improvement of MUST screenin g and r ecording. Priority 3 - To improve identification and response to acutely deteriorating patients Partially Achieved Background Severe sepsis and septic shock have a mortality of 25-3 5% with approximately 44000 deaths per year in UK (2014/2015 data). Improvement in outcomes of patients suffering from severe sepsis and septic shock can be attributed to timely early management, namely prompt assessment and senior review, initial treatment (sepsis 6) and source search and control. We need to ensure we have robust systems in place to ensure that we consistently identify deterioration in inpatients in a timely way no matter the cause and ensure an appropriate rapid response. We strive to ensure we are continually reviewing our progress in this area and are committed to co ntinuous quality improvement. Our targets were: To establish a deteriorating patient task and finish group Ensure t imely identification of patients with sepsis in emergency departments and acute inpatient settings Timely treatment of sepsis in emergency departments and acute inpatient settings Assessment of clinical antibiotic review between 24- 72 hours of patients with sepsis who are still inpatients at 72 hours Reduction in antibiotic consumption per 1,000 admissions . Our success measures have been A multi -professional deteriorating patient task and finish group has been established reviewing the models and resources available to enhance the detection of, and response to, deterioration in adult medical and surgical inpatients out of hours. Sepsis screening - The results April 18 to January 19 for both acute and emergency demonstrate that 98% of all patients that met the criteria for sepsis screening were screened for sepsis showing continuous improvement from last year. Year end results confirm the target was met. Timely treatment - W hilst not achieved throughout the year there have been improvements in Q4 and the target was met with a performance of 92%. The likely reason for the dr op in performance in Q2 and Q3 was a change in staff, both with new doctors starting in August and also the departure of the sepsis nurse. A new sepsis nurse has now been in post since December 2018. Assessment of clinical antibiotic review - There has been a steady improvement in compliance with antibiotic review criteria over the financial year. Targets for the year have all been met. Reduction in antibiotic consumption - Total consumption increased in Quarter 3 of this financial year, in comparison to Quarter 1 and 2, as is to be expected over the winter period. Overall however we met the target to achieve our 1% reduction in total antibiotic consumption in 2018/19 in comparis on to 2017/18 total consumption. What did we achieve to date? The Deteriorating Patient Group has multi- professional representation from across all services involved in the detection and response to deterioration including Critical care, Surgery and Medicine. So far the group has: Completed a review of clinical incidents related to deterioration Completed regular audit of the escalation and response to abnormal National Earlywarning scores in adult inpatients Completed two detailed thematic analyses of case reviews of patien ts admitted as a n em ergency to c ritical care from adult inpatient wards. Used this data to inform an updated education plan around deterioration including in- situ s imulation, seminars with all clinical departments and updated nurse study days Review of the workload and competences of all members of staff involved in providing careto inpatients in the hospital at night Options appraisal for different suggested staffing and models of care overnight Completed roll- out of the NEWS 2 system of physiological monitoring in January 2019 Completion and roll -out of new guidelines for escalation of deterioration and for referral to critical care There has been continuous work and training around sepsis recognition and treatment. A new sepsis nurse has now been in post since December 2018 and the effect of that is evident in the improvement in performance in the last quarter . There are a number of interventions undertaken to improve sepsis awareness including teaching on mandatory training for nurses and doctors, training sessions on wards, close work with PDNs and resus officer to facilitate sepsis training. The m icrobiology team continues to monitor use of all antibiotics where indicated and works with pharmacy to provide an education and awareness raising programme, support the Antimicrobial Stewardship Virtual Ward Round, as well as providing feedback to clinical teams regarding progress. There has been a steady improvement in compliance with antibiotic review criteria over the financial year. We can evidence progress through: Progress for the deteriorating patient group can be evidenced by the rollout of new teaching sessions, minutes of the meeting of the group and the rollout of the new escalation pathways P age 37 of 68 What will we do in 2019/20 to continue improvements? The Trust intends to continue with this important priority in 2019/20 . The deteriorating patient Group will continue to focus on regular data collection looking at escalation and response to deterioration. Once a new model for hospital at night cover for adult inpatients has been agreed the team will focus on its rollout and reviewing its efficacy The sepsis nurse role has shown to be invaluable as evidenced by the drop in our performance when the post was vacant. For 2019/20 we will continue with a number of interventions currently in place to increase sepsis awareness. Other future plans include, continuing to provide regular training to both doctors and nurses in ED; in ward SIM training; and raising awareness throughout the hospital with posters on all wards. We will continue to provide educational initiatives and develop our Trust strategy via antimicrobial management group regarding antimicrobial stewardship, including daily antimicrobial stewardship ward rounds and use of carbapenem -sparing agents where appropriate. We will focus on the promotion of elect ronic tools (e.g. Medicine Powerplans for Sepsis) to improve antimicrobial stewardship and adherence to guidelines with incorporation of such tools for example into s imulation training sessions on acutely deteriorating patients where relevant. Clinical Eff ectiveness (Effective) Priority 4 - To achieve the Quest best employer accreditation - Not Achieved Background NHS Quest, of which H omerton is a member, has decided to add to its core role as a quality improvement network by developing an Employment Brand . NHS Quest were initially attempting to support the 'Best Employer Brand' by developing an accreditation regime designed to assure employers they were focussing on the right things that would ensure they featured in the top 20% NHS trusts to work by 2020 as measured by the NHS staff survey. Our success measures have been This work has not progressed as envisaged and subsequently QUEST is currently reflecting on next steps in respect of how to effect quality improvements in this key area for member organisations . Homerton continues to be involved where appropriate. What did we achieve to date? 2018 Staff Survey feedback indicates that Homerton broadly managed to continue with its previous ratings which indicate that it remains in the top 20% of NHS Trust to work for. Specifically the 2018 Staff Survey indicates that 70% of staff would recommend the organisation as a place to work and 76% would be happy with the standard of care if a friend or relative needed treatment. We can evidence progress through Staff E ngagement Meetings and Action Plan.Equality & Diversity Meetings and Action Plan. Healthy Homerton Meetings. S taff survey completion and results What will we do in 2019/20 to continue improvements? The T rust is currently formulating an action plan to generate improvement at corporate and local levels with the aim of achieving an overall improvement in Trust ratings across a range of areas. Significantly priorities at c orporate level have been identified as follows: Harassment and Bullying of Staff by Patients and Carers Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in employment Staff Health and Well Being Trust Values and Culture A ppraisal rates consistently high across the organisation. The Trust plans to include a priority related to staff health and wellbeing in 2019/20. Priority 5 - Improving services for people with mental health needs who present to A&E - Achieved Background It is widely recognised and accepted that people with mental health problems are up to three times more likely to present to an ED than the general population; and are also up to five times more likely to be admitted to an acute hospital. 'Frequent Attenders' to an ED continue to be a 'growing health concern' with research suggesting that each of these ED attendances are not always beneficial for the patient, yet are resource -intense both in terms of clinical time and financially. As such, clinicians in acute settings need to be adequately equipped to recognise urgent mental health needs as well as identifying underlying mental health conditi ons. Our aim was to maintain a 20% reduction in attendances to ED for patients within a selected cohort of frequent attenders in 2017/18 and identify a new cohort of frequent attenders to ED during 2017/18 that could benefit from interventions to reduce by 20% their attendances to ED in 2018/19. Our success measures have been Maintain 20% reduction in attendances to A&E for patients within the selected cohort of frequent attenders identified in Year 1 (2017/18) - the Trust achieved an 80% reduction. Identif y a new cohort of frequent attenders to A&E during 2017/18 that could benefit from psychosocial interventions and work to reduce by 20%, their attendances to A&E during 2018/19 - the Trust achieved a 60% reduction. What did we achieve to date? A summary of the achievements to date is set out below: Identify subsets of patients who would benefit from assessment, review and care planning wit h s pecialist mental health staff Produce care plans for each patient in the cohort, engaging with local partner agencies Establish joint governance arrangements Establish local data collections to support the evaluation of the CQUIN project Provide assurance on EPR recording/coding for patients presenting with MH complaints Ensure a system is in place to identify new FAP age 39 of 68 Continue to develop and embed service development plans to support sustained reduction in attendances for people with MH needs Identify whether the presentations of the patient cohort were recorded/coded correctly on the electronic patient record system Agre e service development plan to support sustained reduction in attendances for people wit h M H needs W e can evidence progress through CQUIN updates Operational Meetings Steering Group meetings (HUH and ELFT) Urgent Care Quality Meeting ED attendance data What will we do in 2019/20 to continue improvements? To continue to monitor, review and analyse frequent attenders and adopt a multi -disciplinary approach to managing this patient cohort. To continue developing our understanding on this cohort of patients and their health needs. To improve individualised care planning for identified frequent attenders. To ensure robust governance systems between acute and community settings and maintain information sharing mechanisms. To learn and share experiences on individual case management. Priority 6 - Improving the management of end of life care for adults . - Achieved Background This priority relates to the need that when a patient is dying that they and their family receive the best possible care. This involves ensuring they do not receive unnecessary medical interventions and that care is delivered in line with the 5 priorities of care identified by The Leadership Alliance for The Care of Dying People (One Chance to Get it Right June 2014). Our targets were to ensure our patients who die within the hospital have an end of life care plan and a treatment escalation plan. Our success measures have been. Completion of an individualised end of life care plan ensures individualised needs are identified, regularly review ed and any nursing interventions evaluated in a timely way. It ensures that the needs of the family are considered and met. This has been achieved in over 70% of cases over 2018/19. Completing a Treatment Escalation Plan enables the documentation of communication with patients and families around recognition of dying, appropriate treatment options at this time, identification of preferred place of care and death and other priorities for the dying person and their family. With the TEP there is an End of Life Review completed, again ensuring psychological, spiritual and social needs have been considered. This has been achieved in over 70% of cases over 2018/19. What did we achieve to date? In 2018 the Trust launched a revised end of life care strategy for 2018 -2021.The Trust applied and was grante d funding from Macmillan for a two year end of life facilitator post to take forwa rd the strands of the strategy. The end of life care plan has been revised to better reflect the needs of the dying patient and their f amily. The Trust will be introducing a programme of teaching in relation to the new care plan. This went live on EPR in 2019. Following consultation with the ward staff, a two hour communication training programme for ward nurses and health care assistants has been delivered to staff on ECU and Edith Cavell. An End of Life Care Facilitator started in 2018 and has been establishing and promoting this new post and the Strategy throughout the Trust (inpatient and community). In December 2018 we started giving out a bereavement feedback survey to the next of kin ofall adult patients that have died in the hospital. We can evidence progress through Maintaining records of training done, attendance numbers and evaluations including doctors training, nurse's band study days, annual update training, ward based training and Simulation training. Audits demonstrating a continued increase each quarter in the number of patients at end of lifewith a TEP (and EOL Review) and nursing end of life care plan. Feedback received in the bereavement surveys. What will we do in 2019/20 to continue improvements? The Trust is taking forward the aims of the End of Life Strategy 2018- 21. These are: Personalised End of Life Care Supporting our staff Improving environment Communic ation and Information. We will deliver ward teaching re changes to the End of Life Care plan. Conversations with patients and families about dying have been included in s imulation training for nurses and health care assistants and this will continue and be developed for medical staff too. Patient Experience Priority 7 - Ensuring staff are actively hearing the Voice of the Child and this is integral to care. - Achieved. Background Two key drivers for ensuring that the voice of children and young people is heard, listened to and shape the way in in which Homerton provides services for them are: In 2015 the CQC published a report which reviewed 50 inspection reports and concluded that the 'voice of the child' was deafeningly silent. One of the guiding principles that the Trust has signed up to as member of the City and Hackney Safeguarding Children Board is developing a culture which ensures that children and young people are h eard through professionals taking the time to listen to what children and young people are saying, putting themselves in the child or young person's shoes and thinking deeply about what their life might truly be like. P age 41 of 68 Our targets were to ensure; that the voice of the child is included in health visitors safeguarding supervision; children feel involved in decisions about their care; children feel safe as in -patients and staff attend me first training. Our success measures have been 100% Health Visitors have the voice of the child documented on RIO as part of their supervision. Over 90% of children sampled felt involved in their care. A how safe do you feel pilot questionnaire has been developed. Over 30% of relevant staff have attended M e first training What did we achieve to date? Standard Operating Procedure developed for documenting safeguarding supervision on R IO which includes guidance on documenting the voice of the child. 24 Safeguarding children supervision records were audited in Q's 3 & 4. HV participated in a Voice of the child audit. Report completed and findings hav e been us ed to form the basis of a workshop scheduled for 12th April 2019. Parents and children on Starlight Ward continue to be asked to complete the patient satisfaction survey using Optimum Technology. How safe do you feel questionnaire has been developed and piloted with 36 children aged 8-15 years (the denominator was not established), who were in patients on Starlight ward. The momentum for this work slipped in quarter 3 when the trust quality improvement leadleft the organisation. Staff (nursing and medical ) attended Me first Masterclass We can evidence progress through Dip sample audits of supervision records In patient satisfaction feedback report 'How safe do you feel' questionnaire developed and piloted. What will we do in 2019/20 to continue improvem ents? Continue work on embedding the voice of the child in clinical practice as an objective in the Safeguarding Children 2019/20 work plan which will be monitored by the Safeguarding Children Operational Forum. Priority 8 - Improving the first impression and experience of the Trust for all patients and visitors - Not Achieved. Background Creating positive first impressions of the Trust for patients , service users and visitors who are visiting the Trust is important in building trust and confidence in our staff and services. Receptionists are on the front line in meeting and greeting patients , service users and visitors and therefore play a pivotal role in this. We will develop a range of measures to support receptionists and their managers create a positive first impression for every patient, service user and visitor to the Trust at every visit. Our targets were to initiate a quality improvement project with non- clinical outpatient staff, increase the numbers of staff attending the effective receptionist course and developing first impressions standards. Our success measures have been A Quality Improvement project has been established looking at measuring ourselves against best practic e, identifying expected behaviours and barriers and enablers to delivering this and measures to support delivery. There is an action plan for the First Impressions project and it included the need for 50% of the receptionist staff to undertake the Effective Receptionist training. The uptake of training was not fully taken up. A draft set of first impression standard s has been produced aiming to create a positive first impression which will help to provide consistency across the Trust. What did we achieve to date? First Impressions Workshop Sept 2018 attended by 20 receptionists from a range of teams including reception m anagers, Head of Learning and Head of Patient Experience. The session explored three questions t o help inform an action plan . What does the Trust need to put in place to ensure that 'first impression' standards can flourish? What are the things that currently get in the way and prevent us from delivering a positive first impression? What are the factors that will help you deliver a positive first impression? A draft First Impressions Standard was proposed a nd a num ber of areas agreed to support its delivery including recruiting staff with the right attitude, competencies and training, supporting staff to consistently exhibit behaviours. We can evidence progress through A draft set of First impression Standards has been developed including code of behaviours. An action plan has been created which will form the basis of the work plan for the first impression steering group to deliver. Additional Effective Receptionist courses have been commissioned for 2018/19. What wi ll we do in 2019/20 to continue improvements? Refresh the action plan, meeting membership and key priorities. Review the Effective Receptionist training to ensure it is tailored to the new standards. The initiative will be project managed in line with the QI principles. A new OPD Manager has been appointed and will give the initiative a refreshed launch. Priority 9 - For patients who on discharge are receiving one or more community services for their discharge to be seamless and communication between all services enhanced. - Achieved. Background Improving discharge from hospital is a key priority for the trust. This has previously been shown to be an area that could be improved on and that affects both patients and the effective operational performance of the hospital. While considerable work was done in 2017/18 with hospital services including wards and multi- disciplinary teams to better facilitate discharge, greater focus has now turned to enhancing the community -facing services involved in supporting discharge. P age 43 of 68 Our targets were to develop a patient information leaflet in relation to discharge services offered; implement a discharge to assess pilot; ensure continuing care assessments are completed in the community and ensure continuing care assessments are completed within 28 days. Our success measures have been A discharge patient information leaflet has been developed and is awaiting approval. What did we achieve to date? A patient information leaflet has been produced describing the range of the discharge related services. The discharge to assess pilot has been implemented and assessed. We have achieved our target of 85% continuing healthcare (CHC) assessments complete in the community, unless exempt by agreement . We have achieved our target of 95% CHC asse ssments to be completed within 28 days . We can evidence progress through Minutes or action logs of meetings including Medical Productivity Group, CQUIN Board, Integrated Discharge Steering Group and Unplanned Care Board What will we do in 2019/20 to conti nue improvements? To ratify patient information leaflet To seek data for other D2A services as a comparator To maintain delivery of local CHC CQUI N To ensure on- going attendance and effective functioning of various groups identified above. Priority 10 - To implement a complete electronic postnatal discharge process with a failsafe element to ensure timely and appropriate delivery of postnatal care to mothers and babies once transferred from hospital into the community setting. - Achieved. Background Datix incident reports identified a trend in 'missed' postnatal discharges from inpatient areas to community care to Homerton and out of areas (16 missed discharges in January 2018). This resulted in mothers and babies having delayed home visits and therefore the schedule of postnatal care in the community not being followed. This was of serious patient safety concern as mothers and babies were having essential care and screening tests delayed, which in turn has the potential for harm. Following review it was id entified that the missed discharges were occurring in both the transfers of care to H omerton's community services and out of Homerton area community services. It was also identified that the missed discharges were coming from all inpatient areas that process Incorrect Homerton community zone/out of area hospital identified by midwife to be notified of discharge. There were a number of reasons why discharges were not reaching appropriate community teams, it was decided that a new process was to be implemented to cut out the manual process of paper notification and minimise the number of individuals involved in the process to reduce the risk of errors being made. Our targets were to ensure postnatal discharges are sent electronically, daily failsafe checks wer e being made and missed discharges were reported on D atix - with the aim of having 0 missed discharges by March 2019. Our success measures have been As part of the new process, sending of the discharges electronically is mandatory as there is now no provis ion for paper copies to be collected. This has been successful with 100% compliance. The daily failsafe check is completed by two different teams; Community complete the failsafe to check they have received all of the H omerton community discharges, and Delivery Suite complete the failsafe to check all of the out of H omerton community area have been sent. There was a decline in the compliance with this in Quarter 2, which was identified when missed discharge incidents were being reported. Both the Delivery Suite and Community leads have identified the issues which lead to not achieving 100% compliance with the daily failsafe. Although the target of 0 missed was achieved in March 2019, prior to this there were low levels of i ncidents monthly. It is however evident that there has been a clear reduction since the implementation of the new process and failsafe. The main reasons for discharges being missed were; Discharge not sent on day of discharge, and failsafe not done therefore missed discharge notidentified Discharge sent to incorrect out of area hospital - no notification from other hospital or notification not acted upon due to the failsafe not being done The missed discharges are generally identified by families calling the maternity helpline to inform them that they have not had their expected visit, or the health visitor informing us. All missed discharges would be identified at the latest by the national Northgate Newborn Blood Spot (NBBS) failsafe system which would identify a delayed NBBS sample. All are logged via Datix and reviewed and actioned by the line manager of the area that the client was discharged from. What did we achieve to date? Standard Operating Procedure implemented for new discharge process Datix reporting and investigation of any missed discharges Staff support in implementing the new process including training, discussion at team meetings, written feedback Monitoring of incident trends via the maternity trends report with feedback to staff Updates at team meetings Focus on ensuring failsafe completed daily, including further training Putting processes into place to ensure failsafe is completed when core members of theadministration team are not working In late Quarter 4, implementing the London -wide map to support ensuring discharges are sent to the correct hospital . We can evidence progress through Gradual reduction in missed discharges and maintenance of lower level of incidents. There is a continued focus on discharge incidents. In March 2019, we achieved the aim of 0 missed discharges. P age 45 of 68 What will we do in 2019/20 to continue improvements? Further work with administration teams to work towards the aim of 100% compliance wit h t he daily failsafe, including further training and audit. Continued reporting via Datix of any missed discharge to identify any training or system issues. Continue to embed the use of the London- wide electronic map to support the staff to select the correct hospital for discharge.3.2. REVIEW NATIONAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Performance against the relevant indic ators and performance thresholds set out in NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework The following indicators are set out in NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework. The Single Oversight Framework replaced the Risk Assessment Framework in November 2016. Please note Summary Hospital -level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) Clostridium difficile and Venous Thromboembolism (VTE risk assessment) are in Part 2.3: Reporting against core indicators. Homerton endeavours to meet all na tional targets and pr iorities. Below is a summary of the national targets and indicators. Cancer Waits Table 13: 62 day cancer waiting time performance Indicator Target 2018/19 2018/19 2017/18 2016/17 Cancer: 62 day wait for first treatment (from urgent GP referral for suspec ted cancer) 85% 87.70% 81.70% 83.90% Cancer: 62 -day wait for first NHS Cancer Screening Service referral) 90% 66.67% 100.00% 100.00% Data source: Somerset Cancer database The Trust has performed strongly against the 62 Day Cancer standard in 2018/19 and is a significant improvement against last year's performance. The Trust continues to place significant focus on the delivery of this standard via its fortnightly Cancer Access Board. It should be noted that the improved performance has coincided with the appointment of a new Head of Access. With regard to the screening target, it should be noted that although the performance is below the 90% standard, this relates to a total of three treatments, of which one treatment was recorded as a breac h.

Whilst performance has been compliant overall on a monthly basis, there have been some instances where the standard has not been met within individual modalities. Performance is monitored on a fortnightly basis as the Trust's Elective Access Board. Improved Access to Psychological Therapy (IAPT) Table 17 : IAPT waiting time performance Indicator Target 2018/19 2018/19 2017/18 2016/17 Proportion of people completing treatment who move to recovery (from IAPT* database) 50% 60.45% 56.65% N/A Waiting time to begin treatment (from IAPT minimum dataset) within 6 weeks 75% 96.50% 93.87% 84.4% Waiting time to begin treatment (from IAP T minimum dataset) within 18 weeks 95% 99.52% 99.42% 99.1% Data source: Patient Case Management Information System The Trust has continued to deliver its core IAPT targets throughout 2018/19 and performance has improved compared to 2017/18 across the three core standards. 3.3. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AT HOMERTON 'Quality Improvement' (QI) can be defined as an approach to improving service quality, efficiency and morale simultaneously, using improvement science. It is part of a broad range of activities known collec tively as 'improving quality'. QI uses systematic methods to involve those closest to the quality issues in developing solutions to a complex problem. The systematic method used at the Trust is the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Model for Improvement. Building and fostering QI knowledge and skills During 2018/19 the QI team priority has been building QI knowledge and skills in staff (clinical and non-clinical) whatever the service they deliver or the role they play. QI has been incorporat ed into the organisational development activities aimed at foste ring an 'improvement mindset'. We have introduced a QI session into the induction of staff that have managerial or supervisory duties because we want every team to be empowered and supported t o use QI to improve the care provided. The Trust Leadership Level 2 programme 2018 for the first time included QI tools and approaches with bespoke teaching from the QI team as well as one to one coaching for each of the participants. The nurse preceptors also benefitted f rom QI teaching and support. Staff in both of these programmes completed high quality QI projects, produced posters and presentations sharing their findings widely through the QI Forum, audit days and Researc h and Development conferences. These projects delivered improvements in the efficiency of systems and processes reducing the time patients wait for care, decreasing the time taken to administer or dispense medication, improve patient and staff confidence and levels of feedback as well as safety through better revie ws and assessments of patients. The QI Forum was launched in June 2018 as a place for staff to share QI project activities with colleagues from across the Trust. Presentations and discussion highlight issues, findings and solut ions that are transferable. As a regular participant fedback 'I like the learning - there's always something to take away'. The Improving Quality Board, co -chaired by the Medical Director and the Director for Organisational Transformation, is responsible f or a strategic overview of the broad range of improvement activities from mortality reviews to themes from patient feedback and patient safety and effectiveness whi ch shape QI project priorities. Lessons from the QI team's work with preceptor nurses, as well as the 'Improving Trust and Confidence in Nurses' workstream, is being used to develop a Chief Nurse QI Fellow programme, specifically for Band 5 nurses. This will run from April 2019. Staff groups such as Allied Health Professionals and doctors in trai ning are already in the forefront of putting QI into practice. The team provide teaching and advice to these groups as part of their induction, learni ng and development programmes. All staff undertaking QI projects are encouraged to align their projects wi th Trust and service priorities and to include patients/clients and service users as key partners. Working in partnership Partnerships are cruci al to the Trust's QI approach. Homerton is part of UCLPartners (Academic Health Science Network) and shares QI p rojects using the LIFE collaboration and data analysis platform. The Trust subscription to the IHI also provides staff with access to e -learning and to international QI cases studies and resources. Homerton is also an active participant in the QUEST networ k of 16 NHS organisations which are committed to focussing on improving quality and patient safety. The Trust contributes to the QUEST 'Best Employer Brand' initiative because we recognise that high levels of staff engagement improve the quality of patient care. P age 49 of 68 Homerton QI in the City and Hackney health economy and beyond The QI team ethos is to bring QI suppor t to wherever teams are based. For example, we have built on the 'lunch and learn' QI sessions for Adult Community Nursing teams and practice nurses in the south west of City and Hackney to improve communication between practitioners to provide seamless care to clients. The QI team is part of a project using Experience Based Co- Design principles and methods to develop and deliver better services and s olutions with and for patients. This is an exciting opportunity to use QI principles in 'Neighbourhoods' or place based models of care. One of three 'transformation' projects ongoing during 2018/19 related to mobile working in community service teams. This project took a holistic approach to examining how the benefits of mobile working could be realised in three services which included different care models e.g. adults and children's services and therapy and nursing teams. 'Time in motion' studies were conducted using validated tools together with assessing staff and patient/client experience and attitudes to the use of technology. Recommendations for action are informing the development of IT systems and place based 'Neighbourhood' care models. This work al igns with the North East London Sustainability and Transformation Plan: investment in and development of technology and delivering paper -free care at the point of use. Homerton has a track record of developing technology enabled healthcare, such as electronic patient records and sharing information efficiently and securely across health organisations via the Heal th Information Exchange (HIE). In July 2018, Homerton organised and hosted an event for NHS partners in the Quest network focussing on this theme. Homerton Experience Day included immersive sessions for participants to see the HIE in action in the hospital and try out Voice Recognition software to produce clinic letters. We showcased the latest thinking from Homerton staff harnessing the power of wearable technologies to help patients manage long- term conditions and the proposed use of Artificial Intelligence t o screen and triage referrals. The event included insights from Dr Simon Eccles, Chief Clinical Information Officer for Health and Care, the Northern Care Alliance (a Global Digital Exemplar) as well as an opportunity to explore the positives and pitfalls of technology in healt hcare through a lively debate. The Surgical Transformation Programme aims to increase efficiency and productivity in surg ical services. Staff used skills developed in the Quest Improvement Science for Leaders (IS4L) to improve the percentage of patients undergoing gallbladder removal to go home safely on the day of the procedure. Theatres team members also took part in the 'Improving Theatre Safety Collaborative' which used a clinical communities model to drive and sustain improvements in outcomes. Homerton has again been successful in winning a place on the IS4L programme in 2018/19. The team project is called 'Mind the Gap' and is focussed on decreasing the late diagnoses of speech, language and communication needs in children and young people living in Hackney. QI Futures 2019/2020 Homerton's QI activities in 2019/2020 aim to support the Trust's ambition to be a provider of 'Outstanding' care. The QI approach is in line with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) guidance on trusts with a maturing QI function. Key priorities will be to develop and embed better use of data and qualitative information, improve how we work in partnership with patients and service users, sustain and spread successful QI projects and communicate and raise awareness of QI in innovative and compelling ways .

Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the GAM 2018/19 issued by the Department of Health. The accounting policies contained in the GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be the most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the NHS Foundation Trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. 1.1 Going Concern These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. Non-trading entities in the public sector are assumed to be going concerns where the continued provision of a service in the future is anticipated, as evidenced by inclusion of financial provision for that service in published documents 1.2 Accounting Convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to account for the revaluation of property plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.3 Basis of Consolidation The Trust is the corporate trustee to Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Charitable Fund, however the Charity's results have not been consolidated with those of the Trust in 2018/19 on the grounds of materiality. The Charity's accounts for 2018/19 will be published in September and can be found at www.homertonhope.org. 1.4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation of uncertainty In the application of the Trust's accounting policies, management is required to make various judgements, estimates and assumptions. These are regularly reviewed. 1.4.1 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies The following are the judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below) that management has made in the process of applying the Trust's accounting policies and have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: Depreciation rates applied to property, plant and equipment and valuation methodologies and external indices applied to t he v aluation conducted by Gerald Eve LLP (note 9 to the accounts). 1.4.2 Sources of estimation uncertainty The following are assumptions about the future and other major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year: Income and expenditure accruals Other sources of estimation uncertainty are the following: Provision for injury benefit claims, early retirements, impairments of receivables, and others (notes 11 & 15 to the accounts) Estimates for partially completed patient episodes. 1.5 Transfer of functions As public sector bodies are deemed to operate under common control, business reconfigurations within the DH group are outside the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Where functions transfer between two public sector bodies , the GAM requires the application of 'absorption accounting'. Absorption accounting requires that entities account for their transaction in the period which they took place. Where assets and liabilities transfer, the gain or loss resulting is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and is disclosed separately from operating costs. 1.6 Pooled budgets The Trust has not entered into any pooled budget arrangements. 1.7 Operating segments Income and expenditure are analysed in the Operating Segments note and are reported in line with management information used within the Trust.Page 8Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Annual Accounts 2018/19 1. Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.8 R evenue The transition to IFRS 15 has been completed in accordance with paragraph C3 (b) of the Standard, applying the Standard retrospectively recognising the cumulative effects at the date of initial application. In the adoption of IFRS 15 a number of practical expendients offered in the Standard have been employed. These are as follows : - As per paragraph 121 of the Standard the Trust will not disclose information regarding performance obligations as part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less; - The Trust is to similarly not disclose information where revenue is recognised in line with the practical expedient offered in paragraph B16 of the Standard where the right to consideration corresponds directly with value of the performance compl eted to date; - The FReM has mandated the exercise of the practical expedient offered in C7(a) of the Standard that requires the Trust to reflect the aggregate of all contracts modified before the date of initital application. p p p g when, and to the extent that, performance occurs, and is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to activity delivered in that year. Where a patient care spell is incomplete at the year end, revenue relating to the partially completed spell is accrued and agreed with the commissioner. Where income is received for a specific activity that is to be delivered in the following year, that income is deferred. j y y , g g j p j y compensation has subsequently been paid, for instance by an insurer. The Trust recognises the income when it receives notification from the Department of Work and Pension's Compensation Recovery unit that the individual has lodged a compensation claim. The income is measured at the agreed tariff for the treatments provided to the injured individual, less a provision for unsuccessful compensation claims and doubtful debts in line with IFRS 9 requirements of measuring expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. c ontract. 1.9 Employee Benefits 1.9.1 Short-term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment-related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees, including non-consolidated performance pay earned but not yet paid. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that employees are permitted to carry forward leave into the following period. 1.9.2 Pension costs NHS PensionsPast and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pensions Schemes. These schemes are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State in England and Wales. These schemes are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, the schemes are accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes: the cost to the NHS Body of participating in the scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. For early retirements other than those due to ill health the additional pension liabilities are not funded by the scheme. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to expenditure at the time the Trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. Employers pension cost contributions are charged to operating expenses as and when they become due. The employer contribution payable in 2018/19 was \u00a318.8m (2017/18 \u00a317.9m). The schemes are subject to a full actuarial valuation every four years and an accounting valuation every year. 1.10 Expenditure on other goods and services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that, the goods or services have been received and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non-current asset such as property, plant and equipment 1.10.2 Value added tax Most of the activities of the Trust are outside the scope of value added tax (VAT). Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of non-current assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. 1.11 Corporation tax The Trust is not liable to to pay corporation tax. Page 9Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Annual Accounts 2018/19 1. Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.12 Property, Plant and Equipment 1.12.1 Recognition Property, Plant and Equipment is capitalised where: it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes; it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust; it is expected to be used for more than one financial year; the cost of the item can be measured reliably and either it individually has a cost of at least \u00a35,000; or collectively, a number of items have a cost of at least \u00a35,000and individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250, where the assets are functionally interdependent, had broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have simultaneous disposal dates and are under single managerial control. Where alarge asset, forexample abuilding, includes anumber of components withsignificantly different asset lives, forexample plant and equipment, then these components are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their useful economic lives. 1.12.2 Measurement Allproperty, plant and equipment ismeasured initially atcost, representing thecost directly attributable toacquiring or constructing theasset and bringing itto the location and condition necessary forittobe capable of operating inthemanner intended by management. Assets that are held fortheir service potential and are inuseare measured subsequently at their current value in existing use. Assets thatwere most recently held fortheir service potential but are surplus withno plan tobring them back intouseare measured at fairvalue where there are no restrictions on sale atthereporting date and where they do not meet the definition of investment properties or assets held for sale. Revaluations of property, plant and equipment are performed with sufficient regularity toensure that carrying amounts are not materially different from those that would be determined at the end of the reporting period. Current values in existing use are determined as follows: Land and non-specialised buildings - market value for existing use; and Specialised buildings - depreciated replacement cost, modern equivalent asset basis. Assets held at depreciated replacement cost have been valued on an alternative site basis where this would meet the location requirements of the services being provided. Properties inthecourse of construction forservice or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees, and where capitalised inaccordance withIAS23, borrowing costs. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when they are brought into use. ITequipment, transport equipment, furniture and fittings, and plant and machinery that are held foroperational useare valued at depreciated historic cost where these assets have short useful economic lives orlowvalues or both, as this is not considered tobematerially different from current value in existing use. Anincrease arising on revaluation istaken therevaluation reserve except when itreverses an impairment for the same asset previously recognised in expenditure, inwhich case it iscredited toexpenditure to the extent of thedecrease previously charged there. Arevaluation decrease that does not result from alossof economic value or service potential ischarged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there isabalance on thereserve forthat asset, and thereafter toexpenditure. Gains and losses recognised intherevaluation reserve are reported intheStatement of Comprehensive Income as an item of Other Comprehensive Income. Itisimpracticable todisclose theextent of thepossible effects of an assumption on another source of estimation uncertainty at theend of thereporting period. On the basis of existing knowledge, outcomes within thenext financial year that are different from the assumption around thevaluation of the Trust's land, property, plant and equipment could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset recorded in note 9.1. 1.12.3 Subsequent expenditure Where subsequent expenditure enhances an asset beyond itsoriginal specification, thedirectly attributable cost iscapitalised. Where subsequent expenditure restores theasset toitsoriginal specification, theexpenditure iscapitalised and any existing carrying value of theitem replaced iswritten- out and charged to operating expenses. 1.12.4 Depreciation Items of property held at current value, are depreciated over their remaining Useful Economic Lives (UEL) as assessed by the NHS Foundation Trust's professional valuers in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is considered to have infinite life and is not depreciated. Leaseholds are depreciated over the primary lease term. Plant and Equipment initially held at current cost, is depreciated over the estimated UEL. Property, Plant and Equipment which has been reclassified as 'Held for Sale' ceases to be depreciated. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use. The following UELs apply to each individual asset category based on standard asset lives adjusted for local use and expected technology changes: Land - Land is not depreciated because it is considered to have an infinite life Buildings excluding dwellings - 15 to 75 years Plant and Machinery - 5 to 30 years Transport Equipment - 5 to 15 years Furniture and Fittings - 5 to 30 years Information Technology - 5 to 15 yearsPage 10Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Annual Accounts 2018/19 1. Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.13 Investment properties Investment properties are measured at fair value, changes in fair value are recognised as gains or losses in income/expenditure. Only those assets which are held solely to generate a commercial return are considered tobe investment properties. Where an asset is held, inpart, for support service delivery objectives, then it isconsidered tobe an item of property, plant and equipment. Properties occupied by employees, whether or not they pay rent at market rates, are not classified as investment properties. 1.14 Intangible Assets Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without physical substance, which are capable of sale separately from the restof the Trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only when it'sprobable that the future economic benefits willflow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust; where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably; and where the cost is at least \u00a35,000. (i) Internally generated intangible assets Internally generated goodwill, brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and similar items are not capitalised as intangible assets. Expenditure on research is not capitalised. Expenditure on development is capitalised only where all of the following can be demonstrated: t he project is technically feasible to the point of completion and will result in an intangible asset for sale or use; t he Trust intends to complete the asset and sell or use it; th e Trust has the ability to sell or use the asset; t he way in which intangible assets will generate probable future economic or service delivery benefits e.g. the presence of a market for its output or, where it is to be used for internal use, the usefulness of the asset; a dequate financial, technical or other resources are available to the Trust to complete the development and sell or use the asset; and t he Trust can measure reliably the expenses attributable to the asset during development. (ii) Software Software which is integral tothe operation of hardware e.g. an operating system is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral tothe operation of hardware e.g. application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Costs associated with maintaining software are recognised as an expense when incurred. Capitalised computer software is amortised over the expected useful economic life or 5 years, whichever is the shorter. 1.14.2 Measurement Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at cost. The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the criteria for recognition are initially met. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, the expenditure is recognised in the period which it is incurred. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at current value in existing use by reference to an active market, or, where no market exists, at the lower of amortised replacement cost (modern equivalent assets basis) and value in use where the asset is income generating. Internally-developed software is held at historic cost to reflect the opposing effects of increases in the development costs and technological advances. Revaluations and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. 1.15 Depreciation Freehold land, assets under construction or development, investment properties, stockpiled goods and assets held for sale are not depreciated/amortised. Otherwise, depreciation or amortisation is charged to write off the costs or valuation of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, less any residual value, on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which the Trust expects to obtain economic benefits or service potential from the asset. This is specific to the Trust and may be shorter than the physical life of the asset itself. Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year end, with the effect of any changes recognised on a prospective basis. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life, unless the Trust expects to acquire the asset at the end of the lease term, in which case the asset is depreciated in the same manner as for owned assets. 1.14.1 RecognitionPage 11Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Annual Accounts 2018/19 1. Accounting Policies (Continued) At each financial year end, the Trust checks whether there is any indication that its property, plant and equipment or intangible assets have suffered an impairment loss. If there is indication of such an impairment, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine whether there has been a loss and, if so, its amount. Intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually at the financial year end. Impairment losses thatarise from aclear consumption of economic benefit aretaken toexpenditure. Where an impairment losssubsequently reverses, thecarrying amount of theasset isincreased to the revised estimate of therecoverable amount but capped at theamount that would have been determined had there been no initial impairment loss. The reversal of the impairment loss is credited to expenditure. 1.16 Donated Assets Donated non-current assets are capitalised at current value in existing use, if they will be held for their service potential, or otherwise at fair value on receipt, with a matching credit to income. They are valued, depreciated and impaired as described above for purchased assets. Gains and losses on revaluations, impairments and sales are treated in the same way as for purchased assets. Deferred income is recognised only where conditions attached to the donation preclude immediate recognition of the gain. 1.17 Leases Leases areclassified as finance leases when substantially all therisks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 1.17.1 The Trust as a lessee Property, plant and equipment held under finance leases are initially recognised, at the inception of the lease, at fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, with a matching liability for the lease obligation to the lessor. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are recognised initially as a liability and subsequently as a reduction of rentals on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land and building components are separated and individually assessed as to whether they are operating or finance leases. 1.17.2 The Trust as a lessor Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Trust's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Trust's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Page 12Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Annual Accounts 2018/19 1.Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.18 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, using the first-in first-out cost formula. 1.19 Cash and equivalents Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are investments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of [the entity]'s cash management. Cash, bank and overdraft balances are recorded at current values. 1.20 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Trust has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Trust will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows using HM Treasury's discount rates. Early retirement provisions are discounted using HM Treasury's pension discount rate of 0.29% (2017-18: 0.10%) in real terms. All other provisions are subject to four separate discount rates according to the expected timing of cashflows from the Statement of Financial Position date: A short term rate of 0.76 % (2017-18: -2.42%) for expected cash flows up to and including 5 years. A medium term rate of 1.14% (2017-18: -1.85%) for expected cash flows over 5 years up to and including 10 years. A long term rate of 1.99% (2017-18: -1.56%) for expected cash flows over 10 years. A very long term rate of 1.99% (2017-18: -1.56%) for expected cash flows exceeding 40 years. 2018/19 percentages are at nominal rates, whereas 2017/18 percentages are in real terms. 1.21 Clinical Negligence The NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) operates a risk pooling scheme under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to the NHSLA, which in return settles all clinical negligence claims. The contribution is charged to expenditure. Although the NHSLA is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases, the legal liability remains with the Trust. 1.22 Non-clinical risk pooling The Trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to the NHS Litigation Authority and, in return, receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any excesses payable in respect of particular claims are charged to operating expenses as and when they become due. 1.23 Carbon Reduction Commitment scheme (CRC) The CRC scheme is a mandatory cap and trade scheme for non-transport CO2 emissions. The Trust is registered with the CRC scheme, and is therefore required to surrender to the Government an allowance for every tonne of CO2 it emits during the financial year. A liability and related expense is recognised in respect of this obligation as CO2 emissions are made. The carrying amount of the liability at the financial year end will therefore reflect the CO2 emissions that have been made during that financial year, less the allowances (if any) surrendered voluntarily during the financial year in respect of that financial year. The liability will be measured at the amount expected to be incurred in settling the obligation. This will be the cost of the number of allowances required to settle the obligation. Allowances acquired under the scheme are recognised as intangible assets.Page 13Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Annual Accounts 2018/19 1. Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.24 Contingent liabilites and contingent assetsA contingent liability is: a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Trust; or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that a payment will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured sufficiently reliably; A contingent liability is disclosed unless the possibility of a payment is remote. A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Trust. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Where the time value of money is material, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are disclosed at their present value. 1.25 Financial assets Financial assets are recognised when the Trust becomes party to the financial instrument contract or, in the case of trade receivables, when the goods or services have been delivered. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights have expired or the asset has been transferred and the Trust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership or has not retained control of the asset. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value. Fair value is determined by reference toquoted market prices where possible, otherwise by valuation techniques. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, to the initial fair value of the financial asset. Financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at amortised costs, financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. The classification is determined by the cash flow and business model characteristics of hte financial assets, as set out in IFRS 9, and is determined at the time of initial recognition. 1.25.1 Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets measured at amortised cost are those held within a business model whose objective it to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and where the cash flows are solely payments of principle and interest. This includes most trade receivables, loans receivable and other simple debt instruments. After initial recognition, these financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of the financial assset. 1.25.2 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are those held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assests and where the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. 1.25.3 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are those that are not otherwise measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. This includes derivatives and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. 1.25.2 Impairment For all financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (except equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income), lease receivables and contract assets, the Trust recognises a loss allowance representing expected credit losses on the financial instrument. The Trust adopts the simplified approach to impairment, in accordance with IFRS 9, and measures the loss allowance for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For other financial assets, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition (stage 2), and otherwise at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses (stage 1). HM Treasury has ruled that central government bodies may not recognise stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against other government departments, their executive agencies, the Bank of England, Exchequer Funds, and Exchequer Funds' assets where repayment is ensured by primary legislation. The Trust therefore does not recognise loss allowances for stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against these bodies. Additionally, the Department of Health and Social Care provides a guarantee of last resort agaisnt the debts of its arm's length bodies and NHS bodies (excluding NHS charities), and the Trust does not recognise loss allowances for stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against these bodies. For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as an impairment gain or loss.Page 14Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Annual Accounts 2018/19 1. Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.26 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are recognised when the Trust becomes party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument or, in the case of trade payables, when the goods or services have been received. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the liability has been discharged - that is, the liability has been paid or has expired. Loans from the Department of Health and Social Care are recognised at historic cost. Otherwise, financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. 1.26.1 Other financial liabilities After initial recognition, all other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except for loans from Department of Health and Social Care, which are carried at historic cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the life of the asset, to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. Interest is recognised using the effective interest method. 1.27 Public Dividend Capital (PDC) and PDC dividend Public dividend capital is a type of public sector equity finance, which represents the Department of Health and Social Care's investment in the trust. HM Treasury has determined that, being issued under statutory authority rather than under contract, PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. At any time, the Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. An annual charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the trust, is payable to the Department of Health and Social Care as PDC dividend. The charge is calculated at the real rate set by the Secretary of State with the consent of HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the trust. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less all liabilities, except for: donated assets (including lottery funded assets) average daily cash balances held with the Government Banking Service (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits (excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short term working capital facility) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable. The average relevant net assets is calculated as a simple average of opening and closing relevant net assets. In accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care, the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the \"pre-audit\" version of the annual accounts. The dividend thus calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result the audit of the annual accounts. The PDC dividend calculation is based upon the trust's group accounts (i.e. including subsidiaries), but excluding consolidated charitable funds.] 1.28 Foreign currencies The Trust's functional currency and presentational currency is pounds sterling, and figures are presented in thousands of pounds unless expressly stated otherwise. Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated into sterling at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At the end of the reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the spot exchange rate on 31 March. Exchange gains and losses on monetary items (arising on settlement of the transaction or on retranslation at the Statement of Financial Position date) are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.Page 15Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Annual Accounts 2018/19 1. Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.29 Third party assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) arenot recognised inthe accounts since theTrust has no beneficial interest inthem. Details ofthird party assets aregiven inNote 24 to the accounts. 1.30 Losses and Special Payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in expenditure on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had the Trust not been bearing its own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). 1.31 Gifts Gifts are items that are voluntarily donated, with no preconditions and without the expectation of any return. Gifts include all transactions economically equivalent to free and unremunerated transfers, such as the loan of an asset for its expected useful life, and the sale or lease of assets at below market value. 1.32 Accounting Standards that have been issued but have not yet been adopted The DHSC GAM does not require thefollowing Standards and Interpretations tobe in2018-19. These standards arestillsubject toHMTreasury FReM adoption, with IFRS 16 being for implementation and thegovernment implementation date for IFRS 17still subject toHM Treasury consideration.

Further details on how the dividend was calculated are set out in note 1.27.Pension related provisions as at 31 March 2019 consist of \u00a30.628m in relation to Injury Benefits and \u00a30.325m relating to Early Retirement benefits payable to former employees of the Trust. These benefits are calculated and paid to the individuals concerned by the NHS Pensions Agency (NHSPA) and the provision represents the future liability of the Trust based on expected lifetime calculations discounted appropriately. The amount provided by the NHSLA in respect of clinical negligence liabilities of the trust as at 31 March 2019 is \u00a3207,791,496 (2017/18 - \u00a3182,305,000).The Clinical Negligence provision totals \u00a30.055m and is based on the estimated liability arising in the next year relating to claims that are being dealt with by the NHS Litigation Authority on behalf of the Trust. Redundancy provisions of \u00a30.016m are based on the likely obligation of the Trust towards a small number of staff who are at risk of redundancy in the next year due to the outsoucing of certain back office administrative functions to an external provider. The most significant elements of the other provisions figure are the following: \u00a31.5m in respect of potential data challenges from commissioners relating to clinical contract income, \u00a31.0m relating to the estimated value of untaken annual leave owed to Trust employees as at 31 March 2019, \u00a30.245m in relation to a contractual issue with the Trust's facilities management provider, \u00a30.24m in relation to potential employment tribunal claims and \u00a32.965m in relation to provision for future credit notes.Page 28Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Annual Accounts 2018/19 18.

IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation), IAS 39 (Financial Instrument Recognition and Measurement) and IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures) require disclosure of the role that financial instruments have played during the period in creating or changing the risks an entity faces in undertaking its activities. The Trust does not have any complex financial instruments and does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. In light of the continuing service provider relationship the Trust has with Clinical Commissioning Groups and the way those Clinical Commissioning Groups are financed, the Trust is not exposed to the degree of financial risk faced by non NHS business entities. The Trust has limited powers to borrow or invest surplus funds and financial assets and liabilities are generated by day-to-day operational activities rather than being held to change the risks facing the Trust in undertaking its activities. The Audit Committee manages the Trust's funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures and their delegated authorities. The Trust's financial instruments comprise loans, provisions, cash at bank and in hand and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to fund the Trust's operations.Page 32Homerton University Hospital 931 a) 24.

Initial Application of IFRS 9 27.1 Initial Application of IFRS 15 IFRS 15 introduces a new model for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers replacing the previous standards IAS 11, IAS 18 and related interpretations. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue when it satisfies performance obligations through the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As directed by the GAM,t he Trust has applied the practical expendient offered in C7A of the standard removing the need to retrospectively restate any contract modifications that occurred before the date of implementation (1 April 2018). IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as interpreted and adapted by the GAM has been applied by the Trust from 1 April 2018. The standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to reserves on 1 April 2018. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and introduces a revised approach to classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, a new forward-looking \"expected loss\" impairment model and a revised approach to hedge accounting. Under IFRS 9, borrowings from the Department of Health and Social Care, which were previously held at historic cost, are measured on an amortised cost basis. Consequently, on 1 April 2018 borrowings increased by \u00a30.042m and trade payables reduced accordingly. Reassessment of allowances for credit losses under the expected loss model resulted in nil decrease in the carrying value of receivables. The GAM expands the definition of a contract in the context of financial instruments to include legislation and regulations, except where this gives rise to a tax. Implementation of this adaptation on 1 April 2018 has led to the classification of receivables relating to Injury Cost Recovery as a financial asset measured at amortised cost. The carrying value of these receivables at 1 April 2018 was \u00a31.8m. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers as interpreted and adapted by the GAM has been applied by the Trust from 1 April 2018. The standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to the income and expenditure reserve on 1 April 2018.www.homerton.nhs.ukHomerton University Hospital, Homerton "}
