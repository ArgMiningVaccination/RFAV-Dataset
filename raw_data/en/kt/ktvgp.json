On Sunday, March 12th at 10 am, join certified shamanic energy practitioner Danielle Manseau and certified meditation, yoga, and mindfulness instructor Sydnie Mulcahy for an hour and a half long guided meditation and shamanic healing. During this event, you will be guided into meditation by Sydnie to relax the body and free the mind of what no longer serves you. Simultaneously, you will receive group-focused and one-on-one shamanic energy work from Danielle as she works her way around the room. This type of healing removes any energy that is blocking you from fully grounding and calls in positive energy to support you in the present and future. Any messages that come through for the group will be shared during the experience. This immersive experience will leave you feeling zen, re-energized, balanced, and at peace in your mind, body, and soul. Start 2023 by prioritizing self care, and let this session be the beginning of your journey to your highest self. Reserve your space today at www.prismwheel.com/events.
