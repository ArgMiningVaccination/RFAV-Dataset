They include colds and flu. Pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi cause these diseases. Communicable diseases can transmit through contact with bodily fluids, insect bites, contaminated surfaces, water, and foods, or through the air. This article will discuss communicable diseases, their symptoms, and how to avoid them. A communicable disease is any disease that passes between people or animals. People sometimes refer to communicable diseases as \"infectious\" or \"transmissible\" diseases. Pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, cause communicable diseases. [Learn more about the different types of pathogens here.](/articles/pathogens-definition) Symptoms Once a pathogen has entered a person's body, it often will begin replicating. The individual may then begin to experience symptoms. Symptoms will vary depending on the disease. Some people will not experience any symptoms. However, they can still transmit the pathogen. Some symptoms are a direct result of the pathogen damaging the body's cells. Others are due to the body's immune response to the infection. Some communicable diseases may be mild, and symptoms pass after a few days. However, some can be serious and potentially life threatening. Symptom severity may vary depending on a person's overall health and immune function. Four main types of pathogens cause infection: Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Viruses [Viruses](/articles/158179) are tiny pathogens that contain genetic material. Unlike other pathogens, they lack the complex structure of a cell. To replicate, they must enter the cells of other living beings. Once inside, they use the cell's machinery to make copies of themselves. Bacteria [Bacteria](/articles/157973) are microscopic, single-celled organisms. They exist in almost every environment on earth, including inside the human body. Many bacteria are harmless, and some help the body to function. However, bacteria can also cause infections that damage the body. Fungi [Fungi](/articles/158134) are a type of organism that includes yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. There are [millions](https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/features/fungal-infections.html) [Fungal infections](/articles/317970) can occur anywhere in the body. However, they commonly affect the skin and mucus membranes. Protozoa Protozoa are microscopic organisms that typically consist of a single cell. Some protozoa are parasitic, meaning they live on or inside another organism and use the organism's nutrients for their own survival. Parasitic protozoa can cause various diseases. Common viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoa diseases include: Rhinoviruses Rhinoviruses are a viruses that are the [most common](https://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/index.html) [common cold](/articles/166606). Symptoms of a cold may [include](https://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/) A person can catch a rhinovirus by inhaling contaminated droplets from the cough or sneeze of another person. Similarly, rhinoviruses are spread by people touching their nose, eyes, or mouth after touching items or surfaces that have come into contact with the virus. Coronaviruses [Coronaviruses](/articles/covid-19) are a large group of viruses that [affect the respiratory system](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses) Influenza [Influenza](/articles/15107) viruses are infections that attack the respiratory system. Some [potential symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/symptoms.htm) [fever](/articles/168266)or [chills](/articles/chills) [stuffy or runny - muscle or [body aches](/articles/319985) [fatigue](/articles/248002) A person can catch influenza viruses in the same way they may catch rhinoviruses. HIV [HIV](/articles/17131) attacks the immune system of its host. This makes the person vulnerable to other infections and diseases. A person can contract HIV as a result of contact with blood or other body fluids containing the virus. The symptoms of HIV may [develop gradually](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/) [include](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/symptoms-of-hiv): - fever - chills [muscle aches](/articles/322869) - fatigue The only way a person can be certain they have HIV is to have an HIV test. Although there is no cure for HIV, [medications](/articles/324300) can help to keep the virus under control or make it undetectable. Without such treatment, HIV can develop into [AIDS](/articles/17131). [Learn more about undetectable HIV here.](/articles/undetectable-hiv) Other medications can help prevent a person from contracting HIV. People at high risk of HIV and those who believe they may have had exposure to it should speak with their primary healthcare professional about these options. Salmonella and Escherichia coli Nontyphoidal [Salmonella](/articles/160942) and [Escherichia coli (E. coli)](/articles/68511) are two different types of bacteria that can infect the digestive system. Another form of salmonella, Salmonella typhi, can also cause [typhoid](/articles/156859). They typically spread through [contaminated foods](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/public-health-and-safety/what-is-the-difference-between-salmonella-and-e-coli/index.html), such as uncooked meats and eggs, unwashed fruits and vegetables, and contaminated water sources. Salmonella [can also spread](https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/salmonella) through contact with live animals, including chickens, and through person-to-person contact. Some symptoms of these infections include: - abdominal cramps [diarrhea](/articles/158634) - fever - headache Tuberculosis [Tuberculosis (TB)](/articles/8856) is a bacterial infection that primarily attacks the lungs. It may cause the following symptoms: - a cough continuing for more than [3 weeks](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/tuberculosis/symptoms-diagnosis) [loss of appetite](/articles/324011) [unintentional weight loss](/articles/326417) - fever - chills - night sweats A person can catch TB by inhaling tiny droplets or \"aerosols\" from the cough or sneeze of a person who has the infection. Ringworm [Ringworm](/articles/158004) is a [common](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ringworm/) fungal infection of the skin. The characteristic symptom of ringworm is a ring-shaped rash. It may be dry, scaly, or itchy. People may contract ringworm through: - close contact with a person who has ringworm - sharing towels, bedding, or other personal items with a person who has ringworm - close contact with animals with ringworm, typically cats Without treatment, ringworm [may spread](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/ringworm-overview) to other parts of the body. Athlete's foot [Athlete's foot](/articles/261244) is a common fungal infection that affects the skin on the feet. It typically causes sore or itchy white patches between the toes. People can contract athlete's foot through direct contact with someone who has the fungus or surfaces that have been in contact with the fungus. For example, an individual might contract athlete's foot after walking barefoot in locker rooms, showers, or swimming pools. Plasmodium The protozoa Plasmodium genus causes the tropical disease [malaria](/articles/150670). The parasite primarily [transmits](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria) [mosquito bites](/articles/311485). Malaria causes symptoms such as: - fever and chills - headaches - vomiting - diarrhea - muscle pains Without proper treatment, malaria can be life threatening. Vaccination programs are also effectively protecting people from malaria fatalities. Lyme disease Lyme disease is a potentially serious infection that black-legged ticks can pass to humans. It is the [most common](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html) The bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi causes the majority of Lyme disease cases. However, the bacteria Borrelia mayonii may also cause the disease. Symptoms of Lym disease include: - headache - fatigue - fever - skin rash Lyme disease can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system if a person does not treat it. A person may develop a communicable disease after becoming infected by the pathogen. This may happen through: - direct contact with a person carrying the pathogen - contact with bodily fluids containing pathogens - inhaling pathogen-containing droplets from another person's cough or sneeze - receiving a bite from an animal or insect carrying the pathogen - consuming contaminated water or foods People can reduce their risk of contracting or transmitting disease-causing pathogens by following the steps below: [washing their hands thoroughly](/articles/proper-hand-washing)and regularly - disinfecting surfaces at home often, especially doorknobs and food areas - disinfecting personal items such as phones - cooking meats, eggs, and other foods thoroughly - practicing good hygiene when preparing and handling food - avoiding eating spoiled food - avoiding touching wild animals - receiving available vaccinations - taking antimalarial medications when traveling where there is a malaria risk - check for ticks and other parasites Some communicable diseases cause only mild symptoms that disappear without treatment. Others may cause severe symptoms or potentially life threatening complications. Patients require different treatment depending on disease process and clinical presentation. Viral infections Vaccines are a highly effective method for preventing specific viral infections. There are several [different types](https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html) of vaccines. When a person receives a vaccine, they are receiving a form of the virus. The immune system responds by producing antibodies capable of killing an active form of the virus in the future. If a person already has a virus, they may require antiviral medications to keep the virus under control. Bacterial infections Bacterial infections can range from mild to life threatening. A person who has a bacterial infection may require a course of [antibiotics](/articles/10278) to help control the infection. These medications can help to kill bacteria or slow them down so the immune system can counteract them. However, many bacteria are developing a resistance to antibiotics, which poses a major health risk. More than [2.8 million](https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest-threats.html) A person should only ever take antibiotics on a medical recommendation. Fungal infections A severe or chronic fungal infection may require prescription [antifungal medications](/articles/antifungal) and, in rare cases, intravenous medication. However, people can treat many mild infections, such as ringworm and athlete's foot, with over-the-counter topical ointments. Communicable diseases are diseases that can pass from person to person. The pathogens that cause these diseases can spread in various ways, such as through the air, contact with contaminated substances or surfaces, or from animal and insect bites. Many communicable diseases cause mild symptoms that go away without treatment. Others require treatment to prevent them from becoming more serious. There are steps a person can take to reduce their risk of contracting and transmitting disease-causing pathogens. These include receiving available vaccinations, practicing regular handwashing, and maintaining good hygiene at home. "}
