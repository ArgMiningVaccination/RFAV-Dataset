This has brought hope to millions of Americans in the midst of an ongoing globalpandemic. The FDA EUA guidance for both vaccines is to notadminister the vaccine to individuals with a known history of asevere allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of theCOVID-19 vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) additionally advises individuals with a historyof an immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable or anyhistory of anaphylaxis be observed for 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. All other individuals should be observed for 15minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. Staff at vaccine clinicsmust be able to identify and manage anaphylaxis. Post eFDA EUA, despite very strong safety signals in both phase 3 trials,reports of possible allergic reactions have raised public concern.To provide reassurance and support during widespread globalvaccination, allergists must offer clear guidance to individualsbased on the best information available, but also in accordancewith the broader recommendations of regulatory agencies.

In theUnited States, the pandemic has risen to crisis levels in everystate, setting records with tens of thousands of new cases reporteddaily and deaths mounting. As of January 9, 2021, more than 89million people globally have had con rmed infections and almost 2 million have died of COVID-19. 1Medical necessities are often in short supply, hospitals are overwhelmed, and health care aDivision of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass bHarvard Medical School, Boston, Mass cDivision of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women 's Hospital, Boston, Mass dDepartment of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn eAllergy Division, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Wash fDivision of Allergy & Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas gEdward P.

Given the importance of the vaccine in ghting this public health crisis, understanding the allergic reactions with the approvedmRNA COVID-19 vaccines is crucial. At the time of writing thisreview, immediate reactions clinically compatible with anaphy-laxis have occurred at a rate of 11.1 per million doses of thePzer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 2Anaphylaxis has also been reported from the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vac-cine. Currently, the speci c mechanism of allergy and the inciting antigen have not been identi ed. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate allergicreactions associated with the mRNA vaccines and potentialmechanisms of hypersensitivity. We provide recommendationsbased on expert opinion using the currently available evidence tofacilitate safe vaccination based on updated epidemiology andguidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention (CDC), US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) andother regulatory agencies. The information provided in thismanuscript is intended as guidance and a framework for thepracticing Allergist based on the best available evidence at thetime. Although it is expected to have global relevance it does notreplace or override any guidance provided by public health orregulatory agencies. 3 CLINICAL TRIAL DATA The US FDA 's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of 2 highly effective COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020 was alandmark in the pandemic response for Americans. The P zer- BioNTech 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine regimen given on day0 and 21 showed a 95% ef cacy at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection, measured forward from 7 days after thesecond dose was administered. 4The vaccine appeared equally protective across age groups as well as racial and ethnic groups.4 The Moderna 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine regimen given on day0 and 28 was 94% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, measured from 14 days after the second dose onward. 5The efcacy of the Moderna vaccine appeared to be slightly lower in people 65 years and older, but it was equally effective acrossdifferent racial and ethnic groups. 5The safety of both vaccines over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viralvaccines. Severe systemic events were reported in less than 2% ofPzer-BioNTech vaccine recipients after either dose, except for 3.8% reporting fatigue and 2.0% reporting headache after thesecond dose. Most adverse events reported after receiving theModerna vaccine were mild or moderate in severity. A smallnumber of participants reported systemic reactions lasting longerthan 7 days, but there was no difference between vaccine andplacebo groups. The P zer-BioNTech EUA is for individuals 16 years and older, whereas Moderna is for individuals 18 years andolder. There are currently insuf cient data for ef cacy, safety,and effectiveness of these vaccines in children under 16 years ofage but studies are ongoing. Before FDA EUA of a COVID-19 vaccine, the United Kingdom Commission on Human Medicines initiated itsCOVID-19 vaccination program using the P zer-BioNTech vaccine. Within 48 hours, there were 2 reports of severeallergic reactions in the United Kingdom that prompted treat-ment with epinephrine. These reported allergic reactions led to acloser review of the P zer-BioNTech clinical trial data by the FDA. The P zer-BioNTech trial excluded patients with a pre- vious history of severe adverse reactions associated with anyvaccine, and both the P zer-BioNTech and Moderna trials further excluded severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to anycomponent of their COVID-19 vaccine. Hypersensitivity-relatedadverse events were observed in 0.63% of P zer-BioNTech and 1.5% of Moderna vaccine clinical trial participants who receivedthe vaccine, compared with 0.51% and 1.1%, respectively, in theplacebo groups. One case of anaphylaxis and 1 drug hypersen-sitivity reaction were reported in the P zer-BioNTech trial, 6and 2 cases of delayed hypersensitivity reactions were reported in theModerna trial. 5Only 1 of the Moderna delayed allergic reactions was in the vaccine group, and, because it occurred several monthsafter vaccination, it was unlikely to be related to the vaccine.Also, in the Moderna trial, there were 3 events of lip/faceswelling 1 to 2 days after vaccination but exclusively in patientswith a history of dermal llers but unclear from which manu- facturer. There were no anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivityreactions reported with close temporal relation to administrationof the Moderna vaccine. US REGULATORY APPROVAL AND GUIDANCE The FDA EUA guidance for the P zer-BioNTech COVID- 19 vaccine speci es\"do not administer P zer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to individuals with known history of a se-vere allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of thePzer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. \"Given the reported re- actions in health care workers, the US CDC subsequentlyadvised that all patients \u2014regardless of allergy history \u2014should be observed for 15 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination andthat vaccination staff must be trained to manage anaphylaxis.The CDC provided further recommendations \"that persons who have had an immediate allergic reaction of any severity to anyvaccine or injectable therapy (intramuscular, intravenous, orsubcutaneous) discuss the risk of receiving the vaccine with theirdoctors and be monitored for 30 minutes afterward. \"In addi- tion, patients who have an immediate (within 4 hours) or severeallergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to an mRNA COVID-19vaccine should not receive a second dose. CDC precautionsand contraindications for the Moderna vaccine under EUA werethe same as for the P zer-BioNTech vaccine for the purpose of \"harmonization. \" 3 US POSTMARKETING EXPERIENCE Similar to the UK experience, within a few days of widespread vaccination of health care workers in the United States, severalreports of presumed allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccineemerged. At the time of publication, there have been 21conrmed anaphylactic reactions to the P zer-BioNTech vaccine across almost 1.9 million doses administered in the UnitedStates. 2Of note, while 175 severe allergic reactions to the P zer-J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT MONTH 20212 BANERJI ET ALBioNTech were identi ed, upon further review, only 21 were consistent with anaphylaxis. This highlights the criticallyimportant role for allergists in clinical phenotyping of these re-actions with subsequent risk strati cation rather than vaccine avoidance. The majority of CDC-con rmed anaphylactic re- actions (86%, 18/21) occurred within a 30-minute observationwindow, and patients were treated immediately with completeresolution of symptoms. While there are more epidemiologicdata currently available for the P zer-BioNTech vaccine, the authors have personal knowledge through clinical care of at least3 possible anaphylactic reactions to the Moderna COVID-19vaccine. To date, there are no fatalities associated with reportedallergic reactions to any COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY OF ALLERGICREACTIONS TO VACCINES Allergic reactions to vaccines are generally described as occurring at a rate of 1.31 (95% CI, 0.90-1.84) cases per millionvaccine doses from a large population-based study, with no fa-talities reported. 7Rates remain similar when strati ed by age and sex, although slightly higher frequencies have been observed infemales. 7The incidence of allergic reaction by speci c vaccine, however, is dif cult to quantify in epidemiologic studies, because often multiple vaccines are administered on the same day. Thecases that followed the administration of a single vaccine involvedpredominantly trivalent in fluenza vaccine, for which the rate of reaction was estimated to be 1.35 (95% CI, 0.65-2.47) permillion vaccine doses. 7Of concern is that, although numericallyrare, vaccine reactions can cause substantial fear and anxiety inthe general population and may contribute to decreased will-ingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, not allimmediate reactions that occur in association with vaccines aretrue allergic reactions (eg, flushing, transient dyspnea) and careful clinical phenotyping is necessary to prevent large-scale COVID-19 vaccine avoidance. This is apparent in the recent CDC reportdemonstrating that of 175 possible severe allergic reactions, 86(49%) were nonanaphylactic allergic reactions. 2 Conrmed allergic reactions to vaccines are not frequently attributed to the active ingredients, but rather to the inactive in-gredients, or excipients, including egg protein, gelatin, formalde-hyde, thimerosal, or neomycin. Excipients are necessary and addedto a vaccine for speci c purposes such as stimulating a stronger immune response, preventing contamination by bacteria, or sta-bilizing the potency of the vaccine during transportation andstorage. Excipients represent the major contributor to speci c IgE- mediated and immediate reactions associated with vaccines. 8Ef- forts to speci cally decrease well-known excipients such as egg and gelatin in vaccines have been highly successful in reducing subse-quent allergic reactions. 9,10Other excipients, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbate ( Figure 1 ), are used to improve water solubility in drugs and vaccines. PEG itself has not previously beenused in a vaccine, but polysorbate has been identi ed as a rare cause of allergic reactions to vaccines. First-dose reactions to vaccinescontaining polysorbates may have occurred because of previoussensitization from polysorbate 80. 11The recently approved P zer- BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are notformulated with any food, drugs, or latex, but both contain the FIGURE 1.

The speci c PEG in these vaccines is different from the PEG used most commonly inother health care products, both in molecular weight and due to itscoformulation as a stabilizing portion of a liposome. 11,13TheAstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccinescurrently under development do not contain PEG but insteadcontain the excipient polysorbate 80 ( Table II ).

In addition, PEG3350 is the active ingredient in several medications prescribed for treating constipation (eg, Mir-alax) and in bowel preps used before colonoscopy (eg, GoLytely).Although considered to be safe and biologically inert, several re-ports have shown that up to 70% of patients who have undergonetreatment with PEGylated therapeutics will develop anti-PEG IgGantibodies. 15A more recent study in the general population showed that 5% to 9% of 1721 of 948 such samples werepositive for anti-PEG IgM, and 2 of 2091 (0.1%) samples testedwere positive for anti-PEG IgE. 16Also, reactions to PEG- containing products on the rst exposure suggest previous sensi- tization to PEG. However, a review of FDA voluntary reportingdata from 2005 through 2017 identi ed an average of just 4 cases (range, 2-8 cases) per year of PEG-associated anaphylaxis duringcolonoscopy preparation or laxative use. 11Interestingly, more subtle PEG allergies are usually discovered during allergist evalu-ation of patients being evaluated for reactions to seemingly un-related products, including injectable steroids, processed foods,cosmetics, drugs, and other substances that contain PEG. 17Spe- cic IgE directed against PEG, currently a research tool, has recently been demonstrated in PEG-allergic patients who reactedboth to PEGs and, in 1 case, to a PEGylated liposomal productused as an echocardiogram contrast, by 2 independentmethods. 11,13,16In the earliest of these 3 reports, the binding of PEG-speci c IgG from patients with PEG anaphylaxis showed increased avidity as the molecular weight of the PEG assayedincreased from 1000 and above, with clinical tolerance of PEG300upon challenge, suggesting that not all PEGs are equally risky tocause reactions. 11Although an exact threshold of reactivity based on the molecular weight of PEG is not known, tolerance of PEGwith molecular weight less than 400 has been described in thosewho have documented anaphylaxis to PEG3350. 11It has been reported that those who lose reactivity to lower molecular weightPEG over time may still remain sensitized to very high molecularweight PEG. 18Additionally, there appears to be an increased incidence of allergic reactions in patients who receive intravenousPEG compared to the intramuscular route. 19,20Althoughanaphylaxis to oral PEG has been postulated to be due to animpaired epithelial barrier, as PEG is normally used as an osmoticlaxative due to its lack of absorption, anaphylaxis with serum IgEdetected to PEG has occurred in individuals without any apparentdefect. 21 Polysorbate, structurally similar to PEG with polyether do- mains with observed clinical cross-reactivity ( Figure 1 ), is also an excipient in a multitude of medical preparations (eg, vitamin oils,vaccines, and anticancer agents), creams, ointments, lotions, andmedication ( IV ). 22For example, at least 70% of injectable biological agents and mAb treatments contain apolysorbate, most typically polysorbate 80. 23Unfortunately, polysorbate and its degradation products are known to beintrinsically anaphylactogenic, leading to a plausible explanationfor multiple reports of anaphylaxis in patients receivingpolysorbate-containing biologics, vaccines, steroids, and chemo-therapeutics, although there is limited in vivo and in vitro evi- dence to support this, and isolated sensitization throughpolysorbates appears rare and less common than through highermolecular weight PEG. 24-29Attempts have been made to address these issues by using safer alternatives to polysorbate, but thenegative allergic outcomes are often outweighed by the clinicalbenet of improved drug performance. In the context of evolving literature demonstrating PEG as an allergen, many allergists havehypothesized that any cases of anaphylaxis during the rollout ofthe P zer/BioNTech and Moderna severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, which usedifferent liposomal delivery vehicles but contain PEG2000,could potentially be due to preexisting PEG allergy. 30 The positive and negative predictive values of skin testing to PEG in the evaluation of potential allergy to the mRNACOVID-19 vaccines are not clear but has shown utility in theevaluation of individuals with a history of anaphylaxis toPEG. 11,18Allergists have signi cant experience with skin testing, however drug skin testing relies on the use of nonirritating skintesting concentrations which are helpful when positive, but donot rule out allergy when negative. With the currently availablemRNA COVID-19 vaccines, PEG is the only component thatcan be tested using skin prick and intradermal testing techniques.TABLE IV. (Continued) Drug class Generic ET AL 7Thus, PEG skin testing could be considered in the evaluation ofindividuals with a history of IgE mediated allergy to a PEGcontaining injectable or a possible IgE mediated reaction toeither of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Weshould remember, to date, that there is no con rmation IgE mediated reactions to PEG are responsible for reported reactionsto the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Polysorbate, which is cross-reactive with PEG, is the excipient in both the AstraZeneca andJohnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines (currently not FDAapproved). Therefore, PEG and polysorbate skin testing may beof value in shared decision making around future COVID-19vaccination. 31 In addition to considering excipients as the cause of IgE- mediated allergic reactions to the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines, alternative non-IgE pathways for activating mastcells and other in flammatory cells must be considered, because they can lead to a similar clinical presentation. For example,activation of the complement system leads to the generation ofC3a, C4a, and C5a, which are potent activators of in flammation and are called anaphylatoxins due to their ability to causenoneIgE-mediated mast cell degranulation. One of the rst reports of acute anaphylaxis associated with serum complementdepletion was of a 45-year-old woman experiencing anaphylaxisafter receiving lidocaine. She developed faintness, flushing, pallor, dyspnea, and hypotension, but she did not have urticariaor bronchospasm. Complement levels were markedly low (C1q,C3, C4, C5, and factor B). 32Depletion of complement levels and production of C3a and C5a have been seen in both mousemodels of anaphylaxis and in clinical studies. C5a is the mostpotent of the anaphylatoxins and can contribute to vascularpermeability as well as activation and chemotaxis of neutrophils,basophils, and mast cells. Infection and tissue injury can lead toactivation of the complement system resulting in the generationof C3a and C5a, and these mediators can lead can cause pathway may be respon- sible for reactions to medications such as liposomal doxoru-bicin 35and other drugs in clinical trials.34Clearly, it is important to consider both IgE and alternative mechanisms for the currentreactions. Measurement of serum tryptase and complement mayhelp elucidate the mechanism of the drug-induced reactions inpatients following COVID-19 vaccination. It is also important to note that other nonimmunologic re- actions may masquerade as allergic reactions including anaphy-laxis. Vasovagal reactions are a well-known cause of hypotensionand syncopal reactions associated with injections including vac-cines. Panic or anxiety reactions can also present with symptomsmasquerading as allergic reactions such as flushing, shortness of breath, tachycardia, and lightheadedness. Inducible laryngealobstruction (ie, vocal cord dysfunction) may also masquerade asanaphylaxis, with prominent symptoms of shortness of breath FIGURE 2. Risk stratification pathways with categories based on Mass General Brigham and Vanderbilt allergy expert consensus before initial COVID-19 vaccination. *If \"yes\"for questions 1 or 2, specific investigation as to the specific injectable products and vaccines should be pursued to determine whether these products could have contained high-molecular-weight PEG, polysorbate, or polyoxyl 35castor oil (paclitaxel).

Indeed, the most recent CDC report demonstrated that of 175 potentialsevere allergic reactions, 61 (35%) were determined to benonallergic after case review. 2 EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH SEVEREALLERGY HISTORIES AND GUIDANCE FOR INITIALADMINISTRATION OF COVID-19 VACCINE Massive vaccination programs were initiated within a few days after the FDA EUA of the COVID-19 vaccines. However, manyquestions surrounded the safety of giving these vaccines to in-dividuals with a previous allergy history and further supported byrecent data showing that the majority (81%, 17/21) of patientswith con rmed anaphylaxis to the P mRNAvaccine had a prior allergy history and 33% (7/21) had a priorhistory of anaphylaxis. 2The CDC provides guidance with use of a recently developed pre-screening tool.36A similar approach, commonly used in the allergy eld, is to risk stratify patients based on a clinical assessment. The authors from Mass GeneralBrigham (formerly Partners HealthCare; comprising 16 healthcare institutions in the New England area and the largestemployer in Massachusetts with 80,000 employees) and Van-derbilt University Medical Center developed a plan of care to riskstratify employees and guide safe COVID-19 vaccination(Figure 2 ). To ensure vaccination in as many individuals as quickly as possible, our guidance, in line with FDA and CDCguidance, results in the rapid identi cation of high risk in- dividuals needing Allergist assessment but does not preclude largeTABLE V. Frequently asked questions (patient handout) What is vaccine allergy? Similar to medications or foods, people can be allergic to a vaccine. However, allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare (about 1 in 1 million people will have an allergic reaction to a vaccine). Some reactions are mild, such as hives as the only symptom, whereas others are more severe. A severeallergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. Symptoms start very quickly (usually within minutes) and almost always within 4 h of vaccination andtypically include multiple parts of the body: hives on the skin; swelling of mouth, lips, tongue, or throat; shortness of breath, wheezing, or chesttightness; or low blood pressure or loss of consciousness. About half of allergic reactions to vaccines happen in the rst 15 min after receiving the vaccination. Rarely delayed reactions such as fever and local arm swelling can occur up to 2-3 weeks later. These reactions should not preclude asecond dose of the vaccine. What about redness and swelling at the injection site \u2014is that an allergic reaction? Sometimes vaccines can cause large local reactions at the injection site, and these can begin hours after the vaccination or even the next day. The skin at the site of vaccination can become sore, swollen, red, and painful. Sometimes it can also become itchy. The symptoms can last several days. Althoughthis type of reaction can be uncomfortable, if it does not include the symptoms of allergic reactions listed above, it is notan allergic reaction to the vaccine, there is no risk of an allergic reaction with the next vaccination, and an allergist consultation is notnecessary. What is a severe allergic reaction? A severe allergic reaction is sometimes called anaphylaxis. Symptoms start very quickly (usually within minutes) and almost always within 4 h of vaccination and typically include hives; swelling of mouth, lips, tongue, or throat; shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest tightness; or low bloodpressure or loss of consciousness. What are the ingredients in the P zer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine? 1. mRNA. The active ingredient is a nucleoside-modi ed mRNA encoding /C15Sugar (sucrose) /C15The diluent, to the vaccine for administration, is saline (sodium chloride) What are the ingredients in acetate, /C15Sugar (sucrose) Which patients should speak to an allergist before receiving the vaccine? In the vaccine trials, only patients with a history of severe allergic reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic reaction to any compo nent of the vaccine were excluded. If you are unsure about your vaccine or PEG allergy history, an allergy consultation is recommended. In general, mostpatients allergic to one vaccine can receive other vaccinations safely. What is PEG and what are common products that contain PEG? PEG is a common, water-soluble ingredient in a wide variety of commercial products including some vaccines and more than 1000 FDA- approved medications. It is the primary ingredient in commonly used colonoscopy preparations (Golytely) or constipation treatment (Miralax) as we ll as in intraveous medications such as PEGylated medications. It is also used in ultrasound gel and injectable steroid injections such asmethylprednisolone acetate. Reactions to PEG are exceedingly rare, but anaphylaxis has been reported.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACTVOLUME -, NUMBER - BANERJI ET AL 9groups of individuals with lower risk allergy histories fromreceiving the COVID-19 vaccine per usual protocol with either15-minute or 30-minute observation periods. Four screening questions are presented to patients before the initial vaccination to assess risk: 1. Do you have a history of a severe allergic reaction to an injectable medication (intravenous, intramuscular, orsubcutaneous)? 2. Do you have a history of a severe allergic reaction to a previous vaccine? 3. Do you have a history of a severe allergic reaction to another allergen (eg, food, venom, or latex)? 4. Do you have a history of an immediate or severe allergic re- action to PEG-, a polysorbate-, or polyoxyl 35 castor oil (eg,paclitaxel)-containing injectable or vaccine? The screening questions address CDC guidelines and are accompanied by a \"Frequently Asked Questions \"document explaining medical terminolo gy, including descriptions of PEG and polysorbates ( Table V ). If the answer is \"no\"to all 4 questions, the individual would be deemed \"lower risk \"and receive the vaccine under usual protocol with a 15-minute observ ation period. If the answer to question 1, 2, or 3 is \"yes,\"the individual would be deemed \"medium risk \"and require a 30-minute observation period. In addition, if \"yes\"for 1 and 2, speci c investigation as to the speci c injectable products and vaccines should be pursued to determine whether these products could have contained high-molecular-weight PEG, polysorbate, or polyoxyl 35 (eg,paclitaxel). If the answer to question 4 is \"yes,\"the individual would be deemed \"higher risk, \"prompting evaluation with an allergist for clinic al phenotyping and consideration of expanded skin testing if history is not consistent withconrmed anaphylaxis using nonirritating skin test concen- trations ( Figures 3 and4). 11If skin testing result to PEG is positive, under EUA, the indiv idual is not a candidate for the Pzer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, and the skin test result to po lysorbate 20 and 80 become important with regard to the safety of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines indevelopment. If skin testing t o PEG is negative, vaccination with the P zer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines could be considered in conjunction with shared decisionmaking, informed consent, and would require 30 minutes ofobservation under Allergist supervision. EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTSWITH POTENTIAL REACTIONS TO THE COVID-19VACCINES For patients presenting to the allergist with a possible reac- tion to the rst dose of their COVID-19 vaccine, the primary concern is the ability to safely receive the second dose(Figure 5 ). Although the vaccines have some ef cacy related to only 1 dose, both the P zer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines received EUA approval for ef cacy, which was evaluated with 2 doses. As such, a crucial determination will be establishingwhether or not an allergic reaction occurred. Recent CDC datademonstrate that the vast majority, 84% (147/175) of reportedsevere \"allergic \"reactions, were uncon rmed after case review. 2 FIGURE 3.

For patients with a potential allergicreaction (eg, urticaria, angioedema) after their rst dose that does not meet criteria for anaphylaxis, vaccination programsshould prioritize follow-up with an allergist who can review theclinical history and consider PEG skin testing if an IgE-medi-ated reaction is suspected to risk stratify the patient prior to asecond COVID-19 vaccine dose ( Figure 5 ). Antihistamines do not prevent anaphylaxis and could mask cutaneous symptoms,leading to a delay in treatment. However, mg or cetirizine 10-20 mg 1-2 hoursprior to the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination can beconsidered in individuals with mild allergic symptoms (ie,pruritus or urticaria only), especially those that are delayed inonset. If a patient develops potential anaphylaxis to the rst vaccine dose, shared decision making with an allergist includingrisk strati cation and expanded skin testing should occur before any consideration of vaccine rechallenge ( Figure 5 ). There are no data on the safety of the second vaccine after con rmedanaphylaxis to the rst dose. For other vaccines for which there is much more allergy experience, split-dose challenges (eg, 10%-25% of the dose followed 30 minutes later by the remaining75%-90% of the dose) have been used. 38Although some groups have indicated their intent to implement split dosing of themRNA vaccines, there are no supportive ef cacy or safety data. For both the P zer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, neither the stability of the vaccine diluted nor the safety and immu-nogenicity at altered doses or concentration have been studied.It should be remembered that these are not simple proteinvaccines but instead are mRNA vaccines and subject to degra-dation. The P zer-BioNTech vaccine indeed is only 0.3 mL and there are no data, to date, for either mRNA vaccine showingsplit-dosing ef cacy. We do not recommend vaccine skin testing at this time because of limited vaccine supply, lack of infor-mation on sensitivity or speci city, unclear safety of skin testing. At the time of publication, mRNA vaccines are underEUA and remain unlicensed for skin testing. All patients with potential allergic reactions should be reported through formal processes, which include the Vaccine AdverseEvent Reporting System (VAERS; https://vaers.hhs.gov ); FIGURE 4.

To date, Mass General Brighamand Vanderbilt have instituted screening methods before andafter vaccination which consist of self-reported answers to aquestionnaire followed by telemedicine visits with an allergyclinician for high-risk patients prior to the rst vaccine dose or after potential allergic reactions to the rst dose. This allows forclinical phenotyping, risk strati cation, and reassurance to pa- tients deemed at lower risk to safely receive the vaccine. Forreactions that happen onsite, vaccination clinics are reliant onstaff that do not regularly diagnose and treat anaphylaxis, butCDC guidance emphasized a minimum of 15 minutes ofobservation after all doses and ready access to appropriate med-ical treatment for allergic reactions. Those staf ng the vaccina- tion clinic should Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening hypersensitivity re-action where rapid, early administration of epinephrine is vitalfor recovery. Along with the CDC educational and trainingvideos, 41allergists can help reassure patients and educate pro- viders by addressing a few key issues: 1. Education on the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.42Allergists should include differentiating vasovagal and anxiety reactions fromanaphylaxis and de ning anaphylaxis with infographics (Table VI andFigure 6 ). FIGURE 5.

For example, before the rollout of Mass GeneralBrigham employee vaccination, allergists provided antihistamine was added tothe anaphylaxis kits. It is necessary to recognize that somemedications in anaphylaxis kits contain PEG, and as suchit is important for clinics to use epinephrine for suspectedanaphylaxis cases. FIGURE 6.

Providing at-the-elbow support to vaccination programs. Al- lergists may need to be on-site or on-call during higher riskvaccination. This will ensure that vaccinated individuals withpossible reactions receive the best diagnostic evaluation andtreatment plan, while linking them to appropriate follow-upcare before the second vaccine dose. 4. Providing support to individuals with benign symptoms after discharge. Up to 80% of individuals in the vaccine clinicaltrials had local symptoms after vaccination. Large local re-actions with symptoms of pain, itching, burning, or swellingat the site of injection do not preclude an individual fromgetting the vaccine again. Delayed local hypersensitivity re-actions, with onset after Day 8, have been observed specif-ically with Moderna's vaccine. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat fever or myalgias may pre- cipitate urticaria that could be misattributed to the vaccine.Allergists can provide assessments and reassurance andencourage completion of vaccination. SUMMARY To date, allergic reactions to vaccines have been rare and often attributed to various vaccine components. Current reports fromthe CDC suggest that anaphylactic reactions to the P zer-Bio- NTech mRNA vaccine may occur more frequently than seenwith other vaccines. Therefore, to support large-scale COVID-19vaccine rollout programs, allergists can offer clinical phenotyp-ing, risk strati cation, and clear recommendations based on the best available information to date. At this point in time, theetiology of reactions to the P zer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines is not clear. Avoidance of both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to PEG,PEG derivatives or polysorbate is recommended by the CDC.However, understanding the negative and positive predictivevalue of skin testing to PEG and polysorbate may play animportant role in future risk strati cation as many vaccines contain these excipients. Although these challenges requireattention immediately during the current vaccination process, itis of equal importance that we must also design and conductadequately powered studies to investigate the potential mecha-nistic etiology of these reactions. We need to understand thesafety issues surrounding these vaccines, because the success ofthis mRNA vaccine platform is foundational to the flexibility of the COVID-19 response and our response to other viruses withsimilar vaccines in phase I and II trials. We must also remainvigilant to the rare potential for PEG sensitization to occur asindividuals are receiving 2 doses of vaccine with PEG2000 inclose succession and the mechanism for PEG sensitization lead-ing to PEG allergy has not been determined. Alongside guidance from public health and regulatory agencies, our goal was to provide a framework and guidance topracticing Allergists. As the US prepares for massive COVID-19vaccination, allergists must prepare for 2 main population healthchallenges: (1) ensuring that highly allergic individuals feelappropriately informed and supported to receive the COVID-19vaccines and (2) ensuring that patients who suffer from apotentially allergic reaction to the rst dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have a careful evaluation to determine if a true allergicreaction occurred along with the requisite information andsupport needed to decide whether and how to receive the seconddose. Allergists are well versed in applying risk-bene t assess- ments in relative data and evidence free zones by using shareddecision models to achieve safe and effective outcomes. Thepotential life-saving bene t of vaccination in the setting of a global pandemic makes it essential that we carefully evaluateevery patient with a possible allergic reaction to prevent denyingaccess to the vaccine unnecessarily. Our knowledge is rapidlyevolving and future recommendations may change with addi-tional data. Our intent is to provide updates on a regular basis asmore information becomes available.
