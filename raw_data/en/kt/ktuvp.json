It was to the point that I had constant numbness and tingling in my right leg with pain radiating throughout. I was in pain everyday. I tried Acupressure, which did very little. I tried Acupuncture, which did nothing. Massages, six weeks of physical therapy, and two epidurals later, I had no luck. I even tried chiropractic care, which had resulted in increased pain. Eventually, it all led me to getting a discectomy. But, in the end I still had pain. As a young woman I could not understand why I was suffering so much. I was having severe neck pain, headaches, and back pain every day. I was taking ibuprofen, Excedrin and similar products to cover up the pain but nothing helped. My family encouraged me to try chiropractic. I had tried chiropractic 3 or 4 years ago, but I stopped going before I could experience any of the results. Since I was so tired of being in pain I gave Natural Way Chiropractic a shot. They were very friendly, very supportive, and very patient with my frustrated attitude. I had been living with severe neck pain, left leg pain, and right hip pain for 20-30 years, but due to my husband's negative experience with an osteopath many years ago, I was afraid to try chiropractic. The pain continued to get worse, but drugs and surgery were not the answer I wanted. When I met Dr. Covey he explained many things, including how chiropractic is different than osteopathy. This made me more comfortable and willing to try chiropractic. I had a disorder called facet syndrome. For three to four years it was causing extreme low back pain, pain in my upper thigh, and upper arm pain. I tried cortisone injections in my lower back, acupuncture and physical therapy with no results. I even tried methadone to decrease my pain. I finally decided to try chiropractic after trying everything else. After going to another chiropractor and not getting results, I had doubts that chiropractic could help me. Dr. Covey did a thorough examination to see if he could help me. He showed me my problem on the x-rays and told me he was confident he could help. After man years of lower back pain and surgery, I was still experiencing discomfort. I had never gone to a chiropractor but decided to give it a try, even though I didn't believe there would be much change. Now, after just a few weeks there is significantly less pain, better movement and so much hope. If you have never tried this kind of treatment, I would highly recommend Natural Way Chiropractic. The Doctors and staff are amazing! A great chiropractic office!! This was the most friendly and organized chiropractic office I have been in. I have seen many chiropractors in the past 10 yrs and Dr. Sheen and staff were really concerned with my problems. Finally after 5 yrs of back pain and headaches, Dr. Sheen was able to get rid of them... I have now gone 1 yr with out pain, thank you. When I went in to see Dr. Sheen, I had numbness and weakness in my right hand and shoulder. After one week of care my numbness was gone and I had more strength in my hand. In two weeks my hand and arm became normal, also I started to notice that my lower and upper back had no pain. My flexibility was coming back being that I do a lot of lifting at work. The greatest thing is that I used to take two Aleve tablets everyday to get through the day and as of today I do not have to take any. I could feel the bones in my lower back grinding together and had severe pain in my lower spine that was like an electrical shock when I bent over or moved too quickly. It was constant and very debilitating. The only relief I got was when I was asleep.I tried to just keep active and ignore the pain, believing in the long run activity would help. I have seen a couple other chiropractors in the past 10 years and I was completely blown away about Natural Way Chiropractic and staff's ability to help me with any of my concerns...this office is very friendly, affordable and has the best service. If you want a \"old school chiropractor\" with old technology then this is not the place...this office has all the up to date technology to come up with the true diagnoses and no guessing about what is happening with your health like I have experienced with other doctors offices. I have recommended several of my friend's to Natural Way Chiropractic and they all have had great results. Thank you Dr. and Staff at Natural Way. For about three years I was having sharp shooting pain in my neck, upper back, low back and hips. I was also having migraines and insomnia. I was having some serious problems! My M.D. prescribed muscle relaxants for the pain and physical therapy for a short time. The muscle relaxants kept me unable to perform my normal activities while I was on them. I tried chiropractic after being screened at the Seattle Home Show and Dr. Hansen called me and suggested we start treatment. I had tried physical therapy and medications help, but neither helped me recover. So, I gave it a try though I was pretty sure it was quack medicine and would surely hurt me. For the past few years, I had been suffering with ear and headaches. My jaw would pop and click when eating, yawning, and even brushing my teeth.The pain was son and off every day. I would often wake at night in pain. My M.D. had prescribed antibiotics, which were of no relief. I was fitted with a mouth guard by my dentist to protect my teeth from gnashing. Friendly, knowledgeable and experienced! I was very apprehensive for my first appointment but they quickly put my mind at ease, taking the time to answering all my questions and making sure I was comfortable before getting started. The front desk staff are always so sweet and very good about returning calls in a timely manner. Very highly recommend. Dr. Sheen and his staff are the best. They are very friendly. Dr Sheen takes time to explain the process and makes sure you are comfortable during each step of the process, and is willing to take the time to answer any questions you may have. This is great in an era of 5 min Dr. visits. Saved From Surgery! I was told that I needed surgery in both wrists to cure the numbness I was experiencing. I decided to try chiropractic treatment and was drawn to Natural Way Chiropractic of Ferndale. In only took a matter of a month and the numbness was all but gone. In addition I no longer need to take medication for the pain I was experiencing in my neck from the arthritis I have. Dr. Allen saved me from a surgery that I really wasn't looking forward to. In addtion, I see these treatments as an adjunct to the treatment of the stiffness I experience from my Parkinson's. Thank you Dr, Allen and the wonderful staff of Natural Way Chiropractic "}
