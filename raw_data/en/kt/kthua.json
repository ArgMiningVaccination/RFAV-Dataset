And by the time they're 2 months old, they'll be smiling and cooing at you when they're well-rested. They may be holding they're head up for longer stretches during tummy-time. This month, your baby's 1st BIG round of vaccines is due. In their first 2 years, your baby will receive vaccines that protect them against 14 serious diseases.
