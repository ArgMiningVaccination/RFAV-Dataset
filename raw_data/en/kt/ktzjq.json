This party is responsible to all aspects of the product, including quality and compliance with the conditions of marke ting au thorization. The authoris ed holder must be subjected to legislation in the country th at issued the marketing authoris ation, which normally means being physically located in that country (1) Combination vaccine: Vaccine with more than one antigen, combined in a single injection, e.g DPT vaccine combining diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus antigens (2) Licensed i mporter : A person to whom an import license has been issued under Regulation 12, CDCR 1984 ( 3) Licensed wholesaler: A person to whom a wholesaler's license has been issued Regulation 12, CDCR 1984 ( 3) Lot: A defined quantity of starting material, packaging material, or product processed in a single process or series of processes so that it is expected to be homogeneous. It may sometimes be necessary to divide a lot into a number of sub - lots, which are later accumulated to form a final homogeneous lot. In continuous manufacture, the lot must correspond to a defined fraction of the production, characterised by its intended homogeneity. The lot size can be defined either as a fixed quantity or as the amount pro duced in a fixed time interval ( 4) Lot release: The process of NRA/ NCL evaluation of an individual lot of a licensed vaccine before giving approval for its releasing onto the market ( 4) Lot summary protocol: A document summarising all manufacturing step s and test results for a lot of vaccine, certified and signed by the responsible perso n of the manufacturing company ( 4) Monovalent vaccine: A monovalent vaccine contains a single strain of a single antigen, e.g. Measles vaccine (2) Non -compliance: Failure or refusal to comply with a standard or a set of limits ( 4) Guidance Document & Guidelines for Vaccine Lot Release Malaysia Page 9 of 28 NRA/ NCL: The NRA/ NCL taking the responsibility for regulatory oversight of a product for the critical regulatory functions defined by WHO, including independent lot release.

The purpose of the assessment is to verify that prequalified vaccines: (a) meet the specifications of the relevant UN agency; and (b) are produced and overseen in accordance with the principles and specifications recommended by WHO, for good manufacturing practice (GMP), and for good clinical practice (GCP). This is to ensure that v accines used in national immunis ation services in diffe rent countries are safe and effective for the target popula tion at the recommended schedules and that they meet particular operational specifications for packaging and presentation ( 4) Reference country: The reference country for Malaysia is listed as pe r the latest version of Drug Registration Guidance Document by National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (1) Guidance Document & Guidelines for Vaccine Lot Release Malaysia Page 10 of 28 1.0 INTRODUCTION Vaccine is an antigenic substance that is administered into human intended to produce immunity to a disease by stimulating the production of antibodies. It is classified into l ive attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, toxoid vaccines, sub -unit vaccines, polysaccharide vaccines, conjugated vaccines and recombinant vaccines. Production of vaccine is complex, arduous and re quires a mastery of multiple technologies. Therefore, strict quality control and monitor ing at every stage of process are mandatory in order to eliminate or reduce the risk due to production failures. This guidance document is intended to facilitate local stakeholders to understand and meet the requirements for vaccine lot release in Malaysia. 1.1 General Overview of Vaccine Lot R elease Vaccine is a biological product used in healthy populations. It is given i n a mass population , involving healthy babies and young children. Vaccine is complex in nature and more va riable than chemically synthesis ed drug. The challenges in producing consistent lots of vaccines have raised doubts toward safety of vaccines. Different lot of vaccine is developed from inh erently variable biological source and may cause deleterious effects such as reversion to virulence or toxicity or loss of immunogenicity . Since these effects may not be detected immediately after administration, major consequences may arise because vaccin ations involve large number of healthy persons. Moreover, with the increasing number of people having doubts with the safety and success of national immuni sation programme, any problems regarding the safety issues of vaccine would further tarnish the publi c trust on the public health strategies. In addition to the manufacturing complexity, proper storage condition and efficient supply chain management must be ensured to preserve the sensitivity and limited shelf life properties of vaccine. For these reasons, a careful independent review of manufacturing and quality control data on every lot is necessary before it is marketed. This is to ensure the consistent quality of manufactured lots. Each vaccine lot is subject to the lot release progra mme before it is released onto the market . The PRH or importer must submit relevant documents or samples to NRA for independent assessment. Manufacturers must ensure that every new lot of vaccine is identical in its specific characteristics as outlined in the approved marketing authorisation. Guidance Document & Guidelines for Vaccine Lot Release Malaysia Page 11 of 28 Lot release programme will enable NRA to ascertain the safety and effectiveness of every lot of vaccines produced. Upon approval from the NRA , a formal release letter or certificate will be issued to allow release o nto the market. Independent assessment of vaccine can be based on: a) review of manufacturers' summary protocols, which include manufacturing and testing data for each manufactured lot of the product b) recognition/ acceptance of lot release certificate from responsible National Regulatory Authority c) assessment of c old chain system monitoring d) testing that is independent of the manufacturers' quality control testing These approaches are not mutually exclusive and may be product -specific. Where appropriate, strat egy for each particular vaccine shall be established by taking into consideration aspects such as the nature of vaccine, the post - market experience including production history and safety profile . 1.2 Guiding P rinciples Our main intention is to safeguard public health and their well-being . The lot release programme provides an additional monitoring on each new ly manufactured lot of vaccine. The approach employed in this programme is based on the recommendations by World Health Organisation (WHO). 1.3 Scope This guideline is focused on registered imported vaccines for human use. This document is intended to provide guidance to vaccine PRHs , importers and wholesaler s. The content of this guideline will be reviewed and amended accordingly in the future for loc ally produced vaccine. Guidance Document & Guidelines for Vaccine Lot Release Malaysia Page 12 of 28 1.4 Scientific Guidelines Applicable to Vaccines Lot R elease Guidelines for Independent Lot Release of Vaccines by Regulatory Authorities and Technical Report Series (TRS) for all vaccines are available at WHO website : http://www.who.int/ . 1.5 Implementation T imeline: The vaccine lot release was implemented according to a phased timeline established by National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau ( NPCB ). The implementation was conducted in 2 phases as follow : a) Pilot study: Vaccine (either combination or single antigen vaccine) which consists of Bacillus Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) , Diphtheria, (Hep B), Haemophilus Influenzae T ype B (Hib), Polio and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) . - Effective on 1st July 2014 b) Full implementation: Other antigen s (either combination or single antigen vaccine) that are not stated in Phase 1 such as Hepatitis A ( HepA ), Influenza, others . - Effective o n 1st January 2015. Under both phases , monitoring of cold chain system is mandatory before releasing the vaccines onto the market . Guidance Document & Guidelines for Vaccine Lot Release Malaysia Page 13 of 28 2.0 GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION 2.1 General This guideline is largely based on the recommendation outline d in the Guidelines for Independent Lot Release of Vaccines by Regulatory Authorities (4). The lot release approaches for registered imported vaccines in Malaysia include: - a) Review of man ufacturer's summary protocol based on product dossier which has been approved by NPCB during product registration , b) Review of cold chain system monitoring and appropriate data e.g. thermal cycling studies and shipping validation data which have been evaluated . The Process Flow 1 diagram (below) illustrates the process es involved vaccines lot release . The process will involve the follo wing parties : a) Applicant s (PRH) b) National Pharma ceutical Control Bureau (NPCB) c) Importer s and d) Wholesaler s.

Hence, it is recommended that all vaccine products should be stored in their respective recommended condition at all times with continuous monitoring. Failure to show the traceability of temperature monitoring and appropriate storage condition may result in rejection of the entire lot of vaccine. As temperature deviation could happen during transportation or dressing, PRH must submit relevant data and supporting document such as thermal cycling studies and shipping validation to justify temperature excursion for each product. The data must be sufficient to prove that the vaccine products remain stable at those storage c onditions. All data must be submitted and will be evaluated by C CL. If the supporting documents or data provided is not sufficient to show evidence of product stability, the vaccine lot shall be rejected. Please refer to the Guideline s on Good Distribution Practice (GDP) and Supplementary Notes for Management of Cold Chain Products/Material for further details on vaccine temperature monitoring. Guidance Document & Guidelines for Vaccine Lot Release Malaysia Page 19 of 28 2.4 Guidance on Shake Test In the event of an adsorbed vaccine (DPT, DT, TT, Hep B, Hib liquid and/or combination of these) is suspected to be exposed to a freezing temperature, shake test shall be conducted by NPCB officers in NPCB laboratories. It is the responsibilities of the PRH to ensure the vaccine is transported to NPCB laboratories at an advised date by NPCB. Vaccine to be used for shake test shall be taken based on a random sampling from the same lot of the affected vaccine , by NPCB . Vaccine used in the shake test shall not be returned to the PRH. The detail of the Shake Test Protocol is available in Annex 2 of Guidelines on International Packaging and Shipping of Vaccines, WHO/IVB/05.23 December 2005. 2.5 Guidance on Non - Complian t 2.5.1 Non-compliant vaccine In the event of non -complian t vaccine, the PRH shall ensure that the supply of the vaccine for the local use will not be affected.
