When your mind and heart are truly open abundance will flow to you effortlessly and easily. Question: How is it that some spiritual healers are naturally gifted and others have to develop their healing capabilities? Response: All specific healing abilities had to have been developed at some point. They didn't just drop from the sky. Those who display particular healing abilities without seeming to have learned them in this life, presumably would have had to have learned these abilities through some extraordinary process, or in a past life. If the healing ability is not according to any particular technique, but rather a function of a simple desire to heal someone, then their healing ability most likely is a natural consequence of the general purity of their consciousness.
