Spiritual healing can take two forms - that of a sick person being healed through his or her own belief in his or her God or Spiritual guide. The other is where a Spiritual healer is used to assist the sick person. In our modern hi-tech world it is not always fashionable to rely on a Deity which you scientifically cannot quantify or dissect, yet in times of desperation, when all modern medicine has failed with a medical cure, it is always the Spiritual healing route that people turn to - either through their own religious convictions or by using a Spiritual healer. Although modern medicine scoffs at miracles, as it once again cannot be scientifically quantified, they have been happening since the beginning of time and although the skeptics may refer to these miracles as \"spontaneous healing\" we do believe that such \"spontaneous healing\" happens only by divine intervention. People practicing as Spiritual healers come from various religious denominations or simply believe in the Universe, and the Universal healing power. What people should be careful of when seeking out a Spiritual healer is to make sure that they are genuine and sincerely believe in what they do, and are not merely con-men and charlatans seeking to make money out of people's desperation - because these lowly and despicable types of humanity do unfortunately populate this realm of healing and in so doing bring great discredit to those who practice their belief with a pure heart and compassion. Spiritual healing is used in all forms of healing from the most insignificant problems to life-threatening situations. The mechanics of Spiritual healing cannot be explained in medical terms, but could be said to be a time where the patient and God become one, and where the Deity then intervenes and provides the healing. Spiritual healing can take many forms - for the individual it can be quiet contemplation, prayer, acceptance of the Deity's bigger plan in life, an acceptance of love, total forgiveness and understanding that man is but a part of the universe and the greater plan of God, or where a Spiritual healer is involved it could include prayer, incantations, meditation, laying on of hands etc. Faith and prayer are a powerful combination and the results can be miraculous - discounting the charlatans that present themselves in this field - and bring comfort and hope to thousands of people.
