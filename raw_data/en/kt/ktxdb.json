Regardless of the size and complexity of th e court, the financial management system should be able to show the sa me thing\u2014who did what, when th ey did it, and what or how much was involved. This holds true whet her the court is totally manual, totally automated, or somewhere in between. The purpose of this handbook is to help improve financial management in Texas municipal courts. It is based on the premise that when it comes to financial management\u2014what you do not know can hurt you . The unknown and unfamiliar cause the most fear and anxiety. Therefore, the more the judici ary knows about basic financial management\u2014the better off the judiciary and city government will be. The result will be improved financial management in the judiciary\u2014be tter accounting, better internal controls, better cash ma nagement, and better audit results. The approach in this han dbook is to: (1) present an easy-to-understand explanation of what internal controls are and why they ar e important to the municipal courts; and (2) present practical information on a wide range of financial management topics that the courts can use to gauge and improve their financial management operations.

Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 1 Chapter 1 Budgeting Basics 1.1 Introduction Budgeting can be one of the more challe nging areas for a m unicipal court. That is because budgeting has to do with how a court gets funded but the amount funded is determined by the city's governing body. With that in mind, the person(s) responsible for th e municipal court budget need s to do what they can to help ensure adequate funding for the court, taking into consideration the needs of the city as a whole. In some cities the person(s) responsi ble for the municipal court budget can do everything right and it will not make any difference in the governing body's decisions. However, it is more likely, that over time, well thought-out and prepared budget requests will result in better funding for the court. In this chapter we will: \u00be Define what a budget is; \u00be Consider different budget objectives; \u00be Identify some basics to become familiar with; \u00be Explain what a budget calendar is; and \u00be Consider some simple budget suggestions. 1.2 What Is a Budget A budget is many things, including: \u00be A legally required financial document; \u00be The written financial priori ties of the governing body; \u00be A spending plan; \u00be A communications tool; and \u00be A basis for accountability. A. Legally Required Financial Document Texas cities, both general-law and hom e-rule, are required to have a budget (Local Government Code, Chapter 102) . Many people consider the budget a city's most important financial document . It is the basis for city financial management. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 2 B. Written Financial Priorities of the Governing Body When a governing body adopts a budget, they send a message. That message is a loud and clear signal of what the governing body's financial priorities are. There are almost always competing interests when it comes to the budget and rarely is there enough money to do ever ything the governing body would like to do. Nonetheless, the a dopted budget represents their financial priorities. It is easy to complain that the adopted budget is not fair to certain departments or programs. That may or ma y not be true. What is true is that adopting a budget is not only one of the most important res ponsibilities of a governing body; it is one of the most diffi cult. Keeping that in perspective can help department heads \"accept\" the adopted budget and move forward. C. Spending Plan The adopted budget is also a spending pl an. It shows how the city plans to spend the money they are entrusted with, a nd how much they plan to have left at the end of the next year. In that respect , a city budget is similar to an individual or family budget. D. Communications Tool The adopted budget is used to comm unicate to the pub lic the written financial priorities, spending plan, and other financial expectations for the upcoming year. Budget reader s can see in black and whit e what to expect. The budget also normally communicates certain economic, demographi c, statistical, and other information citizens are interested in. E. Basis of Accountability Since the adopted budget is a public document, it becomes a basis of accountability to help dete rmine if the governing body di d, or tried to do, what they said they would. In other words, the adopted budget becomes a tool to help measure the governing body's performance. 1.3 Differing Budget Objectives Different groups have different objectiv es when it comes to the municipal court budget. Understanding those differen ces can help reduce conflict and result in better prepared budget requests. It help s to try to see things through the eyes of someone else. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 3 Consider three groups - municipal court personnel, the governing body, and the public, and how they generally feel about revenues, expenditures, and customer service. Group Revenues Expenditures Customer Service Court Personnel Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Governing Body Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease The Public Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease For court personnel, do you think they want to see revenues increase or decrease? Do you think they want expenditures to in crease or decrease? An increase in expenditures means they want a larger budget for the upcoming year. Do you think they want customer service to increase or decrease? An increase in customer service would mean more (or improved) customer service. Ask yourself the same questions fo r the governing body and the public. Somehow indicate (e.g., circle, underline, or highlight) on the table above what you think. Then look at the results. The author feels that most of the tim e the objectives of the three groups are as shown in bold below. Group Revenues Expenditures Customer Service Court Personnel Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Governing Body Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease The Public Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease That means, in general, that: \u00be Court personnel want revenues to go up, want to see their budget increased, and want to improve customer service in the court; \u00be The governing body would like to see revenues go up, expenditures go down, and customer service go up; and \u00be The public would also like to see revenues go up, expenditures go down, and customer service go up. The only area with tension is the area of expenditures. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 4 Group Revenues Expenditures Customer Service Court Personnel Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Governing Body Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease The Public Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Court personnel generally want their budget increased, while the governing body and the public do not. From the pers pectives of the governing body and the public, increased revenues and decreased expenditures means less revenue that has to be raised from other sources and/or more money that can be expended on other programs. This should indicate that the munici pal court is more likely to get an increase in their budget if they can find a way to: (1) increase revenues; and/or (2) improve customer service to the benefit of the governing body. For instance, revenues might be increased as a result of enhancing collection activities (e.g., more prompt follow-up on delinquenc ies, instituting an annual warrant roundup, and/or accepting additional methods of payment). Customer service might be improved by reducing the amount of time defendants have to wait in line to pay. That might be the result of st aggering the office workload to allow one additional person to help with defenda nts during the busiest hour each day. 1.4 Basics to Become Familiar With Everyone involved in the municipal court budget proce ss should become familiar with: \u00be The budget law for cities; and \u00be Their home-rule charter budget pr ovisions (if applicable). A. Budget Law for Cities The budget law for cities is found in Local Government Code, Chapter 102. The provisions are: Local Government Code, S ection 102.001. Budget Officer (a) The mayor of a municipality serves as the budget officer for the governing body of the municipality except as provided by Subsection (b). (b) If the municipality has the city ma nager form of government, the city manager serves as the budget officer. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 5 Local Government Code, Secti on 102.002. Annual Budget Required The budget officer shall prepare each year a municipal budget to cover the proposed expenditures of the municipal government for the succeeding year. Local Government Code, Section 102 .003. Itemized Budget; Contents (a) The budget officer shall itemize the budget to allow as clear a comparison as practic able between expenditures included in the proposed budget and actual expenditures for the same or similar purposes made for the preceding year. The budget must show as definitely as possible ea ch of the projects for which expenditures are set up in the budget and the estimated amount of money carried in the budget for each project. (b) The budget must contain a comple te financial statement of the municipality that shows: (1) the outstanding obligations of the municipality; (2) the cash on hand to th e credit of each fund; (3) the funds received from all sources during the preceding year; (4) the funds available from a ll sources during the ensuing year; (5) the estimated revenue availa ble to cover the proposed budget; and (6) the estimated tax rate required to cover the proposed budget. Local Government Code, Section 102.004. Information Furnished by Municipal Officers and Boards In preparing the budget, the budget officer may require any municipal officer or board to furnish information necessary for the budget officer to properly prepare the budget. Local Government Code, Section 1 02.005. Proposed Budget Filed With Municipal Clerk; Public Inspection (a) The budget officer shall file the proposed budget with the municipal clerk before the 30th day before the date the governing body of the municipality makes its tax levy for the fiscal year. (b) The proposed budget shall be availa ble for inspection by any taxpayer. Local Government Code, Section 102.006. Public Hearing on Proposed Budget (a) The governing body of a municipal ity shall hold a public hearing on the proposed budget. Any taxpayer of the municipality may attend and may participate in the hearing. (b) The governing body shall set the he aring for a date occurring after the 15th day after the date the proposed budget is filed with the municipal clerk but before the date the go verning body makes its tax levy. (c) The governing body shall provide fo r public notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 6 Local Government Code, Section 102.0065. Special Notice by Publication for Budget Hearing (a) The governing body of a municipal ity shall publish notice before a public hearing relating to a budget in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the municipality is located. (b) Notice published under this section is in addition to notice required by other law, except that if another law requires the governing body to give notice, by publication, of a he aring on a budget this section does not apply. (c) Notice under this section shall be published not earlier than the 30 th or later than the 10th day before the date of the hearing. Local Government Code, Secti on 102.007. Adoption of Budget (a) At the conclusion of the public hearing, the governing body of the municipality shall take acti on on the proposed budget. (b) The governing body may make any changes in the budget that it considers warranted by the law or by the best interest of the municipal taxpayers. Local Government Code, Section 1 02.008. Approved Budget Filed With Municipal Clerk On final approval of the budget by th e governing body of the municipality, the governing body shall file the bud get with the municipal clerk. Local Government Code, Section 102.009. Levy of Taxes and Expenditure of Funds Under Budget; Emergency Expenditures (a) The governing body of the municipality may levy taxes only in accordance with the budget. (b) After final approval of the budget, the governing body may spend municipal funds only in strict compliance with the budget, except in an emergency. (c) The governing body may authorize an emergency expenditure as an amendment to the original budget only in a case of grave public necessity to meet an unusual and un foreseen condition that could not have been included in the or iginal budget through the use of reasonably diligent thought and attention. If the governing body amends the original budget to m eet an emergency, the governing body shall file a copy of its order or resolution amending the budget with the municipal clerk, and the clerk sha ll attach the copy to the original budget. (d) After the adoption of the budget or a budget amendment, the budget officer shall provide for the filing of a true copy of the approved budget or amendment in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the municipality is located. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 7 Local Government Code, Section 102.010. Changes in Budget for Municipal Purposes This chapter does not prevent the governing body of the municipality from making changes in the budget for municipal purposes. Local Government Code, Section 102.011. Circumstances Under Which Charter Provisions Control If a municipality has already adopted c harter provisions that require the preparation of an annual budget covering all municipal expenditures and if the municipality conducts a public he aring on the budget as provided by Section 102.006, the charter provisions c ontrol. After th e budget has been finally prepared and approved, a copy of the budget and the amendments to the budget shall be filed w ith the county clerk, as required for other budgets under this chapter. Highlights from the budget law for muni cipal court personnel include the following: \u00be A budget is required; \u00be Expenditures are to be comparable from year to year; \u00be The budget must contain a financial statement; \u00be Municipal officers are re quired to furnish requested information to the budget officer; and \u00be Except in an emergency, municipal f unds are to be spent in strict compliance with the budget. B. Home-rule Charter Budget Provisions Home-rule cities can specify unique budget provisions in their charter. Municipal court personnel involved in the budget process should become familiar with any specific charter budget provisions for their city. Typical charter budget provisions and some specific examples follo w. Please note that the examples (in italics) are from several different cities and the due dates in the examples will vary. \u00be Who is responsible for pr eparing the proposed budget, when it is due, and when it must be adopted. The city manager shall prepare and submit the annual budget on the basis of the estimates of the departments. The city manager shall prepare an annual budget to accomplish the goals and objectives established by the city council and submit it to the city council for approval.

The department heads of the city shall prepare annual departmental budget requests for the ensuing fiscal year as directed by the city manager and submit said requests to him for his review. The budget shall be prepared by the city manager on the basis of the estimates of departments.

A proposed complete draft of the a ppropriation ordinance, the tax levying ordinance, and any other ordinances required to effectuate the budget. Such other information as may be required by the City Council. 1.5 Budget Calendar A. Budget Calendar Defined A budget calendar is a listing of all budge t actions, the dates they should be completed, and who is responsible for doing them. It is important that everyone involved in the budgeting process know who is responsible for what. B. Benefits of a Budget Calendar A budget calendar helps keep actions from being overlooked, provides needed accountability, allows for more adequate time to complete actions, and allows more time for gathering needed data. Without a budget calendar, the budget preparation process is of ten rushed, and the results often reflect that rushed process. C. Sample Budget Calendars Most cities have a budget calendar for th e city as a whole. In addition, the municipal court should cons ider having one just for th e court. Of course, the Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 11 municipal court budget calenda r dates and timeframes shoul d fall within the dates and timeframes of the budget calend ar for the city as a whole. If you have never developed a budget ca lendar for the municipal court, have everyone involved in the pro cess list everything they do, when they do it, and how much time it takes. Then put the actions in chronological or der of when they must be done. Select due dates for the individual actions, working backwards and allowing some \"cushion\" time for the unexpe cted. Keep up with the actual dates for completing the individual ac tions and adjust and refine the calendar from year to year as needed. Budget calendars vary from city to city. Following are example budget calendars from two Texas cities. The sec ond calendar is more detailed than the first. Both calendars are based on an October 1 st fiscal year.

Budget Year-round Working on the budget year-round allows th e work to be spread out (to the extent possible). Budget preparation normally comes at a busy time of the year - the end of spring and summer. School activ ities, extracurricular activities (e.g., sports), and vacations take up a larger pe rcentage of time than during other parts of the year. Reducing the amount of budge t work that has to be done in a compressed time frame should improve the end product. Spreading the work out may result in being able to devote more time to some aspects of the budget preparation pr ocess than would otherwise be the case (e.g., gathering data to supports requests). Working on the budget year-round should also help provide a broader perspective for what budget priorities ar e. Those priorities might change throughout the year. For example, budget preparation time may come during the busiest three months of the year for walk-in traffic. The number one budget priority at that time might be to add another person to help handle the traffic faster. However, during th e other nine months the number one priority might be upgrading the telephone system, moving closer to a paperless o ffice, or improving security. Working on the budget year-round should make it less likely to make adding staff as the number one priority. Year-round budgeting can also help with staying current on other work. Having some of the work already done or partially done may mean not having to drop everything \"so to speak\" just to work on the budget. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 18 Finally, year-round budgeting can help ma ke better use of any \"down\" time. In other words, those times that are not quite as busy might be a good time to get some of the budget work done. B. Have an Inclusive Budget Process Within reason, try to get as many c ourt staff as possibl e involved in the budget preparation process. If there is ju st one, two, or three people in the court, it should not be too difficult to get everyone involved in at least some aspect of the process. Of course, the larger the cour t, the harder it is to do. However, even if the court is large and divided into several sections, at a minimum, the supervisors of those sections could be i nvolved in the process, at least to some extent. There are several potentia l benefits to an inclusive budget process. The people who do the specific tasks genera lly know their work better than anyone else and can give good insi ght into trends that are starting to show up, what impact(s) certain changes might have, and how best to solve problems. Employees are more likely to meet certa in goals or targets if they had some input in setting those goals or targets. Al so, if someone leaves or is promoted, it helps to have someone else at least partially familiar with budget activities. Finally, keeping employees \"out of th e loop\" more than is necessary can foster a \"me\" versus \"them\" attitude, al ong with the things that go with it (e.g., complaining and absenteeism), which impact job performance. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 19 Chapter 2 Revenues 2.1 Utilization Table Some of the revenues received by a m unicipal court are restricted in how they can be used. Other revenues have no restrictions and can be used for any legal city purpose, as appropriated by the governing body. The table below shows municipal court revenues that have rest rictions and those that do not. The information in this table is primarily fo r budget purposes. Detailed court cost and fee information is in Chapters 9 - 13. In addition, the local share for many of the state court costs and fees is contingent upon timely reporting and remitting.

Information that can be included is: \u00be history; Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 25 Below is a sample format. Adjust it to meet your needs. Name: ___________________________________________________________________ Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 26 For example, the Revenue Catalogue page for the municipal court building security fee might look so mething like the following: Name: Municipal Court Technology (MCT) Fee Fund / Account Number: xx-xxx-xxxx Authority: Code of Criminal Pro cedure, Article 102.0172 Authorized by Senate Bill 601, 76th Legislature, effective September 1, 1999 Municipal ordinance number xx-xxxx, dated September 1, 1999. Description: Not to exceed $4.00 court cost Expanded convicti on definition applies No exception for parking and pedestrian offenses Started October 1, 1999 Amount: $4.00 per conviction Revenue History: 2007 $12,340 2006 11,080 2004 10,765 2003 10,450 2002 10,000 Comments: September 1, 2003: State law - \"maintenance\" added as a qualified use September 1, 2003: Local ordinance adjusted to add \"maintenance\" as a qualified use September 1, 2003: State law - sunset provision (9-1-05) repealed September 1, 2003: Local ordina nce adjusted to authorize continued collection 2.3 Revenue Estimate Summary The Revenue Estimate Summary helps keep track of a ll municipal court- related city revenues and projections in one place. Municipal court-related city revenues are those amounts retained by the c ity. In other words, amounts that are not remitted elsewhere (e.g., the state or another local government). The Summary shows actual revenues, not just the amount received. For example, if the Consolidat ed Court Cost (Fee) genera ted $40,000 in receipts, only $4,000 would be revenue, since th e city only gets to retain 10 percent as a service fee and 90 percent is sent to the state. Similarl y, if $20,000 is received in Time Payment Fees, only $10,000 would be revenue, because 50 percent is sent to the Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 27 state. By focusing on the revenue amount rather than the amount received, it is less likely that someone will think the municipal court is generating more revenues than it actually is. On the following page is a sample format. Adjust it to meet the needs of your court and city. Try to maintain enough detail to allow for sound revenue projections. For example, if the Legisl ature was to increase the Consolidated Court Cost (Fee) from $40 to $50, the po ssible impact on municipal court-related city revenues could be determined. Th e city would receive a maximum additional amount of $1 per conviction [($50 - $40) x 10% service fee]. Of course, the $1 amount would need to be adjusted to take into consideration the estimated collection rate. The sample format has six columns: \u00be Column 1: Description - gives the name of the court cost, fee, or fine (e.g., Time Payment Fee); \u00be Column 2: Revenue Percen tage - gives the percenta ge of the total amount received that is municipal court-related city revenue; \u00be Column 3: Actual Previous Year - gives the actual revenue amount for the previous city fiscal year; \u00be Column 4: Budgeted Current Year - gives the amount of revenue budgeted for the current city fiscal year; \u00be Column 5: Projected Current Year - gives the amount of revenue projected for the current city fiscal year; and \u00be Column 6: Estimated Next Year - gives the projected amount of revenue for the next fiscal year. An additional column could be added to indicate the fund that receives the revenue. The court costs, fees, fines, bond forfeitures, and other revenue could then be grouped by fund.

Most budget officers make their estimates after getting input from applicable department heads (e.g., the municipal cour t administrator for the municipal court- related city revenue). There should be someone in the c ourt (court administrator or other individual) more knowledgeable about es timating municipal court-related city revenues than anyone else in the cit y. If the budget officer and governing body can learn to rely on the court in this area, they will be more likely to rely on the court in other areas (e.g., departmental budget needs). The individual in the court responsib le for estimating the revenues should be familiar with the factors that can impact revenues (e.g., population changes, local economic outlook, and enhanced collection efforts). Estimates should be realistic and cons ervative. The author would rather underestimate revenues by an amount than overestimate revenues by the same amount. The reason is that the amount of estimated revenues for a city determines to a large extent the expenditure side of the budget for a city. As a result, estimates that are not met could re sult in budget cuts. And if revenues are more than anticipated, budget amendments can always be made. A total of municipal court-related city revenue should be estimated per fund. In other words, a total for the Municipa l Court Building Secur ity Fund, a total for the Municipal Court Technology Fund, a to tal for the General Fund, and a total for any other fund(s) that receive m unicipal court-related city revenues. For example, the Municipal Court Bu ilding Security Fund may have just one revenue source - the municipal cour t building security fee. The revenue estimate for the Fund would be based on just that one fee. However, the General Fund will normally have numerous revenue sources, including: \u00be Service fees for state court costs; \u00be Fees for requesting a driving safety course; \u00be Deferred disposition special expenses; \u00be Fees for services of peace officers; \u00be Dismissal fees; \u00be City \u00be Municipal ordinance vi olation fines; and \u00be Fines for state law offenses (other than Transportation Code offenses). Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 30 Some cities estimate each individual re venue source and then come up with a total amount of municipal court-relate d city revenue per fund. For example, estimating revenue for the General Fund would require estimating revenue for each of the categories above and then a dding the amounts to come up with a total for the Fund. Other cities might start with the tota l amount of General Fund revenue for the previous year, or the total amount of revenue projected for the current year, and make adjustments to come up with th e estimate for the upcoming year. For example, a city may just assume a certain percentage increase in municipal court revenues over the current year. The first approach, estimating each individual revenue source, and adding the amounts, is generally more accurate, but also more time consuming. To understand how this approach could be more accurate consider the amount of revenue that would be overlooked if th e Legislature passed a new $10 local court cost for municipal court operations. The first approach would include the estimated revenue from the new local cour t cost. The second approach probably would not. However, the added accuracy of the first approach may not be worth the time involved. The second appro ach is probably used the most. Some cities use a combination of the two approaches. Those cities use the second approach and then make adjustme nts for any specific major changes (e.g., a new local court cost or a new required minimum fine for an offense higher than the average fine previously charged for that offense). Other cities use case filing data to proj ect revenues. A city might estimate a certain amount of revenue per case filed. For example, a city that estimates 10,000 case filings with average city re venue per case of $50 would project municipal court city-related revenue for the year of $500,000. The projection could even based upon different estimate d revenue amounts per case depending upon the type of case (e.g., state law traffi c offenses, other state law offenses, municipal ordinance parking violati ons, and other municipal ordinance violations). There are various revenue estimating t echniques, ranging in difficulty from simple to complex. One relatively easy method is Simple Trend Analysis. This method can be used for each individual revenue source or for the total for a particular fund. The method uses historical data as the basis for projecting future revenues. A minimum of five years of da ta is often used. The average change over a period of time is computed and used as a basis for projection. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 31 Example 1 \u00be The City of Moderate Growth uses Simple Trend Analysis to estimate municipal court-related revenue for the General Fund. \u00be The City believes revenue growth for fiscal 2007 will be similar to the growth of the last several years. Fiscal General Fund Percentage Year Revenue Change 2003 362,000 NA 2004 380,000 + 4.97 2005 394,000 + 3.68 2006 405,000 + 2.79 2007 426,000 + 5.19 Total + 16.63 Divide by Number of Years \u00f7 4 Average Change per Year + 4.1575 Fiscal 2007 Projected Revenue $426,000 Multiply by Average Change per Year .041575 Fiscal 2007 Estimated Revenue Increase 17,711 Add Fiscal 2007 Projected Revenue 426,000 Fiscal 2007 Estimated Revenue $443,711 Note : General Fund Revenue for fiscal 2003 - 2006 are actual revenue amounts. General Fund Revenue for fiscal 2007 is projected because budget estimates are usually made before the end of the current year. Example 2 \u00be In addition to the information in Example 1 above, assume there will be a new legislatively mandated local court cost of $5. \u00be The City estimates the revenue from the new court cost and adds that amount to the estimate from Example 1.

Estimate from Example 1 $443,711 Divide by Historical Collection Rate .65 Estimated Amount Assessed 682,632 Multiply by Revised Collection Rate .72 Fiscal 2007 Estimated Revenue $491,495 Once revenue projections are made for a year, do not forget about them. After the year ends, go back and see how accurate the projections were. If the projections (or some of the projections) ar e not very close to the actual amounts, try to figure out why. Doing so can help you become more accurate with future projections. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 33 Chapter 3 Departmental Budget Request 3.1 Introduction Most cities have some sort of depart mental budget request process. In some cities the process is very formal. In ot her cities, the process is more informal. Hopefully, whatever process is utilized puts departments on a level playing field with the budget officer and governing body. Having the different departments use the same forms and follow the same instructions should also make the work of the budget officer and governing body somewhat easier because of the comparability of the requests. Department heads should receive specific budget request forms with detailed instructions about how to comple te the forms. Many cities also include a statement of budget policy with the forms and instructions. A statement of budget policy generally provides most of the following: \u00be General economic outlook; \u00be Demographic information; \u00be Property valuation and information rela ting to other major revenue sources; \u00be Budget goals and priorities; \u00be A statement about the possibility of additional personnel; \u00be A statement about the possibility of an across the board pay raise; and \u00be General guidelines to follow in preparing the request. Departmental request forms vary greatly from city to city. They generally require most of the following: \u00be A description of the department's Expenditure information by budget line-item: - Actual for the previous year; - Budgeted for the current year; - Projected for the current year; and - Requested for the next year; and \u00be Additional detailed information for: - Additional personnel requests; and - Capital outlay requests. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 34 In most cities, the budget officer and/or the governing body hold departmental budget hearings to allow the department heads to present their requests. 3.2 Samples and Examples Four general forms are presented. Your particular city may use more or less forms, depending upon what is required and how it is to be presented. For example, the information to be provided on the first form below could be required on separate forms. The four forms are: \u00be General Department Information Form; \u00be Expenditure Request Form; \u00be Additional Personnel Request Form; and \u00be Capital Outlay Request Form. A. General Department Information Form The information to be provided on this form should include: \u00be A description of the department's functions and responsibilities; \u00be Measurement indicators; \u00be A listing, and where needed, descrip tion of the department's recent accomplishments; and \u00be A listing, and where needed, an e xplanation of upcoming goals. A sample format is shown on Page 35 and an example begins on Page 36. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 35 GENERAL DEPARTMENT INFORMATION FORM C i t y Department Fiscal Year Functions and Responsibilities INFORMATION FORM C i t y Municipal Court Fiscal Year 2007 Functions and Responsibilities : The municipal court is the first level of the judicial branch of government. The jurisdiction of the Municipal Court includes Class C misdemeanors occurring within the territorial limit of the City. Charges processed by the Municipal Court may be filed by county peace officers, st ate peace officers, citizens, and a variety of city employees, including but not limit ed to police, fire, code enforcement and animal control officers. The Municipal Judge also serves as a magistrate of the State and has the authority to issue search warrants, emergency protective orders and arrest warrants. The mission of the Mu nicipal Court is pre-determined by the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure a nd the Code of Judicial Conduct which provide that the Court and all s upport personnel shall provide equal and impartial justice under the law and process ea ch case efficiently without delay or unnecessary expense. In add ition, it is the mission of the Court to provide a friendly environment responding to the need s of all persons who come in contact with the Court.

The collection activities s hould increase city revenues approximately $140,000 next fiscal year. This is based on a conservative 10 percent increase in our collection rate. Similar cities starting a collections progra m have experienced collection rate increases in the 15 - 20 percent range. Pl ease note that the collection activities should result in additional state revenues of approximately $6 0,000 during the same period. Other Budget Impact (Required for Each Position Requested): Budgetary impact is included in the appropriate line-items (e.g., personal services, supplies and materials, other services and charges, and capital outlay). As required, capital outlay items are listed separately on the Capital Outlay Request Form. D. Capital Outlay Request Form This form is used to request capital items that have a value of at least a certain amount (as determined by city policy). A sample format is shown on Page 42 and an example is shown on Page 43. Ca pital outlays are reco rded as an asset on the city's books and are generally placed on an inventory list showing the department (e.g., municipal court) responsible for the asset.

A. If the city has not adopted all of the local option court costs and fees, suggest they do so. Adopting the local option c ourt costs and fees raises revenue and does so in a way that is taxpayer-friendly. Since the court costs and fees are paid by defendants, the amount collected is revenue that does not have to come from other sources (e.g., propert y or sales taxes). Local option court costs and fees include the: \u00be Special expense warrant fee (Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 45.203); \u00be Municipal court building security fee (C ode of Criminal Procedure, Article 102.017); \u00be Municipal court technology fee (Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 102.0172); and \u00be Juvenile case manager court cost (C ode of Criminal Procedure, Article 102.0174. B. Try to get one member of the governing body as an advocate for the municipal court. Sometimes it only takes the strong suppor t of one member of the governing body to get the municipal court budget request funded. This is not being sneaky or underhanded. It is the author's experien ce that many council members are not familiar with municipal court operations. They are more likely to be familiar with utilities or street repairs. When they do become familiar with how the municipal court operates, they generally have a mu ch higher appreciation for the court, and everything else being equal, are more lik ely to support the court's budget request. Do not wait until budget time to try to de velop a relationship. Start early in the year. Invite them to the court, show them around, explain what you do, and answer their questions. This may take some time, but it should be worth the effort. C. Be prepared for the municipal court departmental budget hearing. Know what you are requesting and why, and be able to support your request. If possible, attend the departmental budget hearing for one or more other departments. This will he lp give you a feel for wh at works and what does not Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 45 work. However, keep in mind the di fficult job the governing body has and maintain a professional demeanor throughout the entire process. D. Where possible, give priority to expenditures that increase revenues or reduce future expenditures. Some expenditures can result in additi onal revenues that exceed the amount of the expenditures. For example, a dding an additional person(s) to focus on collection activities. Other expenditures can reduce future expenditures. For example, technologies that reduce the amount of staff time can result in fewer personnel needed sometime down the road. E. Budget at more than one level of funding. Most municipal courts will not be requested to do this as part of their departmental budget request. Even if that is the case, it help s to be prepared should budget cuts have to be made or a dditional funding becomes available. If possible, have a plan, or the outline of a plan in place. Pre-planning helps prevent \"spur of the moment\" decisions that ar e often regretted later. Additionally, budget officers and governing bodies appreciat e those departments that stay ahead of the curve and help make their jobs easier. F. When needed, consider suggesting rotation with other departments for certain types of expenditures. In some cities, certain ty pes of budget requests are not likely to get funded at all because it is too expensive to do so fo r all applicable city departments in the same fiscal year. Examples include furn iture and certain types of technology. As a result, departments often end up going fo r longer periods of time without needed replacements/upgrades because it is easier not to provide funding for any of the departments than it is to provide funding for just one or a few of the departments. In this situation, a rota tion schedule can help. For example, rather than not get any new furniture for a long period of time, a rotation of a certain number of years might mean that every department gets needed replacements/upgrades more frequently. The department that gets f unded the first year, se cond year, and so on, can even be determined by \"picking st raws\" when an acceptable schedule cannot be determined based on need. Fr om the standpoint of the governing body, budgeting regular smaller amounts is often easier than peri odically budgeting a much larger amount. G. Know the average number of cases ea ch year disposed of per municipal court full-time equivalent. This is a good benchmark number and can be used to compare with other (similar) municipal courts. Hopefully, this number is increasing over time as the Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 46 court becomes more efficient and new t echnologies are employed. Knowing what this number is should give you some idea of when it will be necessary to add staff. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 47 Chapter 4 Cost Information 4.1 Introduction Sometimes a court wants more detailed cost information than is provided in the city's budget or financia l statements. For example, a court may want to know the: \u00be Cost of operating the municipal court as a whole; \u00be Cost of operating each of the diffe rent sections in the court; or \u00be Average cost of each case disposed. \"Cost\" information for a municipal c ourt is almost always different than what is shown in the budget or financia l statements. That is because accounting principles followed by cities are not based on \"cost\" information. Cost information can be used to: \u00be Help determine the real financia l bottom line of court operations; The court may be contributing more or less to the city's financial picture than previously thought. \u00be Prepare better budget requests; This is especially true for projec ts that cover multiple budget years. \u00be Help determine if an optional fee should be charged; and For example, charging the technology fee to pay for the co urt's technology needs. \u00be Benchmark with other courts. For example, using more accurate num bers when comparing the cost per case disposed with the same number from other courts. The topics for this chapter are; \u00be Definitions and descriptions; and \u00be Converting expenditures to costs. Utilizing cost information is not something every court should do. In many courts, it is just not needed. In some c ourts, there may not be adequate records or enough time to obtain and utilize the info rmation. Utilizing cost information should only be done by those courts that de termine it will be beneficial to them and when the information can be determined or obtained in a practical way and timeframe. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 48 4.2 Definitions and Descriptions A. Cost Cost is the cash value of the labor, supplies, equipment, and other resources used to accomplish a purpose or carry on an activity.3 It does not make any difference when the labor, supplies, equipment, and other resources are acquired or paid for. For the purposes of this manual, cost is the cash value of the labor, supplies, equipment, and other resources used to operate a municipa l court or a section of a municipal court, regardless of when paid for or acquired. For example, the cost of a municipal court for fiscal year 2007 would be the cost of all the resources used during fi scal 2007, including those paid for before fiscal year 2007 and those pa id for after fiscal 2007. To better understand what cost is, think about taking a vacation in the month of May to the Northwest. The cost of th e trip would include all of the following: \u00be Cash spent on the trip; \u00be Credit card charges made on the trip regardless of when paid; \u00be Items purchased before the trip just fo r the trip (e.g., clothes, travel books); \u00be Film developed and prints done in Ju ne for pictures taken on the trip; \u00be Pet care expenses while gone paid for in June; and \u00be Wear and tear on the car. You can probably think of other costs th at could be included. The idea is to make sure that the cash value of all the vacation resources are included regardless of when they are acquired or paid for. Since the focus is on resources \"used\" certain items have to be depreciated over the period they are expected to be used. For example, if a computer was purchased in January of 2006 for $1,500 and is expected to last three years, the cost each year would be $500 using the simplest method of depreciation (i.e., straight line depreciation). Recognize that governments do not keep up with costs (use cost accounting) very often because there is not a profit motive in government like there is in business. As a result, some cost figures may have to be computed or estimated. 3 Analyzing Costs in the Courts , U.S. Department of Justice, Na tional Institute of Justice, 1987 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 49 B. Cost Objective Most municipal courts that use cost information use the information to determine the total cost of the court or the average cost per case filed or disposed. For larger courts, where the court is divi ded into operational s ections or divisions (e.g., administration, operations, security, and collections), cost information can be used to more accurately reflect the co st of each section or division. Each section or division would be considered a cost center. C. Direct and Indirect Costs Costs can be classified as direct or i ndirect. Direct costs can be assigned to a single objective or cost center. Indir ect costs are assigned to multiple objectives or cost centers. Additionally, a cost can be direct or indirect depending upon the circumstances. For example, consider salaries of municipal court personnel who work wholly for the court. If the cost objectiv e is the total cost of the municipal court, the salaries would be direct costs. However, if the cost objective is to determine the cost of the different sections within the court, the salaries for those who perform tasks for more than one section would be indirect costs. Indirect costs have to be allocated. If specific records ar e available showing how much to allocate to the different co st centers, the allo cation is easy and accurate. For example, if employee A spe nds 75 percent of her time working in Operations and 25 percent working in Co llections, 75 percent of her salary and benefits would be allocated to Operations and 25 percent of her salary and benefits would be allocated to Collections. If specific detailed records are not available showing how much to allocate to the various cost centers, a way to allo cate the costs as accu rately as possible without spending an unnecessary amount of time to do the allocation should be found. For example, assume the police department and municipal court are located in the same building that is rented for $2,000 a month. The allocation could be made based on squa re feet. If 40 percent of the space is used by the court, then 40 percent of the rent, or $800 ($2,000 x 40%) could be allocated to the municipal court. D. Important Reminder It is important to keep in mind that cost information is just that - cost information. Cost information does not indicate how good a job the court is doing judicially. In other words, cost in formation deals with efficiency, not effectiveness. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 50 4.3 Converting Expenditures to Costs Converting expenditures to costs may re quire some effort. The information to make the conversion will be easier to ac cess in some cities than in others. A court will normally need to contact th e department responsible for the city's accounting function for the detailed info rmation needed, and in many cases, to help with the conversion. Possibly the easiest way to understand converting expenditures to costs is to look at an example. Example The finance director for the city shows municipal court expenditures for the year ended September 30, 2007 to be $420,000. The following additional information is available: 1. Expenditures for supplies included $2,000 for supplies not used in fiscal 2007. 2. Expenditures included $12,000 for a thre e-year insurance policy covering fiscal 2007 - 2009. 3. Expenditures excluded lease payments of $1,500 made in fiscal 2005 that benefit fiscal 2007. 4. Capital outlays made in fiscal 2007 for computers, new workstations, and telecommunication e quipment totaled $80,000. 5. Depreciation expense fo r the year totaled $25,000. 6. The municipal court's share of city administrative expenditures totaled $7,000. Fiscal year 2007 munici pal court expenditures $420,000 Subtract: Expenditures for supplies not used in fiscal 2007 - 2,000 Expenditures for insurance policy for fiscal 2008 - 2009 - 8,000 Capital outlays made in fiscal 2007 - 80,000 Add: Expenditures for lease payments made in fiscal 2006 that benefit fiscal 2007 + 1,500 Depreciation expense for fiscal 2007 + 25,000 Municipal court's share of city administrative expenditures + 7,000 Estimated cost of municipa l court for fiscal 2007 $363,500 A more comprehensive format for ma king the conversion is shown on Page 52. Adjust the line items to reflect those used in your particular court and city. Not all line items will need to be adjuste d. However, realize that each line item that is adjusted may be the result of numerous individual adjustments. For Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 51 example, consider the \"rentals and leas es\" line item. The expenditure amount for that line item could reflect payments fo r several pieces of equipment that differ from the cash value used during the fiscal year.

However, if it appears that $500 is missing from the municipal court, it generally will get media coverage\u2014and often, significant coverage. The public expects and deserves sound financial management from city officials and employees. City officials and employees deserve to work in an environment that protects them if they do their jobs correctly. Chances for errors and other irregularities should be minimal. All too often, it is not a situation where money is actually missing that caus es a problem, but rather a situation where someone thinks money may be missing and the financial management system in the court cannot show otherwise. When it comes to money and other property, a municipal court should be able to show four things: \u00be They have collected all the money or other property to which they are entitled; \u00be The money collected is properly re mitted to the appropriate party; \u00be All money and other property is properly managed; and \u00be All money and other property is prop erly expended, properly accounted for, and properly reported. Many municipal courts do not have ade quate staff and resources to operate according to textbook guidelines. However, each court should have a goal to do the best they can with the resources they have. In fact, some extra precautions should be taken in those situations where there is a lack of adequate staff and other resources because the chances for problems are higher. In this chapter, internal control w ill be defined and described and the basic components of internal control will be presented and explained. More detailed and specific controls relating to specific subject areas will be covered in subsequent chapters. A deta iled internal control checkli st is included in Appendix C. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 54 5.2 Internal Control Defined and Described Although more technical definitions exist, a practical definition of internal control (as used in this manual) is: Internal Control : the plans and procedures implemented in a municipal court designed to provide reasonable assurance of: (1) reliable financial information; (2) compliance with app licable laws and regulations; and (3) effective and efficient operations. One easy way to think of internal contro l is as a set of financial management checks and balances. Internal control is a major part of managing a municipal court. A sound system of internal control should: \u00be Minimize the possibilities for e rrors and misuse of funds; \u00be Provide a clear audit trail (show who did what and when they did it); and \u00be Provide for earlier detection of errors and/or irregularities than would otherwise be the case. Good controls make the work of both the internal audi tor and external auditor easier and less time-consuming. However, keep in mind that good internal control provides \"reasonable\" (s ee the definition above), not \"absolute\" assurance that operations are as they should be. Internal control systems have inherent limitations. For example, the collusion of two or more people could circumvent the controls or management could override the system. Internal control used to be primarily something that only auditors and accountants talked about. But the frequency of publicized wrongdoing in governmental financial management has increased the need for awareness and understanding of internal contro l at all levels of government . In addition to actual monetary losses that can result from poor controls, pe rhaps the biggest loss is the decline in the public's perception of and confidence in government. The importance of internal control re lates to both money and people. The people component, which in the long run can prove more important than the money \"side,\" is often overlooked. An inte rnal control system should protect the people who do their jobs right. The vast majority of people who are not involved in errors and/or irregularities deserve to work in an office that can show their innocence when errors and/or irregularities do occur. Th ey do not deserve to be clouded with unnecessary suspicion. Most internal controls are not complic ated. They are, however, frequently overlooked because officials and employees tend to focus on what they consider to be the primary function(s) of their offi ce. For example, a municipal court clerk Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 55 generally thinks in terms of case-related duties, rather than financial management duties and internal control. When it comes to financial manageme nt, an individual should not want someone to just trust him/her. Rather, he /she should want a set of procedures that are followed, and that will show he/she did the right thing should a question ever arise concerning city or state money. One thing that makes sound financial management so important is the realiz ation that something only has to go wrong once and it can plague someone for a long time. One quick way to determine if there may be some internal control weaknesses in the court is for everyone to take a \"Blank Paper Test.\" Simply have each person in the court write down the things that could cause him/her to be accused or unnecessarily suspected of wr ongdoing, even if he/she did things right. For example, assume three people all work from the same cash drawer, and there is $50 missing from the drawer at the end of the day. It does not matter whether it was intentional or unintentional. Any one of the three c ould be at fault. This means that the two innocent people may be unnecessarily suspected. A sound system of internal control would pinpoint responsibility for the missing money, preventing those who did not have anything to do with it from being unnecessarily suspected. Other examples include: (1) not getti ng a receipt when turning in money to someone; (2) not using official, chronol ogically, pre-numbered receipts for intakes of money; and (3) not balanci ng out receipts before turning money and receipts over to someone else. Internal control is not just the respons ibility of auditors. To some degree, internal control is the res ponsibility of everyone in the municipal court and should be part of everyone's job description. However, ultimate responsibility rests with management (i.e., court management and city management). One additional matter should be kept in mind concerning internal control\u2014 and that is the \"Cost Benefit Rule.\" This rule simply provides that, in general, the cost of internal controls should not exceed the expected benefit. For example, $10,000 should not be spent to protect $500. The rule takes into account that funds should be spent efficiently and effectively. 5.3 Internal Control Components There are five interrelated components of internal control. Not all municipal courts will implement and execute th e components in the same way. For example, a large municipal court will im plement and execute them differently than a much smaller municipal court. The five components are: Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 56 Control Environment; and Communication; and \u00be Monitoring. A. Control Environment The control environment sets the tone of the municipal court. In essence, it is the foundation for all of the other components. The control environment includes the following: \u00be Integrity and ethical values; \u00be Competence; \u00be Philosophy and operating style of management; \u00be Assignment of authority and responsibility; and \u00be How personnel are developed. Guidance needs to be provided for proper behavior. To the extent possible and practical, temptations for unethical be havior need to be removed. When necessary, discipline should be used. If the way something should be handled is not perfectly clear, an individual should consult the appropriate supervisor/manager. Good questions for th e individual and supervisor/manager to ask include: Is it legal? Does it follow th e spirit of the law? Is it ethical? Is it fair? What are the possible and pr obable outcomes? Who benefits? Everyone in the court needs to be competent to properly accomplish their job. Court management needs to identify the needed skills and knowledge for the variety of jobs in the court. Positions should be filled with the most qualified and competent persons possible. Under-qualif ied persons tend to be less able to perform their duties without undue errors. All personnel should know exactly what they are supposed to do and how they are supposed to do it. They need to understand how important internal control is. Needed training should be provided and constructive performance appraisals should periodically be conducted. Management's attitude about internal control has a big impact on internal control in the court. Staff can tell whethe r they are just providing \"lip service.\" For example, how does management respond to an audit? Do they \"blow if off\" or make sure the recommended changes ar e implemented? If sound internal control is not important to management, mo st likely it will not be to the staff either. The court's organizational structure s hould show clear lines of authority and responsibility. Everyone should know who reports to w hom and when. Authority and responsibility should be delegated in a way that promotes sound internal control rather than circumventing it. For example, when someone is out on leave, Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 57 is that person's duties delegated to someone that would maintain a proper division of duties or is the delegation based upon friendship or some other criteria? A proper balance of supervision s hould exist throughout the court. Additionally, the court s hould have good employment pr actices\u2014hiring, training, compensating, evaluating, and when need ed, disciplining. The success (or failure) of an internal control system is often largely influenced by the extent to which individuals recognize they will be held acc ountable for their actions. B. Risk Assessment Every municipal court faces risks from both internal and external sources. Risk assessment involves identifying a nd analyzing the risks, and determining how to manage them. In identifying risks, all relationships and interactions within the court, the city, and with external parties should be considered. Determining the possible impact of risks, along w ith trying to identify the likelihood of occurrence, will help determine how the ri sks should be managed. Consider some sort of classification system for risks impact and probability. For example the potential impact of a risk could be low, medium, or high. Similarly, the probability of a risk could be low, medium , or high. Keep in mind that risks are both quantitative (e.g., loss of money, equi pment) and qualitative (e.g., loss of public trust, injury to the court's reputation). It might help to answer the following questions: \u00be What could go wrong? \u00be Where are we most vulnerable? \u00be How could someone steal from the court? \u00be How could court information and data be manipulated? \u00be How do we collect delinquent amounts? \u00be What transactions provide the most risk? \u00be How can our controls be bypassed? C. Control Activities Control activities are the specific policies and procedur es in the court. They help ensure that needed actions are taken to address the identified risks. Control activities include a wide range of activiti es and encompass what has traditionally been known as principles of internal control. Appropriate Division of Duties If possible, three basic functions should be performed by three different people in a municipal court: \u00be Authorization (approval) of transactions; Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 58 \u00be Recording of transactions; and \u00be Custody of assets (cash and other property). For example, a clerk making collections and issuing receipts (having custody of assets) should not be the person to balance and prepare the bank deposit or remittance (approving the day's receipts), and neither of these persons should record the day's receipts in the bookkeeping system. If one person does perform two, or all three of these functions, there is no independent check for mistakes, and erro rs are likely to go undiscovered for long periods. Fraud is also much easier if, fo r example, the same person collects cash, prepares the bank deposit and/or records the receipts in the books. The division of duties should be confi gured to prevent someone misusing funds and then concealing it. In many municipal courts , it is often not practical to maintain a strict separation of duties due to a limited staff size. If such is the case, other means will take on added importance in helpi ng assure reliable internal control, including: \u00be Rotation of among personnel; vacations; training to improve quality of work; and \u00be More frequent internal audits. Also, when necessary, a reasonable separa tion of duties can be maintained when there are just two persons. For example, when money is received: Person A Person B 1. Payment received and 2. Deposit slip prepared receipt issued. (matched against receipts and cash drawer balance). 3. Deposit made. 4. Receipts posted to receipts journal and docket book. 5. Deposit total matched against total posted to receipts journal. The basic principle to remember is that no person should handle a transaction from beginning to end. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 59 Sound Procedures for Authorizing, Recording, and Reporting Transactions All municipal courts should have logical , consistent procedures that describe in detail the duties that must be perfor med, how they are to be performed, and who is to perform them. If personnel cl early understand what is expected of them, they will tend to do a better, more accu rate job. Also, errors will be fewer, and chances of fraud will be less if each person unders tands what he/she should be doing. Procedures should provide for: \u00be Use and control of pre-numbered control Proper authorization of Safeguarding of assets; \u00be Appropriate flow of documents; \u00be Reasonable amount of checking work of others; and \u00be Bonding of all employees with acce ss to cash and other valuables. A good system of division of duties and sound, written procedures, will not guarantee good internal contro l - the system must be followed. Operations and results must be monitored and evaluated to see if the system is working as it should (see Monitoring below). D. Information and Communication Appropriate information must be identified and communicated in a way and timeframe that enables others (e.g., court administrator, city manager, city council) to properly carry out their respons ibilities. Information should not just flow upward in a municipal court and c ity. Court and city management should also provide needed information to staff so they can adequately do their jobs. Likewise, appropriate information needs to be shared among staff for effective and efficient job performance. Court management should make it clear that internal cont rol respons ibilities are to be taken seriously. Everyone in the court needs to understand their role in the internal control system and how their work relates to the work of others in the court and the city. E. Monitoring Municipal court operations need to be monitored to determine if the internal control system is effective. Ther e are two types of monitoring - ongoing monitoring and separate evaluations. Ongoing monitoring includes regular management, supervisory activities, and st aff activities. Separate evaluations include examinations and audits, whet her conducted by cour t personnel, city personnel, or external auditors. How de tailed and how often se parate evaluations Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 60 take place should depend on the effectiveness of ongoing monitoring and results of the risk assessment. Any audit findings should be promptly resolved. There are also two basic types of c ontrols - preventive and detective. Preventive controls attempt to stop so mething before it happens (e.g., computer passwords, division of duties, proper aut horization of transact ions). Detective controls attempt to find out if anything is wrong before it gets any worse (e.g., reconciliations, a udits) and stop it. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 61 Chapter 6 Receipts, Disburseme nts, and Remittances 6.1 Introduction A large part of municipal court financ ial management consists of receipts, disbursements, and remittances - dealing with money on a recurring basis. This chapter presents general procedures and information for receipts, disbursements, and remittances. Since every municipal court is different, the procedures and information will need to be adapted to meet the individual court's needs. In this chapter, general procedures and information will be presented for: \u00be and remittances; and \u00be Accounting for disbursements. 6.2 Change Funds (The materials on pages 61 and 62 were adapted from the Justice of the Peace Manual (1994) - a Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts publication.) Change funds are used for the purpose of making change for customers. There should be a separate change f und for each person taking in money and issuing receipts. Change funds should be maintained at the lowest practical level - generally what is needed for daily ope rations. To determine the amount needed: \u00be Analyze prior transactions; \u00be Check with the city auditor and/or city treasurer for guidance; and \u00be Check with personnel from other municipal courts. It is recommended that signs be posted in the court indicating: \u00be Checks and money orders will be accep ted for the amount of payment only; \u00be Checks will not be cashed; \u00be Any currency denominations that will not be accepted; and \u00be When paying in cash, have as close to the exact amount as possible. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 62 The goals with change funds are to keep the funds secure and pinpoint responsibility for the funds. A. Creating a Change Fund 1. After the city council or appropr iate official (e.g., city auditor or finance director) authorizes the change fund, the municipal court administrator (or other appropria te employee) should receive the amount from the city treasurer, count it to verify the amount, and then sign for the receipt of it. 2. The person receiving the money in 1. above will then turn over money to each individual responsible for op erating a fund, have him/her count it to verify the amount, and then sign for the amount received. 3. Each fund should be maintained in a secured location. Generally, only the responsible individual shoul d be allowed access to the fund. B. Managing a Change Fund The individual responsible for operating a fund must: 1. Count and verify the change fund at the beginning of each day. The amount should be consistent from day to day. 2. Make change as necessary. Wh en making change, always count it until the same amount is arrived at twice. 3. Count and verify the change fund at the end of each day. The dollar amount in the change fund after re ceipts are removed should equal the authorized amount of the fund. 4. Periodically review the adequacy of the change fund amount and make adjustments as needed. C. Control of Change Funds 1. Maintain each fund at the lowest practical level ($50 - $200 per cashier is usually adequate). 2. Under no circumstances should the fund be: a. Commingled with personal funds; b. Used to make advances to officials or employees; c. Used to cash personal checks; or d. Used to balance daily receipts (e.g., making up for a shortage). Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 63 3. Unannounced reconciliations or audits of cash receipts and change funds should be made on an irregular basis to help ensu re the integrity of the fund. 4. The fund should be appropriately secured at all times, during the day and night. During the work day, each cashier should keep their change fund and collections in a location that is out of reach of those making payments. Each change fund should be locked, with access restricted when the cashier responsible for th e fund is away for any reason. Change funds also need to be secure d when the work day is over, with access restricted and accountability pinpointed. There are times when a cashier's fund needs to be accessed in their absence. There should always be two people present when this is done and the amount documented. One way this can be handled is to have a dual key box where duplicates of the individual cashier's keys are stored. Keys to the dual key box would be kept by two different individuals; thus two people would n eed to be present to access an absent cashier's funds. 6.3 Receipt Form Each municipal court should have a pr ocess which ensures that all money received is properly processed, deposite d, and accounted for. A proper receipt form is essential. For internal control purposes, the receipts must be chronologically numbered. Remember, even if computer-generated receipts are used, hardcopy receipts are needed for those instances when the computer goes down. Some courts use a two-part receipt. However, better internal control can be achieved using a three-part receipt as follows: \u00be One part (the original) fo r the person making payment; \u00be One part for the city auditor (or the city treasurer if the city does not have a city auditor); and \u00be One part to be retained by the court. One of the copies can be electronic. In some courts a four-part receipt is used with two parts being retain ed by the court instead of one. For accounting and auditing purposes, th e receipt should provide space for the following information: \u00be Date; \u00be Reference number (e.g., case number); Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 64 \u00be Who the money is being received from; \u00be Method of payment (e.g., cash, check , money order, credit card); \u00be Indication of whether the paymen t is a full or partial payment; \u00be Total amount received; \u00be What the money is being received for; \u00be Signature or initials of the individual preparing the receipt. (For hardcopy receipts, the signature or initials w ould be written by the cashier. For computer-generated receipts, the signat ure or initials w ould be generated by the computer); and \u00be Any other relevant information. Sample Format No particular format is required by la w. A sample format is shown on the following page. Each court should adapt the format to meet their specific needs. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 65 OFFICIAL RECEIPT No. ________ Municipal Court City of ____________________ Date ___________ Reference No. _____________ _____________________ Received From _________________________ Received For ____________ ___** Mode of Payment Cash ______ Check* _______ Money Order * ____________ Other ____________________ Description the check number or money order number. ** Itemize what the amount received is for (e.g., specific court costs and f ees and fine) with the corresponding amounts. 6.4 Over-The-Counter Receipts The most basic method for receiving payments is over-the-counter. The following procedures are general in nature , but detailed enough to be adapted for use in most municipal courts. Each court should adapt the procedures to fit its specific situation. In addition to the inte rnal control considerations previously discussed, following sound procedures also helps a court present a good image to the public. The procedures are broken down into four areas: \u00be Getting started; \u00be Opening up; \u00be Basic operations; and Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 66 \u00be Closing out. A. Getting Started There are some basic things that should be covered before a court and employee begins receiving money over-the -counter. Many of them are common sense, but often get overlooked in the fast pace of day-to-day operations. 1. Develop written procedures . The procedures should: a. Be comprehensive; b. Be dated (i.e., indicate th eir effective date); and c. Periodically be reviewed and updated (at least annually if possible). 2. Appropriately bond cashiers . Whether employees are bonded individually, as part of an entire offi ce, or as part of the city as a whole varies. The more common practice appears to be bonding cashiers as part of the city as a whole. B onding amounts vary based upon specific city requirements (e.g., as set by the city council or finance director), and are generally based on the amount at risk, historical experience, and other factors. a. Only bonded employees should receive and/or handle money; and b. The adequacy of bond amounts should periodically be reviewed (at least annually) and a ny necessary changes made. 3. Provide a physically secure place for cashiers . Cashiers should have a feeling of safety as they do thei r jobs. Each city should take reasonable steps to ensure a safe working environment for employees by: a. Providing appropriate physical barriers and restrictions between cashiers and the public; b. Using signs to show restrictions (e.g., Only Employees Beyond This Point); and c. Providing cashiers with some so rt of panic button or similar device. Providing a physically secure plac e for cashiers would be a good use of the Municipal Court Build ing Security Fund provided for in Code of Criminal Procedur e, Article 102.017. The money in that fund comes from a $3 fee on misdemeanor convictions if the governing body has passed the appropriate ordinance. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 67 4. Adequately train cashiers . To best represent the office and the city, cashiers should be trained in a wi de range of areas, including: a. Court operations; b. City operations in general; c. Dealing with people; d. Handling money; e. Security issues; f. Types of collections: (1) Cash; (2) Money orders and cashiers checks; (3) Credit cards; (4) Electronic payments; and (5) Any other applicable types of collections; g. Determining the proper amounts to be collected; and h. Forms to be used and how to use them. 5. Have a fireproof place (preferabl y a safe) to lock up money and any unissued hardcopy re ceipts overnight . Money should not only be safeguarded during the day, but also overnight and at other times the office is closed. 6. Explain to cashiers that no co mmingling of money is acceptable . This would include: a. Commingling personal money with court money; b. Cashing personal checks; c. Using court money to make personal change; and d. Using personal money to make court change. 7. Post signs indicating court policies . Individuals should not be surprised about certain court policies when they are ready to make a payment. The signs should be posted even if notification is also made via other methods (e.g., le tters, citations, etc.). In this situation, the signs reinforce the policies and make the job of the cashiers somewhat easier. The signs should: a. State the methods of payment accepted and not accepted; b. State any currency denominations not accepted; c. Indicate that someone paying in cash should have as close to the exact amount owed as possible; d. Instruct payors to obtain a r eceipt as proof of payment; and e. If the court accepts personal ch ecks, state the court's policy for non-sufficient fund (NSF) checks. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 68 8. Obtain an adequate supply of pre-printed, hardcopy, chronologically numbered receipts . Using chronologically numbered and controlled receipts is a significant component of a sound system of receiving payments. Even if the office issues computer-generated receipts, hardcopy receipts are needed for th ose instances when the computer goes down. a. If computer-generated recei pts are used, they should also be chronologically numbered (the number is usually affixed as the transaction occurs); b. Restrict the ability to set or reset the computer-generated receipt numbers; c. Receipts should display the name of the city and \"Municipal Court.\"; d. Receipts should have at least th ree parts (it is okay for one part to be electronic): (1) One part for the person making the payment; (2) One part for the court; and (3) One part for the city auditor or city treasurer. Please note that generic receipts (e.g., from a local office supply store) should not be used. 9. Distribute the pre-printed, ha rdcopy, chronologically numbered receipts to the cashiers . a. Explain to them their responsibili ties concerning th e receipts and what steps to take when they are aware of any problems; b. Have them count all the receipts being distributed to them; and c. Have them sign something indicating specifically what receipts they received (i.e., receipt numbers xxx - xxx). 10. Periodically reconcile all receipts . It is important to periodically account for all receipts - not just th e issued ones, but the unissued ones as well. The idea is to make sure that all unissued receipts are in fact unissued and accounted for. In othe r words, making sure someone has not been issuing receipts out of sequence and taking the money. Comments reference 8., 9., and 10. One person in the office should be designated as the custodian for the hardcopy receipts. This person should be responsible for: receiving the receipts ordered centrally from the city; counting and inspecting all of the receipts before signing for them; assigning receipts to individual clerks; receiving comple ted receipts back from the clerks; reconciling used and unused receip ts; and notifying the city when new receipts need to be ordered and the number to start with. It is Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 69 important to make sure there are no gaps in the numbers from the current batch of receipts and the receipts being ordered. Custodians should maintain a log with the following information: and all acco unted for; incomplete and to be reassigned). A sample log is shown on Page 76. 11. Provide each cashier with a se parate cash box, drawer, or register . It is usually impossible to properly affix responsibility for over-the-counter errors or irregularities when two or more people work out of the same box, drawer, or register. For example, if Carol and Bob work out of the same cash drawer and $50.00 is missi ng at the end of the day, it is virtually impossible to appropriate ly pinpoint responsibility for who made the mistake or took the money. The problem is compounded as the number of people who work out of a single box, drawer, or register increases. Even if a single register is used that requires each cashier to key in a unique user number before processing a transaction, responsibility for missing money still cannot be properly pinpointed. This is because someone can take out more money or put in less money than they should. Here again, it would not be possible to affix responsibility to a specific cashie r. It is recommended that the following procedures be implemented: a. Provide each cashier with their own key; b. Explain to each cashier their re sponsibility for the key and the box, drawer, or register; c. Make sure another key is kept by someone highe r in authority and is only used as needed and in the presence of at least two people; and d. Make sure the boxes, dr awers, or registers are compartmentalized to allow keeping currency and coin denominations separate. Using compartmentalized boxes, drawers, or registers reduces th e chances of giving someone the wrong change. 12. Distribute a change fund to each cashier . Since each cashier needs their own box, drawer, or register, th ey need their own change fund as well. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 70 a. Maintain the change fund at th e lowest practical level - generally what is needed for daily operations; b. $50 - $200 per change fund will be adequate in most instances; c. Have cashiers count and sign for the money they receive; and d. Periodically review the ade quacy of the ch ange fund amount (occasionally, determine how often coins and currency exchanges are needed) and make appropriate adjustments. 13. Make sure cashiers do not also handle mail receipts . If, due to a limited staff size, a cashier does have to handle mail receipts, mail should be handled at a time when the cashier is not handling over-the- counter receipts and when the cashie r does not have access to his/her cash box, drawer, or register. B. Opening Up This area focuses on those things that should be done by a cashier each day before he/she begins handling transactions. 1. Obtain change fund and unissued receipts . a. The fund and receipts should have been locked up in a secure place overnight; and b. If obtaining a fund and receipts provides a cashier access to another cashier's fund or receipts , at least two people should be present when the fund and receipts are obtained. 2. Count and verify the change fund amount . It is important to verify that the beginning amount is correct. Fo r example, if someone took money out of a change fund during the night, and the amount was not checked before starting to handle transa ctions the following day, the assumption would be that something happened during the day's transactions, not before the day's transactions started. A cashier could be unnecessarily suspected of wrongdoing. a. Indicate on the Cashier Rec onciliation Form that the beginning change fund amount is correct and was verified; or b. If the amount is incorrect: (1) List the amount missing; (2) If possible, indicate spec ifically what is missing (i.e., the number of specific coin and currency denominations); and (3) Make appropriate notification as required by the court/city. 3. Count and verify unissued receipts . It is also important to verify that the unissued receipts that are supposed to be there are in fact there. For example, if someone took unissu ed receipts during the night, and Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 71 that was not checked before starting to handle transactions the following day, the assumption might be that the responsible cashier issued the receipts and pocketed the money. Remember, a good audit trail shows who did what, when they did it, and how much was involved. a. Indicate on the Cashier Reconcili ation Form that the unissued receipts that are supposed to be there are in fact there; or b. If any receipts are missing: (1) List, by number, the receipts missing; and (2) Make appropriate notification as required by the court/city. 4. Put change fund and rece ipts in working location . The working location should be a box, drawer, or register that can be adequately secured. 5. Make sure items needed to ha ndle over-the-counter receipts are present and in good working condition . A cashier should have what they need to do the job before the first person comes in to make a payment. Items needed may include: a. Calculator; b. Date stamp (changed to current date); c. Ink pads; d. Restrictive endorsement stamp; e. Payee stamp; f. Court costs, fees, and fine schedule; g. Pens and paper; and h. Any information to be disseminated to persons making payments. 6. If applicable, get computer \"up and running .\" This would include: a. Turning the computer on and logging on; b. Making sure needed applications are working; and c. Making notifications and adjustme nts for any items not working. C. Basic Operations Below are the procedures a cash ier should follow each day there is cashiering activity. Remember, the proce dures should be adjusted to fit the circumstances of a particular court. 1. Be professional and courteous to each person . Each cashier represents both the municipal court and the city. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 72 2. Make sure the amount being paid is correct . The documents or information to check to make sure the amount being paid is correct include: a. A court judgment; b. Court costs, fees, or fine schedules; c. A payout agreement; and/or d. An applicable law. 3. Prepare and issue a receipt for each intake of money . a. Information on a receipt should normally include: (1) The date; (2) The docket, case, or account number; (3) The amount received; (4) The name of the person making the payment; (5) What the money is being received for; (6) The method of payment (e.g., cash, check, money order) and, if applicable, the number of the check or money order; (7) The name of the city and \"Municipal Court\"; (8) Additional information as needed; and (9) The signature of th e person issuing the receipt. b. For hand-prepared receipts: (1) Fill out the necessary information on the receipt before signing it; (2) Make sure the payment is received and the amount is correct before entering the amount on the receipt. If checks are accepted, make sure they are completely filled out, the amount is correct, and are signed. If payment is by credit card, make sure the payor signs the court copy) ; and (3) If a hand-prepared receipt is being prepared because the computer is down and the system requires that a computer- generated receipt be issued later, appropriately cross-reference and attach the receipts. c. When making change, count it until the same amount is arrived at twice; d. Keep the payment received in vi ew until the receipt is issued and the payor is satisfied. e. Restrictively endorse check s and money orders (with payor present); f. Put the payment in th e box, drawer, or register; and g. Appropriately place any paperwork and/or documents (e.g., receipt copies, payout agreement, files). Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 73 4. Lock up money and receipts ( both issued and unissued) if the immediate work area is left for any reason, including: a. Breaks; b. Lunch; c. Appointments; or d. Meetings. 5. Establish a procedure for maki ng any needed coin and currency exchanges . When doing so: a. Double-count what you give up; and b. Double-count what you receive. 6. For high volume operations, have a system in place to remove excess cash during the day . Doing so reduces security problems and should allow for more rapid deposits. a. Make the removals at pr edetermined times or levels; and b. Amounts removed should be signed fo r, or if that is not possible, counted by both the cashier and the person receiving the cash. 7. Retain all voided receipts . When voided receipts occur: a. Clearly mark \"VOID\" on the receipt copies; b. Do not alter the receipt in any way; and c. If the payor's copy is missing, attach something explaining why. 8. Make sure automated systems provide a clear audit trail (i.e, who did what, when they did it, and how much was involved). a. Utilize a multi-level access stru cture that permits changes to only be made by authorized personnel; and b. Ensure the system traces changes and shows who made them. Financial management informatio n should not be able to be changed on a computer without a cl ear audit trail. For example, if someone can reduce the amount the computer shows as owing on a case - say from $400 to $ 200, it would be easier for someone to steal $200 than would otherwise be the case. 9. If someone performs a cash count on the cashier, the cashier should never leave the person performing th e count alone with the money and receipts . The cashier should: a. Watch carefully what the person does; b. Sign the cash count form indicating the date and time; and Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 74 c. Indicate on the form if he/she disagrees with the count, and if so, in what way. D. Closing Out The following procedures for closing out are based on the use of the sample Cashier Reconciliation Form shown on Page 77. The procedures can easily be adapted to use with othe r reconciliation forms. 1. Each cashier should initially ba lance out his/her own cash box, drawer, or register . If a cashier turns in mone y to someone without counting it and something is missing, it is difficult to prove who is at fault. 2. Each cashier should balance out ea ch day he/she has any cashiering activity . 3. To balance out, a cashier should : a. Go to the designated locati on for balancing out. The location should: (1) Generally not be in the public's view; or (2) Be so isolated that the cashier is completely alone (i.e., there should be at l east two people present); b. Separate the money and checks/money orders and any other applicable documents (e.g., credit card slips); c. Verify that checks/money orders were restrictively endorsed; d. Further separate the curren cy and coins into denominations; e. Count the currency and coin s by denomination, entering the individual denomination totals and the overall total in the \"Cash and Currency\" section of the Ca shier Reconciliation Form. The overall total should also be entere d in the \"Recap\" section of the Cashier Reconciliation Form. The form should be completed in ink ; f. Rubber-band (or otherwise secure) the currency together in descending denomination size and put coins in an appropriate envelope or container; g. List the individual checks, money orders, and credit card payments with amounts and the overall total in the \"Checks/Money Orders/Credit Ca rd\" section of the Cashier Reconciliation Form, and (1) Run an adding machine tape of the checks, money orders, and credit card payments, and write \"Checks/Money Orders/Credit Card\" on the top of the tape; (2) Attach the tape to the checks, money orders, and credit card slips; and (3) Enter the overall total in the \"Recap\" section of the Cashier Reconciliation From Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 75 Because of the volume of trans actions, some courts do not list individual checks, money orders, and credit card payments, but list a total for each instead. However, some courts use their adding machine tape to list check numbers. Many calculators allow a check number and a check amount to be entered, with only the amount of the checks being totaled. This is usually done by entering the check number and pressing the \"#\" key, followed by entering the check amount and pressing the \"+\" key. The \"total\" key is pressed at the end ; h. Add the \"Cash and Currency\" total in the \"Recap\" section to the \"Checks/Money Orders/Credit Card\" total in the \"Recap\" section to arrive the \"Total Monies on Hand\" in the \"Recap\" section; i. Replenish the change fund (c ounting the amount twice) and enter the change fund amount in the \"Recap\" section. The change fund amount should generally remain constant from day to day ; j. Subtract the \"Less Change Fund Amount\" in the \"Recap\" section from the \"Total Monies on Hand\" amount in the \"Recap\" section to arrive at \"Total Monies on Hand (Excluding Change Fund Amount)\"; k. Put the copies of the receipts issued in numerically chronological order and enter the beginning rece ipt number and ending receipt number in the \"Receipts to Account For\" section of the Cashier Reconciliation Form. The form has space for three batches of receipts if needed ; l. Enter the total amount of the receipts issued in the \"Receipts to Account For\" section of the Cashier Reconciliation Form; and (1) Run an adding machine tape of the receipts and write \"Receipts\" on the top of the tape; (2) Attach the tape to the receipts; (3) Enter the total amount of the receipts issued in the \"Recap\" section of the Cashier Reconciliation Form; m. Subtract the total of \"Receipts To Account For\" from \"Total Monies on Hand (Excluding Cha nge Fund Amount)\" and enter the amount in the space provided in the Cashier Reconciliation Form. The amount should be zero. A positive number represents an overage. A negativ e number represents a shortage. n. If there is an overage or shor tage repeat steps e. through m. and compare individual receipt amounts to check, money order, and credit card payment amounts. If a mistake was made doing the reconciliation and there is not an overage or a shortage, correct the form. If there continues to be an overage or a shortage, continue to the next step; o. Verify unissued receipts ar e all present - in unbroken series Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 76 If any are missing, indicate th is in the \"Additional Information\" section of the Cashier Reconcil iation Form, listing the missing receipt numbers; p. Enter the date and time and sign the Cashier Reconciliation Form; and q. Make a copy of the Cashier Reconciliation Form and forward the form, receipts, and payments to the appropriate individuals for verification and remittance or deposit preparation and bookkeeping. Verification should take place in the presence of the cashier and the verifier shoul d also sign and date the form. Any corrections should be initia led by both the cashier and the verifier. Erasures and white out are not to be used. (A limited staff size may not allow for a verification count prior to remittance or deposit.) In some cities, because of court and treasurer (or bank) locations, it may be necessary to have someone accompany the individual remitting/depositing the money. (Cashier Reconciliation Forms should be maintained for audit and personnel purposes. For example, if a cashier consistently fails to balance out properly, the forms could be supporting documentation for a personnel action.) 4. Return the cash box, drawer, or regi ster (along with the change fund) to the appropriate location for safekeeping .

Proper management of mail collections is particularly important because the person making payment is not present, and no receipt is issued at the time of collection. To make matte rs worse, many people send cash through the mail. The goals concerning mail collections are to establish a clear audit trail, and to ensure and document the proper handling of mail co llections. The collections should be processed correctly and timely. This m eans mail payments should be processed daily. How well an office is run can often be gauged by how the office handles mail receipts. If they are handled properly and timely, then the rest of the office is usually in pretty g ood shape. However, if mail is not handled properly, odds are high there are problems in other areas of o ffice operations. In other words, if an area in which the involved party is not present (as with mail collections) is in good shape, the probability is that othe r areas (where the involved parties generally are present) are in good shape, also. Basic Procedures The following procedures are general in nature and can be adapted for use in most municipal courts. Each court should adapt the procedures to fit their specific situation. 1. Mail Cashier(s) If possible, two clerks, working together, should open the mail and record the payments on the Daily Mail Collection Report. One person prepares the Report and the othe r person verifies the report. a. Open all mail addressed to the office; b. Sort out mail intended for others, retaining all that contain currency or checks. Forward othe r mail to appropriate parties; c. Restrictively endorse all checks immediately (i.e. \"For Deposit Only, Account # ________\"); d. List all payments received on the Daily Mail Collection Report (see sample on Page 80) in sufficient detail to identify the person who sent the payment, the amount received, and for what it was received; e. Total all currency and checks a nd compare that amount to the total on the Daily Mail Collection Report. Find and correct any errors. Sign and date the report; f. Forward the mail collections and the Daily Mail Collection Report to the cash receipts cashier; g. Forward a copy of the Daily Mail Collection Report to the accounting department; and Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 79 h. Retain a copy of the report. 2. Cash Receipts Cashier a. Receive the mail collections and Daily Mail Collection Report from the mail cashier; b. Verify that the amount received equals the amount shown on the Daily Mail Collection Report. If not, investigate discrepancies; c. Prepare receipts (whether they are mailed will depend upon office policy). Enter receipt num bers on Daily Mail Collection Report; d. Prepare bank deposit or remittance to city treasurer; e. Make deposit or remittance; f. Forward the Daily Mail Colle ction Report and deposit slip or remittance receipt to accounting department for bookkeeping entries; and g. Retain a copy of the report. 3. Accounting Department a. Receive a copy of the Daily Mail Collection Report from the mail cashier; b. Receive the Daily Mail Collection Report and deposit slip or remittance receipt from the cash receipts cashier; c. Verify that the amount shown on the copy of the Daily Mail Collection Report received from th e mail cashier is the same as the amount shown on the Daily Mail Collection Report received from the cash receipts cashier; d. Verify that the amount shown on the Daily Mail Collection Report equals the amount on the deposit slip or remittance receipt; and e. Make appropriate bookkeeping entries and file paperwork.

Other municipal courts provide a mechanism for payments to be made when the office is closed. Those courts that do provi de for after-hours, in-person payments, generally do so via some sort of lock or drop box. Similar to mail collections, proper ma nagement of lockbox collections is important because the person making paymen t is not present when the payment is physically received by the court. Additio nally, lockbox payments are even more likely to be made in cash than paymen ts received in the mail. The goals concerning lockbox collections are to estab lish a clear audit tr ail and to ensure and document the proper handling of lo ckbox collections. Lockbox collections should be processed correctly and timely. Lockbox collections should also be processed daily. Basic Procedures Lockbox procedures are very similar to the procedures for mail receipts. The following procedures are general in natu re and can be adapted for use in most municipal courts. Each c ourt should adapt the procedur es to fit their specific situation. 1. Lockbox Cashier(s) If possible, two clerks, working t ogether, should open the lockbox and record the payments on the Daily Lockbox Collection Report. One person prepares the report and the other person verifies the report. a. Open the lockbox or receive lockbox contents. The box should be opened in an open area, not in an enclosed office ; b. Restrictively endorse all check s immediately (i.e., \"For Deposit Only, Account # _______\"); c. List all payments received on the Daily Lockbox Collection Report (see sample on Page 83) in sufficient detail to identify the person who sent the payment, the amount received, and for what it was received; d. Total all currency and checks and compare that amount to the total on the Daily Lockbox Collection Report. Find and correct any errors. Sign and date the report; e. Forward the lockbox collections and Daily Lockbox Collection Report to the cash receipts cashier; f. Forward a copy of the Daily Lockbox Collection Report to the accounting department; and g. Retain a copy of the report. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 82 2. Cash Receipts Cashier a. Receive the lockbox collec tions and Daily Lockbox Collection Report from the lockbox cashier; b. Verify that the amount received equals the amount shown on the Daily Lockbox Collection Report. If not, investigate any discrepancies; c. Prepare receipts (whether they are mailed will depend on court policy). Enter receipt numbers on the Daily Lockbox Collection Report; d. Prepare bank deposit or remittance to city treasurer; e. Make deposit or remittance; f. Forward the Daily Lockbox Colle ction Report and deposit slip or remittance receipt to the accounting department for bookkeeping entries; and g. Retain a copy of the report. 3. Accounting Department a. Receive a copy of the Daily Lockbox Collection Report from the lockbox cashier; b. Receive the Daily Lockbox Collection Report and deposit slip or remittance receipt from the cash receipts cashier; c. Verify that the amount shown on the copy of the Daily Lockbox Collection Report received from th e lockbox cashier is the same as the amount shown on the Daily Lockbox Collection Report received from the cash receipts cashier; d. Verify that the amount shown on the Daily Lockbox Collection Report equals the amount on the deposit slip or remittance receipt; and e. Make appropriate bookkeeping entries and file paperwork.

Electronic collection generally increases revenue b ecause defendants are given an additional way to pay and the ease with which payment can be made. The goals concerning electronic payments are to establish a clea r audit trail and process and account for the payments correctly and timely. Basic Procedures The following procedures are general in nature and can be adapted for use in most courts. Each court should adapt the procedures to fit their specific situation. 1. Electronic Receipts Cashier a. Receive notification of electronic payments. Notification is usually via a report of the previous day's transactions ; b. If notification is not in a usab le report format, list all payments received on the Daily Electronic Collection Report (see sample on Page 86) in sufficient detail to identify the person who made the payment, the amount of the payment, and for what it was received; c. Forward a copy of the Daily Elec tronic Collection Report to the cash receipts cashier; d. Forward a copy of the Daily Electronic Collection Report to the accounting department; and e. Retain a copy of the report. 2. Cash Receipts Cashier a. Receive the Daily Electronic Co llection Report from the Electronic Receipts Cashier; b. Prepare receipts (whether they are mailed will depend upon office policy). Enter receipt number on the Daily Electronic Collection Report; c. Forward the Daily Electronic Collection Report to accounting department for bookkeeping entries; and d. Retain a copy of the report. 3. Accounting Department a. Receive copy of the Daily Elec tronic Collection Report from the electronic receipts cashier; b.

Verify that the amount shown on the copy of the Daily Electronic Collection Report received from the electronic receipts cashier is the same as the amount shown on the Daily Electronic Collection Report received from the cash receipts cashier. d. Receive notification from bank of amount credited from electronic payments. e. Verify that the amount shown on the Daily Electronic Collection Report equals the amount show n credited by the bank; and f. Make appropriate bookkeepi ng entries and file paperwork.

For example, the judge may direct the defendant to pay: \u00be The entire fine, costs, and fees when sentence is pronounced; \u00be The entire fine, costs, and f ees at some later date; or \u00be A specified portion of the fine, costs, and fees at designated intervals. In addition to establishing a clear audit trail and properly handling payments, the goals concerning installment payments include ensuring that payments are made timely and there is prompt follow-up on missed payments. Basic Procedures The following procedures are general in nature and can be adapted for use in most courts. Each court should adapt the procedures to fit their specific situation. 1. Have a written description of the circumstances under which installment payments are usually allowed . Even though the decision rests with the judge, it is best to have a written description of when installment payments are generally allowed. This indirectly causes the judge to think about the pros and cons, as well as the reasons for allowing or not allowing defendants to pay what they owe over a period of time. The end result is usually a more consistent application of when installment agreements are used. 2. There should be a signed, written court order whenever installment payments are allowed . a. The order should clearly sp ell out the terms of the order, including payment amounts, dates, and location of office where payments are to be made; b. The order should be signed by the judge; and c. A copy of the signed orde r should be given to the payor. 3. There should be an efficient way to monitor payments when defaults occur . Some municipal courts have comput er software specifically designed to simplify the installment payment process. In the absence of an automated method, a manual system will be needed. One easy manual method is to use a copy of the in stallment agreement with pre-printed columns on the back of the order. A minimum of four columns are needed - date paid, receipt number, amount paid, and balance. A separate sheet or index ca rd will work as well. An example is shown Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 88 at the bottom of the next page. The advantage of using the back of the order is that all necessary referenc e information is in one place and files do not normally have to be pulled to see what the payment requirements are. If a manual system is used: a. Simply file a copy of the inst allment orders, index cards, or separate sheets in a file folder, cabinet or box, based on due dates (or due dates plus a gra ce period), depending on how your court operates; b. Each day pull the installment orders that are delinquent and follow up on them; c. As payments are made, enter the appropriate information in the columns on the back of the order and file the order under the next payment due date or in the permanent file if paid in full; d. Ensure that payments and othe r appropriate information are also entered in the regular bookkeeping system and records; and e. Consider maintaining a list of individuals with an installment order. If an individual receive s an installment order in another matter(s), this will enable the terms to be more appropriately set (e.g., the same due dates for payments. 4. Maintain a control total for all outstanding amounts owed and periodically check to ensure the amount is correct . A court should be able to tell at any point in time the total amount owed, and who owes what amount. 5. Consider maintaining a list of in dividuals who default on payments, and check that list before ordering new payments . Example Back of Court Order, Separate Sheet, or Index Card. (If a separate sheet or index card is used, the case number will need to be added along with required payment dates and amounts.) Case # 06-9841 The total amount owed is $300.00 with $100.00 due by the 10 th of each month beginning in July 2007. Date Paid Receipt Number Amount Paid Balance $300.00 July 10, 2007 14525 $100.00 200.00 August 2007 17423 100.00 0.00 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 89 6.9 Accounting for Receipts Each municipal court needs an effec tive and efficient method for recording financial transactions. Officials are responsible for ensuring that sound bookkeeping procedures are followed in the municipal court. This includes making sure that those responsible for the bookkeeping function are qualified and trained, and that access to accounting reco rds is appropriately restricted. The accounting system should ensure that all transactions related to receipts are properly reported. There should be a good audit trail from the time money is received until it is disbursed or remitted. A. The Receipts Journal (The materials on the rest of this page were adapted from the Justice of the Peace Manual (1994) - a Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts publication.) A receipts journal should be used to chronologically account for individual receipts issued. The journal enables a municipal court to: \u00be Properly keep track of and account for each receipt issued; \u00be Properly separate and account for the different types of monies collected; \u00be Group collections in order to easily figur e the total collectio ns for each type; \u00be Balance daily, weekly, and monthly reports; and \u00be Leave a good audit trail for inte rnal and external auditors. The receipts journal should be main tained on a daily basis and should include: \u00be The date of the transaction; \u00be The name of the person making the payment; \u00be A reference number (e.g., the docket or case number); \u00be The receipt number; \u00be An actual column to keep up with the total amount received; and \u00be Several individual columns indicating wh at the money received is for (e.g., court costs, fees, and fines by type). Many municipal courts have an automated financial management system that prepares receipts, journalizes tran sactions, makes subsidiary entries, and prepares various financial reports. Howe ver, if a court does not have such a system, a receipts journal should be mainta ined manually. Entries to the journal should be made from the receipt copies maintained by the court. Daily entries should be verified for mathematical accuracy and should periodically be reviewed by someone other than the person making them, comparing them to appropriate source doc uments. Preferably, entries should be made by someone not receiving payments , preparing bank deposits, or approving disbursements. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 90 An example manual receipts journal is shown on Page 95. Descriptions of the individual columns are: FINES \u00be Weight - fines collected for offenses i nvolving a vehicle having a single axle weight, tandem axle weight, or gr oss weight that is more than 5,000 pounds heavier than the vehicle's allowa ble weight, of which 50 percent has to be sent to the state unless the o ffense occurred within 20 miles of an international border; \u00be Safety Belt/Seat - fines collected for Child Safety Seat Systems and certain Safety Belt offenses, of which 50 per cent must be sent to the state; \u00be Other Title 7 - other fines collected for offenses under Title 7 of the Transportation Code, which can only be used for specified purposes (all Title 7 fines are subject to the provisions of the Excess Highway Fines law for applicable cities); \u00be Parent Contributing - fines collected for the offe nse of Parent Contributing to Nonattendance of which 50 percent ha s to be sent to the appropriate school district, open-enrollment ch arter school, or j uvenile justice alternative education program; and \u00be Other - other fines that are retained by the city. STATE COURT COSTS AND FEES \u00be CCC - Consolidated Court Cost, of which 90 percent must be remitted to the state; \u00be JRF - Jury Reimbursement Fee, of which 90 percent must be remitted to the state; \u00be JSF - Judicial Support Fee, of which 85 pe rcent must be remitted to the state (On January 1, 2008 the city must remit 90 percent of JSF on offenses that occur January 1, 2008 and after\u2014the fee is increased to $6 on January 1, 2008 for those offenses that occur January 1, 2008 and after.); \u00be STF - State Traffic Fine, of which 95 percent must be remitted to the state; \u00be IDF - Indigent Defense Fund, of which 90 percent must be remitted to the state. \u00be TPF - Time Payment Fee, of which 50 per cent must be remitted to the state; \u00be FTA - Failure to Appear/Pay/Satisfy Judgment Fee, of which two-thirds must be remitted to the state; and \u00be AF - Arrest Fee, of which 20 percent mu st be remitted to the state if the service is performed by a st ate peace officer (If the service is performed by a city peace officer the city retains 100 percent of the arrest fee.). LOCAL COURT COSTS AND FEES \u00be CS - Child Safety Court Cost, which is retained locally; \u00be TFC - Traffic Court Cost, whic h locally; \u00be MCBS - Municipal Court ng Security Fee, which is retained locally; \u00be MCT - Municipal Court Technology Fee, which is retained locally; \u00be JCM - Juvenile Case Manager Court Cost, which is retained locally; Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 91 \u00be AF - Arrest Fee for service of local p eace officers, which is retained locally; and \u00be Other - any other court cost or f ee which is retained locally. OTHER \u00be Special Expense/Title 7 - the special expense provided for in Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 45.051 (Sus pension of Sentence and Deferral of Final Disposition) for offenses under Title 7 of the Transportation Code, which is retained locally (and is subject to the provisions of the Excess Highway Fines law for applicable cities); \u00be Special Expense/Other - the special expense provided for in Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 45.051 (Sus pension of Sentence and Deferral of Final Disposition) for all other offenses, which is retained locally; \u00be Bonds - the amount received for the bonds; and \u00be Miscellaneous - any other receipts received by the office. The sample journal format can be adapte d to meet the specific needs of most municipal courts that maintain their accounting records manually. Just tailor the columns to the level of detail desired by the court and city. The level of detail will generally be based on se veral factors, including the city budget, accounting system, number of restricted revenues, city auditor and/or finance director requirements, and external reporting requirements. In some courts with a small number of transactions, rather than maintain a cash receipts journal, a copy of each receipt is kept with the day's transactions and a report for each day is prepared showing the summary total of each type of collection (e.g., consolidated c ourt cost, time payment fee.) B. Example Cash Receipts Journal Operations The following example shows how a cash receipts journal can be used. Assume the following transactions were reco rded in the cash receipts journal for a municipal court during the m onth of March. Also assume the city has adopted the municipal court building security fee and the municipal court technology fee, but has not adopted the juven ile case manager court cost. The small number of transactions is for illust rative purposes only. The en tries are shown on Page 96. March 3 : $205.00 was collected from Nancy Noshow for failure to appear. Docket No. 06-301. Receipt No. 1246 was issued. March 6 : $160.00 was collected from Lack Co ntrol for disorderly conduct. Docket No. 06-302. Receipt No. 1247 was issued. March 10 : $160.00 was collected from Bobby Bottle for public intoxication. Docket No. 06-303. Receipt No. 1248 was issued. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 92 March 13 : $235.00 was collected from Randy Risk for failure to maintain financial responsibility. Docket N o. 06-304.

March 22 : $143.00 was collected from Lonnie Lately for an expired motor vehicle inspection certificate. Do cket No. 06-309. Receipt No. 1254 was issued. March 23 : $810.00 was collected from Grays on Gross for improper storage of food (a municipal or dinance violation). Docket No. 06-310. Receipt No. 1255 was issued. March 27 : $103.00 was collected from Carol C ourse who requested to take a driving safety course for a speeding violation. Docket No. 06-311. Receipt No. 1256 was issued. March 28 : $140.00 was collected from Mi ke Cycle for no motorcycle protective headgear. Docket No. 06-312. Receipt No. 1257 was issued. March 31 : $200.00 was collected from Justin Case for a cash bond. Docket No. 06-313. Receipt No. 1258 was issued. March 31 : $193.00 was collected from Beatrice Belt for a child passenger safety seat system offense. Do cket No. 06-314. Receipt No. 1259 was issued. C. Chart of Accounts Cities generally develop their financial management system around a standard classification syst em, commonly referred to as a chart of accounts. A chart of accounts is simply a city's stru cture of funds, func tions, departments, assets, liabilities, fund balances (equity), revenues, expenses, and expenditures, Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 93 and a numbering system to reflect that st ructure. A city's chart of accounts should be used consistently throughout the budget, accounting records, and reports. In municipal courts, the emphasis is primarily on codes for receipts/revenues (expenditures are generally handled centrally by the city). Thus, receipts/revenues may need to be maintained by using a code number in addition to a title, name, or abbreviation. For example, codes can easily be adde d to the individual receipts/revenues in the sample receipts journal as follows: FINES (301-310) \u00be Weight 301 \u00be Safety Belt/Seat 302 \u00be Other Title 7 303 \u00be Parent Contributing 304 \u00be Other 305 STATE COURT COSTS AND FEES (311-320) \u00be CCC 311 \u00be 318 LOCAL COSTS AND (321-330) \u00be Special Expense/Other 332 \u00be Bonds 333 \u00be Miscellaneous 334 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 94 The codes can easily be added to the r eceipts journal, as shown on Page 97. Additional numbers can also be used to indicate the funds the receipts/revenues are to be credited to.

In this manual, the term \"remitta nce\" is used to refer to turning money into the city treasurer and the term \"dis bursement\" is used to refer to making payments (e.g., to the state). Making payments (disbursements) and turning in money (remittances) promptly and accurately is an important responsibility of department heads and a way for them to show accountability to the public. Most municipal courts do not mainta in a bank account and, as a result, are only concerned with \"remittances\" and not with \"disbursements.\" This is generally preferable unless the court has a staff size large enough to maintain a proper division of duties and handle the a dditional safekeeping responsibilities that are part of maintain ing a bank account. Even then, a city should make sure maintaining an account in the court enhan ces city efficiency and effectiveness. Basic Procedures The following procedures should help ensure that a municipal court has addressed the important issues relating to disbursements and remittances. They are general in nature and can be adapted for use in most courts. Each court should adapt the procedures to fit their specific situati on. Procedures should be developed in consultation with the c ity auditor and the city treasurer. 1. If a bank account is no t maintained by the court : a. Remittances should be made to the city treasurer daily; and b. A receipt should be obtained for all remittances. 2. If a bank account is maintained by the court : a. All deposits and disbursement s should be processed through the accounts maintained at the city depository. Disbursements should not be made in cash. Refunds should also be made by issuing a check. If the money has already been turned into the city treasurer, the refund should not be made by the court. Rath er it should be made centrally by the city ; c. All checks should be sequentia lly pre-numbered and used in order; d. Checks should be preprinted with the name of the city and \"Municipal Court;\" Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 100 e. All unused checks should be sa feguarded and periodically accounted for; f. A checkbook with sufficient room on the stub for an adequate description of the disbur sement should be used; g. Checks should not be pre-signed; h. Checks should not be made out to \"cash\" or \"bearer;\" i. Voided checks should be marked \"void\" and accounted for. They should be kept with the checkbook and later placed in the reconciliation envelope or folder . Do not destroy voided checks; j. Authorized check signatures s hould be kept to a minimum; k. If a \"stamp\" or \"check-signing\" device is used, it should be appropriately safeguarded and access appropriately restricted; l. Checks should be prepared only when: (1) Supporting documentation is pr esent and has been verified; (2) All figures have been double-checked; and (3) There is an adequate balance in the account; m. The payee line should be completed by the person preparing the checks, not the person signing them; n. Checks should be signed by someone not keeping the books or preparing the checks; o. Checks should be mailed without allowing them to be returned to the person who approves them or does the bookkeeping for them; p. Checks should be appropria tely entered in the court's bookkeeping system; and q. If a check is reported as lost: (1) Verify that the check has not cleared the bank. Check the last bank statement. If the ch eck was not cleared on the last bank statement, contact the bank to make sure it has not cleared since then; (2) Initiate a \"stop payment\" on the check; (3) Write an explanation as to why the \"stop payment\" was done, when it was done, and who did it. Attach the explanation to the check stub or cash disbursements journal; and (4) Back out the check from the accounting records. This should be done in the cu rrent disbursements journal as the next entry. On the disbursements journal page where the original entry was made, write \"canceled\" beside the entry. If the check was shown as outstanding on any bank reconciliations it is also a good idea to write \"canceled\" by the check number on the reconciliations. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 101 6.11 Accounting for Disbursements Each municipal court that maintains a bank account needs an effective and efficient method for keeping up with a nd recording disbursements. Proper accounting for disbursements helps complete the cycle of having a good audit trail from the time money is received until it is disbursed. A. The Disbursements Journal The materials on the rest of this page were adapted from the Justice of the Peace Manual (1994) - a Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts publication. A disbursements journal should be us ed to account for all disbursements from a court. The journal enables a court to: \u00be Properly keep track of and account for each disbursement made; \u00be Properly separate and account for the different types of disbursements; \u00be Group disbursements in order to easily calculate the total disbursements for each type; \u00be Balance daily, weekly, and monthly reports; and \u00be Leave a good audit trail for inte rnal and external auditors. The disbursements journal should be maintained on a daily basis and should include: \u00be The date of the transaction; \u00be The name of the payee and, where necessary, what the payment is for; \u00be A reference number (i.e., the check number); \u00be An actual column to keep up with the total amount disbursed; \u00be Several individual columns indicating wh at the disbursement is for (e.g., State Comptroller or City Treasurer); and \u00be A memorandum column to add any additional information needed (e.g., the reason for a refund). If a municipal court does not have an automated system of accounting for disbursements, a disbursements journal s hould be maintained manually. Entries to the journal should be made from the checks and applicable supporting documentation. Daily entries should be verified for mathematical accuracy and should periodically be reviewed by some one other than the person making them. If a court makes only a few disburseme nts each month, a journal is normally not needed. In this s ituation, the checks, supporti ng documentation, and reports are usually sufficient. The decision not to maintain a disbursements journal should be made after consulting with the city auditor and finance director. An example manual disbursements jour nal for a municipal court is shown on Page 103. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 102 B. Example Cash Disbursements Journal Operations Following is an example of how a cash disbursements journal can be used. Assume the transactions below were reco rded in the cash disbursements journal during the month of October (there w ill normally be many more monthly transactions). Also, assume payments to the state are made directly by the court (in many cities where the munici pal court maintains a bank account, disbursements to the state are made by the city treasurer after the money is remitted to the treasurer from the cour t). The entries are shown on Page 104. October 9 : Check No. 345 in the amount of $200.00 was issued to Didnt Doit, refunding a cash bond paid the previous month. Docket No. 06-916. October 20 : Check No. 346 in the amount of $1,940.00 was issued to the Comptroller of Public Accounts for 50 percent of the fines received during the previous fiscal year for Safety Seat System and certain Seat Belt offenses. October 31 : Check No. 347 in the amount of $2,905.00 was issued to the Comptroller of Public Accounts for the quarterly amount of state court costs and fees. October 31 : Check No. 348 in the amount of $3,695.00 was issued to the City Treasurer for the city's share of state court costs and fees, local court costs and fees, and fines collect ed during the previous quarter.

Areas include: \u00be Petty cash; \u00be Bank credits; \u00be Monthly reporting; and \u00be Monitoring the budget. 7.2 Petty Cash Petty cash consists of a sum of money set aside for making small cash purchases on a contingency basis. It is recommended that municipal courts not have petty cash funds. Purchases made fo r the court should be made centrally by the city. However, in some cities, municipal c ourt operations cannot be kept separate from regular city operations and the city petty cash f und has to be handled by an individual working in the court. In t hose instances, the petty cash fund should be kept separate from the muni cipal court change fund(s). 7.3 Bank Account Reconciliations Each municipal court that maintains a bank account(s) should do regular reconciliations. Monthly reconciliations of the bank statement(s) with the books maintained by the court is necessary to help assure that errors and/or irregularities, if any, are found and appropriately handled without delay. Bank account reconciliations should be done promptly upon receipt. Additionally, the reconciliations s hould be done by someone who is not responsible for receiving money, preparing deposits or signing checks. Almost all bank statements include a reconciliation format. Many formats are similar to the one on the following pa ge. A city auditor or finance director may even have a specific fo rmat for the court to use. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 106 As a general rule, reconciliations shoul d be done initially by the office that maintains the account(s). The city auditor will usually review the reconciliations as part of the audit of th e court, and he/she may even perform what is known as a \"proof of cash,\" which is even more inclusiv e of an office's transactions than is a bank reconciliation. A. Bank Reconciliation Procedures After receiving the bank statement unopened (to ensure it has not been altered) from the bank: STEP ONE 1. Enter the balance from the books in the space provided on the reconciliation form; 2. Deduct any bank charges indicated on the bank statement; 3. Make any other necessary adjustments such as adding interest earnings; and 4. Total the amounts in 1., 2., and 3. to a rrive at the adjusted book balance. STEP TWO 1. From the bank statement, write the stated bank balance in the space provided on the reconciliation form; 2. Compare checks, deposits, and other transactions listed on the statement with the books; 3. List, in the space provided on the reconciliation form, all outstanding checks; 4. Add any deposits made by the end of the period not posted to the bank statement; 5. Make any other necessary adjustments; and 6. Total the amounts in 1., 2., 3., 4., and 5. to arrive at the adjusted bank balance. STEP THREE 1. Compare the amounts arrived at in Steps One and Two; and 2. If they do not agree, investig ate and resolve any differences. STEP FOUR 1. Sign and date the reconciliation; and 2. Submit the bank statement and reconcil iation to appropriate personnel for review and approval. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 107 B.

The goals concerning these jail time credits are to establish a clear cut audit trail, and to properly apply and account for the credits. Refer to Page 191 of this manual for detailed information on jail time credit, including what constitutes a \"period of time\" for credit purposes and historical credit amounts. Basic Procedures 1. Jail Time Credit Clerk a. Receive jail time credit forms from the jail. These forms should be received daily. There should be a form from the jail showing the time the defendant was placed in jail and the time the defendant was released from jail. The form should be signed or initialed by the appropriate individual at the ja il showing the date and time the defendant was placed in jail. The form should also be signed or initialed by the appropriate individual at the jail showing the date and time the defendant was released from jail ; b. Verify there is appropriate documentation for the defendant to spend time in jail (e.g., an order\u2014judgment\u2014signed by the judge); c. Determine the amount of cr edit that the defendant should receive. Calculate th e credit amount based on the periods of time spent in jail multiplied by the judge's rate of credit (minimum of $50 per period of time\u2014eight to 24 hours); and indicate the correct amount of credit on the jail time credit form. d. Forward the jail time credit forms to the accounting department for bookkeeping entries; and e. Retain a copy of the forms. 2. Accounting Department a. Receive the jail time credit forms from the jail time credit clerk; b. Verify that the amount of credit shown on the form is the correct amount; and c. Make appropriate bookkeeping entries and file paperwork. (In courts with automated systems, credits are usually posted to the computer as non-cash transactions, but automated courts should check with their softwar e provider to verify how to account for jail time credit transactions.) Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 110 7.5 Community Service Credits Some defendants satisfy part or all of what they owe by performing community service. The goals concerning these community service credits are to establish a clear cut audit tr ail, and to properly apply a nd account for the credits. Refer to Page 193 of this manual for detailed information on community service credit including how to handle cases where a defendant starts performing community service and then decides to pay and what to do when a community service order is not complied with. Basic Procedures 1. General a. Give the defendant a copy of the court order or other appropriate paperwork that indicates the specifics about the required community service (i.e., entity or organization name and location, number of hours to be worked, when they must be completed by, etc.); b. Send written notification to the entity or organization about the community service requirement, as well as a form to complete concerning the defendant's community service. The written notification and form can be comb ined into one form. The form should provide space for the entity or organization to indicate whether the work was performed as specified by the judge's order. The entity or organi zation should specifically indicate when and how many hours the defendant worked. The form should also provide space for the entity or organization to enter any additional comments they feel are warranted. The form should be signed and dated by an appropriate representative of the entity or organization; and c. Forward a copy of the court or der or other appropriate paperwork to the accounting department. 2. Community Service Credit Clerk a. Receive community service cr edit forms from the entity or organization. b. Determine the amount of cr edit that the defendant should receive. Calculate the credit amount based on the numbers of hours worked multiplied by the judge's rate of credit (minimum of $6.25 per hour), and indicate th e correct amount of credit on the community service credit form; d. Forward the community service credit forms to the accounting department for bookkeeping entries; and Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 111 e. Retain a copy of the forms. 3. Accounting Department d. Receive copies of the court orders or other appropriate paperwork; e. Receive the community service cr edit forms from the community service credit clerk; f. Verify that the amount of credit shown on the form is the correct amount; and g. Make appropriate bookkeeping entries and file paperwork. (In courts with automated systems, credits are usually posted to the computer as non-cash transactions, but automated courts should check with their softwar e provider to verify how to account for community serv ice credit transactions.) 7.6 Monthly Reporting To the Office of Court Administration Government Code, Section 71.035(b) requi res courts to report information as required by the Texas Judicial Counc il. In Texas Administrative Code, Sections 171.1 and 171.2, the Council requ ires monthly activity reports by the 20 th of each month after the month the statistics are being reported for. Reports can be: (1) submitted on forms provided by the Texas Judicial Council; (2) generated from a case management system as long as the report is an exact replica of the form provided by the Texas Judicial Council; or (3) entered directly into the trial court activity database at http://data.courts.state.tx.us/OCA/secure/login.aspx . Detailed report instructions can be found at http://www.courts.state.tx.us/oca/required.asp . Important Note : The \"Total Revenue\" amount required on the report includes the total amount collected by th e court during the month regardless of when the case was disposed of. The am ount includes money colle cted both for the city and the state. However, it does not in clude amounts retained by a collections agency for service fees authorized under C ode of Criminal Procedure, Article 103.0031. To the City A report should be prepared at th e end of each month summarizing and highlighting the court's operations for the month. The information to be included in the report should be selected after consultation w ith the governing body, finance director, and city manager. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 112 For example, one council member may be interested in the court's backlog, another council member may be interested in juvenile statistics, and another council member may only be interested in the revenue amount for the month. The goal is to include the relevant and requested information, but to do so in a way that is easy to read and understa nd. Too much information reduces the likelihood that the information will be l ooked at. Remember, the municipal court is just one department, a nd the governing body, finance di rector, and city manager look at information from other departments as well. If possible, keep the report to just one or two pages. Additional information can always be provided if requested. It is also a good idea to incl ude a cover memo (maximum of one page and in a larger font size if space permits) identifying or summarizing the main points you want to get across. Try to va ry (to the extent possible) what is included in the cover memo from m onth to month so it does not become repetitive. For caseload and financial information, try to include comparable information from the same month last ye ar as a comparison. An example report starts on Page 113. Information to be incl uded on a report will vary from city to city. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 113 City of Moderate Growth Memorandum TO: City Council; City Manager; and Finance Director FROM: Court Administrator REF: Municipal Court Report for March 2007 DATE: April 6, 2007 Attached is the monthly report for March 2007. Please note the following: 1. Although our disposition rate (93.2%) was higher than the same month last year (91.8%), our backlog continues to increase (from 2,748 cases at the end of March 2005 to 3,552 cases at the end of March 2007). (Note: If the part-time judge and part-time clerk positions being requested in next year's budget ar e funded, we should be able to increase our disposition rate to o ver 100 percent and eliminate most of the backlog by the end of the next fiscal year.) 2. Collections continue to improve. Total collections increased 25 percent compared to the same month last year (from $100,000 to $125,000). The City's share also increased 25 pe rcent (from $66,667 to $83,333). We are becoming more effective collectors. Collections per case disposed were approximately $16 higher even though there has been no change in our standard fine schedule. 3. Our increased collection effectiveness is also reflected in the percent of budgeted revenue collected year-to-date. With one-half of the year completed, 58 percent of budgeted revenue has been received, compared to 52 percent at this time last year. 4. The community-wide focus on juveniles appears to be paying off. The number of juvenile cases filed this Ma rch was the lowest total for the month of March since 2002. Please let me know if you have any ques tions or need additional information.

Although others in the city (e.g., finance director and budget officer) monitor the budgets of the various departments, including the municipal court budget, they are not as familiar with the court budget and court operations as the court administrator. For example, a new legislative requirement might increase or decrease revenues or increase expenditures. A nother example might be a court employee who is going to be out on extended medical leave for several months. The court administrator is much more likely to understand the impact these changes would have on the budget and operations. Most courts receive (or should receiv e) a monthly print-out that shows budget and other financial information for the court. The information provided should include, for each budget line-item, budgeted amounts and amounts received or expended. An example of pa rt of a monthly report is shown on Page 116. The example is for the Municipa l Court Building Security Fund. A complete monthly budget report for the municipal court would include similar type information for all municipal c ourt-related funds (e.g., Municipal Court Technology Fund, Child Safety Fund, and General Fund). Monitoring the budget includes: 1. Reviewing revenues to determine if it appears the amount(s) budgeted for the year will be received. If it appears that the amount(s) will not be received, appropriate personnel (e.g., budget officer, finance director) in the city should be notified. If possible, determine what you think the revised amount(s) should be and include that with your notif ication. Prompt notification is important because the city may need to amend the budget. Appropriate city perso nnel should also be notif ied if it appears that substantially more than the amou nt(s) budgeted will be received. If possible, determine what you think the revised amount(s) should be and include that with your notification. He re again, the city may want to amend the budget. Much higher than anticipated revenue s could mean increased funding for the court or another department or program. 2. Reviewing expenditures to determin e if it appears the amount(s) budgeted for the year will be sufficient. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 116 If it appears that the am ount(s) will not be sufficient, appropriate personnel (e.g., budget officer, finance director) in the city should be notified. If possible, determine what you think the revised amount(s) should be and include that with your notif ication. Prompt notification is important because the city may need to amend the budget to increase overall expenditures for the court. In some cities, there is little chan ce of increasing overall spending in the court once the budget is set. If that is the case, changes will need to be made to ensure that the appropriated amount s are not exceeded. This could still require a budget amendment (depending upon at what level the city amends the budget). The sooner an expenditure problem is identified, the sooner (and often easier) it can be remedied. For example, assume the budget year for a court is half over and at th e current rate of spending, budgeted expenditures will be exceeded by $18,000 for the year. If changes are made beginning in month seven of the budget year, spending would need to be reduced an average of $3,000 per month not to exceed the budgeted total for the year. However, if changes are not made until month ten of the budget year, then spending would need to be reduced an average of $6,000 per month not to exceed the budgeted total for the year.

Auditing Defined Auditing is the examination of information and operations for mathematical accuracy, legality, and proprie ty. It is a process for determining whether all transactions are properly recorded in th e accounts and appropriately reflected in statements and reports. B. Objectives of Auditing The broad purpose of auditing in munici pal courts is to help ensure the integrity of the court's financial operations. Specific objectives are to help ensure that: \u00be The court has collected all the money they are supposed to; \u00be Money collected was properly remitted to the appropriate party(ies); \u00be Property is properly managed; \u00be Money and other property is properly accounted for, properly reported, and adequately safeguarded; and \u00be Operations conform to laws, rule s, and prescribed procedures. Auditing cannot guarantee that collect ions, records, and reports are 100 percent correct. Auditing can, however, be a means for minimizing and providing for early detection and co rrection of material mist akes and irregularities. C. Auditing Requirement State law requires that a city be au dited annually and a financial statement prepared based on the audit (Local Government Code, Section 103.001). Although the law provides that the aud it can be done by someone employed by the city (Local Governme nt Code, Section 103.002), it is recommended that the audit be done by an independent certified public accountant. The law does not require internal audits of the municipal court in a city. D. Types of Audits 1. State Audits The Comptroller of Public Accounts is responsible for administering state court cost and fee laws. That responsibi lity includes audit authority to examine a Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 118 city's books and records to en sure that correct state c ourt cost and fee amounts are properly assessed, collected, reported, and remitted. A state audit can result from one or more of the following: \u00be Random selection; \u00be Predetermined selection (meeting certain selection criteria); \u00be Request from the city to be audited; or \u00be Taxpayer complaint. However, a taxpayer complaint or request from the city does not automatically result in an audit. A state auditor meets with the city before the audit starts to explain the process. Several factors can impact how long the audit takes. Those factors include city size, condition and volume of records, and the availability of computer records. At the conclusion of th e on-site part of the audit, the auditor meets with the city to summarize the results and estimate any balance owed or refund amount. The city is notified of the final audit results af ter the audit report goes through the Comptroller's internal re view process. Refunds are made when the audit shows the city overp aid. However, the city is sent a bill if they underpaid. The city can a ppeal if they disagree with the results. The audit usually covers a four-year period. Common mistakes found by auditors th at result in cities being billed include: \u00be Allocating wrong amounts to court costs and fees; \u00be Failing to properly implemen t legislative changes; \u00be Failing to assess court costs and fees wh en they should have been assessed; and \u00be Improperly waiving court costs and fees. 2. Local Audits In addition to a possible state audit, cities should ensure that municipal courts are audited locally. That would include both internal and external (or outside) audits. Most cities have an annual external (outside) audit by an independent certified public accountant. The external auditor's main focus is to satisfy themselves that the city's financial st atements are reasonable and presented in conformity with generally accepted account ing principles. As a result, these external audits should not be expected to and normally do not devote as much audit attention to the municipal court as is needed. That is where internal auditing helps. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 119 An internal audit is an audit done by someone who works for the city. Internal auditors can devote more time and effort to the municipal court. A good internal audit functi on can result in lower operating co sts, more efficient ways of getting things done, better service to th e public, and less costly outside audits. At least quarterly, some sort of inte rnal audit work should be done relating to court operations. Some cities have a regular internal audit department or an individual from a department other th an the municipal court designated to perform that function. Most cities do not. However, in some cases, someone from the finance department or treasur er's office could periodically do some internal audit work in the court. If ther e is not any type of internal audit function in the city, someone from the municipal court should periodically do some audit work related to the court's operations. Even in cities with an internal audit function the municipal court may want to also do some audit work, possibly so things get looked at more often, or in more detail. Some of the audit work that should be done in a munici pal court includes: \u00be Conducting surprise cash counts; bank reconciliations; \u00be Accounting for all receipts; \u00be Auditing receipts for proper amount co llected, proper deposit/remittance, and correct bookkeeping; \u00be Confirming amounts paid (or the f act that nothing was paid) with defendants; and \u00be Reviewing reports. All of the above does not have to be done each quarter. But some of it should be. The mere fact that some aud it work is periodically and consistently done is a deterrent to wrongdoing. E. Areas to Check Starting on Page 120, information on how to check different aspects of municipal court financial ma nagement is presented. The information is being presented in a way that the areas can be checked by someone from the municipal court. Areas included are: \u00be 120 \u00be Confirmations; \u00be Surprise cash counts; Flow and composition of funds; and \u00be Fraud red flags. 8.2 Property All municipal court property should be physically observed and counted at least once a year. This is almost always done by some one outside the court. However, each court should have an up-to-date copy of the property inventory record prepared for the court and the cour t can use that invent ory record to help make sure they are ready for a property audit by following the steps below. Property inventory records are almost always prepared and maintained by the office responsible for the accounting function in the city, such as the Finance Department. That department has the c ity-wide information necessary to properly account for property (i.e., purch ases, disposals, transfers, trade-ins, depreciation, account numbers, etc.) The ory should include the following: \u00be Inventory/asset number; \u00be serial number; and \u00be Asset location. Other information may also be incl uded on the form, such as account coding, depreciation, and estimated useful life information. Steps 1. Obtain an up-to-date copy of the pr operty inventory record for the court. 2. Verify the existence and location fo r all property shown on the inventory, checking the inventory/asset number, desc ription of the asset, asset serial number, and asset location. Investigate for any property listed that cannot be located. Pay special attention to unrecorded transfers to another city office/department or unrecorded disposal s or trade-ins of property. Locate any supporting documentation. 3. Search for the existence of property not shown on the inventory. List any found. Pay special attention to unreco rded purchases or transfers from another city office/department. Locate the supporting documentation for the property. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 121 4. If applicable, determine location and reason for property out for repairs and maintenance or use by an employee (e.g., laptop computer). Based on judgment, consider: \u00be Obtaining written confirmation from service provider as to existence, work being done, and inventory/asset number, description of the asset, and asset serial number; or \u00be Going to location of asset to physically verify existence of the property, checking the inventory/asset number, description of the asset, and asset serial number. 5. Note condition of the property. Investigate abnormal deterioration, usage, or other factors implying misuse. 6. Check to ensure property is being utilized. Note any unutilized or underutilized property. 7. Update the court copy of the inventory record to keep until an updated one is received from the city. 8. Initiate any necessary property and accounting record changes. 9. Notify appropriate city personnel of any missing property or other significant items of interest (e.g., unu tilized or underutilized property). Note: If your city does not maintain an inventory record by department, your court may want to consider preparing a simplified version just for control (not accounting) purposes. Pick a date (usually the last day of a month works best) and simply list all major assets, asset desc riptions, serial numbers if available, and asset locations. Please note that if your city does not keep an inventory, it will be unlikely for an a sset to have an inventory/asset number. Update the inventory record as assets are added or de leted. Save the updates so there will be an audit trail. The inventory record can usually be maintained on an Excel spreadsheet or manually on index cards. A simplified example format for control purposes is shown below. Municipal Court Inventory As of September 30, 2007 Description Serial Number Location / Responsibility Dell Dimensions 5150 computer - acquired June 15, 2005 for $1,299.00 HF4WX-381 Assigned to Cathy Cashier HP Laser Jet 1320 printer - acquired July 15, 2006 for $999.00 493-JRT Collections Section Xerox Fax Machine F116 - acquired September 1, 2006 for $1,050.00 SFS2390001 Administration Section Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 122 8.3 Computer Security Computer security awareness is a must in today's automated environment. Internal control is important in automated court operations just like it is in manual court operations. The internal control system in an automated environment should: \u00be Minimize the possibilities for e rrors and misuse of funds; \u00be Provide a clear audit trail (show who did what and when they did it); and \u00be Provide for earlier detection of errors and/or irregularities than would otherwise be the case. Everyone in the municipal court should take the responsibility of computer security and controls seriously. Unfo rtunately, it is an area that is often overlooked because of the other demanding day-in and day-out responsibilities that have to be fulfilled. The security needs of a particular court will vary from city to city based on the type of system, software, and city requirements. However, there are some basics that promote sound financial manage ment that apply to just about every system. Steps 1. Obtain a copy of the written policies and procedures relating to computer security, controls, and use. 2. Check to see if each employee has si gned a statement indicating that they have read, understand, and agree to follow the policies and procedures. Correct the situation for employees for which there is not a signed statement. 3. Check to see if the policies and procedures cover: \u00be Who is responsible for what and how; \u00be Who has access to what (both physi cal access and computer access); \u00be How that access is controlled; and \u00be How passwords are to be used. This would include basics such as lo cking the computer or signing off the computer when leaving the workstation so someone else cannot make unauthorized entries It would also include setting up a multi -level access structure to only allow access and the ability to make changes to those authorized to do so (e.g., supervisory access for case corrections when needed). Additionally, there should be an audit trail show ing who did what and when. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 123 4. Check with appropriate city personnel (if not ha ndled by the court) to determine if passwords were changed timely and are appropriate. Passwords should: \u00be Be changed periodically (several times a year); \u00be Not include personal information, such as a family member's or pet's name; \u00be Have a minimum length of seven to eight characters; \u00be Contain a combination of numbers, symbols, and upper/lower case letters; and \u00be Not be used for multiple purposes (e.g., at home and work). 5. Through interviews, observation, and reviewing any applicable reports, determine if: \u00be Access restrictions are being followed; \u00be Passwords are not easily accessible; \u00be Logging off and locking are occurrin g when they are supposed to; and \u00be Computers are not being shared without the cu rrent user logging off and the new user logging on. 6. Correct any problems. 8.4 Analytical Review Analytical review is a process of re viewing information about the municipal court's operations to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships, changes, or fluctuations. Analytical review can iden tify possible problem areas that might be missed using more traditional audit procedur es. It is a way of looking at the big picture without getting lost in the details. For exampl e, analytical review would look to see if the numbers, relationships of numbers, a nd results look like they should, and if they do not, try to determine why. Steps 1. Determine what information, relationshi ps, and time period(s) to include in the review. For example: \u00be The time period to compare might be the current fiscal year-to-date with the same period last fiscal year; \u00be Numbers to compare might be cases disposed, disposition rate, total collections, collections per case di sposed, and estimated collection rate; and \u00be Relationships to compare might be the ratio of the state traffic fine collections to the local traffic court cost collections and city revenue as a percent of total collections. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 124 (Since the state traffic fine and loca l traffic court costs are charged in the same cases, the ratio should be consistent from period to period. A change could indicate improper as sessments. Additionally, if city revenue as a percent of total coll ections is decreas ing, it would be beneficial to determine why.) 2. Obtain the information. 3. Perform the review. If the numbers, relationships, or results are not what would be expected, find out why. For example, \u00be If the ratio of state tra ffic fine collections to local traffic court cost collections is eight to one (8:1) th ere is probably a problem. The ratio should be approximately ten to one (10: 1) since the state traffic fine is $30 and the local traffic court cost is $3 and they both apply on the same cases. Further investigation mi ght reveal that there is a set of offenses that the state traffic fine is not being assessed when it should be. \u00be If the percentage of city revenue to total collections is 60 percent compared to 70 percent for the same time period last fiscal year, there should be an explanation. It could be something as simple as the state adding new mandated court costs a nd total assessments for those offenses staying the same. In other words, the city fine amount is being reduced. Reducing the fine is something the judge(s) can do, but they may not be aware of what is happening. 4. Correct any problems th at can be corrected. 8.5 Citations Docketed It is important to make sure that all cases that are supposed to be set up are in fact set up. This may require th e cooperation of the police department. Steps 1. Obtain a complete list ing of citations issued. (How this listing is obtained will vary from city to city. In cities that use ticket writers, the court will have a list of citations. In some cities that do not use ticket writers, the police department maintains the ticket books and a complete listing of citations will have to be obtained from the police department. In other cities that do not use ticket writers, the court maintains the ticket books and will have a listing of citations issued. In courts that maintain and issue the ticket books, completed books should be received back from officers before th ey are issued a new one. All tickets must be accounted for, in cluding \"voids\" and \"warnings.\" Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 125 2. Select a sample of citations. Depe nding on how the citations are sequenced, try to make sure citations from each officer are included in the sample. 3. Trace the citations to the court docket. Verify the citations were entered. Verify the offenses entered are correct. 4. Correct any problems. 8.6 Hardcopy Receipts Even if computer-generat ed receipts are used, hard copy receipts are needed for those instances when the comput er goes down. Using chronologically numbered and controlled rece ipts is a significant com ponent of a sound system of receiving payments. All hardcopy receipts, both issued and unissued, need to be periodically accounted for. Additionall y, the process for ordering and receiving the receipts needs to be sound. Steps 1. Through observation and interviews, de termine the process for ordering, receiving, distributing, and securing receipts. 2. Make sure the process includes the following: \u00be Receipts are ordered centrally by the city (not by the municipal court); \u00be When received by the court, recei pts are counted, inspected, and signed for as to what is received; \u00be When received by individual clerks, receipts are counted, inspected, and signed for as to what is received; and \u00be All receipts (both assigned and unassi gned) are kept secu re at all times with accountability pinpointed. 3. Verify that the receipts display the name of the city and \"Municipal Court.\" Generic receipts should not be used. 4. Verify that receipts are three-part receipts (one part for the person making the payment, one part for the court, and one part for the city auditor or city treasurer.) (When a hardcopy receipt is issued bec ause the computer is down or there is some other reason why a computer-generated receipt cannot be issued at the time of payment, most courts ente r the payment on the computer later with a computer-generated receipt being issued then. In most cases like this the computer will generate two receipt copies. One copy should be attached to the court's copy of the hardcopy receipt issued to the defendant.) Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 126 5. Verify that a Hardcopy Receipt Log is being maintained, is up-to-date, and is correct. 6. Account for all receipts, both issued and unissued. There should be no gaps in the numbers. 7. Correct any problems. 8.7 Receipts General Checking receipts to make sure they are correct is an integral part of a sound financial management system in municipal courts. All appropriate information must be included, the amounts must be co rrect, and the amounts must agree with what is shown on other records. Steps 1. Using a cutoff of pre-numbered receipts at the end of the period of the last review and at the end of the current period under review, determine the number of receipts issued. 2. Select a sample of receipts to be examined. Consider a minimum of 25 receipts even if the population of receipt s is small and the review period is a month. Consider a minimum of 50 r eceipts even if the population of receipts is small and the review period is a three-month period. This is not a statistical sample like an external auditor would use. There are numerous ways to select th e sample. An easy method is to divide the total population of r eceipts by the number of receipts needed in the sample and then select every \"nth\" (i.e., a specific number selected at random, such as 5, 10, 12, 25, etc.) receipt until the total number is received. For example, if there are 500 receipts in the population and a sample of 50 receipts is needed, select every 10 th receipt starting w ith a random number, such as three. So the sample would be as follows: 3rd receipt, 13th receipt, 23rd receipt, 33rd receipt, etc. Additionally, try to make sure the samp le includes some receipts from each clerk. 3. Examine the receipts to determin e if they contain the following: \u00be Date; \u00be Reference number (e.g., the money was received from; \u00be Method of payment (e.g., cash, check, money order, credit card in person, telephone payment, internet payment); Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 127 \u00be Indication of whether the paymen t is a full or partial payment; \u00be Total amount received; \u00be What the money was received for; and \u00be Signature or initials of the i ndividual who prepared the receipt. 4. Verify that any voided receipts are clearly marked \"VOID\" and all copies are accounted for. 5. Examine the receipts to determine the math is correct. 6. Examine the receipts to determine that court costs, fees, and fines are correct for the offenses and the date they o ccurred. Pay special attention to the following: \u00be State traffic fines; \u00be Time payment fees; \u00be Safety seat system and safety belt offense fines; \u00be Overweight offense (over 5,000 pounds) fines; \u00be Excess highway fines; \u00be Allocation and pro-ration; and \u00be Deferred disposition cases. 7. Examine the receipts to determine th at court cost, fee, and fine amounts agree with the judgment. 8. Examine the receipts to determine th at court cost, fee, and fine amounts agree with the accounting records. 9. Correct any problems. 8.8 Credits Jail time and community service credits need to be applie d correctly. Those who are supposed to receive credit should receive credit. Outstanding assessments that are to be satisfied by cr edits should not slip through the cracks. Additionally, the area of credits is subject to manipulation because payments can actually be received with th e records reflecting that only credits were applied. Steps 1. Identify cases where credits were app lied. If there are a lot of cases with credits, select a sample. 2. Examine case documentation to determine: \u00be Credits were properly authorized; Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 128 \u00be Credits were actually earned (e.g., by looking at jail time credit forms from the jail); \u00be Credit amounts were calculated properly; \u00be Credits were properly applied to court costs, fees, and fines (i.e., to fines first and court cost s and fees last); and \u00be Payments were not received for any of the amounts shown as credits. 3. Identify cases where credits are shown as outstanding (e.g., community service is to be performed at a later date). If there are a lot of cases with outstanding credits, select a sample. 4. Examine case documentation to determine: \u00be Credit amounts are in fact outstanding; and \u00be Payment was not received for any amount shown as outstanding. 5. Correct any problems. 8.9 Confirmations A good audit procedure often overlooke d in municipal courts is doing confirmations. Confirmations are also a great deterrent to wrongdoing, especially if employees know they are being done. There are two basic types of confirmations - negative confirmations and positive confirmations. Negative confirmations only require a re sponse if the information trying to be confirmed is incorrect. For example, a confirmation letter sent to defendant Sam Speed might read: Our records indicate you received deferred disposition for the offense of speeding (case number 06-1493) and paid the court a total of $198.00 on May 3, 2006. If that is NOT CORREC T, please contact Rhonda Right at (512) 111-2222 or P.O. Box 3333, Hometown, Texas 44721. Since negative confirmations require no response if the information is correct, no response is considered a good response. However, negative confirmations are generally only effective if a large percentage of the cases being audited is sent confirmations. Positive confirmations require a response whether the information trying to be confirmed is correct or incorrect. Fo r example a letter sent to defendant Sam Speed might read: Our records indicate you received deferred disposition for the offense of speeding (case number 06-1493) and paid the court a total of $198.00 on May 3, 2006. If that is CORRECT, please sign Part A below. If that is NOT Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 129 CORRECT, please sign Part B below and provide us the information according to your records. After signing, please retu rn this form to Rhonda Right at P.O. Box 3333, Hometown, Texas 44721. A postage-paid, self-addressed envelope is enclosed for your convenience. If you have any questions, please contact me at (512) 111-2222. Confirmations should also be used to confirm cases shown as dismissed with no payment being made, cases show n as dismissed with only $10.00 being paid, cases shown with part or all of th e amount assessed being satisfied by credit (i.e. jail-time or community service) , and cases showing amounts still due. Positive confirmations are generally more appropriate for a municipal court to use for self review. Steps 1. Determine the type and number of cas es for possible review. For example, the number of cases coul d include all cases dis posed during the review period and all cases outstanding at the end of the review period. 2. Select a sample(s) of cases for c onfirmation. If both disposed and outstanding cases are to be confirme d, two samples will be needed. This is not a statistical sample li ke an external auditor would use. Use judgment to determine the size of the sample, but try to make sure the sample includes a mix of cases showing a payment being made, cases showing no payment being made, cases where a credit is indicated, and outstanding cases. 3. Prepare and mail the letters. 4. Receive responses. Consider a follow -up mailing if the response rate is too low. 5. Analyze responses. Inves tigate any discrepancies. 6. Correct any problems. 8.10 Surprise Cash Counts Cash counts should be made on a surprise basis at irregular intervals. Often, but not always, a good time for a cash count is when the clerk(s) balances out at the end of the day. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 130 Steps 1. Select the drawer(s) or fund(s) to be counted. If the office is small and there are only one, two, or three drawers/funds, tr y to count all of them. In larger offices with numerous cashiers, be random and irregular in the drawers/funds selected. For example, in a large court, if employee A's fund is counted in March, that employee should not feel that they could not be selected again for at least a year. 2. Count the cash in the drawer or f und. Use a cash count and reconciliation form to record your results. An example form is shown on Page 77. Never allow the custodian of the drawer/f und being counted to leave you alone with the cash during the count. 3. Using the receipts (or tapes or computer printout), add up how much should have been received, according to th e receipts/tapes/printout. Enter the results on the form. 4. Enter on the form the amount of cash th at should be in the drawer/fund for making change. 5. From the total monies counted, s ubtract the total receipts per the receipts/tapes/printout (S tep 3), and the authorized change fund (Step 4). 6. The answer should be zero. If it is not, recheck the entries and math on the form. If they are correct, the problem is probably in the receipts. Find the problem. 7. Account for all the receipt numbers. Additionally, if manual, hardcopy receipts are used, examine the unused ones and make sure all that are supposed to be there are in f act there, in unbroken series. 8. Examine all receipts that are voided. All copies of the receipts should be there and should be marked \"void.\" 9. Examine the fund for inappropriate items , such as IOU's, checks from city employees, or checks or money orders da ted prior to the da te they should be included in this day's transactions. Investigate any inappropriate items found. 10. Have the custodian sign the form. 11. If all the drawers/funds in the cour t were counted, trace the amount to the remittance to the treasurer or the de posit to the bank statement (when it arrives). 12. Correct any problems. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 131 8.11 Bank Reconciliation Review Procedures for a bank reconcilia tion, along with a sample format and example start on Page 107. Bank reconcilia tion is being included again here as a review procedure. Review and approva l of bank reconciliations should be a standard operating procedur e as recommended on Page 106. Steps 1. Obtain the most recently completed bank reconciliation(s). 2. Determine if the reconciliation( s) was done timely. If possible, reconciliations should be done within three days of receipt. 3. Review the reconciliation(s). The procedure on Page 106 can be followed. 4. Investigate any unusual items (e.g., disbursements to unusual parties, unusual or suspicious endorsement s, or signs of alteration). 5. Compare deposits made as shown by th e bank statement with a specific day's receipts. Pay special attentio n to outstanding items and deposits in transit. Investigate anything unusual. 6. Correct any problems. 8.12 Flow and Comp osition of Funds It is important to make sure that th e amounts shown as daily receipts are the same amounts deposited/remitted and refl ected in the accounting records and reports. In addition, the composition (i .e., how much is cash, how much is checks, how much is money orders, etc.) of deposits/remittances should be consistent with what is shown on the daily balancing out forms. Steps 1. Obtain the daily balancing out form s and the deposit/remittance records for the review period. 2. Compare submitted deposit/remittance records with validated deposit/remittance records to make sure they are the same. Investigate any discrepancies. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 132 3. Compare the balancing out forms with the deposit/remittance records for the same days to make sure they are the same. If the amounts should be different, reconcile the difference. Investigate any discrepancies. 4. Compare the composition shown on th e balancing out forms with the composition shown on the deposit/remittance records to make sure they are the same. If the amounts should be different, reconcile the difference. Investigate any discrepancies. 5. Make sure the amounts shown on the balancing out forms and deposit/remittance records are accurately reflected in the accounting records and reports. Investigat e any discrepancies. 6. Correct any problems. 8.13 Fraud Red Flags Unfortunately, fraud does happen. In addition to the regular review procedures, an eye should be kept ou t for possible fraud. Employee fraud can seriously damage the court' s and city's reputation. Be aware that inadequate internal control increases the likelihood of fraud. A whistleblower hotline that employees can use to report wrongdoing is a good deterrent and detection tool. Steps 1. Keep an eye out for the fo llowing concerning court personnel: \u00be Personal financial trouble; \u00be alcohol, gambling Sloppy records; \u00be Anxious, upset, edgy when questioned; \u00be Wants to be in total control of financial records; \u00be Discrepancies between pro cedures and operations; \u00be Cannot supporting documentation; \u00be No, or very short, vacations; \u00be Significant or unusual delays in pr oviding requested documentation; \u00be Excessive adjustments to records; \u00be Employee or odd endorsements on checks received; and \u00be Unexplained fluctuations in cash/collections. 2. If it appears that a possible fraud(s) may have occurred, notify appropriate people in the court/city. 3. Correct any problems.

The defendant pays $200 on May 15th the other $200 on June 15th. The time payment fee would apply because part of the $400 is paid 31 days or more after the date the judgment is entered. - Example 2: Assume that a judgment is entered on June 1, 2007 with a total of $400 owed by a defendant. The defendant pays $200 on June 15th and $200 on June 29th. The time payment fee would not apply because no part of what is owed is paid 31 days or more after the date the judgment is entered.

Amount to Charge There must be documentation the service was performed by a peace officer before assessing the following fees: ARREST FEE \u00be $5 on conviction for issuing a written notic e to appear in co urt following the defendant's violation of a traffic law, municipal ordi nance, or penal law, or for making an arrest without a warrant (The arrest fee does not apply to charges initiated by a filed complaint, such as Failure to Appear - Penal Code, Section 38.10 and Violate Promise to Appear - Transportation Code, Section 543.009) ; and WARRANT FEE \u00be $50 on conviction for executing or proce ssing an issued arrest warrant, capias or capias pro fine. (Executing a warrant or capias means arresting the defendant. The law does not define \"processing.\" Each j udge must determine what he/she will consider as \"processing.\" In practi ce, \"processing\" has generally included any activity performed by a peace officer, after a warrant, capias, or capias pro fine is issued, related to the purpose the warrant, capias , or capias pro fine was issued for. For example, after a capias pro fine is issued, if a peace officer makes a telephone call to th e defendant, sends a letter to the defendant, or enters the capias in a data bank, the capias would be considered \"processed.\" Remember, this is a fee for the service of a peace officer. A court employee (that is not a peace officer) c annot generate the fee. In the example above, if a court employee (that is not a peace officer) called the defendant, sent the defendant a letter, or entered the capias in a data bank, the fee would not apply. Additionally, a warrant, capias, or capias pro fine must have a judge's signature before it is considered \"issued.\" Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 167 If the \"executing\" law enforcement agency is different than the \"processing\" law enforcement agency, the law enforcement agency that executed the arrest warrant, capias, or capias pro fine is entitled to the amount of the fee collected if they request it from the court within 15 days of the arrest. However, if they do not request it within the required time period, the fee must still be assessed and retained by the city of the law enforcement agency that processed the arre st warrant or capias. Cities that have a lot of interaction with othe r law enforcement agencies should consider meeting with those agencies and developing an efficient way to process requests and payments. Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 102.011(g) provides that \"conviction\" has the meaning assigned by Section 133.101 of the Local Government Code. Section 133.101 provides that a person is considered to have been convicted in a case if: (1) a judgment, a sentence, or both a judgment and a sentence are imposed on the person; (2) the person receives community supervision, deferred adjudication, or de ferred disposition; or (3) the court defers final disposition of the case or imposition of the judgment and sentence.) OTHER FEES Other fees that should be assessed when they apply include: \u00be $5 for summoning a witness (serving a subpoena); \u00be $35 for serving a writ not otherwise liste d in Code of Crim inal Procedure, Article 102.011 (includes a summons for a defe ndant or parent of a juvenile) ; \u00be $10 for taking and approving a bond and, if necessary, returning the bond to the courthouse; \u00be $5 for a commitment or release; \u00be $5 for summoning a jury, if a jury is summoned; \u00be Reasonable expenses for meals and l odging incurred and $.29 per mile for mileage required to perform and re turn from performing one of the following services: - conveying a prisoner after convi ction to the county jail; - conveying a prisoner arrested on a warrant or capias issued in another county to the court or ja il of the county; and - traveling to execute criminal proce ss, to summon or attach a witness, and to execute process not otherwis e described by this article; and \u00be Costs of overtime paid for time spent testifying in or traveling to or from testifying in the trial of a case. (The court should obtain a list of overtim e rates for city police officers. The list should be updated as new officers are added or the rates change. The court should consider developing a form for officers to sign indicating how much qualifying time was spent in a ca se. The overtime rate is simply multiplied by the time. When an officer 's time has to be allocated among Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 168 two or more cases, the method of alloca tion should be consistently applied. However, if a case is settled and does not go to trial, overtime cannot be charged, because the officer did not testify.) Offenses Included \u00be Conviction of all criminal offe nses, except as noted below; \u00be Conviction of offenses related to pe destrians or the parking of motor vehicles (Article 102.011 does not specifically exempt parking and pedestrian offenses as do some court cost and fee laws. However, since the arrest fee is a fee for the service of a peace officer, it does not apply to citations issued by those who are not peace officers.) ; \u00be Cases disposed of under Code of Cr iminal Procedure, Article 45.051 - Suspension of Sentence and Deferral of Final Disposition; \u00be Cases disposed of under Code of Cr iminal Procedure, Article 45.0511 - Driving Safety Course or Motorc ycle Operator C ourse Dismissal; \u00be Unless exempted by the court, cases di sposed of under Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 45.052 - Dismissal of Misdemeanor Charge on Completion of Teen Court Program; \u00be Cases where a defendant is required to attend an alcohol awareness course under Alcoholic Beverage Code, Section 106.115; \u00be Cases disposed of under Health and Safety Code, Section 161.253 - Tobacco Awareness Program; and \u00be Cases disposed of under Parks and Wildlife Code, Section 31.130 - Boater Education Course Permitted in Lieu of Fine.

Amount to Charge \u00be Not to exceed $25 per warrant if gove rning body has adopted appropriate ordinance. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 169 [Issuance and service (execution) of the warrant causes the fee to be due. The fee would not be due if a warrant is merely processed. Also, if the city has adopted this fee, it would be in addition to the $50 warrant fee provided for in Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 102.011. In other words, both the $50 warrant fee and the not to exceed $25 special expense warrant fee can both apply on the same case.] Offenses Included \u00be Issuance and service of a warrant for an offense under Penal Code, Section 38.10 - Failure to Appear; and \u00be Issuance and service of a warrant fo r an offense under Tr ansportation Code, Section 543.009 - Violation of Promise to Appear.

Collections must be remitted to the city treasurer and are subject to appropriation by the city c ouncil for any legal purpose. [Peace officers who serve the warrants outside of regular work hours may not receive the warrant fee as compensation. Cities must compensate officers as they otherwise would for o vertime (see Attorney General Opinion JM-462, 1986). However, cities can us e the money generated from the fees to pay the overtime.] 11.9 Suspension of Sentence and Deferral of Final Disposition Special Expense Legal Reference \u00be Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 45.051 (see Appendix B - Page 257) .

Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 181 Chapter 12 What to Charge 12.1 Introduction A new court costs and fees chart(s) is prepared every two years to reflect legislative changes. The current chart represents changes made by the 80th Legislature and is for conviction of o ffenses committed on or after January 1, 2008. Using the Chart Basic court costs and fees are listed on the top right of the chart. The abbreviations used are: \u00be CCC - Consolidated court IDF defense fee; \u00be JRF fine; \u00be TFC - Traffic; and \u00be CS - Child Safety. Each of the basic costs and fees are al so designated as \"state\" or \"local,\" indicating whether the cost/fee is a state cost/fee or a local cost/fee. Refer to Chapters 9 and 11 of this manual for deta iled information on individual costs and fees. Notice the asterisk (*) in the far right column indicati ng that certain other fees need to be added to the total when they apply. Offense descriptions are lis ted on the left hand side of the charts. Offenses are broken down into two majo r categories: municipal or dinances and state law. Municipal ordinances are broken down into three categories. The first category is Parking authorized by Transportati on Code, Sections 542.202 - 542.203. The second category is Pedestrian. The third category, Other Municipal Offenses, is for all other municipal ordinance violations. State law violations are broken down into three categories. The first category is Parent Contributing to Nona ttendance and Failure to Attend School. The Second category covers all Rules of the Road offenses which are found in Subtitle C of Title 7 (chapters 541 - 600) in the Transportation Code. The third category, All Other Misdemeanors, is for a ll other state law violations. In other words, everything except Parent Contribu ting to Nonattendance, Failure to Attend School, and Rules of the Road offenses.

Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 188 PAGE LEFT BLANK INTENTIONALLY Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 189 Chapter 13 Special Topics 13.1 Bond Forfeitures There are two basic types of bond forf eitures. Although both arise in criminal matters, one is handled as a criminal proceeding and the other as a civil proceeding. Court costs, fees, and fine apply to the criminal bond forfeiture. In the civil bond forfeiture proceeding, criminal court costs, fees, and fine do not apply. Criminal Proceeding Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 45.044 (see Appendix B - Page 255) provides for cash bond forfeitu re. A judge may enter a judgment of conviction and forfeit a cash bond in satisfaction of the costs, fees, and fine, if the defendant: \u00be has entered a written and signed conditional plea of no contest and a waiver of jury trial, and \u00be fails to appear according to the terms of the release. The defendant must be notified in writing: \u00be that a judgment of co nviction and forfeiture of bond was entered on a specific date and the forfeiture satisfies the defendant's fine and costs, and \u00be the defendant has the right to a new tria l if applied for within 10 days from entry of the judgment. If a new trial is request ed, the court must permit th e defendant to withdraw the previously entered plea and waiver of jury trial. If a new trial is not requested, the judgment and forfeiture become final. Costs, fees, and fine are then handled as in other criminal cases. State costs and fees are reported and remitted to the state and local court costs and fees are retained locally. Remember that the defendant is automatically entitled to credit for any jail time served. Civil-Type Proceeding Code of Criminal Procedure, Chapter 22 addresses bond forfeitures that use the rules of civil procedure. Under Ch apter 22, a case is initiated against the defendant and sureties. Money forfeited st ays totally with the city. In addition, civil court costs may be assesse d after entry of the judgment [ Dees v. State, 865 S.W. 2d 461 (Tex.Crim.App. 1993)]. The would in necessary and reasonable expenses in re-arresting the de fendant and any other costs involved in the case, such as costs for service of process. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 190 Criminal case costs, fees, and fine do not apply to this type of proceeding, so criminal costs, fees, and fine must not be taken out of the forfeited money. The underlying criminal case remains pending until it is later disposed of. If payment for the underlying case is received later, th e court costs, fees, and fine are satisfied at that time. There may be times when an amount needs to be refunded to a defendant but the defendant cannot be located. For example, a defendant may have moved without leaving a forwarding address. These am ounts represent \"unclaimed property\" and must be remitted and reported to the Comptroller's office. City treasurers are responsible for remitting and re porting to the Comptroller. The Comptroller's Unclaimed Property Secti on can be contacted toll-free at 1-800- 321-2274. 13.2 Appeals Appeals from municipal court are a ddressed in the Code of Criminal Procedure, Chapters 44 and 45. Bond is re quired and is sent to the court the case is appealed to as part of the transcri pt. How court costs, fees, and fines are handled depends on whether the municipal court is a court of record or a non- record court. Record Courts If the appeals court affirms the mu nicipal court decision, the municipal court may forfeit a cash appeal bond to satisfy the fine and costs. If the appeal bond is cashed, and th e appeals court affirms the municipal court decision, the municipal court is re sponsible for assessing and collecting the court costs, fees, and fine. It is the city's responsibility to report and remit applicable amounts to the state. Local co sts, fees, and fines are retained by the city. If the appeals court reverses the municipal cour t, the municipal court is responsible for returning a ny cash bond to the defendant. Bonds are typically kept in a non-int erest bearing account separate and apart from other court collections pending the out come of the appellate court. This is because a defendant would be entitled to the appropriate share of any interest earnings if the bond is returned. Non-Record Courts Court costs, fees, and fine are hand led by the county. It is the county's responsibility to assess, colle ct, report, and remit appli cable court costs and fees to the state. Local court costs and fees are retained by the county. Cities are not entitled to any of the costs and fees. Court costs and fees will be higher because Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 191 additional local costs apply in county courts that do not apply in municipal courts. The fine is also retained by the county. Note: The bond filed by a defendant is sent to the appellate court. If a defendant files a cash appeal bond, have the defendant file a money order or cashier's check made out to the c ounty with the bond. 13.3 Jail Time Credit Jail time credit is provided for in the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 45.048 (see Appendix B - Page 256) . Article 45.048 requires that the credit be at least $50 for each period of time served, as specified by the convicting court. A convicting court may specify a period of tim e that is not less than eight hours or more than 24 hours as the period for whic h a defendant who fails to pay the fine, costs, and fees in the case must remain in jail to satisfy at least $50 of the fine, costs, and fees. It is important to remember that Article 42.03 (see Appendix B - Page 254) provides that defendants are entitle d to credit for any pre-conviction time they spend in jail. Pursuant to Ar ticle 45.041, the rate fo r any pre-conviction credit is the same (i.e. at least $50 for each period of time, as specified by the convicting court). Pre-conviction credit is concurrent. In other words, the defendant receives credit for each case where a judgment has not been entered. For example, if a defendant had three cases and spent two pe riods of time in jail at $50 per period, the defendant would be entitled to $100 cr edit on each of the three cases, for a total credit of $300. Post-conviction credit is consecutive, of ten referred to as \"stacked.\" In other words, the defendant only receive s credit for one case at a time. For example, if a defendant had three cases a nd spent two periods of time in jail at $50 per period, the defendant would only be entitled to a total of $100 credit. Court orders must contain certain information for post-conviction credit to be consecutive (i.e., case numb er, name of the court, date of conviction, sentence, and offense). Please note that the credit for jail ti me is the amount that was applicable on the date of the offense. For offenses that occurred prior to January 1, 2004 the credit for jail time was not less than $100 for each period of time served as specified in the judgment. Since Article 45.048 requires a minimum credit of $50 for each period of time, but sets no maximum amount, the cour t may give a credit in excess of that amount for each period of time served. If for some reason the court allows a larger amount, the judge should document why it was allowed. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 192 Although unlikely, it is possible for a defendant to receive jail time and community service credit for the same day. For example, assume a defendant is released from jail at 10:00 a.m., on Monday morning, and performs community service from 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. that same day. Both jail time and community service credit would apply. A defendant, however, would not be able to earn both credits at the exact same time. For example, a defendan t cannot earn jail time and community service credit during th e same four-hour period, say from 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. Jail time credit applies to the court costs, fees, and fine. If there is enough jail time, the entire amount owed is sati sfied. However, if a defendant satisfied part of the amount owed with jail time credit and pays the balance, the amount paid is credited to court co sts and fees first, and the ba lance, if any, to the fine. Refer to 13.6 Allocation and Proration for a more detailed explanation of how payments are allocated and prorated. EXAMPLES Assume a defendant is convicted of an offense that occurs in January 2006 and owes $300.00, as follows: Court costs and fees $60.00 Fine 240.00 Total owed $300.00 Example 1 : Defendant receives credit fo r six 24-hour periods at $50.00 per period. Total owed $300.00 Jail credit (6 24-hour periods @ $50 per period) 300.00 Balance owed $0.00 Example 2 : Defendant receives credit for four 16-hour periods at $50.00 per period and pays $100.00. Total owed $300.00 Jail credit (4 16-hour periods @ $50 per period) 200.00 Balance owed 100.00 Amount paid: Court costs and fees $60.00 Fine 40.00 Total 100.00 100.00 Balance owed $0.00 (The amount paid is credited to court costs and fees first, and the balance to the fine. That is, the jail time cr edit is applied to the fine first.) Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 193 Example 3 : Defendant receives credit fo r two 8-hour periods at $50.00 per period and pays $200.00. Total owed $300.00 Jail credit (2 8-hour peri ods @ $50 per period) 100.00 Balance owed 200.00 Amount paid: Court costs and fees $60.00 Fine 140.00 Total 200.00 200.00 Balance owed $0.00 (The amount paid is credited to court costs and fees first, and the balance to the fine. That is, the jail time cr edit is applied to the fine first.) 13.4 Community Service Credit Community service credit is provided for in Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 45.049(e) [see Appendix B - Page 256] . A defendant is considered to have discharged at least $50 for each eight hours of community service performed, which is equal to a minimum hourly rate of $6.25. Please note that the credit for commun ity service is the amount that was applicable on the date of the offense. Fo r offenses that occurred prior to January 1, 2004 the credit for comm unity service was $100 for each eight hours performed. As indicated in the section on jail time credit (see page 191) , it is possible for a defendant to receive community service and jail time credit for the same day. The example used was a defendant be ing released from jail at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning and performing community service from 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. that same day. Both community servic e and jail time credit would apply. A defendant, however, would not be able to earn both credits at the exact same time. For example, a defendan t cannot earn community service and jail time credit during the same four-hour period, say from 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. Community service credit applies to the court costs, fees, and fine. If there are enough community service hours worked, the entire amo unt owed is satisfied. However, if a defendant satisfies pa rt of the amount owed by performing community service and pays the balance, the amount paid is credited to court costs and fees first, and the balance, if any, to the fine. This generally occurs when a defendant starts community servi ce and then decides to pay instead of finishing the community service. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 194 There are also times when a defendan t will not comply with the court's order to perform community se rvice. In that situation the court normally issues a capias pro fine. Refer to 13.6 Allocation and Proration for a more detailed explanation of how payments are allocated and prorated. EXAMPLES Assume a defendant is convicted of an offense that occurs in January 2006 and owes $300.00, as follows: Court costs and fees $60.00 Fine 240.00 Total owed $300.00 Example 1 : Defendant performs six days of community service at $50.00 per day. Total owed $300.00 Jail credit (6 days @ $50 per day) 300.00 Balance owed $0.00 Example 2 : Defendant performs four days of community service at $50.00 per day and pays $100.00. Total owed $300.00 Jail credit (4 days @ $50 per day) 200.00 Balance owed 100.00 Amount paid: Court costs and fees $60.00 Fine 40.00 Total 100.00 100.00 Balance owed $0.00 (The amount paid is credited to court costs and fees first, and the balance to the fine. That is, the community service credit is applied to the fine first.) Example 3 : Defendant performs two days of community service at $50.00 per day and pays $200.00. Total owed $300.00 Jail credit (2 days @ $50 per day) 100.00 Balance owed 200.00 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 195 Amount paid: Court costs and fees $60.00 Fine 140.00 Total 200.00 200.00 Balance owed $0.00 (The amount paid is credited to court costs and fees first, and the balance to the fine. That is, the community service credit is applied to the fine first.) 13.5 Special Situations Municipal courts also deal with nu merous special situations, such as payments received from magistrates under Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 15.18, capias pro fine cases, and cases wh ere court costs, fees, and fines are waived for indigents under Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 43.091. Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 15.18 Payments On out of county warrants, magistrates can accept pleas, set fines, determine costs, accept payments, give credit for time served, determine indigence, and discharge defendants. This means a magistrate can handle a case financially different than your local j udge would (e.g., different fine amount or different credit amount). Article 15.18 requires amounts collected be sent to the court before the 11 th business day after the plea is accepted. It is important that amounts received be posted as promptly as possible. As in other cases, amounts received should be applied to court costs and fees first, and then to the fine. Although not required by law, magistrate s should consider contacting courts as soon as possible after accepting a plea to prevent any inappropriate action (e.g., arresting the defendant) from being taken on the case. Capias Pro Fine Cases When an adult defendant fails to satisfy the terms of a judgment, a capias pro fine may be issued. In addition to not payi ng at all, failing to satisfy the terms of a judgment would also include failu re to perform community service and paying with a check without suffi cient funds to cover the check. On cases where a capias pro fine is issued, the financ ial components of the case will change. In addition to the extra $50 fee for the service of the peace officer, new or additional credit for jail time served or community service to be performed may be applicable. Or the judge may allow the new amount owed to Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 196 satisfied by installment payments. Pr omptly updating financial components on capias pro fine cases will allow for future actions to be timely and appropriate. Waiver of Court Costs, Fees, and Fines for Indigents Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 43.091 provides that when a defendant defaults, the court may waive payment of the court costs, fees, and fine if the court determines the defendant is i ndigent and each alternative method of discharging the amount owed under Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 43.09 (e.g., community service) would impose a hardship on the defendant. An indigence hearing is needed to do this. Please note that in order to default, there must be a judgment. This means that under current law, c ourt costs, fees, and fines cannot be waived in cases where there is not a judgment (e.g., Susp ension of Sentence and Deferral of Final Disposition cases under Code of Cr iminal Procedure, Article 45.051). 13.6 Allocation and Proration Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 103.0031 (see Appendix B - Page 270) provides that a city's governing body may enter into a contract with a private attorney or a public or private vendor for the provision of coll ection services for: (1) debts and accounts receiv able such as unpaid fine s, fees, court costs, forfeited bonds (excluding commercial bail bonds), and restitution ordered paid by: (A) a court serving the city; or (B) a hearing officer serving the city under Chapter 682, Transportation Code; and (2) amounts in cases in which th e accused has failed to appear: (A) as promised under Subchapter A, Chapter 543, Transportation Code, or other law; (B) in compliance with a lawful written notice to appear issued under Article 14.06(b) or other law; (C) in compliance with a lawful summons issued under Article 15.03(b) or other law; (D) in compliance with a lawful or der of a court serving the city; or (E) as specified in a citation, summ ons, or other noti ce authorized by Section 682.002, Transportation Code, that charges the accused with a parking or stopping offense. The city's governing body may authorize the addition of a collection fee in the amount of 30 percent on each of the ite ms described in (1) and (2) above that is more than 60 days past due, and that has been referred for collection. However, the fee does not apply to a case that has b een dismissed or to any amount that has been satisfied through jail credit or community service. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 197 An item is considered mo re than 60 days past due if it remains unpaid on the 61st day after the following: \u00be with respect to items in (1) above, th e date on which the debt, fine, fee, forfeited bond, or court cost must be pa id in full as dete rmined by the court or hearing officer; or \u00be with respect to items in (2) above, the date by which the accused promised to appear or was notified, su mmoned, or ordered to appear. For cases described in (2) above, th e 30 percent collection fee applies to: \u00be the amount to be paid that is communicated to the accused as acceptable to the court under its standard policy for resolution of the case, if the accused voluntarily agrees to pay that amount; or \u00be the amount ordered paid by the court after plea or trial. If the court of original jurisdiction de termines the defendant is indigent, has insufficient resources or income, or is ot herwise unable to pay all or part of the underlying fine or costs, then the defenda nt is not liable for the collection fees. If a person pays an amount that is less th an the aggregate total owed, the allocation to the comptroller, the city, and the private attorney or vendor is reduced proportionately. Article 103.0031 also provides that the governing body of a city with a population of more than 1.9 million (i.e. th e City of Houston) may authorize the addition of collection fees for a collec tion program performed by employees of the city. The revisions made to Article 103.0031 by the 78 th Legislature, Regular Session, in Senate Bill 782 were effective June 18, 2003. That bill provides that a city may enter into a contract for collecti on services for debts incurred as a result of offenses committed before June 18, 2003, but that the collection fee does not apply to those offenses. Allocation and proration of court costs, fees, and fines collected by a private attorney or private vendor under a contra ct authorized by Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 103.0031, will be handled differently from the allocation and proration of all other collections of court costs, fees, and fines. A. Amounts Collected in General (N ot Under an Article 103.0031 Contract by a Private Attorney or Public or Private Vendor) When the full amount of court costs, fees, and fine is paid at one time, allocating the payment among the various costs, fees, and fine is pretty straightforward. However, allocation can become more difficult when multiple payments are made on the same case. Cities must ensure that state court costs and Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 198 fees are reported and remitted prope rly. To do so, they must follow the Allocation Rule. 1. Allocation Rule Allocate amounts to court costs and fees first (both state and local) and then to fines (see Attorney General Opinion GA-147, 2004). That opinion provides in part: ...allocate monies received from a defendant first to pay costs and then to pay a fine. If the m onies received do not cover all of the costs, then the monies must be allocated to costs on a pro rata basis. The Time Payment Fee is treated lik e other court costs and fees (e.g., consolidated court cost, jury reimbursement fee, judicial support fee, state traffic fine) when allocating and prorating. When the full amount owed by a defendant is not received, the Time Payment Fee ta kes precedence over fines and shares pro rata with other costs and fees. 2. Reporting and Remitting State court costs and fees are reporte d and remitted on a calendar quarter basis (see page 198) . If the full amount of costs a nd fees is paid at one time, reporting and remitting is fairly simple. They are reported and remitted on the report covering the calendar quarter during which they were collected. For example, court costs and fees collected in March would be reported on the first quarter report covering January through March. Multiple payments present more of a challenge. Assuming total court costs and fees (excluding the Time Payment Fee) for a case is $98.00, consider two examples. In example one, $50.00 is receiv ed in February an d $50.00 is received in March. Since the amount received is enough to cover all the court costs and fees (and even part of the fine), the stat e court costs and fees would be reported on the first quarter report co vering January through March. In example two, $50.00 is received in March and $50.00 is received in April. In this example, the state's shar e of the $50.00 received in March would be reported on the first quarter report coveri ng January through March and the state's share of the $50.00 received in April would be reported on the second quarter report covering April through June. 3. Common Mistakes Some cities make mistakes that resu lt in underpayments to the state, while others make mistakes that result in overpayments. Keep in mind that Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 199 underpayments (whether intentional or not), once detected, generally result in loss of the city's administrative fee. Four common mistakes made by cities in allocating a nd prorating court costs and fees are: 1) allocating payments to the fine fi rst and then to court costs and fees; 2) allocating payments to state court costs and fees first, local court costs and fees second, and then to the fine; 3) allocating payments pro rata among court costs, fees, and the fine; and 4) not remitting timely (frequently as the result of holding payments until the full amount of the court costs, fees, and fine is paid before reporting and remitting state court costs and fees). For those cities that accept installmen t payments, one way to minimize the number of mistakes is to require that the first payment at least cover all court costs and fees. This makes it easy to know for which reporting period to report the costs/fees and prevents payments from having to be prorated. 4. Examples Assume the defendant was convicted of Disorderly Conduct under Penal Code, Section 42.01, and judgment was ente red on May 10. The offense occurred in 2006. The amount owed is: \u00be $200.00 if the full amount is paid within 30 days after the date the judgment is entered ($69.00 court costs and fees and $131.00 fine). \u00be $225.00 if any part is paid on or after the 31 st day after the date the judgment is entered ($94.00 court costs and fees, which includes the $25.00 time payment fee, and $131.00 fine). Example 1 - Full Amount Paid in a Lump Sum - Upon Sentencing Defendant pays the full amount of the court costs, fees, and fine, on May 10. Allocation : $69.00 to court costs and fees, $131.00 to fine. Reporting and Remitting : State court costs and f ees are reported on the second quarter report covering the period April through June. Example 2 - Full Amount Paid in a Lump Sum - At a Later Date Defendant pays the full amount of the cour t costs, fees, and fine within 30 days, on June 8. Allocation : $69.00 to court costs and fees; $131.00 to fine. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 200 Reporting and Remitting : State court costs and f ees are reported on the second quarter report covering the period April through June. Example 3 - Full Amount Paid in Inst allments (All in the Same Quarter) Defendant pays the full amount of the court costs, fees, and fine in two installments, $112.50 on May 20 and $112.50 on June 20. Since part of what is owed is paid on or after the 31 st day after the date the judgment is entered, the $25.00 Time Payment Fee is added. Allocation : May 20: $112.50 received ($69.00 appl ied to court costs and fees; $43.50 applied to the fine). June 20: $112.50 received ($25.00 applied to court costs and fees; $87.50 applied to fine). Reporting and Remitting : State court costs and f ees are reported on the second quarter report covering the period April through June. Example 4 - Full Amount Paid in Installments (In Different Quarters) Defendant pays the full amount of the c ourt costs, fees, and fine in six $37.50 installments, on the tenth of each month, beginning June 10. Since part of what is owed is paid on or after the 31st day after the date the judgment is entered, the $25.00 Time Payment Fee is added. Allocation : June 10: $37.50 received ($37.50 applied to court costs and fees; $0.00 applied to fine). July 10: $37.50 received ($37.50 a pplied to court costs and $0.00 applied to fine). August 10: $37.50 received ($19.00 a pplied to court costs and fees; $18.50 applied to fine). September 10: $37.50 received (applied to fine). October 10: $37.50 received (applied to fine). November 10: $37.50 received (applied to fine). Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 201 Reporting and Remitting : The part paid in June is reported on the second quarter report covering the period April through June and the part paid in July and August is reported on the third qu arter report coveri ng the period July through September. The allocations would be determined as follows: STATE CRIMINAL COSTS AND FEES - CITY QUARTERLY REPORT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER - APRIL THROUGH JUNE amount collected = percentage to apply total costs/fees to each cost/fee 37.50 = 39.89% to 2.00 IDF = x 1.60 9.97 39.89% x 94.00 = 37.50 STATE CRIMINAL COSTS AND FEES - CITY QUARTERLY REPORT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER - JULY THROUGH SEPTEMBER Simply take the total amount fo r each fee and subtract the amount previously reported as follows: CCC (40.00 - 15.96) = 24.04 JRF (4.00 - 1.60) = 2.40 JSF (6.00 - 2.39) = 3.61 IDF (2.00 - 0.80) = 1.20 MCBS (3.00 - 1.20) = 1.80 MCT (4.00 - 1.60) = 2.40 JCM (5.00 - 1.99) 3.01 AF (5.00 3.01 TPF (25.00 - 9.97) = 15.03 Total (94.00 - 37.50) = 56.50 Example 5 - Full Amount Not Paid - One Payment Made (Costs and Fees Satisfied) Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 202 The only payment ever made by the defendant is $100.00 on May 10. Since no part of what is owed is paid on or after the 31 st day after the date the judgment is entered, the Time Payment Fee is not added. Allocation : $69.00 to court costs and fees; $31.00 to fine. Reporting and Remitting : State court costs and f ees are reported on the second quarter report covering the period April through June. Example 6 - Full Amount Not Paid - One Payment Made (Costs and Fees Not Satisfied) The only payment ever made by the de fendant is $25.00 on May 10. Since no part of what is owed is paid on or after the 31st day after the date the judgment is entered, the Time Payment Fee is not added. Allocation : $25.00 to court costs and fees; $0.00 to fine. Reporting and Remitting : State court costs and f ees are reported on the second quarter report covering the period April through June. Proration : Since the full amount of court costs and fees was not collected, prorate the $25.00 among all the court costs and fees using the following formula: amount collected = percentage to apply total costs/fees to each cost/fee 25.00 = 36.23% 2.00 IDF = x 4.00 = 1.45 36.23% x 5.00 JCM = 1.81 36.23% x 5.00 AF = 1.81 36.23% x 69.00 = 25.00 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 203 Example 7 - Full Amount Not Paid - Multiple Payments Made (Costs and Fees Satisfied) Defendant makes two installments , $50.00 on May 15 and $50.00 on June 15. Since part of what is owed is paid on or after the 31st day after the date the judgment is entered, the $25.00 Time Payment Fee is added. Allocation : May 15: $50.00 received ($50.00 applie d to court costs and $0.00 applied to fine). June 15: $50.00 received ($44.00 applied to court costs and fees; $6.00 applied to fine). Reporting and Remitting : State court costs and f ees are reported on the second quarter report covering the period April through June. Example 8 - Full Amount Not Paid - Multiple Payments Made (Costs and Fees Not Satisfied) Defendant makes two installments, $30.00 on July 15 and $30.00 on August 15. Since part of what is owed is paid on or after the 31st day after the date the judgment is entered, the $25.00 Time Payment Fee is added. Allocation : July 15: $30.00 received ($30.00 applied to court costs and fees; $0.00 to fine). Aug. 15: $30.00 received ($30.00 applied to court costs and fees; $0.00 to fine). Reporting and Remitting : State court costs and f ees are reported on the third quarter report covering the period July through September. Proration : Since the full amount of court costs and fees was not collected, prorate the $60.00 among all the court costs and fees using the following formula: amount collected = percentage to apply total costs/fees to each cost/fee 60.00 = 63.83% to each 94.00 cost/fee Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 204 63.83% x 40.00 4.00 2.00 IDF = 1.28 63.83% x 3.00 x 4.00 = 2.65 63.83% x 5.00 JCM = 3.19 x 5.00 15.96 63.83% x 94.00 = 60.00 Example 9 - Part Paid and Part Satisfied by Jail Time Credit Defendant receives $100.00 credit for two 24 -hour periods spent in jail and pays $100.00 on May 15. Allocation : $69.00 to court costs and fees; $31.00 to fine. Reporting and Remitting : State court costs and f ees are reported on the second quarter report, covering th e period April through June. Example 10 - Full Amount Satisfied by Community Service Defendant receives $200.00 credit for f our days community service at $50.00 a day. Allocation : $0.00 to court costs and fees; $0.00 to fine. Reporting and Remitting : Not applicable - nothing to report. B. Amounts Collected Under an Article 103.0031 Collection Contract by a Private Attorney or Private Vendor As indicated previously , allocation and proration of amounts collected by a private attorney or private vendor unde r a contract authorized by Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 103.0031, should be handled differently from the allocation and proration of other collections. 1. Allocation Requirement If a person pays an amount that is less than the aggregate total owed (including the collection fee), allocations are reduced. The private attorney or vendor receives a proportionate share, and the comptroller and the city receive a proportionate share. Court costs and fees are satisfied first from the comptroller's and city's proportionate share. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 205 2. Examples Assume the defendant was conv icted of a speeding offense under Transportation Code, Section 545.352. The offense occurred in March 2006. The city council has entered into a contra ct with a private vendor in which the collection rate is 30 percen t and the amount owed is over 60 days past due. The total amount owed by the defendant is: Court costs and fees: - consolidated court cost (fee) $40.00 - jury reimbursement fee 4.00 - judicial support fee 6.00 - indigent defense fee 2.00 - state traffic fine 30.00 - traffic 3.00 - municipal court building security 3.00 - municipal court technology 4.00 - juvenile case manager court cost 5.00 - arrest fee 5.00 - warrant fee 50.00 - time payment fee 25.00 Court costs and fees 177.00 Fine 120.00 fee ($293.00 x 30%) Total $386.10 Example 1 : A total of $300.00 is received by the city. Since the full amount of court costs and fees, fine, and collection fee was not received, first determine the amount to al locate to the collection fee, as follows: amount collected = percentage to apply to total amount due the collection fee 300.00 = 77.70% 386.10 Amount allocated to the collection fee: Total collection fee $89.10 Multiply by x .7770 Amount allocated to the collection fee $69.23 Since the amount left after allocation to the collection fee is enough to cover all the court costs and fees, they are satisfied in full, and the balance is applied to the fine, as follows: Total received $300.00 Less the amount allocated to the collection fee - 69.23 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 206 Amount left 230.77 Less the amount allocated to the court costs and fees - 177.00 Amount applied to the fine $53.77 Example 2 : A total of $125.00 is received by the city. Since the full amount of the court costs a nd fees, fine, and collection fee was not received, first determine the amount to allocate to the collection fee, as follows: amount collected = percentage to apply to total amount due the collection fee 125.00 = 32.38% 386.10 Amount allocated to the collection fee: Total collection fee $89.10 Multiply by x .3238 Amount allocated to the collection fee $28.85 Since the amount left after allocation to the collection fee is not enough to cover all the court costs and fees, prorate the amount left among all the court costs and fees as follows: Total received $125.00 Less the amount allocated to the collection fee - 28.85 Amount left $96.15 amount left = percentage to apply total costs and fees to each cost and fee 96.15 = 54.32% 177.00 54.32% x 40.00 2.17 54.32% x 6.00 JSF = 3.26 54.32% 2.00 IDF = 1.09 54.32% x 30.00 x x 177.00 = 96.15 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 207 13.7 Accounting, Repor ting, and Remitting Accounting, reporting, and remitting requirements are based on state law and sound financial administration. A. In the Municipal Court State court costs and fees are required by law to be accounted for separately. Most state court cost and fee laws have a provision exactly like or very similar to the following: Consolidated Court Cost Local Government Code, Section 133.054 (a) An officer or clerk collecting a f ee shall keep a record of the money collected. \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 State Traffic Fine Transportation Code, Section 542.4031 \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 (b) An officer collecting a state traffic fine under this section in a case in municipal court shall keep separate r ecords of the money collected and shall deposit the money in the municipal treasury. \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 Local court costs and fees should also be accounted for separately. For some costs and fees, separa te accounting is required by law, such as with the municipal court building secur ity fee. For this fee, the law requires a separate \"fund.\" A separate fund simply means a se lf-balancing set of accounts. In other words, the Municipal Court Building Security Fund has its own assets, liabilities, and equity accounts just like the city's General Fund. Although the law requires a separate fund, it does not require a separate bank account. Municipal Court Building Security Fee Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 102.017 \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 208 (d) Except as provided by Subsection (d -2), the clerks of the respective courts shall collect the costs and pa y them to the county or municipal treasurer, as appropriate, or to any other official who discharges the duties commonly delegated to the county or m unicipal treasurer, as appropriate, for deposit in a fund to be known as the cour thouse security fund or a fund to be known as the municipal court building s ecurity fund, as appropriate. Money deposited in a courthouse security fund may be used only for security personnel, services, and items related to building security fund may be used only for security personnel, services, a nd items related to building that house the operations of district, county, or just courts, and money deposited in a municipal court building security fund may be us ed only for security personnel, services, and items related to buildings that hous e the operations of municipal courts. For purposes of this subsection, operatio ns of a district, county, or justice court include the activ ities of associate judges, masters, magistrates, referees, hearing officers, criminal law magistrate court judges, and masters in chancery appointed under ... . (d-1) For purposes of this article, the term \"security personnel, services, and items\" includes: (1) the purchase or repair of X -ray machines and conveying systems; (2) handheld meta l detectors; (3) walkthrough metal detectors; (4) identification cards and systems; (5) electronic locking an d surveillance equipment; (6) bailiffs, deputy sheriffs, deputy consta bles, or contract security personnel during times when they are providing appropriate secu rity services; (7) signage; (8) confiscated weapon inventory and tracking systems; (9) locks, chains, alarms, or similar security devices; (10) the purchase or repair of bullet-proof glass; and (11) continuing education on security i ssues for court pers onnel and security personnel. \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 For other costs and fees, even thoug h not required by law, sound financial administration requires separate accounting. Consider the $3 court cost for traffic offenses. Additional Court Cost - Traffic Offense Transportation Code, Section 542.403(b) The officer who collects a cost under this section shall: (1) deposit in the municipal treasury a cost collected in a municipal court case; \u0083 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 209 \u0083 \u0083 For a cost such as this, sound financ ial administration requires separate accounting to determine possible budgeta ry impact. For example, if the Legislature decided to increase the cost from $3 to $5, separate accounting for the cost in the past would provide a basis for determining how much additional revenue to budget as a result of the increase. Separate accounting for a cost like this normally just means the ability to track the receipts - not to maintain a separate fund. There should be a good audit trail for all monies received. The bookkeeping system used by the court, whether manual or automated, should show the following for each cost/fee: \u00be date \u00be when remitted; and \u00be to whom remitted. If the court uses a manual bookkeeping system, one easy way to account for the costs and fees is to have a separate column for each cost/fee. For example, a receipts journal may be set up as follows: \u00be column 1: date received; \u00be column 2: from whom received; \u00be column 3: receipt number; \u00be column 4: total amount received; and \u00be columns 5, 6, 7, etc. (as many as are needed): individual columns for each cost/fee and other amounts that need to be accounted for separately In cases where the amount owed is satisfied by jail time or community service credit, there should be s upporting documentation. For example, community service credit should be s upported by documentation authorizing the service (signed by the judge) and docum entation showing that the work was actually done (signed by an appropriate individual w ith the organization for which the community service work was done). Most municipal courts remit money to the city treasurer on a daily basis and do not maintain a bank account. A report should accompany the remittance showing exactly what the am ount is comprised of. In other words, how much is turned in for each individual court cost/fee, how much is for fines, etc. A receipt should always be obtained for the amount remitted. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 210 If the municipal court does maintain a bank account, am ounts collected should be remitted to the city treasurer on a consistent basis in accordance with city policy. Here again, a report showing exactly what the amount is comprised of should accompany the remittance and a r eceipt should be obtained. A separate bank account is not required for state court costs and fees. In addition, state court costs and fees can be put in an interest-bearing account. B. In the City Treasury State court costs and fees are also required to be accounted for separately in the municipal treasury. Most state cour t cost and fee laws have a provision exactly like or very sim ilar to the following: Consolidated Court Cost Local Government Code, Section 133.054 \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 (b) The treasurer shall keep a record of the money collect ed and on deposit in the treasury. \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 State Traffic Fine Transportation Code, Section 542.4031 \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 (e) The custodian of money in a muni cipal or county treasury may deposit money collected under this section in an interest-bearing account. The custodian shall: (1) keep records of the amount of money collected under this section that is on deposit in the treasury; and \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 Some local fees are required by law to be accounted for separately in the city treasury. As indicated previously, the municipal court building security fee must go into a separate fund (self-balancing set of accounts). Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 211 Municipal Court Building Security Fee Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 102.017 \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 (d) Except as provided by Subsection (d -1), the clerks of the respective courts shall collect the costs and pa y them to the county or municipal treasurer, as appropriate, or to any other official who discharges the duties commonly delegated to the county or m unicipal treasurer, as appropriate, for deposit in a fund to be known as the cour thouse security fund or a fund to be known as the municipal court building s ecurity fund, as appropriate. A fund designated by this subsection may be used only to finance .... \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 Court costs for child safety also have to be accounted for separately. If a city's population exceeds 850,000 according to the most recent federal decennial census, a separate fund is required. If a city's population is less than 850,000, separate accounting is still required, but a separate fund does not have to be used. Court Costs for Child Safety Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 102.014 \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 (f) In a municipality with a populati on greater than 850,000 according to the most recent federal decennial census, the officer collecting the costs in a municipal court case shall deposit money collected unde r this article in the municipal child safety trust fund established as required by Chapter 106, Local Government Code. (g) In a municipality with a popula tion less than 850,000 according to the most recent federal decennial census, th e money collected under this article in a municipal court case must be used for a school cro ssing guard program if the municipality operates one. If the municipality does not operate a school crossing guard program or if the money received from municipal court cases exceeds the amount necessary to fund the school crossing guard program, the municipality may either deposit the additional money in an interest-bearing account or expend it for programs designed to enhance child safety, health, or nutrition, including child abuse prevention and intervention and drug and alcohol abuse prevention. \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 212 Just like in the court, there must be a good audit trail in the treasury. The bookkeeping system used by the treasury, whether manual or automated, should show the following for each court cost/fee: \u00be date cover; \u00be when remitted; \u00be amount remitted; and \u00be to whom remitted. A separate fund or bank account for state court costs and fees is not required in the treasury. Additionally, the ba nk account used can be interest-bearing. Amounts due the state should be recorded as liabilities, rather than revenues. This is true whether the amounts are reco rded in the general fund or some other fund. Perhaps the best way to account for court costs and fees in the city treasurer's office is by using an agency fund. An agency fund is a self-balancing set of accounts used to a ccount for assets held by a governmental unit as an agent for individuals, private organizations, other governmental units, and/or other funds. In this situation, the assets are he ld for another government (the state) and another fund (the general fund). When amounts are remitted to the state, the city's share (administrative fee) is tran sferred to the genera l fund. Purely local court costs and fees can go directly to the appropriate fund or through the agency fund. The treasurer's office should always give a receipt when money is remitted. C. To the State Comptroller Cities are responsible for reporting on and remitting state court costs and fees. Most state court cost and fee laws have a provi sion exactly like or very similar to the following: Consolidated Court Cost (Fee) Local Government Code, Section 133.056 (a) On the last day of the month fo llowing a calendar quarter, the treasurer shall report the criminal f ees collected for the preced ing calendar quarter. \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 213 Consolidated Court Cost Local Government Code, Section 133.058 (a) Except as otherwise provided by th is section, a munici pality or county may retain 10 percent of the money coll ected from fees as a service fee for the collection if the munici pality or county remits th e remainder of the fees to the comptroller within the period prescribed by Section 133.055(a). \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 State Traffic Fine Transportation Code, Section 542.4031 \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 (e) The custodian of money in a muni cipal or county treasury may deposit money collected under this section in an interest-bearing account. The custodian shall: (1) keep records of the amount of money collected under this section that is on deposit in the treasury; and (2) not later than the last day of the month following each calendar quarter, remit to the comptroller money collected under this section during the preceding quarter, as required by the comptroller. (f) A municipality or county may retain five percent of the money collected under this section as a service fee for the collection if th e municipality or county remits the funds to the comptrol ler within the period prescribed in Subsection (e). The municipality or c ounty may retain any interest accrued on the money if the custodian of the money deposited in the treasury keeps records of the amount of money collect ed under this sec tion that is on deposit in the treasury and remits the funds to the comptroller within the period prescribed in Subsection (e). \u0083 \u0083 \u0083 There are four reports for reporting st ate court costs, fees, and fines: \u00be State Criminal Costs and Fees - City Quarterly Report; \u00be Excess Highway Fines; \u00be Texas Excess Motor Carrier Fines; and \u00be Child Safety Seat and Seat Belt Violation Fines. Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 214 1. STATE CRIMINAL COSTS AND FEES - CITY QUARTERLY REPORT State court costs and fees are reported on this report. Reports are due by the last day of the month following each calendar quarter. Quarter Period Covered Report Due By First January - March April 30 Second April - June July 31 Third July - September October 31 Fourth October - December January 31 The reporting cycle is sometimes altered during legislat ive years because of changes effective September 1. When that happens, reporting quarters are normally: Quarter Period Covered Report Due By First January - March April 30 Second April - June July 31 Third July - August October 31 Fourth September - December January 31 The Comptroller always notifies cities when a reporting change is going to take place. The report form is mailed to each city before the end of each quarter - a little more than a month before it is due. The following pre-printed information is on the form: \u00be city identification number; \u00be city name and mailing address; \u00be due date of the report; and \u00be the period the report covers. EXAMPLE Anycity, Texas is preparing the quarterly report for the second calendar quarter of 2006 (April - June). During th at period, the munici pal court collected the following state court cost, fee, and fine amounts: State traffic fines $4,500.00 Peace officer fees 100.00 Failure to appear/pay fees 1,200.00 Motor carrier weight violations 1,800.00 Time payment fees 1,400.00 Jury reimbursement fees 800.00 Municipal Courts November 2007 Financial Management Handbook Page 215 Judicial support fees 720.00 Driving record fees 0.00 Other state court costs and fees: For offenses committed 1/1/04 forward 16,000.00 For offenses committed 9/1/01 through 12/31/03 500.00 For offenses committed 8/31/99 For committed 9/1/97 For committed 9/1/95 committed 9/1/91 through 8/31/95 0.00 Total $27,020.00 The Report Form (Note: At the printing of this book, the Comptroller has not yet revised this form. You can check the Comptroller's website for the most up-to-date form: www.state.tx.us.) The part of the form where the amount s are reported looks similar to the following: Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Description TOTAL COLLECTED SERVICE FEE AMOUNT DUE STATE SEE BACK FOR INSTRUCTIONS (Sta te court costs only) (See Instru ctions) (Col. 1 minus Col. 2) Section I : Reports for offenses committed: 1. 01-01-04 Forward State Traffic Fine ___________ 8. ___________ Section II : As applicable: 9.
