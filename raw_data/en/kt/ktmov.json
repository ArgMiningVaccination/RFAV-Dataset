In the search for a lead plant for our new moisturiser series (see page 12 ), we came across the prickly pear cactus - Opuntia ficus indica. It grows in a dry environment and is excellent at surviving dry periods. It has the ability to store moisture in this kind of hostile environment, thereby compensating for and harmonising the imbalance in the environment. But would the analysis of the sub\u00ad stance show that the plant could live up to its promise? Yes - we were right. We found that a product made from prickly pear would have a remarkable moistur\u00ad ising effect on human skin. We developed a specially adapted process for our own production, and we have applied for a patent for this process. We're also delighted that the plants are grown in a controlled organic envi\u00ad ronment and the growing conditions meet our requirements for a respectful supply chain.

With courage and dedication, our employees have accepted these challenges and sought solutions. This is not only about the application of skills and abilities, but also about the way in which they are used. From which stance do I make my contribution? Am I aware of the importance of my contribution to the business practice and the brand of Weleda? These are questions that have to do with the forma\u00ad tion of an appropriate corporate culture. The figures for our business activities can be found on the inside cover page and in the financial statements from page 63 onwards. We do not regard the figures as a target, but as the result of our work. We work for our customers and with the help of nature for health in the world. Because we see a purpose in our work, we can do our work with love. This, among other things, is what this Annual and Sustainability Report is all about: in each chapter we will tell a story about what love and devotion to working at Weleda look like and what is important to us. In accordance with our purpose: inspired by anthropo\u00ad sophy, we follow our path. So much for the concept behind this report. I am writing these lines at the end of March 2020. We are all affected by the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Europe and in the world. The last few weeks have changed our lives fundamentally. Social life has been considerably restricted everywhere in order to slow down the development of the pandemic. Of course, Weleda is also affected by this. The good news for Weleda: we were able to continue manufacturing and delivering our products up to the time of writing this report. How things are when the report reaches you, we cannot assess today. We very much hope that the situation will have improved by then. Our thoughts are with the victims of this pandemic and the many people whose livelihoods are threatened by this virus and the closure of public life. My sincere thanks go to all employees of Weleda for their prudent handling of the exceptional situation and to you for your interest and trust in Weleda. Yours, Paul Mackay Chairman of the Board of Directors of Weleda AG 2EDITORIAL OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Board of Directors of Weleda AG 2 Dr Andreas J\u00e4schke Head of Organisational Culture at Klinik Arlesheim \"There is as much healing power in every product as love has been worked into it.

You can't do it without love.\"1 Nataliya Yarmolenko Chief Commercial Officer \"Love of action for me means to recognise the meaning in the situation and connect with it. From this grows courage and strength to do what is necessary. This stance is expressed in our purpose.\" 4 The knowledge of the Weleda gardeners Weleda's international team of gardeners has compiled valuable knowledge in a book about the biodynamic cultivation of medicinal plants. They provide personal insights into their work and into the complex interplay between the human being and nature. For the first time, readers can participate in the wealth of experience of the Weleda gardeners: how they promote soil health, produce their own seeds and work with the rhythms of nature. In a loving way the gardeners present their work and understanding as well as the art of keeping the garden organ\u00ad ism in balance. In very personal interviews they show what it means to be a gardener and to work and live with nature: \"In spring, when everything begins to sprout, this is life at its purest. It's an incredible feeling to stand in the middle of a field of St John's wort in summer and feel the power of the sun. And in autumn, when everything ripens, you feel like you've matured a bit yourself.\" This is how Michael Straub puts it. He is an agri\u00ad cultural engineer and has managed the Weleda medicinal herb garden in Germany for over 20 years. The eight Weleda medicinal plant gardens are spread all over the world: in Europe, South America and New Zealand our gardeners cultivate precious plants for natural cosmetics and medicines. The gardens were created to provide the compa\u00ad ny with plant-derived raw materials that meet Weleda's high quality criteria. Because only healthy and strong plants can provide people with vital strength and curative powers. All gar\u00ad dens have one thing in common: the medicinal plants are biodynamically farmed. The book is enjoyable to read, a guidebook and photo book in one. More than 130 at\u00ad mospheric photos show how human beings can work in harmony with creation: Das Wissen der Weleda G\u00e4rtner, 5THE NEW WELEDA BOOK Weleda sustainability programme Our sustainability programme follows a global approach. It is geared towards the entire Weleda Group and is valid for the years 2018 to 2022. In all seven areas of action - from which the structure of the present report is also derived - we continued to pursue our goals consistently in 2019. This year, 2020, we will add another focus: climate protection, including mobility and logistics. Attractive and sustainable packaging Weleda developed a new long-term packaging vision in 2019: \"Zero Waste. Zero Harm. 100 % Consumer Relevance\". Weleda packaging should not cause any problems in the world but at the same time it should be attractive and easy to use. We will align our medium\u00ad and long\u00adterm packaging development with this vision. Weleda still has a long way to go before this vision becomes rea\u00ad lity. On the positive side, a start has already been made: by 2022, the proportion of recycled material in packaging will more than double from 29 per cent (in 2018 ) to at least 65 per cent. We will achieve this goal primarily by using more green glass and plastics with a high recycling content. For example, in 2020 the bottles for Calendula body lotion and Calendula baby oil will be converted to 100 per cent recycled plastic. Together with other industrial and trading companies, Weleda is involved in the Recyclate Forum to strengthen the recycling econ\u00ad omy and increase the market share of recycled packaging. It is our wish that one day our vision \"Zero Waste. Zero Harm. 100 % Con\u00ad sumer Relevance\" is the industry standard. You can read more about our vision on page 13 in an interview with Dr Bernhard Irrgang, responsible for research and development in the natural and organ\u00ad ic cosmetics segment. Healthy soils We support soil resilience, biodiversity and local to regional eco\u00ad systems worldwide through our eight biodynamically managed Weleda medicinal herb gardens and around 50 raw materials pro\u00ad jects. In the Weleda medicinal herb gardens, our gardeners main\u00ad tain a resilient ecosystem that is able to keep itself in balance on its own and becomes more species\u00adrich. So despite the drought in the summer of 2019, our harvest results were good. Weleda pro\u00ad motes biodynamic and organic cultivation around the globe. To\u00ad gether with our partners, we ensure that soil quality is improved. Healthy soils are the foundation of all Weleda products and the key to intact ecosystems, healthy people, a healthy climate and thus our health in general.Weleda becomes B-Corp By 2022, the entire Weleda Group is to become a certified B-Cor\u00ad poration (B\u00adCorp for short ). B\u00adCorp is an international sustainability certification for companies. Certified companies provide trans\u00ad parent proof that they meet very high social and environmental standards in order to reconcile financial and ethical value creation. There are around 3,000 certified companies worldwide. In autumn 2019, we successfully completed the first project phase of the preliminary review. More information about B\u00adCorp can be found at www.bcorporation.net New: climate protection We also want to become even better at climate protection, includ\u00ad ing logistics and mobility. We already know that, for example, our gardens and our cultivation partners have many positive effects on the climate - but we will now look at this area of action more systematically. In 2020, a climate balance will be prepared for the entire Weleda Group, covering all dimensions: direct own emissions (Scope 1), energy received from external sources (Scope 2 ) and other indirect emissions (Scope 3 ), for example from global agricul\u00ad tural supply chains and logistics. On this basis, we are developing a tailor\u00admade climate protection programme that we will present in the 2020 Annual and Sustainability Report. What does sustainability really mean? If we continue to optimise ourselves and become more and more efficient, we will certainly become \"less bad\" as a result. But is it enough to reduce emissions or increase the recycling rate of our packaging? We think not. It is essential, but in a finite world with limited resources and billions of people who have a right to an intact nature and a dignified life, we need a paradigm shift as defined by the Cradle to Cradle movement: from \"less bad\" to \"more good\". The crucial question is: is a world with Weleda worse or bet\u00ad ter than a world without Weleda? We know that there are many examples where a world with Weleda is better. But there are also other examples. We will do our utmost to ensure that the overall balance becomes less and less negative and instead more and more positive. 6WELEDA SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMME In the following seven chapters, we present our \"good\u00ad prints\". These are employees and people connected with Weleda who make the world a better place through their professional actions: in distinction to the so\u00ad called ecological footprint, we have coined the term \"goodprint\" for their commitment to a good cause.Goodprint 7WELEDA #thinkahead Jakob W\u00f6ssner, Organisational Manager, is committed to communicating Weleda's knowledge also digitally. Product development and products01 The foundation of our customers' trust is our special commitment to quality. Alongside this high product quality, innovative packaging is also in demand today. With our ambitious goals for more sustainable pack\u00ad aging, we want to make Weleda natural and organic cosmetics even more customer\u00adoriented. In addition to new developments, we see it as our task to continue to invest in research and development, such as micro\u00ad biome research.The Digital Academy is intended for a specialist audience such as doctors and pharmacists. Rita Wirtz and Jakob W\u00f6ssner are driving the project forward. Digital Academy: the knowledge of Weleda Developing professional skills, personal development: for the first time, Weleda AG is presenting a digital learning platform. From summer 2020, it will be available to pharmacists, PTAs and non\u00admedical practitioners. Society's interest in complementary medicine is growing steadily. Weleda has a wealth of knowledge in this field. One year before its 100th birthday it is making it accessible with a new tripartite training programme inspired by the image of the human being of anthroposo\u00ad phy. The first topic of the Digital Academy is digestion and stress. Pharmacists, PTAs and non\u00admedical practitioners will first receive basic knowledge about anthroposophic medicine and pharmacy and cor\u00ad responding products from Weleda. Whoever wants to go further can additionally book professional content for therapeutic use. In a third step, participants receive suggestions for personal development. \"We are thus offering unusual added value,\" says Jakob W\u00f6ssner, Organi\u00ad sational Development and Digitisation Manager. \"In addition to a clas\u00ad sic further training, the individual learns how to reduce stress in everyday life, for example.\" The innovative concept itself is also intend\u00ad ed to contribute to this: content is conveyed in a playful manner, the time for learning can be freely chosen. In the future, personal meet\u00ad ings with speakers, for example, could supplement the virtual offer. \"There is an unbelievable amount of potential in this,\" says Jakob W\u00f6ssner, who helped develop the platform. \"The extent to which good things can be achieved is unlimited. 10Goodprint #thinkahead Our commitments and goals for sustainability 100% Natrue certification for all cosmetic productsNew products: Skin Food Body Butter, Skin Food Light and Skin Food Lip Balm Naturally Clear Clarifying Wash Gel, Mattifying Fluid, S.O.S.

The power of a drop of oil The successful pomegranate care series will grow in 2020: Weleda has composed the Pomegranate Firming Face Oil from pomegranate seed oil, argan oil, apricot seed oil and six other precious vegetable oils. The intensively nourishing oil is quickly ab\u00ad sorbed and reduces wrinkles. Just a few drops of the oil are enough - either in com\u00ad bination with a day or night cream or pure as intensive care.Intense moisture with prickly pear cactusPHARMACEUTICAL STRATEGY: IT'S COMPLEX Successes, challenges and in- tensive work: in 2019, Weleda made progress with its strate- gy for a sustainable pharmaceu- tical business. But it also be- came clear that there is still a long way to go before we reach our goal. To reduce complexity, transpar\u00ad ency is needed. This makes it pos\u00ad sible to weigh up the financial implications of decisions much more comprehensively and to act accordingly. For example, in the price increase that was imple\u00ad mented, which led to a deliberate loss of reimbursement for some medicines in Switzerland. Weleda is thus taking a necessary step towards an economically viable product range without limiting the availability of important an\u00ad throposophic medicines. The first successes of the pharmaceutical strategy in Germany and Swit\u00ad zerland are accompanied by the challenging situation in France: the cancellation of the eligibili\u00ad ty of homoeopathic medicines for reimbursement in two stages by January 2021 directly affects Weleda.Four times intensive moisture: the new moisturising care series with prickly pear cactus Our skin is beautiful when it is healthy. And in order to stay healthy, the microorganisms on our skin have to thrive. Because they form our protective shield. As humans, we are never alone. Countless microorganisms live in our body and on our skin. This is completely natural, because microorganisms originated long before hu\u00ad mans in the history of evolution. To sur\u00ad vive in this environment, we had to learn to live in symbiosis with them: we offer them a habitat and they help us. On the skin, the good, i. e. useful, represen\u00ad tatives of the so-called microbiota - popu\u00ad larly also known as microbiome - ensure that Microbiome: protective shield of the skin the ubiquitous harmful germs do not get the upper hand and cannot harm us. They thus form a protective layer and con\u00ad tribute to the barrier function of healthy skin. Microbiome\u00adfriendly products promote the protective function of the skin. \"We start from the premise that our natural cos\u00ad metics products are microbiome\u00adfriendly,\" says Dr Gerald K\u00fcnst le, who, together with his team, is researching how Weleda natu\u00ad ral cosmetics affect the microbiome. \"We want to be able to prove this for our exist\u00ad ing portfolio and in the future we want to incorporate it more strongly into the devel\u00ad opment of new products.\"I very much like to prescribe Weleda products. I am convinced by the high quality from the raw material to the final product and my patients benefit from it during their recovery. Dr Fabricio Dias, Brazil Anthroposophic doctor and general practitionerA VIEW FROM OUTSIDE Dry skin? Nature knows what to do: four new Weleda products with prickly pear cactus extract pro\u00ad vide natural, long-lasting moisture. The unique extract from Mexican organic prickly pear cactus, for which a European patent is pending, has a high content of water\u00adbinding substances and thus sup\u00ad ports the skin's own ability to store mois\u00ad ture. We use this property for our new moisturising care series: 24h moisturising cream The light texture is quickly absorbed and strengthens the natural skin barrier. 24h moisturising fluid The matting fluid with babassu oil provides long\u00adlasting moisture. Refreshing moisturising eye gel The unscented gel is quickly absorbed, cools and revitalises the sensitive skin around the eyes. Refreshing moisturising spray The spray revitalises tired skin and refines the pores. All four new products are Natrue\u00adcertified. They also bear the new UEBT seal for raw 12THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 A vision for the best possible packaging The consumer goods industry is currently facing a major challenge: less packaging that is more environmentally friendly. In an interview, Dr Bernhard Irrgang, responsible for research and development of natural and organic cosmetics, explains why really good solutions take time. Weleda has therefore formulated a packaging vision for the years until 2030 and beyond. What requirements must product packaging fulfil? DR BERNHARD IRRGANG: It must protect the product from oxygen, light and impurities. This is a central aspect because Weleda uses par\u00ad ticularly sensitive and valuable raw materials. Then, of course, the packaging must be easy to handle and be as ecological as possible. The biggest challenge at present is to strike a balance between adequate product protection and ecology. How ecological is our packaging? Some of our packaging materials are already highly recyclable, and we are also increasingly using recycled material. Unfortunately, how\u00adever, different definitions of recyclability apply in the countries in which we operate and the quality of recycling varies greatly. What does the most ecological packaging look like? It should consist of only one type of mate\u00ad rial to be, then it is easier to recycle. This is the case with our PET bottles, and glass is also a pure material. It is important to manu facture the packaging in the most environmentally friendly way possible as well. What goals does Weleda set itself for the next few years? By 2022, 65 per cent of our primary packaging will come from recycled sources. To this end, we will increase the proportion of recycled PET and, in the case of glass, switch completely to glass with a very high recycling content. By 2030, we aim to achieve closed cycles for packaging, either through take\u00adback systems or orderly recycling cycles. Secondly, we must ensure the quality of the recycled material. Thirdly, the packaging must of course meet the expectations of our customers. How does Weleda achieve these goals? There are no easy solutions. I understand the desire for faster progress, but we must proceed carefully. We are currently testing whether it is possible to offer certain products in zero\u00adwaste shops without any packaging and without any loss of product quality. Also solid products, such as hair soaps, require little packaging. Or aluminium: there is hardly any better protection for our products, but the extraction of aluminium is very energy\u00adin\u00ad tensive. We will therefore have to find other solutions for this as well.By 2022, 65 per cent of our primary packag\u00ad ing will come from recycled sources. Dr Bernhard Irrgang Head of Research and Development for Natural and Organic CosmeticsDr Bernhard Irrgang heads the research and development depart\u00ad ment for natural and organic cos- metics and thus also the packaging development team. 13 01 Product development and productsRegenerative farming and biodiversity02 The quality of our raw materials is particularly important to us. Our goal for organic plant\u00adbased raw materials is to increase the biodynamic proportion to 30 per cent by 2022. We are confident that this type of farming is the most sustainable. This is the cultivation method that gives back more to our envir\u00ad onment than it takes, thanks to closed cycles with natural humus formation. #responsibility Weleda is committed to the reforestation of cleared rainforests in Borneo and to sustainable sources of income for the local population. Annette Piperidis, who initiated the project and is responsible for sustainable procurement at Weleda, makes her very personal contribution to reforestation. 66,000 trees for a new rainforest Barren land to the horizon: an abandoned rice cultiva\u00ad tion project has destroyed one third of the peat bog rain forests in the Mawas Conservation Area in central Borneo. Since 2019, Weleda AG has been committed to refor esting them and protecting the biodiversity in the region. Where until 25 years ago dense rainforest grew on damp peat bog soil, 66,000 plants are now stretching their delicate green shoots towards the sun again, enough for 55 hectares. \"That sounds like a lot, but it isn't,\" says Annette Piperidis, Manager for Sustainable Raw Materials Procurement at Weleda AG in Schw\u00e4- bisch Gm\u00fcnd. \"Our dearest wish would be to restore the entire area of 100,000 hectares. At least a start has been made. To this end, Weleda AG cooperates with the non\u00adprofit organisation Bor\u00ad neo Orangutan Survival (BOS ) Germany, which has been working for the endangered orangutans in Borneo and the preservation of their natural habitat since 1991. \"BOS is an ideal partner for pur- suing our own sustainability goals,\" says Annette Piperidis, who sees her work as a calling. \"In doing so, we not only want to be donors, but also to improve the living conditions on site.\" The pro\u00ad ject, which is endowed with 100,000 euros, gives 100 village families work in planting and trains locals to become fire fighters, as the cleared peat bog soil is easily ignited. It also provides knowledge about the value of the forest - and of patience: only in many years' time will the trees be big enough to provide a home for orangutans again. Helping the villagers, reforesting the rainforest and thus helping the orangutans, these are the cornerstones of the project. 16Goodprint #responsibility Our commitments and goals for sustainability Minimum average organic propor\u00ad tion of 80 %, based on certifiable raw materialsCurrent status: 80 % Organic requirement implemented for new raw materials UEBT standard: new partnerships comply with organic require\u00ad ments and fulfil social and ecological demands.

Wild bees play an important role as pollinators of native plants. In order to protect this endangered species, Weleda Australia provides construction kits for bee hotels for schools. In this way children are taught the importance of biodiversity in a playful way. The concept follows a playful approach. Not with frontal teaching but with practi\u00ad cal outdoor work the pupils learn about the importance of wild bees and their func\u00ad tion for the local ecosystem. Weleda pro\u00ad The pupils playfully explore the nature of the wild bee.vides interested schools with a kit for a bee hotel, including instructions and in\u00ad formation material, free of charge. The pupils then assemble the bee hotel under the supervision of a teacher and observe the bees throughout the summer. In this way, the children not only learn about the habits and preferences of the wild bee, but also recognise the importance of plant pollination and its effects on biodiversity. The concept is well received. \"We have worked with over 650 schools across the country, providing them with a free bee hotel and curriculum,\" said David Johnston, Managing Director of Weleda Australia. He estimates that more than 120,000 chil\u00ad dren have been taught the importance of biodiversity.The bee hotel enriches our school garden. The pupils have also planted special plants to attract bees near to the hotel. It was amazing how much they learned. Alison Bath Headmistress of the Tuntable Creek Public School 18THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 I admire the holistic approach taken by Weleda, which includes every thing: the preservation of the soils, the promotion of the farming projects through to the search for the best pack\u00ad aging solutions. Alexx Stuart, Australia Author and blogger www.lowtoxlife.comA VIEW FROM OUTSIDE A thick oak tree was also once a seed: since 2019, Weleda has been engaged for the first time in its own strategy for organic seeds which makes farmers independent of large corporations, maintains biodiversity and secures natural materials. Three corporations currently own 60 per cent of the world's seeds. These are mostly hybrid or even genetically modified breeds that cannot be propagated. At the same time, the diversity of useful plant species is declining significantly. Today, 70 per cent of the vegetable varieties that were once grown in Germany have already dis\u00ad appeared. \"This topic is becoming increas\u00ad ingly relevant to society,\" says Annette Engel, Head of Raw Materials Purchasing at Weleda AG. \"With our seed strategy, Promoting biodiversity is one of Weleda's sustainability goals. This is why we intensified our partnership with the company Agro\u00adMap in 2019. In eastern Albania, in the middle of the Shebenik\u00adJablanica nature re\u00ad serve, they carefully cultivate vari\u00ad ous plants such as calendula accord\u00ad ing to the guidelines of organic farming or obtain them from con\u00ad trolled wild collection. The varied landscape and the biodiversity at an altitude of over 1,000 metres are the main attractions of the production area. Otherwise, the sparsely populated region, whose population can hardly live on agri\u00ad culture, is structurally weak. This makes it all the more important to provide the villagers with a secure and regular income through work in the fields. Agro\u00adMap was founded by two former students of the Uni\u00ad versity of Hohenheim. It is important to both of them not to engage in highly pro\u00ad ductive plant cultivation, but to preserve and promote biodiversity. This is another which is initially set to run for four years, we want to help ensure that organic seed will continue to be available to farmers in the future as well. To this end, the com\u00ad pany supports, for example, the \"Save our Seeds\" initiative and the seed funds of the \"Zukunftsstiftung Landwirtschaft\" foun\u00ad dation, as well as the \"Kernel initiative of the organic food re\u00ad tailer Dennree. In 2012, Weleda was already one of the founding members of the \"Initiative Bio\u00ad Saatgut Sonnenblumen\" (IBS), an initiative that aims to rebreed hybrid seeds into reproductive organic seeds. It takes persis\u00ad tence: the variety will be available in a few years at the earliest. reason why Weleda is convinced of the partnership. Bees are responsible for pre\u00ad serving biodiversity, which is why colonies have been established that are developing well so far. Biodiversity also means ob\u00ad serving the number of insects in the area. Therefore Agro\u00adMap started so\u00adcalled in\u00adsect monitoring. The aim is to take a criti\u00ad cal look at the effects of cultivation on bio\u00ad diversity. Will the number of insects re\u00ad main the same or even increase as a result of agriculture? These are important ques\u00ad tions that move us at Weleda.Sowing a future for high biodiversity Counting insects and creating jobs in Albania Regard for biodiversity: the cultivation project in Albania is no threat to bird's nests. 19 02 Regenerative farming and biodiversity #respect Bas Schneiders, Head of International Strategic Purchasing at Weleda, thanks harvest workers in Moldova. Weleda supports lavender cultivation locally and thus offers the local population a secure income. Respectful supply chain 03 Weleda products are based on thousands of substances from nature. We source many natural raw materials and valuable medicinal plants from suppliers around the globe. We cooperate with more than 50 cultivation partners worldwide. The ethical procurement of raw materials is important to us - for people and nature. Since 2018, we have been the first European brand to be certified by the Union for Ethical BioTrade. How villagers become experts with lavender oil Weleda obtains fragrant lavender oil not only from the South of France, but also from Eastern European Moldova. The successful cooperation with villagers will now be converted to biodynamic agriculture by the end of 2021. \"Without the lavender our villages would be completely de\u00ad serted,\" says Victor Cracea, flashing his many steel teeth when he smiles. The 78\u00adyear\u00adold lives in the small upper village, in Mincenii de Sus. The mobile phone network is almost without gaps, but many inhabitants fetch their water from the village well, as in the past. Some 90 kilometres north of the Moldovan capital Chisinau, those who stayed have been making a living since 2003 because Weleda has concluded long\u00adterm leases with its local partner, the company Resendjer. On a total of 220 hectares, villag\u00ad ers cultivate lavender and extract the plant's valuable oil. Sea\u00ad sonal helpers also earn well during the harvest season. Since 2019, their prospects have again improved significantly: a three\u00adyear project with the German Development Company, endowed with 400,000 euros, trains local people to cultivate the fields ac- cording to biodynamic criteria and to cultivate new plant species. Weleda and Resendjer are investing about half of this sum. For the first time, a tractor and a compost turner were also purchased. Hedges are planted to increase local biodiversity. \"In this way we are taking a big step towards regenerative agriculture and at the same time can inspire new social momentum,\" says Bas Schneiders, Head of International Strategic Purchasing, happily. \"In the future, we hope to have a reach beyond the region.\"The lavender is still harvested by hand in Moldova, with workers bringing the collected lavender flowers to the distillery in small tractors. Bees also contribute to biodiversity. 22Goodprint #respect Our commitments and goals for sustainability Cultivation projects (approx. 50 worldwide )Support of social and ecological initiatives and projects: Moldova - lavender cultivation: conversion to biodynamic agriculture, with support from the German Development Company (see page 22 ) Albania - cultivation of calendula, viola and sunflower: financing of beehives and insect monitoring (see page 19 ) Honduras - cultivation of Nux vomica and Ipecacuanha: support for a botanical garden Romania - arnica wild collection: renovation of a village school Germany, Bulgaria and Czech Republic - calendula and lavender cultivation: advice on biodynamic cultivation Mexico - sesame cultivation: medical support (financing of antiserum against scorpion bites ) Peru - ratanhia wild collection: testing of new areas for controlled biological wild collection UEBT management system for the entire supply chains of natural raw materials in the natural and organic cosmetics area.See area of action 02: Regenerative farming and biodiversity Trend: rising unchanged falling Assessment: Promise fulfilled Promise not fulfilledOur commitments Trend Milestones 2019 Assessment Transparency regarding true costs Transparency regarding the true costs for all essential plant\u00adbased raw materials (true cost accounting )Preparation (for example app programming ) of the next stage with 15 additional raw materials, which will be evaluated in 2020 Trend: rising unchanged falling Assessment: Target easy to reach Target difficult to reach Target very difficult to reachStatus quo 2019 New targets for 2022 Trend Assessment More about Weleda and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations on page 101.Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 23 03 Respectful supply chain Our active involvement in the supply chain As the first European brand, we have been allowed to use the UEBT seal of approval since 2018. UEBT stands for Union for Ethical Biotrade and is a non\u00adprofit association that promotes the respectful procurement of natural ingredients. The very strict UEBT standard promotes sustainable local development and the protec\u00ad tion and careful use of biodiversity. UEBT certification is based on the testing of our pro\u00ad cesses for all natural raw materials used in our natural and organic cosmetics products. We thus guarantee that biodiversity is optimally preserved and sustainably used in the cultiva\u00ad tion of the plant, the harvest and further processing. We are also committed to treating all partners in the supply chain fairly, respect\u00ad ing human and labour rights and promoting community development. Our current UEBT certification is valid until June 2021 and will then be extended by a new audit. In the meantime, we train all the departments involved internally, for example research and development and marketing. In 2019, external UEBT audits of our sup- pliers were also required. We successfully com\u00ad pleted most of the planned audits. However, we had to postpone some audits until 2020. The main reason for this is the great organisa\u00ad tional effort (availability of auditors, suppliers and operators on site, coordination, language, different structures of the supply chains and all this in connection with the complex UEBT control process ). OUR GOALS FOR 2020 Audits of all remaining prioritised supply chains Follow-up of supplier actions and completion of verification audits The corrective measures of last year's audit are main- ly adjustments in our pro- cess descriptions and inter- nal training. These meas- ures will be implemented in 2020.

Philippe Kniebily, France Deputy Mayor of Saint Louis and Director of Petite Camargue AlsacienneA VIEW FROM OUTSIDE How an audit is carried out Olive oil: an important ingredient for our arnica massage oil. We obtain a part of it from a cooperative in the Andalusian mountains in Spain. Olive trees are organically grown on more than 8,000 hectares. In 2019, we con ducted an audit to check whether the co op erative meets the criteria for UEBT cer ti fication. The auditor Annette Pipe\u00ad ridis checked, among other things, whether there is social security for employees, whether biodiversity is protected locally and whether hygiene requirements are met. Especially pleasing: the cooperative passed the audit with very good results. \"The head of the cooperative is exemplary in his commitment to biodiversity. The prickly pear is endangered by a plague of lice on site. Juan Antonio Caballero is now looking for insects that eat the lice. This way, the existence of the prickly pear can be secured,\" explains Piperidis. Together with the farmers she defined further measures after the audit to meet all requirements. Implementation is then regularly monitored by Weleda.Organic olive oil is produced on more than 8,000 hectares in Andalusia, Spain. Making music promotes the concen\u00ad tration and development of children. For this reason we have given the pupils of the Sekem school in Egypt new musical instruments with our Christmas donation. In this way we want to support the chil\u00ad dren in gaining new learning experiences. The Sekem school was founded in 1989 northeast of Cairo. It is open to children of all religions and encourages them to live in harmony and respect each other's religious practices. Today the Sekem school comprises a primary, a preparatory and a secondary school for 300 pupils. The children come to the Sekem school from rural, village and urban areas: from underprivileged and privileged families - Egyptians and foreigners alike. The Sekem school is based on the Egyptian state curriculum. By combining traditional educa\u00ad tional methods with innovative learning experiences, it is possible to promote the social, cultural and educational develop\u00adment of each child. Weleda and Sekem have already had a close partnership for many years which goes far beyond the jojoba oil that Weleda obtains from Sekem in biodynamic quality.Melodious Christmas donation When making music, children learn much more than just notes: it improves their commu\u00ad nication skills and concentration. 25 03 Respectful supply chainSustainable sites, production and logistics04 For Weleda, environmental protection is one of the central corporate tasks. With the help of our environmental management we control and improve the consumption of resources and the environmental impact caused by the company. How well we succeeded in doing this in 2019 can also be seen in the consolidated environmental data on page 96. #future To give penguins a future, Weleda in Great Britain donates ten pounds sterling to the Global Penguin Society for every ten kilograms of recycled plastic. How Skin Food also does penguins good In Great Britain, Weleda has had soft plastic packaging processed by TerraCycle since 2019. In addition, for every ten kilograms, ten pounds sterling are donated to the Global Penguin Society to save endangered penguin species. It's not always easy to do the right thing. This includes, at a time when the disadvantages of plastic packaging are rightly becoming apparent, switching to it nevertheless, also for ecological reasons. This sounds contradictory at first. Weleda's Skin Food skin care has been available in plastic tubes since the end of 2018 instead of aluminium tubes. The reason: extracting new aluminium is very pollut\u00ad ing and energy-intensive. Recycled aluminium, though, is too brittle. On the other hand, there are still no suitable bioplastics for all in\u00ad gredients. Although Weleda plastic packaging can also be recycled in principle, the process is more complicated if it is made of poly\u00ad propylene and ethylene at the same time - such as the soft tubes for Weleda shower or sunscreen lotion products. Because there is no dual recycling system in Britain as there is in Germany, Weleda decid\u00ad ed to cooperate in Britain with TerraCycle, which is regarded as a specialist in this field worldwide. Customers can collect their tubes and send them to TerraCycle for free. Or they drop off empty pack\u00ad aging at Weleda in Ilkeston and at recycling centres which send them to TerraCycle. \"It is important to us that all these tubes are recycled in the country,\" says Jayn Sterland, Managing Director of Weleda UK. The costly TerraCycle process is also used by other manufacturers, but \"only Weleda is investing additionally in a sustainable project and is constantly striving to develop better packaging\".Pablo Garc\u00eda Borboroglu, founder and president of the Global Penguin Society, has been researching and protect\u00ad ing penguins for over 30 years.

In the meantime, the city of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd has procured all the necessary plots so that nothing any longer stands in the way of Weleda purchasing the land. 30THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Development of environmental indicators Our goal is to reduce the energy, water and waste intensity with which we manufacture our products by 2.5 per cent annually. We thus aim to continuously reduce the use of resources and the volume of waste generated so as to protect the environment and save on costs. Intensity is strongly affected by the capacity utilisation of our facilities: the more products the facilities produce within the operating times, the lower the intensity (improved efficiency ). Capacity utilisation depends primarily on the order situation, over which we have only limited influence. We do have a direct influence on the technical facilities (energy\u00adefficient production facilities ), process control in production (lean workflows and smooth operation ), formulations (cold or hot production of prod\u00ad uct content ) and the avoidance of waste during production and distribution.The following environmental indicators are essential for Weleda: the consumption of potable water and energy as well as the amount of waste in relation to the production volume of finished products and product content. The charts below show the suc\u00ad cesses to date, the current status and our targets up to 2022. The key figures relate to the manufacturing countries of France, Germany and Switzerland. The largest quantities are produced at these locations. Water intensity Potable water consumption in relation to production volume (product content ).

Since the beginning of 2020 they have been converting the incident light into electricity. Almost 60 per cent of Weleda Benelux's energy requirements can be cov\u00ad ered by the collectors. The company wants to lead by example and show other compa\u00ad Around 2,700 pallets, and thus 80 truck journeys, are to be saved each year by making greater use of transport packaging for natural and organic cosmetic products at a comparable sales volume. In the classic sense, corrugated cardboard boxes are used as transport packaging, so\u00adcalled tertiary packaging. These boxes, also known as trays, have important tasks and have an effect in many areas: on the stability of the pallet load, on trans\u00ad port safety, even on the well\u00adbeing of the employees when they have to pull a tray nies that there are sustainable solutions because, according to the government's timetable, all enterprises in Holland should reduce their energy requirements by 49 per cent by 2030. There are temporary tax benefits for this. Since it was not pos\u00ad sible to install solar modules on the com\u00ad pany roof, the only option left was to build a carport. In the first place, the new car\u00ad port serves to generate electricity. In this way, Weleda Benelux has successfully managed to generate its own electricity and reduce its carbon footprint. out of a pallet layer. As simple as a tray may be, the system is complex because there are many dependencies to consider. A project to optimise tertiary packaging materials was already launched at the end of 2017. Analyses have shown that trays of various product groups are not being used to their maximum possible capacity. Since the beginning of 2020, a new con\u00ad cept has been tested in production batch sizes. Other positive effects: packaging material can be saved, costs for transport and parking space can be reduced and CO2 emissions can be cut.New solar plant in the Netherlands Optimisation of the transport capacity utilisationIN BRIEF Renewal of ultrapure water treatment Water plays a decisive role in the production of natural cos- metic products and pharmaceu- ticals. At Weleda we use purified water. Mineral salts and other unwant\u00ad ed substances are removed from drinking water by ion exchange and reverse osmosis. The ultra\u00ad pure water produced in this way can be reused for the manufac\u00ad ture of various Weleda products. However, it is mostly used for cleaning the production equip\u00ad ment. The demand for ultrapure water in Germany was deter\u00ad mined at the beginning of 2020, as a new water treatment plant is planned. The future plant will have a greater efficiency than the previous one. In the long run, wa\u00ad ter can therefore be saved. In ten years' time, we will see more clearly what problems arise from climate change and species extinction. Ideally, Weleda products should actively con\u00ad tribute to solving these problems. Dr Arthur Braunschweig, Switzerland President of \u00f6bu - Swiss Association for Sustainable BusinessA VIEW FROM OUTSIDE 32THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Weleda France dispatches natural and organic cosmetics products in a small house. The brilliant packag\u00ad ing format provides joy and gives the transport carton a second life. Since January 2020, some customers of Weleda France have been receiving their ordered goods in eye\u00adcatching transport packaging. The small cardboard house is decorated with lovingly drawn pictures for colouring in and thus looks quite differ\u00ad ent from ordinary tertiary packaging. There is no question that customers accept the little house with enthusiasm and place it in the shop for children to play in. Others want to present the unique packaging at events and show users how recycling and environmental protection can be innova\u00ad tively combined. The new transport carton has many advantages that go beyond playful recycling and benefit the environ\u00adment. For example, the packaging mate\u00ad rial is made from 100 per cent waste paper. The production company is located in the region, barely 60 kilometres from Weleda France. Due to the short distance to the place of use, the CO2 footprint in the eco\u00ad balance can be reduced. The new closure system also has a positive effect on the eco\u00adbalance: the transport carton is glued with parcel tape made of paper and no longer wrapped with stretch film. Three tons of plastic film can be avoided per year. But why the format of a house? The main purpose of the pointed roofs is to prevent further cartons from being stacked on top of fragile products. This reliably reduces the rate of damaged articles. The small cardboard house thus protects sensitive goods and allows the cardboard a continued existence - to the delight of many children.Innovative shipping packagingNext target: 1,000 days without an accident at work With almost 1,500 accident-free days or four years without an accident, Weleda Brazil had set an in-house record for labora- tory work up until 2015. Due to absences and stand\u00adin sit\u00ad uations, this high figure could no longer be achieved. By 2019, at least 500 accident\u00adfree days were recorded again - supported by in\u00ad tensive discussions, the \"Week\u00ad ly Dialogue on Safety\". Further measures are now being planned, such as safety control points. Be\u00ad cause in the next stage Weleda Brazil is trying to achieve 1,000 accident\u00adfree days. Combined line for natural and organic cosmetics A new filling and packaging line was designed for the Schw\u00e4b - isch Gm\u00fcnd site in 2019. It replaces two old lines and can fill both aluminium and plastic tubes in different sizes. The ma\u00ad chine is designed for a higher number of cycles and relieves the burden on employees as ad\u00ad ditional processes are automat\u00ad ed. In addition, the production ca\u00ad pacity can be expanded flexibly. The combined line will be put into operation at the beginning of 2021. Not only protects our products, but also delights children: the new shipping packaging. 33 04 Sustainable sites, production and logisticsMeaningful and effective work05 Weleda is a business enterprise and at the same time a place of human development based on common tasks.

In 2019, the campaign was supported by the state of Baden\u00ad W\u00fcrttemberg with 10,000 euros. Twice around the world with colleagues worldwide Cycling to work is healthy. But Marcel Locher of Weleda in Arlesheim was concerned with more than that when he wanted to combine national programmes into a world\u00ad wide movement. Employees from 11 countries are mean\u00ad while participating in Bike to Weleda. In the beginning there was an e-mail. In 2015 Marcel Locher wrote to colleagues in France and Germany: wouldn't they like to share their enthusiasm, at least virtually cycle with each other and thus even do something good for the planet? You bet! The idea of the \"bicycle freak\", as he calls himself, developed into a summer cam\u00ad paign in which a total of 228 colleagues from Argentina to New Zealand and Switzerland took part in 2019. This can be seen on a new website which last year was financed with 10,000 euros from the \"RadKULTUR programme of the German state of Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg. All the Weleda locations taking part are listed along one route, along with the most eager cyclists and the record that was pedalled last year: twice around the globe. What is com\u00ad ing in 2020? \"Hopefully one or two new additions!\" Across oceans, \"a completely different kind of solidarity\" has already developed, says Marcel Locher, for whom appreciation for others is just as im\u00ad portant in his work in the Sustainability team as it is in his volun\u00ad tary work, which is supported by many helpers. \"Nobody gets paid, but they get a smile and wonderful stories.\" Like from some col\u00ad leagues from the Brazilian metropolis of S\u00e3o Paulo for whom cycling there is too risky. They're nevertheless still in it. On foot.

Now we have developed a German variation from the English version. With the sentence, \"We dare to care. Inspired by anthroposophy, we dare to make a dif\u00ad ference,\" we have reformulated the Weleda purpose. The majority of our employees work in German\u00adspeaking countries. So that everyone can connect with the meaning of the sentence, we have therefore created a German version: Collaboration beyond company boundaries: this is what associative togetherness is all about. \"Associative collaboration is more than cooperation,\" explains Dr Isabella Hei\u00ad dinger, also responsible for human resources development at Weleda. \"We are trying to make company boundaries more elastic in order to work together on big issues that we cannot solve alone.Twice a year we meet with other com\u00ad panies like VAUDE, Lilly Pharma, GLS Bank and Systelios Klinik. We think about the experiments we can tackle together.\" What are we working on together? An associative course: in 2019, together with GLS Bank, we launched the experiment Associative Studies in Busi\u00ad ness Administration. We expect this to lead to a new quality in training - formed in different cultures, with broadened horizons and unique opportunities for personal and professional development. In Septem\u00ad ber 2019, the first associative student started (see interview in the middle). In 2020 we plan to allocate further asso- ciative study places. Associative leadership training: in September 2019, the first joint manage\u00ad ment training course took place - a new format that we developed together from four companies. A number of man agers from each of the companies involved took part. The response was so encour aging that we are planning the second module together. durch Anthroposophie, Inspired by anthro\u00ad posophy we courageously take new paths with love. ) The focus was not on literal translation but on meaning. \"The sentence should be filled with life,\" says Dr Isabella Heidinger, responsible for culture and identity at Weleda. What does the word \"love\" mean in this context? \"Love is not meant here as a nice feeling, but as an attitude: respectful, interested, caring, responsible.\"The German version of our self\u00adimage \"Associative collaboration is more than cooperation\" Robin Saffarian is happy to work for two companies.THREE QUESTIONS TO ROBIN SAFFARIAN, FIRST ASSOCIATIVE STUDENT AT WELEDA AND GLS BANK How did it come about that you are doing your training at two companies at once? I applied to Weleda. Then I was asked whether I would also like to do practical phases at GLS Bank. I think this is a wonderful opportunity and I get to be the first to do it - that's great. How has the training been going so far? I started my studies at Alanus Uni\u00ad versity in September 2019. From January to the end of February I was in the human resources department at Weleda. I will then spend the practical phase in summer at GLS Bank. What are you looking forward to in your studies? I am delighted to work for two com panies that are so concerned about sustainability. I also find it exciting to live in three different cities in one year - Bochum, Bonn and Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd. I am looking forward to meeting different people, seeing different places, get\u00ad ting involved in different areas. My wish is that Weleda becomes more committed to supporting women, babies and families and that it will become more involved in maternal care. Sheena Byrom, Great Britain Midwife, author and speakerA VIEW FROM OUTSIDE 38THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 How work can function without a manager People who can identify with their work get more involved and are more successful. Olga B\u00f6hme, Managing Director of Weleda Russia, was able to experience this at first hand. Since 2018, she and her team have been testing cooperative leadership with self\u00admanaging teams and greater freedom of decision\u00admaking. She tells us what that looks like in an interview. What were the first steps like? OLGA B\u00d6HME: First we had to prepare our\u00ad selves as a management team, because this change only works if you are willing to cede control and place your trust in others. We then changed the recruitment process and paid more attention to whether the applicants represented our values. In the marketing team we then started the first experiment of a self\u00admanaging team. What did this experiment look like? The six people on the team started to man\u00ad age themselves. This means that although they coordinate the strategic marketing plan with me, they decide everything else themselves or as a team. They also dis\u00ad tribute the tasks within the team itself. Sometimes this works well, sometimes not so well. Here it is my role to coach the team. Have there ever been setbacks? The whole thing is a process - with each month you understand better how it can work. We have worked out rules to\u00ad gether. We always adjust them after three months. Then we see what works and what doesn't. What successes have been achieved since the changeover? The team is highly motivated. You can feel the enthusiasm. We also receive feed\u00ad back time and again that the employees have grown through the responsibility. Joint activities are also an important compo\u00ad nent: yoga, Cross Fit and English lessons. In addition, we are all reading Reinvent \u00ad ing Organisations by Frederic Laloux. One of us prepares a chapter and we discuss it together. It welds us together and is fun. What are the next steps? Our vision is to build up the entire organ\u00ad isation in circles and thereby reduce hier\u00ad archies. I am often asked what such a structure can look like. I can't tell yet. But we already have ideas and are trying them out and then adapting them. There's no other way. I don't think there's any catch\u00adall solution.The team is highly motivated. You can feel the enthusiasm. The employ\u00ad ees have grown through the responsibility and trust. Olga B\u00f6hme Regional Director Northern, Central and Eastern Europe and Managing Director Weleda Russia 39 05 Meaningful and effective work #promotingculture Over the years, the European Church Music Festival has developed into a cul\u00ad tural event of distinction. Weleda has been a sponsor from the very beginning. Klaus Stemmler (Director, left ), Stepp (Weleda ) are looking forward to the festival. Cultural and social relationships and development06 We support our shared social life in many different ways, for example by promoting art and culture. Through our active involvement we make a contribution to the cohesion of our society and to the improvement of the essentials of life. Through our publications and action days we inspire people to lead sustainable and healthy lives. How music inspires us to ask about the questions of life Concerts, church services and master classes form a complete package during the three\u00adweek Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd European Church Music Festival, which is almost unique in Europe. Weleda has been one of the main spon\u00ad sors for 20 years. A misty nave. Dancers dressed in white, moving between standing visitors - there has never been anything like this in the 800-year history of the Romanesque Church of St John on the market square in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd. On August 6th 2020, however, the Moritz Ostrusch njak company will be here to give their \"Boids\" performance, one of the highlights of the festival. For the 33rd time, internation\u00ad ally renowned artists are being invited to make sacred music a tangible experience in 12 churches in the city and the surrounding area and \"to shed light on existential questions,\" as artistic director Klaus Stemmler says. \"Boids\" is a perfect illustration of this year's motto \"I and We\", with its focus on the behaviour of individuals in a group. At the opening concert on July 15th in the Church of St Augustine, in contrast, countertenor Philippe Jaroussky will perform baroque \"celes\u00ad tial music\" as a soloist with the L'Arpeggiata ensemble. \"All this is made possible by a great team and of course by supporters like Weleda AG,\" says Klaus Stemmler, who himself was a cathedral chorister for many years. \"We are all inspired by this task and our success encour\u00ad ages us to continue.\" In 2019, around 15,000 festival-goers took advantage of the opportunity to be deeply touched by music and personal encounters.

Green Beauty Days were held in Berlin and Vienna in September 2019 to enable users to explore this issue. Weleda experts ex\u00ad plained Weleda's quality stand\u00ad ards and care philosophy in ex\u00ad perience workshops. They showed the positive influence that sus\u00ad tainable care products have on the skin. A panel discussion in\u00ad spired guests to think about how they can integrate closeness to nature into their everyday lives. Donate instead of throwing away At events there are often sam- ples left over that are still per- fectly usable but no longer suitable for retail sale. We want to prevent these valuable prod- ucts from becoming waste. At the Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd site, such sample packs from the midwifery department are being sent to a social cause: they are being donated to the food shar\u00ad ing project carried out by the youth culture initiative Esper\u00ad anza. The initiative distributes food and donations of goods from commercial partners free of charge. Complementary medicine and natu\u00ad ral cosmetics require high\u00adquality medicinal plants. In the association Hortus officinarum we are making a contribution to the availability of biodynamic medicinal plant seeds. The basis for high\u00adquality medicinal plants is suitable seeds. Since 2008 the in\u00ad dependent non\u00adprofit association Hortus officinarum has been improving and main\u00ad taining the seed quality of many medicinal plant species. Its tasks include safeguard\u00ad ing proven sources and the propagation and cultivation of species for which the seeds are not available on the market or are not available in organic or biodynamic quality. The association also strives to preserve the genetic diversity of medicinal plant seeds and to protect them from privatisation and patenting. Among the 200 members of the association are medicinal plant nurser\u00ad ies, doctors, pharmacists, manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and natural and organic cosmetics - including Weleda. All those involved benefit from the cultivation work and the exchange of knowledge. In the Weleda medicinal plant gardens at the Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd and Arlesheim sites, Hortus representatives cultivate and document numerous medicinal plant species for seed cultivation. In Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, for example, a comparative cultivation of three seed sources of (garden ) valerian (Valeriana officinalis ) was carried out to determine whether the typical character\u00ad istics, such as growth form, smell and root growth, are present and whether the re\u00ad quirements of the pharmacopoeias for the ingredients are met. A source with opti\u00ad mal morphological characteristics and ingre\u00ad dients is now being further propagated. Over 30 species are currently being culti\u00ad vated for conservation. Hortus returns some in the Engadine. In this way the association contributes to the strengthen\u00ad ing of biodiversity.

In order to create awareness of sustainability and environmental protection, we invest in the en\u00ad vironmental education of pupils in Eastern Europe. With the support of the environmental movement EA in Russia, we began work\u00ad ing with Eastern European schools in the year under review. A total of 2,150 teach\u00ad ers and 43,000 pupils took part in the collaboration with Weleda in 2019. The schools are located in 77 Russian regions and seven other countries, including Ka\u00ad zakhstan, Georgia and Ukraine. For prima\u00ad ry and middle school pupils, materials that were both fun and educational were developed on the subjects of ecology and sustainability. To make it easily acces\u00ad sible to teachers, the teaching material is available on a web portal: Customers of the Australian online shop were invited to take part in a climate pro\u00ad tection campaign. All of the sales proceeds from September 20th went to Greenfleet, one of the largest non\u00adprofit environmen\u00ad tal protection organisations in Australia. Since 1997 Greenfleet has been initiating guidance for lesson planning, attractively animated presentations and other mate\u00ad rials for interactive games and tasks. The teachers taking part welcome the oppor\u00ad tunity to integrate environmental topics into their lessons: \"The project is very relevant. It is so important to make every effort to improve the environmental situation,\" commented a biology teacher from the southern Russian city of Rostov- on\u00adDon. A primary school teacher from Moscow reported that the children found many uses for old, unnecessary things in class: \"We were very surprised that things can be given away, exchanged or borrowed for a while.\" The collaborative work will be continued.projects to compensate for CO2 emis\u00ad sions. To this end, it has specialised in re\u00ad forestation and the protection of biodi\u00ad versity. The organisation has planted over 9.4 million trees and created more than 500 species-rich woodland areas. Over time, more than 3.4 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions have been off\u00ad set. At the same time, soil erosion is re\u00ad duced, water quality is improved and new habitats for flora and fauna are created. Weleda has contributed to these practical climate protection measures with 361 native trees. That is the number of native trees that have been planted using the sales proceeds from September 20th. Green\u00ad fleet uses the donations to offset CO2 emissions in both Australia and New Zea\u00ad land and to combat the consequences of climate change. At its Australian location, Weleda is looking for further options to protect and regenerate biodiversity in the region - especially after the devastation caused by the bush fires. More information can be found at www.hortus\u00adofficinarum.chGreenfleet climate protection project Working with schools I would like Weleda to support ideas and initiatives for a health system that is oriented towards the com\u00ad mon good, for example solidarity in financing and pay \u00ad ing for health instead of for medicines and equipment. Christian Felber, Austria Economist specialising in the common good and dance performerA VIEW FROM OUTSIDE 45 06 Cultural and social relationships and development #growth Daniel Kugler and Eileen Smith are managing our first global brand campaign which has the motto \"YOU ARE NATURE.\" We presented the campaign to people in the trade at Vivaness, the world's largest trade fair for natural and organic cosmetics in Nuremberg. Management and finance 07 A company is commercially successful when customers truly value its service and enable it to strengthen its financial resilience as a result. We regularly receive awards for our work. We are constantly working to improve the range of products we offer: with a customer\u00adfocused strategy and a high degree of commitment in our agencies around the world.All Weleda branches used the campaign for their marketing, as here Weleda South Korea in Seoul. \"YOU ARE NATURE.\" For the first time, Weleda AG is setting out its stall worldwide with a global brand campaign. This unified identity was launched in the first markets, the UK and Germany, in autumn 2019. Austria and Switzer\u00ad land followed at the beginning of 2020. The cam\u00ad paign aims to show how deeply the human being is rooted in nature - as are the diverse products of Weleda. How did the company's first joint brand campaign come about? DANIEL KUGLER: Products are becoming increasingly inter\u00ad changeable. Consumers are finding it more difficult to make purchasing decisions. This makes brands that people can trust because they know what they stand for more important. With our global brand campaign we want to highlight what sets us apart as a brand and makes our products so unique. What sets Weleda apart? EILEEN SMITH: What makes us special, in essence, is our deep understanding of the inseparable connection between people and nature: nature with its medicinal plants and natural raw materials is as alive as we are. With \"YOU ARE NATURE.\" we ex\u00ad press it very clearly. Weleda has stood for this since 1921. Can you give a specific example? DANIEL KUGLER: Because of this affinity between people and nature, it is important to us to bring the right product to the right person, tailored to his or her individual needs. For example, the skincare range for sensitive skin contains almond oil. Just as the almond protects its kernel with a shell, the oil gently and protectively wraps itself around the skin.What other aims does the campaign have? EILEEN SMITH: It is intended to make Weleda better known on a global level and at the same time increase the profile of the brand, especially among younger consumers. In addi\u00ad tion, major conventional brands are currently pushing into the growing natural and organic cosmetics sector and we want to position ourselves more clearly vis\u00ad\u00e0\u00advis them as well. \"YOU ARE NATURE.\" is the name of the campaign, four models are its \"face\"? DANIEL KUGLER: As a global company, diversity is a major issue for us. That's why we decided for the first time to choose four models from different cultural backgrounds. They can be seen in the video, the main tool of the campaign. What was it like developing the campaign? EILEEN SMITH: \"YOU ARE NATURE.\" is the result of close colla- boration between different departments, with the markets and our agency, all of which share the same strong passion for the brand. So it was fun!

Internationalisation once again proved to be the right strategy, as strengths and weaknesses in the different markets balanced each other out. D - A - CH region In our region with the highest sales we can look back on a very successful 2019. Sales in natural and organic cos\u00ad metics grew by more than 3 per cent com\u00ad pared to 2018. We were also able to in\u00ad crease our market share slightly. The growth drivers were primarily the new Skin Food products. The baby care range also recorded significant growth and here we now have a market share of almost 20 per cent. In the shower category, we held our own in the market with the two limited editions Sum\u00ad mer Garden Shower and Forest Harmony in particular. We see our efforts in terms of sustaina\u00ad bility and brand positioning rewarded once again: Weleda is the most sustainable cos\u00ad metics brand from the perspective of con\u00ad sumers in Germany. This was the finding of the Cosmetics 2019 sustainability study compiled by Facit Research. And accord\u00ad ing to the Brand Relevance Index, we ranked 17th among the most relevant brands in Germany, far ahead of our competitors.France, Southern Europe and South America region France In France, we are facing a difficult market environment due to the tense political situation. The negative news in the press and social media about homeopathy and about the discontinuation of reimburse\u00ad ment for homeopathic medicines is having a negative effect on the sale of our me\u00ad dicines. In natural and organic cosmetics, Weleda remains the market leader in the organic cosmetics segment and has gained market share in the pharmacy trade despite increasing competition. We also attribute this to the Skin Food range and the Baby Liniment Calendula cream, which were successfully launched in spring. The reim\u00ad bursement for homeopathic medicines has been reduced from 30 per cent to 15 per cent and will be discontinued from 2021. We expect a further negative impact on our sales. For this reason, a strategy has been developed for building a sustainable business model for the future. Italy The successful launch of Skin Food is hav\u00ad ing a positive effect on sales. In addition, we were able to increase the demand for our products through online offers. After restructuring in distribution, which led to a slight decline in sales, we expect a posi\u00ad tive impact on sales in 2020. Sales declined in the pharmaceuticals business, also be\u00ad cause of negative public opinion towards homeopathy. Spain We increased sales of natural and organic cosmetics despite strong competition. Distribution in perfumeries was strength\u00ad ened and is having a positive effect. We also opened our own online shop which boosted business via the Internet. In ad\u00ad dition to the increase in our market share as a mother and baby brand, consumers The reception area at the new offices of Weleda Italy #1 Weleda is the most sustainable cosmetics brand in Germany. 52THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 have shown great interest in the expansion of the Skin Food range which has become a real growth driver for the company. In June 2019, the distribution of pharmaceu\u00ad ticals was discontinued as low demand in Spain meant maintaining the segment could no longer be justified in business terms. Brazil The business in over\u00adthe\u00adcounter medi\u00ad cines continued to grow at double\u00addigit rates. We gained market share through our flagship product Ansiodoron. In natural and organic cosmetics we recorded stable sales growth. Overall, the demand for natu\u00ad ral and organic cosmetics products and over\u00adthe\u00adcounter herbal medicines is in\u00ad creasing in Brazil. Chile The national crisis with violent riots throughout the country had a negative im\u00ad pact on our sales. Until October, however, we recorded a very positive sales trend in natural and organic cosmetics and phar\u00ad maceuticals, mainly owing to successful social media campaigns and effective measures in retail. Argentina The political situation is tense and business has suffered as a result. After the sharp depreciation of the currency in August 2018, the market recovered at the beginning of 2019. However, price increases and inflation led to a drop in sales. Thanks to our experience in crisis management, we continue to look to the future with optimism.North America and Western Europe region North America The trend reversal in North America continued in 2019 with strong growth well above the overall expansion in the market. The introduction of the new Skin Food range was a great success. This strong growth made Skin Food the best\u00ad selling hand and body lotion in natural and organic cosmetics retail. Growth was achieved through several channels, in particular through the customers Whole Foods and Amazon.United Kingdom Despite the difficult economic situation caused by Brexit, we recorded stable growth in natural and organic cosmetics and expanded sales. Various market\u00ad ing measures boosted sales of the new Skin Food products and strengthened brand awareness. Pharmaceuticals sales also grew through new distribution channels. Prof itability increased by 50 per cent thanks to excellent cost control and growing revenues.3.5 % growth in sales of natural and organic cosmetics in 2019 in our key region D - A - CH. Skin Food - a success story It has been around since 1926 - the skin cream or simply just Skin Food. In 2019, three products were added to this popular universal cream and it quickly became a worldwide success. The launch of the Skin Food range was the biggest product innovation since the 2009 Pomegranate range. Years of testing and market research preceded the launch. An interdisciplinary and international team of mar- keting specialists and research and development experts worked closely together to launch Skin Food Light, Skin Food Body Butter and Skin Food Lip Balm in addition to the classic Skin Food. That the effort was worth- while was shown in February 2019 at Vivaness, the world's largest trade fair for natural and organic cosmetics in Nuremberg, where the new Skin Food products won the Best New Product Award for the most innovative new product. Worldwide, the new Skin Food products were the main growth drivers in 2019 and won many prizes from Australia to the USA. The expansion of the Skin Food range is a good example of how to modernise a product with roots going back to the very beginnings of Weleda and make it fit for the future. Modernised and fit for the future: the successful Skin Food range 53 07 Management and financeBenelux 2019 was a very strong year for the Benelux countries with growth of almost 10 per cent and a sharp increase in prof- itability. Growth was evident in both the Netherlands and Belgium and in all major product categories, including pharmaceuti\u00ad cals. The main growth drivers were the new Skin Food products and the expansion of sales in Belgian pharmacies. The City Spas also made a significant contribution to total sales. Northern, Central and Eastern Europe region Russia Weleda Russia remained on a growth tra\u00ad jectory and recorded a very successful year in 2019. This was due to sales growth through various channels, including per\u00ad fumery, pharmacies and online. Successful 360-degree marketing campaigns did much to raise brand awareness and, as a result, led to significant sales growth. Ukraine Weleda Ukraine continued its double- digit growth in 2019. We attribute this to healthy growth for the baby and pregnan\u00ad cy products and a general increase in brand awareness. Increased sales in online retail were also a success factor.Scandinavia In Sweden, after years of only moderate growth, sales increased by a gratifying 20 per cent. This was primarily due to the new Skin Food products. There has also been a lot of change in other areas: a new organisational structure was put in place and a channel strategy for natural and organic cosmetics was developed. In Den\u00ad mark and Norway, the new Skin Food products likewise generated sales growth. The Weleda pharmacy in J\u00e4rna was closed owing to changes in government regula\u00ad tions for anthroposophic medicines. Growth driver: the new Skin Food products generated signifi- cant sales growth in all markets. Growth in a difficult market environment The uncertain political and economic situation in Russia is weakening purchasing power. It is therefore all the more pleasing that Weleda's sales are constantly on the rise. Within three years, the Weleda Russia team has managed to double sales. And this despite the fact that competition in Russia is fierce - many global players are meanwhile trying to enter the market with their natural pro- ducts and want a slice of the cake. Weleda products are now an established feature of chemists and pharmacies and sales in online distribution also grew rapidly in 2019. Looking back on a successful 2019: the team at Weleda Russia Increased sales in online retail were a success factor in 2019. 54THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Czech Republic Once again our team achieved double\u00addigit growth in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The expansion of the Skin Food range and the strong focus on baby care contributed most to this. Our marketing and sales team orchestrated campaigns in all channels for both product lines, including a tram with a Weleda Skin Food look in Prague. Exports to Central and Eastern European countries In 2019, we again recorded stable growth for our export markets in Central and East\u00ad ern Europe, especially in the Balkans and Georgia, while Israel registered double\u00addig\u00ad it growth rates in its market and was able to further expand its market position.Asia / Pacific region Asia In 2019, the Asian region again showed double\u00addigit growth. The new subsidiary in South Korea made a major contribution to this. The export country with the strongest growth was once again China, although we can only supply a partial range here be\u00ad cause of import regulations - animal test\u00ad ing is required that is unacceptable for us. Japan, still Weleda's largest Asian market, likewise recorded double\u00addigit growth. Australia and New Zealand The strong double\u00addigit growth in natural and organic cosmetics continued in both countries. Skin Food is now the number one seller in New Zealand, surpassing the mother and baby and facial care lines. The pharmaceuticals business was unfortu\u00ad nately affected by a recall of baby powder products due to packaging defects. How\u00ad ever, the trend remained positive and sales are picking up again.Just one of many marketing measures: Skin Food advertising on a tram in Prague In October 2019, Weleda South Korea introduced itself to the press and business partners at the Swiss embassy in Seoul.In 2019, the natural and organic cosmetics business grew at double-digit rates in Australia and New Zealand. 55 07 Management and financeWhy open a City Spa in Hamburg in particular? RITA WIRTZ: We conducted market research for the whole of Germany which told us where our potential customers live. Ham\u00ad burg and Stuttgart were top of the list, yet the two cities are very different. We want to learn from this in order to fur\u00ad ther develop the project. How is the Spa doing so far? When I see people before and after treat\u00ad ment, I am proud of what our products achieve in combination with professional application. The people are radiant and at peace. We are the intermediary between people and the power of nature. As with the City Spas in the Netherlands, we attach great importance to high\u00adquality and sus\u00ad tainable materials in warm and restrained colours. What is the long-term goal of Weleda City Spas? Our dream is to open a network of Weleda City Spas in Europe to support people in their well-being. Up to now we have had our products for this purpose. In the Spa we come into direct contact with our users. We learn a great deal about their needs and in return receive a lot of affirmation of and trust for the effort we make together at Weleda. The market for massages and cosmetic applications is growing rapidly. Why? Today we communicate ever more quick\u00ad ly and intensively through digital means. That this is stressful is undisputed. A mas\u00ad sage reduces the stress hormone corti\u00ad sol and lowers the heart rate. Regular mas\u00ad sages have a positive effect on the im\u00ad mune system. The neuronal centres of the reward system are stimulated. What specific steps are planned now? The next City Spa in Stuttgart will follow in late summer 2020. Despite the tight real estate market, we have found a spot in the middle of the city with assistance from the Stuttgart local authority. The Spa will also include a room for workshops. In prin\u00ad ciple, Weleda sees opportunities to devel\u00ad op a third business segment with its Spas, alongside natural and organic cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.Already planning the next steps: Project Manager Rita Wirtz Weleda City Spa opened in Hamburg After successfully opening four City Spas in the Netherlands, Weleda added its first German location in Hamburg\u00adBlankenese in January 2020. Project Manager Rita Wirtz tells us how the Spa got started and what next steps are planned. When I see people before and after treatment, I am proud of what our products achieve in combination with professional application. Rita Wirtz Project Manager 56THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Excellent! In 2019, we won numerous awards worldwide for our commitment. We consider these awards to be a significant recognition of our work. They motivate us to continue on our path: for healthy nature, responsible management and effective products.

Business performance The Weleda Group increased total sales to over EUR 429 million in 2019. The distribution of growth rates as well as the absolute increase in sales indicates that internationalisation continues to develop well. Above all, the increase in sales in Central and East\u00ad ern Europe including Russia and Ukraine, the USA, and the com- pany established in South Korea in the previous year contributed significantly to the increase. Weleda opened or set up further City Spas in Amsterdam and Hamburg in the fourth quarter of 2019. The opening of a Spa in Stuttgart is being planned. The Spas, which are aesthetically and sustainably equipped, offer massages and facial treatments in accordance with Weleda's holistic philosophy. Net result decreased slightly compared to 2018 mainly due to a lower operating result. The profit generated, coupled with stable net working capital, further increased the equity ratio and thus the resilience of the company. Pioneering decisions about the future are only possible on the solid basis which was estab\u00ad lished in the last years. Some of the most important strategic decisions for the next years are the renewal of our infrastruc\u00ad ture with the core element of a new logistics site in Germany, investments in research and development, the implementation of the natural and organic cosmetics and the pharmaceuticals strategy, the further development of our range of services offered, the continuation of the digital transformation, the implemen\u00ad tation of collegial leadership and the Sustainability Programme 2018 - 2022. Employees The Weleda Group had an average of 2,168 full-time employees in 2019 (previous year: 2,116 ). Weleda employees (previous year: 1,091 ). Risk assessment Risks are an integral part of business operations. A risk manage\u00ad ment system that enables the identification, analysis, control and monitoring of significant risks in the corporate environment is therefore particularly important for Weleda. In order to identi\u00ad fy risks in good time and determine the appropriate action, our management regularly assesses, at Group level and at the level of Weleda AG, any significant internal and external risks that may impact the entire corporate environment. The Board of Directors discusses and approves the results of the risk assessment and any measures every year.Development of sales The net sales of the Weleda Group for the 2019 financial year amount to EUR 429.3 million (previous year: EUR 412.3 million ). This corresponds to a growth rate of 4.1 per cent, or EUR 17.0 mil\u00ad lion, compared with the previous year (adjusted for exchange rate effects: 3.9 per cent, or EUR 16.3 million ). This means that Weleda held up well in 2019 despite an intensely competitive market. The net sales from the individual company Weleda AG decreased by 1.5 per cent or CHF 4.6 million year-on-year, mainly driven by the translation of the German branch into CHF.

Sales in this region increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 211.8 mil\u00ad lion (previous year: EUR 204.0 million ). Sales in France decreased by 4.2 per cent and amounted to EUR 89.4 million (previous year: EUR 93.4 million ). Sales in the other regions increased by a total of 11.4 per cent to EUR 128.1 million (previous year: EUR 115.0 mil\u00ad lion ). The positive exchange rate impact on sales was EUR 0.2 million. Operating result Compared to the previous year, the consolidated operating result (EBIT ) of the Weleda Group decreased by EUR 5.2 million to EUR 15.9 million (previous year: EUR 21.1 million ) mainly due to the development in France. The EBIT margin decreased to 3.7 per cent (previous year: 5.1 per cent ). The operating result (EBIT ) in the separate financial statements of Weleda AG decreased, compared to the previous year, by CHF 0.8 million to CHF 3.6 million.Global sales of the natural and organic cosmetics business seg\u00ad ment grew by 6.3 per cent compared with the previous year (5.2 per cent sales growth in 2018 ). The growth regions of West\u00ad ern Europe, North America, Asia and Pacific as well as Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia and Ukraine, were primarily re\u00ad sponsible for the improvement. Sales increased by 3.5 per cent in the D - A - CH region. Sales growth in all other countries totalled 9.2 per cent. Development of sales in the business segments Natural and organic cosmetics accounted for EUR 327.0 million or 76.2 per cent of global sales (previous year: EUR 307.6 million or 74.6 per cent ). The sales generated by pharmaceuticals decreased to EUR 102.3 million (previous year: 104.7 million ), corresponding to 23.8 per cent (previous year: 25.4 per cent ) of total sales. Global sales of the pharmaceuticals business segment decreased by 2.3 per cent in 2019 (previous year: decrease of 3.6 per cent ). Sales in the D - A - CH region, which generated about 48 per cent of sales, increased by about 5.0 per cent compared with the pre\u00ad vious year. In addition, growth impulses came from the South America region with growth in sales of 18.1 per cent (adjusted for exchange rate effects ). In France, the year\u00adon\u00adyear decline in sales was 12.4 per cent. Sales in the other markets decreased by 10.8 per cent (adjusted for exchange rate effects ) compared to the previous year.Market performance of the Weleda Group by region in million EUR (exchange rate\u00adadjusted changes from the previous year ) Total: EUR 429.3 millionD - A - CH Germany, Austria, Switzerland211.8 (+ 3.3 %) North America, United Kingdom, Benelux50.1 (+ 8.0 %) Northern, Central, Eastern Europe Scandinavia, Russia, Czech Republic, Ukraine, CEE29.4 (+ 24.5 %) FISSA France, Italy, Spain, South America124.3 (- 1.8 %) Asia / Pacific 13.7 (+ 20.9 %)Natural and organic cosmetics and pharmaceuticals Weleda Group Total: EUR 429.3 millionWeleda natural and organic cosmetics76.2 % Weleda pharmaceuticals 23.8 % Operating result (EBIT ) in million EUR 2019 2018 2017 2016 201523.921.1 18.7 32.915.9 60THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Result for the year The consolidated result for the year decreased by 9.3 per cent to EUR 13.0 million compared to the previous year. The financial result amounted to EUR - 0.5 million and was up on the previous year (previous year: EUR - 1.1 million ). Mainly due to lower results within the Group and a tax refund in France, income taxes de\u00ad creased to EUR 2.5 million (previous year: EUR 5.6 million ). Ger\u00ad many accounted for the biggest share of income taxes with EUR 1.8 million (previous year: EUR 3.4 million ). The separate financial statements of Weleda AG showed a gain of CHF 0.2 million (previous year: loss of CHF 0.5 million ).Financial and assets situation The equity ratio of the Weleda Group again increased and amounts to 52.9 per cent (previous year: 51.1 per cent ) due to the net result for the year. Consolidated cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 26.6 million (previous year: EUR 9.1 million ). Cash flows from investing activities increased, compared with the previous year, by EUR 3.1 million to EUR 14.3 million (previous year: EUR 11.2 million ). Of the gross investments of EUR 14.5 million, EUR 1.9 million were invested in intangible assets and EUR 12.6 mil\u00ad lion in property, plant and equipment. Around three\u00adquarters of the investments in property, plant and equipment or intangible assets were made at the two main production sites in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd and Arlesheim. Cash flow after investing activities amount\u00ad ed to EUR 12.3 million (previous year: EUR - 2.0 million ). Cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 11.9 million to EUR 47.7 million at year-end. This resulted in a net financial cred\u00ad it balance of EUR 47.7 million (previous year: EUR 35.8 million ). Cash flow from operating activities for Weleda AG amounted to CHF 26.0 million (previous year: CHF 3.9 million ) in the year under review and, after the deduction of net investments of CHF 16.5 million (previous year: CHF 16.5 million ), came to CHF 9.5 (previous year: CHF - 12.6 million (previous year: CHF 9.0 million ) in interest\u00adbearing liabilities in the year under review.Result attributable to shareholders in million EUR 2019 2018 2017 2016 201511.214.3 12.9 10.113.0 Investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in million EUR 2019 2018 2017 2016 20157.610.9 12.9 8.014.5 61 07 Management and financeExtraordinary events In the year under review there were no significant extraordinary events. Research and development activities The growth of natural and organic cosmetics was mainly driven by market expansion and innovation. In pharmaceutical research, Weleda has continued to press ahead with the development of competencies. For both segments together, Weleda again invest\u00ad ed double\u00addigit millions in research and development this year. Outlook for 2020 The current COVID-19 situation makes a forecast for 2020 diffi\u00ad cult for Weleda as well. In view of the current market conditions, planned innovation, the market presence and the brand strength of Weleda, we see continued good opportunities for growth of natural and organic cosmetics in most of the countries. In coun\u00ad tries with particularly severe restrictions, we expect below\u00adaver\u00ad age growth or even declines. At Group level, we anticipate a de\u00ad cline in sales of pharmaceuticals, mainly due to developments in France. Overall, we expect that the decisions taken for the future, such as investments in research and development, the implementation of the pharmaceuticals strategy, the product\u00admix strategy for natural and organic cosmetics and the further mar\u00ad ket development outside Europe will have a positive effect on the operating result. On the other hand, the COVID-19 situation particularly affects productivity and sales in some countries. Overall, we therefore expect stable overall sales and a less posi\u00ad tive result than in 2019. 62THE WELEDA GROUP AND WELEDA AG ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Consolidated Annual Financial Report 2019 Weleda Group BALANCE SHEET OF THE WELEDA GROUP 64 INCOME STATEMENT OF THE WELEDA GROUP 65 CASH FLOW STATEMENT OF THE WELEDA GROUP 66 STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY OF THE WELEDA GROUP 67 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE WELEDA GROUP 68 REPORT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITOR 80 Statutory auditor Ernst & Young AG Basel, Switzerland Corporate headquarters Weleda AG Dychweg 14, 4144 Arlesheim, Switzerland Tel. +41 www.weleda.com, www.weleda.ch Branch in AG Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd Germany Tel. +49 7171 91 90 www.weleda.deContact person for shareholders Paul Mackay, Chairman of the Board of Directors Secretariat and share register Sabine Lexen Tel. +41 61 705 22 02 63Balance sheet of the Weleda Group Assets in 1,000 EUR Notes 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 47,689 35,794 Trade receivables 1 66,536 64,655 Other current receivables 2 11,135 16,412 Inventories 3 68,241 63,787 Prepaid expenses and 5,428 5,179 Total current assets 199,029 185,827 Non\u00adcurrent assets Financial 4 1,677 1,808 Investments in non\u00adcontrolling interests 4 1,019 850 Property, plant and equipment 4 72,599 69,966 Intangible assets 4 3,631 3,600 Total non\u00adcurrent 76,224 Total assets 277,955 262,051 Liabilities and shareholders' equity in 1,000 EUR Notes 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Liabilities Current liabilities Trade payables 5 20,176 18,468 Other current liabilities 6 11,552 12,184 Current provisions 7 3,362 5,575 Accrued expenses and income 21,580 18,386 Total Shareholders' equity Share capital 3,800 3,800 Non\u00advoting share capital 7,600 7,600 Capital reserves 8,716 9,600 Retained earnings 126,715 112,749 Treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares 8 -

Key figures and changes are calculated based on the exact amount and not the reported rounded amount. Consolidation principles Accounting principles This Annual Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with uniform accounting standards (Weleda Accounting Manual ). These accounting standards comply with the provisions on commercial accounting of the Swiss Code of Obligations (article 957 - 963 b OR ). The consolidated financial statements of the Weleda Group comply with the law and the articles of incorporation. Certain items of the balance sheet as well as the income statement are summarised in order to provide the reader with a better overview. These items are explained in detail in the notes. Scope of consolidation In addition to Weleda AG Arlesheim and its branch Weleda AG Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 23 subsidiaries are fully consolidated within the Weleda Group statements. These companies are, without exception, Group com panies and controlled by Weleda AG Arlesheim. Weleda AG has direct or indirect investments of more than 50 per cent in these companies. In the year under review Weleda Services GmbH was incorporated and added to the scope of consolidation. The non\u00adcontrolling interest in Japan is consolidated using the equity method. The consolidated companies are listed in the notes. Consolidation method The consolidated financial statements are based on the annual statements of the Group companies as at December 31st 2019, which are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Weleda Accounting Manual. The consolidation period is the calendar year. Capital consolidation is carried out in accordance with the Anglo\u00adSaxon purchase method. For the fully consolidated companies, assets, liabilities, expens\u00ad es and income are stated at 100 per cent. Non-controlling interests in consolidated shareholders' equity and profit / loss for the year are disclosed separately. The carrying amounts of the parent company's investment are offset against the current shareholders' equity of the subsidiary companies. In accordance with the full consolidation method, assets and liabili\u00ad ties as well as expenses and income also of those companies in which a third party is involved are in\u00ad cluded in full in the Group accounts. Third\u00adparty shares of shareholders' equity and of the results of consolidated companies are disclosed separately. Currency translation The financial statements of consolidated companies in foreign currencies are translated as follows: current assets, non\u00adcurrent assets and liabilities are translated at year\u00adend rates (rate on balance sheet date ), shareholders' equity at historical rates. The income statement and the cash flow statement are translated using average rates for the year. The resulting currency translation effects are booked directly in retained earnings without impacting profit and loss. The following currency exchange rates are applied:ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 WELEDA GROUP 68 Intragroup transactions, balances and intercompany profits All intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated, as were all intercompany profits stated in the balance sheet. Balance sheet and valuation principles In general, assets and liabilities are valued on an individual basis in so far as they are material and cannot be treated together as a group as is customary due to their similarity. Sales recognition Sales are recognised on the transfer of risks and benefits to customers or upon provision of the service. This generally corresponds to delivery of the products. Current assets Receivables and other current assets are reported at their nominal values. The general risk of loss and individual credit risk have been accounted for on the basis of value adjustments. The valuation of inven\u00ad tories is conducted on the basis of acquisition or production cost while observing the principle of lower of cost or market. Non\u00adcurrent assets Acquired intangible assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition, less amortisation. Property, plant and equipment is recognised at acquisition or production cost minus depreciation. Small\u00advalue intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a value of less than EUR 1,000 are depreciated in full in the year they are added. Financial assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition. Equity holdings are consolidated using the equity method. Where there are indications of non\u00adcurrent assets being overvalued, carrying values have been reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted. Liabilities Liabilities are recognised based on their nominal value. Provisions for pension plans and similar obli\u00ad gations are determined based on actuarial principles. The remaining provisions cover all recognisable risks for un determined obligations. Liabilities are recognised at the respective amount at which they are to be repaid.YEAR-END RATES in EUR 2019 Rates on balance sheet date2019 Average rates2018 Rates on balance sheet date2018 Average CHF (Swiss franc ) WELEDA voting and non\u00advoting shares Treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares are recognised at cost at the time of acquisition. The holding of treasury voting and non-voting shares is disclosed as a negative item in equity. Upon resale, the profit or loss is allocated directly to the voluntary retained earnings. Leasing transactions Leasing and rental contracts are recognised on the basis of legal ownership. Accordingly, expenses as lessee are recognised on an accrual basis, whereas the leased or rented objects themselves are not recognised. The total amount of outstanding non\u00adcurrent rental and leasing obligations is included in the notes.ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 WELEDA GROUP 70 Notes to the balance sheet and the income statement 1 Trade receivables 2 Other current receivables 3 Inventoriesin 1,000 EUR 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 From third parties 65,862 64,162 From companies in which a non\u00adcontrolling interest is held 511 350 From shareholders 163 143 Total trade receivables 66,536 64,655 in 1,000 EUR 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 From third parties 11,128 16,399 From companies in which a non\u00adcontrolling interest is held 7 13 Total other current receivables 11,135 16,412 in 1,000 EUR 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Raw, auxiliary and operating materials 17,862 17,755 Unfinished products 11,201 10,637 Finished products and trade goods 41,506 38,097 Value adjustments on inventories - 2,328 - 2,702 Total inventories 68,241 63,787ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 WELEDA GROUP 714 Non-current assets Financial assets include non\u00adcurrent amounts due from third parties, securities and investments of less than 20 per cent.

Board of Directors' responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the consolida\u00ad tion and valuation principles as set out in the notes. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and main\u00ad taining an internal control system relevant to the prepa\u00ad ration of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circum\u00ad stances. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these con\u00ad solidated financial statements based on our audit. We con\u00ad ducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the con\u00ad solidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assess\u00ad ment of the risks of material misstatement of the consol\u00ad idated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's prepa\u00ad ration of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal con\u00ad trol system. An audit also includes evaluating the appro\u00ad priateness of the accounting policies used and the rea\u00ad sonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2019 comply with Swiss law and the consolidation and valuation principles as set out in the notes. Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licens\u00ad ing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA ) and in\u00ad dependence (article 728 CO ) and that there are no circum\u00ad stances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728 a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We recommend that the consolidated financial state\u00ad ments submitted to you be approved.

Key figures and changes are calculated based on the exact amount and not the reported rounded amount. Accounting principles This Annual Financial Report has been prepared in accordance with uniform accounting standards (Weleda Accounting Manual ). These accounting standards comply with the provisions on commercial accounting of the Swiss Code of Obligations (article 957 - 963 b OR ). The Annual Financial Report of Weleda AG complies with the law and the articles of incorporation. Certain items of the balance sheet as well as the income statement are summarised in order to provide the reader with a better overview. These items are explained in detail in the notes. Currency translation The accounts of the German business establishment are stated in euro and translated at year\u00adend as follows: current assets, non\u00adcurrent assets and liabilities are translated at year\u00adend rate (rate on balance sheet date ), shareholders' equity at historical rate. The income statement and the cash flow statement are translated using the average rate for the year. The resulting currency translation effects are booked directly in the income statement. The following currency exchange rates are applied: Balance sheet and valuation principles In general, assets and liabilities are valued on an individual basis in so far as they are material and cannot be treated together as a group as is customary due to their similarity. Sales recognition Sales are recognised on the transfer of risks and benefits to customers or upon provision of the service. This generally corresponds to delivery of the products. Current assets Receivables and other current assets are reported at their nominal values. The general risk of loss and individual credit risk have been accounted for on the basis of value adjustments. The valuation of inven\u00ad tories is conducted on the basis of acquisition or production cost while observing the prin ciple of lower of cost or market.YEAR-END RATE in CHF 2019 Rate on balance sheet date2019 Average rate2018 Rate on balance sheet date2018 Average rate 1 EUR (euro ) 1.087 1.112 1.127 1.155ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 WELEDA AG 86 Non\u00adcurrent assets Acquired intangible assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition, less amortisation. Property, plant and equipment is recognised at acquisition or production cost minus depreciation. Small\u00advalue intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a value of less than CHF 1,080 / EUR 1,000 are depreci\u00ad ated in full in the year they are added. Financial assets are recognised at the cost of acquisition. Equity investments are also recognised at acquisition values and depreciated over five years. Additions to equity investments of less than CHF 100,000 are fully depreciated in the year of acquisition. Where there are indications of non\u00adcurrent assets being overvalued, carrying values have been reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted. Liabilities Liabilities are recognised on the basis of nominal value. Provisions for pension plans and similar obli\u00ad gations are determined based on actuarial principles. The remaining provisions covered all recognisable risks for un determined obligations. Liabilities are recognised at the respective amount at which they are to be repaid. Treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares Treasury voting and non\u00advoting shares are recognised at cost at the time of acquisition. The holding of treasury voting and non-voting shares is disclosed as a negative item in equity. Upon resale, the profit or loss is allocated directly to the voluntary retained earnings. Leasing transactions Leasing and rental contracts are recognised on the basis of legal ownership. Accordingly, expenses as lessee are recognised on an accrual basis, whereas the leased or rented objects themselves are not recognised. The total amount of outstanding non\u00adcurrent rental and leasing obligations is included in the notes.ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 WELEDA AG 87Notes to the balance sheet and the income statement 1 Trade receivables 2 Other current receivables 3 Financial assets 4 Equity investmentsin 1,000 CHF 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 From third parties 33,234 35,342 From associated companies 18,156 18,149 From shareholders 177 161 Total trade receivables 51,567 53,652 in 1,000 CHF 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 13,298 From 3,584 2,909 Total 11,272 16,207 in 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Loans to Group companies 16,225 14,051 Other financial assets 511 573 Total financial assets 16,736 14,624 in 1,000 CHF 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Investments in Group companies with an interest of more than 50 per cent 9,926 14,565 Other equity investments 78 104 Total equity investments 10,004 14,669ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 WELEDA AG 88 5 Trade payables 6 Other current liabilities 7 Non-current interest-bearing liabilities All financial liabilities due within the following 12 months are disclosed in current interest-bearing liabilities.in 1,000 CHF 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 To third parties 13,277 10,867 To associated companies 229 1,598 To the statutory auditor Ernst & Young 79 32 Total trade payables 13,585 12,497 in 1,000 CHF 31.12.2019 2,935 To Group companies 22,101 23,423 To the statutory auditor Ernst & Young 0 48 To shareholders 35 25 Total other current liabilities 25,445 26,431 in 1,000 CHF Residual maturity 1 to 5 years 17,643 20,989 Residual maturity over 5 years 10,870 11,270 interest\u00adbearing liabilities 28,513 32,259ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2019 WELEDA AG 898 Provisions Other provisions comprise, among other things, currency provisions for unrealised exchange rate gains on non\u00adcurrent financial positions, reserves for strategic projects, restructuring liabilities for the Weleda UK Pension Fund and provisions for jubilee and other long-term service bonuses. 9 Treasury voting and non-voting shares 2019, 160 non-voting shares were sold at an average transaction price of CHF 3,680.

Board of Directors' responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the re\u00ad quirements of Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, im\u00ad plementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsi\u00ad ble for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are rea\u00ad sonable in the circumstances. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these finan\u00ad cial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and per\u00ad form the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material mis\u00ad statement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the finan\u00ad cial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assess\u00ad ments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evi\u00ad dence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2019 comply with Swiss law and the com\u00ad pany's articles of incorporation. Report on other legal requirements We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licens\u00ad ing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA ) and in\u00ad dependence (article 728 CO ) and that there are no circum\u00ad stances incompatible with our independence. In accordance with article 728 a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the com\u00ad pany's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

This label guarantees that biodiversity is pre\u00ad served and used sustainably in the culti\u00ad vation, harvesting and further processing of the plants. Weleda is also committed to treating all supply chain participants fairly and paying fair prices.Italy Weleda Italia S. r. l.

The non\u00adprofit association promotes the respectful procurement of natural raw materials. The ambitious standard for ethical procurement promotes sus\u00ad tainable economic growth, local development and the protection and sustainable use of biodiversity. In accordance with our vision \"Creating a world in which the health and beauty of human beings and nature continually un\u00ad fold\" and our mission \"Weleda sustainably develops its business in harmony with nature and the human being\", we have implemented the UEBT standard as a sustainability management system along all our natural raw material supply chains. In 2018, UEBT offered a certification programme for ethical pro\u00ad curement (ESS ). UEBT certifies procurement systems of companies that respect people and biodiversity. As a UEBT member, we are committed to innovation and procure\u00ad ment practices that contribute to a world in which people and bio\u00ad diversity can thrive. With this in mind, and as part of our sustaina\u00ad bility strategy, we have decided to go one step further in our com\u00ad mitment and introduce the certification of our Ethical Sourcing System (ESS ) for all our natural raw materials used in our natural and organic cosmetics products. A subsequent risk analysis will help us to identify the need for lasting improvements and to determine what measures must be taken. As a next step, and as part of the certification programme, we are committed to taking further action along defined, so\u00adcalled priori\u00ad tised supply chains. This will allow us to reach even more actors and areas for cultivation and wild collection to improve ethical sourcing wherever necessary. We achieved the first certification in 2018 and had a second successful audit in June 2019.Certification scope in figures 2019 We had 657 approved supply chains, which means that 100 per cent of the raw materials used were evaluated. In 2019 we purchased 279 natural raw materials from 150 sup\u00ad pliers for natural and organic cosmetics. 50 of our supply chains are defined as prioritised for verification. Verification means that we confirm the information we have received from our suppliers for evaluation through on\u00adsite audits. Of these 50 prioritised supply chains, 34 audits were carried out in 2019, with all other audits to be carried out in 2020. Reasons for delays in audits are mainly of a time\u00adrelated nature. 2020 target Verification of all remaining prioritised supply chains Follow\u00adup of supplier measures and completion of verification audits The corrective measures from last year's audit are mainly adjust\u00ad ments in our process descriptions and internal training. These measures will be implemented in 2020. More internal training on communication 103NOTES UEBT CERTIFICATIONObservation Not all audits were carried out in 2019 as planned. There were diffi\u00ad culties with time planning (availability of auditors, suppliers, oper\u00ad ators on site ), coordination, language, but also with the different structures of the supply chains which require a more precise speci\u00ad fication of the UEBT standard and its application. Internal training measures with all relevant departments were necessary to better explain the requirements of the certification and their importance in day\u00adto\u00adday work. This training was con\u00ad ducted for R & D, marketing and project management and may be repeated regularly. The current certification is valid until June 2021.What are the guiding principles of the UEBT standard? Biodiversity conservation Sustainable use of biodiversity Sharing of benefits between companies and communities through the use of biodiversity Traceability to identify the origins of the natural ingredients Compliance with national and international regulations Adequate working conditions for employees and ensuring local food security No \"land grabbing\", instead measures to prevent illegal use What is the UEBT? The Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT ) provides a globally recog\u00ad nised standard for ethical trade in natural resources. The non\u00adprofit organisation is an offshoot of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD ) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD ). 104NOTES UEBT CERTIFICATION Transparent and solid business management Weleda places great value on a transparent management structure and an open communication culture. The rules for good corporate governance are laid down in the company's articles of association and organisational regulations. Control and risk management The primary objective of risk management is to ensure the long\u00ad term survival of the company - as a basis for further development. Risk reporting to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors takes place half\u00adyearly. The material content and elements of Weleda's Group\u00adwide risk policy have been documented and de\u00ad scribed in a comprehensive control and risk management system (KuRS ). The Audit Committee is a fundamental element of the manage\u00ad ment structure, with responsibility for compliance with Weleda's corporate governance.Audit Committee Members Two members of the Audit Committee, Dr J\u00fcrg Galliker (Chairman ) and Monique Bourquin, are also members of the Board of Directors. With Dr Patrick Scarpelli, partner at cctm AG in Basel, an external specialist is also represented. Tasks The function of the Audit Committee is to provide effective sup\u00ad port to the Board of Directors in monitoring corporate governance. This includes: - monitoring the integrity of financial reporting and the Group's internal control system as well as monitoring compliance with legal and internal regulations - monitoring the independence and performance of the independ\u00ad ent external auditors (auditors and Group auditors ) and the inter\u00ad nal auditing department 105NOTES CORPORATE GOVERNANCEWeleda worldwide Switzerland Weleda Dychweg 14 14 4144 Arlesheim Switzerland +41 61 701 16 92 Germany Weleda AG M\u00f6hlerstr. 3 - 5 73525 www.weleda.com.ar Australia Weleda Australia Pty Ltd Unit 16 No. 2 Daydream Street (Access via Daydream Street www.weleda.com.au Weleda Ges. m. b.
