Although no virological cure exists for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, existingtherapies to control viral replication and prophylaxis to minimise mother-to-child transmission makeelimination of HBV feasible. We aimed to estimate the national, regional, and global prevalence ofHBsAg in the general population and in the population aged 5 years in 2016, as well as coverage ofprophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment.MethodsIn this modelling study, we used a Delphi process that included a literature review in PubMed andEmbase, followed by interviews with experts, to quantify the historical epidemiology of HBVinfection. We then used a dynamic HBV transmission and progression model to estimate the country-level and regional-level prevalence of HBsAg in 2016 and the effect of prophylaxis and treatment ondisease burden.FindingsWe developed models for 120 countries, 78 of which were populated with data approved by experts.Using these models, we estimated that the global prevalence of HBsAg in 2016 was 3\u00b79% (95%uncertainty interval [UI] 3\u00b74-4\u00b76), corresponding to 291992000 (251513000-341114000)infections. Of these infections, around 29 million (10%) were diagnosed, and only 4\u00b78 million (5%) of94 million individuals eligible for treatment actually received antiviral therapy. Around 1\u00b78 (1\u00b76-2\u00b72)million infections were in children aged 5 years, with a prevalence of 1\u00b74% (1\u00b72-1\u00b76).

Less than 1% of mothers with a high viral load had received antiviraltherapy to reduce mother-to-child transmission.InterpretationOur estimate of HBV prevalence in 2016 differs from previous studies, potentially because we tookinto account the effect of infant prophylaxis and early childhood vaccination, as well as changingprevalence over time. Although some regions are well on their way to meeting prophylaxis andprevalence targets, all regions must substantially scale-up access to diagnosis and treatment to meetthe global targets.FundingJohn C Martin Foundation.IntroductionDiscovery of HBsAg in 1965 led to development of an effective vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV),which became available in 1981 and, given that untreated HBV can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, andhepatocellular carcinoma, represented the world's first anticancer vaccine. Althoughintroduction of the vaccine was widespread, its cost limited broad use in infants born in low-incomeand middle-income countries. This coverage expanded widely after Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance beganto support HBV vaccination programmes in 2001. However, after the introduction of highly effectivecurative therapies for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 2013, HBV became somewhat overshadowed in publichealth prioritisation, and its cure remains elusive. Accurate epidemiological assessments at thenational level are necessary to accurately establish the current disease burden and the effect ofexisting interventions, and to provide insight into priority actions for the future.In 2015, combating viral hepatitis by 2030 was included in the Sustainable Development Goals (3.3).Then, in 2016, the World Health Assembly passed the Global Health Sector Strategy on ViralHepatitis, which aims to eliminate HBV and HCV by 2030. The targets include 90% global coverage ofthree-dose infant vaccination by 2020; timely birth-dose vaccination in 50% of infants by 2020, and in90% by 2030; and prevalence in children aged 5 years of 1% by 2020, and 0\u00b71% by 2030. Reduction ofincidence among infants is important because most HBV infections in infants become chronic, whichis the leading source of new chronic HBV infections. As well as the prevention targets, the 2030targets include diagnosis of 90% of people infected with HBV and antiviral treatment of 80% of thosediagnosed and eligible for treatment. In addition to the global targets, specific WHO regions have settheir own objectives, which are often more aggressive than the World Health Assembly targets.Previous reports describing the country-level and regional prevalence of HBsAg haveprimarily consisted of meta-analyses and literature reviews. The most recent studies have reportedglobal prevalence estimates of 248 million or 257 million individuals with HBV infection. Thesereports were limited by their calculation of averages using a combination of robust and non-representative studies, studies done in different age groups, and studies done at differenttimepoints. Additionally, data in children are scarce because most studies only include adults andare not adjusted for the population by age and sex. Moreover, these estimates are historical and donot consider the effect of vaccination and other efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission.

The strategyset diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis targets to reduce prevalence among children aged 5years and liver-related deaths. Previous global reports of HBsAg prevalence follow traditionalsystematic review and meta-analysis procedures, while including studies among blooddonors, which typically report a low prevalence. However, most of these studies exclude theeffect of vaccination. Other studies report the use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and antiviraltreatment of pregnant women at the country level, but none has quantified the methods ofprophylaxes at a regional or global level. Additionally, any reports of cascade of care havebeen at the local or national level.Added value of this studyWe combined a traditional meta-analysis, national expert interviews, and modelling toestimate HBsAg prevalence, prophylaxis use, and proportion diagnosed and treated at thenational, regional, and global levels in 2016. We used a dynamic transmission and diseaseburden model that took into account the effect of prophylaxis and treatment on HBsAgprevalence. A Delphi process was used to strengthen the traditional systematic review process,and involved consultation with 620 experts to obtain feedback on inputs and outputs for 78national models. Another 42 models were developed on the basis of published data. Estimatesfor the remaining 80 countries were extrapolated from these 120 countries, which aloneaccounted for 93% of the world's population.Implications of all the available evidenceThe global prevalence reported here is higher than previous estimates because it excludedstudies done in blood donors and other non-representative populations. The diagnosis andtreatment data provide evidence of countries that have made progress. The data presentedhere are a marker on the road to elimination of hepatitis B and can support the creation ofnational strategies to meet the 2030 targets.One previous study used modelling to predict the future disease burden of HBV and proposepotential strategies to address this increasing public health problem. That study found that a targetof 90% reduction in new chronic infections and 65% reduction in mortality could be achieved byscaling up coverage of infant vaccination (to 90% of infants), birth-dose vaccination (to 80% ofneonates), use antivirals (to of HBeAg-positive and population-widetesting and treatment (to 80% of eligible people).The aims of this study were to quantify the national, regional, and global HBsAg prevalence in thegeneral population and in the population aged 5 years; to estimate use of prophylaxis for mother-to-child transmission; and to model the cascade of care (number of patients diagnosed, eligible fortreatment, and treated) in 2016.MethodsSearch strategy and selection criteriaIn this modelling study, we included all countries with a total population of 1\u00b70 million people ormore. We also included Fiji, Kiribati, and Belize because of our collaborations with the WHO RegionalOffice for the Western Pacific and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). We obtained inputdata for these countries through a literature review and a Delphi process, which used experts to fillany data gaps and to confirm data when available. Full details of data collection, scoring of datasources, Delphi process, and modelling are summarised in the appendix.For the literature review, we searched PubMed and Embase between Jan 1, 1960, and March 1, 2016,without language restrictions using the search terms \"[Country Name] AND b) or HBV]AND 'hbv'/exp OR 'hbv')\" . were reviewed for relevance, and only123/27/18, 8)15 AMGlobal prevalence, treatment, and prevention of hepatitis B virus inf...in 2016: a modelling study - The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Page 4 of 22http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(18)30056-6/fulltext?code=lancet-site studies that included HBsAg prevalence were included. We also included grey literature, ministry ofhealth reports, conference presentations, local journals, and personal communications with localexperts in the analysis. We excluded studies published before 1985 (with the exception of those donein Mauritania and Senegal because studies done before 1985 were deemed the most representativefor these countries) and studies done solely in non-representative populations (eg, blood donors,people who inject drugs, haemophiliacs, and specific ethnic groups).Data collection and processingWe extracted data such as HBsAg prevalence, sex and age distributions of the infected studypopulation (if available), time period(s) of the estimate, population studied (general population,pregnant women, students), setting of the study (urban, rural), scope of the study (single centre,multicentre, city, multicity, region, national), type of analysis (surveillance, meta-analysis, reviewarticle, modelling, other, unknown), and sample size from the studies. Data were then scored using amultiobjective decision-analysis approach, resulting in a score of 1-3 for each study. For publishedstudies, the overall score was based on the weighting of the scores for generalisability, sample size,and year of the study (appendix). Each study was scored independently by two epidemiologists. Toassess generalisability, clear classification guidelines were used (appendix). When the estimate wasbased on expert opinion, the study received a score of 1 as a default, a score of 2 if it was based onpublished or unpublished data, and a score of 3 if it was based on a well designed national study,unpublished or ahead of print, or a large national database (appendix). The highest-scoring studywas chosen to provide the representative estimate for each country, with the exception of countriesin which lower scoring studies were recommended by local experts. Although studies in blooddonors were excluded from use as base estimates, they were used to provide estimates of the lowerbound of the uncertainty interval (UI).Countries were divided into three categories: approved, estimated, and extrapolated. For approvedcountries, we used a Delphi interview process with 620 national and regional experts to buildconsensus regarding the inputs and key findings (appendix). These experts were identified throughour previous work on HCV, and by referral and recommendations from leaders in the field. At aminimum, we received feedback regarding the inputs for this category. In 53 of the 78 countries, atleast one face-to-face meeting was held to review both inputs and outputs with the experts. Theexperts either approved the inputs, rejected them and provided a better source of data (sometimesunpublished data), or recommended data from analogous countries with a similar health-caresystem.For estimated countries, inputs were based on published studies, which were reviewed and scoredby two epidemiologists and the primary investigator (HR). When age and sex distributions wereunavailable for a country, we estimated the distributions using those from another country with asimilar vaccination history by calibrating the prevalence to match that of the country withunavailable age and sex data. For extrapolated countries, in which no prevalence data wereavailable, the weighted average of countries within the same region, as defined by the Global Burdenof Diseases (GBD), was used (appendix).To estimate the population diagnosed with HBsAg, we reviewed (in order of priority) nationalnotification or registry data, peer-reviewed literature, and expert opinion. The number of individualstreated annually was estimated with (in order of priority) national databases, audit sales data,government reports, estimates from major treatment centres, and drug suppliers.Country-level estimates from WHO and UNICEF were used as a baseline for estimates of theproportion of infants receiving the first dose of vaccination within the first 24 h of life (timely birthdose) and those receiving a complete schedule of vaccination (at least three doses at age 1 year). Incountries with a consistently high historical coverage that reported a single year as 0% coverage, weassumed that this result was a reflection of non-reporting and not a change in strategy. The PAHO dida robust review of the vaccination schedule in the region, and this review supplemented the report13 14 15 15,163/27/18, 8)15 AMGlobal prevalence, treatment, and prevention of hepatitis B virus inf...in 2016: a modelling study - The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Page 5 of 22http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(18)30056-6/fulltext?code=lancet-site from WHO and UNICEF. Estimates of the proportion of infants born to HBsAg-positive motherswho received both timely birth dose and hepatitis B immunoglobulin were based on countryinterviews, national immunisation guidelines, and WHO reports, as described in the appendix. WHOdata were used for countries with missing interviews or national data. However, a comparison ofthe reported prophylaxis data in the WHO report with countries we interviewed indicated that use ofhepatitis B immunoglobulin was overestimated in the WHO report. For countries in which data wereonly available from the WHO report, we assumed that if a country reported that all pregnant womenare screened for HBsAg and that all infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers receive hepatitis Bimmunoglobulin then, in reality, only 50% of all infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers who receivetimely birth dose also receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin. If no national screening of pregnantwomen was reported, but hepatitis B immunoglobulin was reported to be administered, then theestimate decreased to 20%. These estimates were then adjusted on the basis of feedback fromexperts or regional leads and, unless specified, we assumed that 96% of pregnant women arescreened in countries with robust health-care systems. Estimates of antiviral treatment in motherswith high viral loads, as a method to prevent perinatal transmission, were based mostly on expertopinion (appendix). Prophylaxis coverage was not extrapolated to countries that did not report data.ModellingThe PRoGReSs model is a compartmental, deterministic, dynamic Markov disease progression modeldeveloped in Microsoft Excel to quantify the annual prevalence of HBsAg by disease stage, sex, andage in each country. A full description of the model is provided in the appendix. The model waspopulated with reported country-specific demographic data (population, mortality, births, and sexratios at birth), epidemiological data (HBsAg prevalence, age and sex distributions, and prevalence ofHBeAg in HBsAg-positive women of childbearing age), and data on intervention coverage (diagnosis,antiviral treatment of general population, peripartum antiviral treatment of mothers, infantvaccination, and catch-up vaccination; appendix).Disease progression and mother-to-child transmission rates were determined as a function of viralload to allow analysis across countries with different genotypes and were assumed to be constantacross countries. We established disease progression rates using data from the REVEAL study andthe Stanford cohort (university and community clinics; Nguyen MH, unpublished) in the USA(appendix). We developed a function (appendix) to estimate the risk of developing chronic HBVinfection using data from countries that reported HBsAg and core-antibody prevalence beforevaccination. Each country model was independently fitted to the reported prevalence of HBsAg by sex and agegroup in a given year, and to the reported number of diagnosed cases of HBV infection in a given year(appendix). We calculated the incidence of infections due to mother-to-child transmission usingreported data on births, prophylaxes coverage (timely birth dose, three-dose vaccination, hepatitis Bimmunoglobulin, and peripartum antiviral treatment of mothers), and the forecasted HBsAgprevalence in women of childbearing age (appendix). The incidence of horizontally acquiredinfections was back-calculated with the force of infection (a function determining the rate ofinfection with HBV among the susceptible population) and mortality, after accounting for clearanceof HBsAg in all years up to and including the year of reported HBsAg prevalence (appendix).Disease stages considered in the model were HBsAg-positive, cirrhosis (compensated ordecompensated), hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. The population in eachdisease stage was further divided into low viral load (HBV DNA <20000 IU/mL), high viral load (HBVDNA separate progression rates foreach (appendix). HBsAg-positive people with a high viral load, or compensated cirrhosis,decompensated cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma independent of viral load, were consideredeligible for antiviral treatment, in line with WHO treatment guidelines. Discontinuation oftreatment was incorporated in the model, but was only used in the models for Iran, Pakistan, andQatar after request by the expert panels.15,1617 18 1920,21 223/27/18, 8)15 AMGlobal prevalence, treatment, and prevention of hepatitis B virus inf...in 2016: a modelling study - The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Page 6 of 22http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(18)30056-6/fulltext?code=lancet-site Jump to Section GoTo validate the model, we chose countries that had prevalence estimates at two or more timepoints(appendix). The model was calibrated to the first reported HBsAg prevalence by age, and theforecasts were compared with the second reported HBsAg prevalence by age.Statistical analysisWe calculated UIs and did sensitivity analyses using Crystal Ball release 11.1.2.3.500. -PERTdistributions were used for all uncertain inputs. We used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate 95%UIs, with 1000 simulations run per country. We assumed that UIs for prevalence estimates in allcountries were independent. The UI for each country was calculated on the basis of range inputs forprevalence, transmission rates, transition rates, and mortality rates (appendix). These country UIswere used to calculate regional and global UIs. For these estimates, two sources of uncertainty wereconsidered: country-level uncertainty in prevalence and its effect on the regional and globalprevalence. The 2016 prevalence estimates and 95% UIs for each country were consolidated anddefined as assumption variables. We also did a sensitivity analysis to identify countries thataccounted for the greatest variation in the global prevalence because of their estimated prevalenceuncertainties.Role of the funding sourceThe funder had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, orpreparation of the manuscript. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the studyand had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.ResultsWe identified 42691 studies in the literature review, of which 435 were used in this analysis.Validation of all inputs and outputs with national experts is ongoing, but, as of publication, 78countries had provided feedback.The literature review provided prevalence estimates for 128 countries, with a mean global HBsAgprevalence of 4\u00b79%, or around 364 million infections after exclusion of estimates from studies done inblood donors or other non-representative populations. Using 120 country-specific models,representing 93% of the global population and 90% HBsAg-positive infections, weestimated 251513000-341114000) individuals were global prevalence of 3\u00b79% (95% UI 3\u00b74-4\u00b76; Table 1, Table 2). For eightcountries (Afghanistan, North Korea, Eritrea, Lithuania, Nepal, Palestine, Somalia, and Ukraine), datawere insufficient to establish age and sex distributions or HBsAg prevalence, or the identified studiesdid not pass the quality threshold and no model was developed. Estimates of HBsAg prevalence werenot available for all countries, and the quality of the available studies varied across countries (figure1). 2016 estimates of HBsAg prevalence in the general population and in children aged 5 years acrosscountries are shown in figure 1.Table 1 2016 estimates of HBsAg prevalence, treatment, and prophylaxis, by country Only countries that were modelled are shown.

The lowestprevalence among children aged 5 years (<0\u00b71%) was in the PAHO region (table 3). PAHO generallyhas a lower prevalence before vaccination than many other regions, and vaccination has beenimplemented widely in the region for sufficient time that some mothers were vaccinated as infants orchildren. Only the Western Pacific Region had reached the recommended threshold of 90% or higherthree-dose vaccination coverage in infants. However, China had a three-dose vaccination coverage ininfants of 99% and a large effect on the regional average (figure 3, table 1). The global average of 46%of infants receiving a timely birth dose was also largely affected by the coverage in China, becauseChina represented 24% of all timely birth doses administered globally (table 1). This global averagewas most affected by birth dose in high-income and upper-middle-income countries (coverage wasestimated to be only 3% in low-income countries; table 3).Table 3 2016 estimates of HBsAg infection prevalence, treatment, and prophylaxis, by WHO or World Bankregion3/27/18, 8)15 AMGlobal prevalence, treatment, and prevention of hepatitis B virus inf...in 2016: a modelling study - The Lancet Gastroenterology Page 10 of 22http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(18)30056-6/fulltext?code=lancet-site HBIG=hepatitis B immunoglobulin.

Because of China, the 2020 treatment target of 5million is achievable. China alone was estimated to treat at least 3\u00b75 million HBsAg-positiveindividuals, while the remaining countries combined were estimated to treat about 1\u00b73 millionpeople with HBV infections, giving a total of 4\u00b78 million people treated globally (table 1). In mostcountries, a large increase in screening and treatment will be needed to meet the targets of 90%diagnosed and 80% of those eligible treated by 2030, in part due to the current lack of nationalscreening programmes for people other than pregnant women.We validated the model in three countries (China, Iran, and the USA) that reported HBsAg prevalenceby age at two timepoints (appendix). These validations showed that the model could accuratelypredict the future prevalence of HBsAg by age and sex under different circumstances. The quality ofthe forecast declined when HBeAg was used in place of viral load, showing that differentiation byviral load provides more accurate estimates of future prevalence than does HBeAg alone.The sensitivity analysis (figure 5A) showed which countries had the largest effect on the estimatedtotal number of HBsAg-positive individuals in 2016. Angola was the greatest source of uncertainty atthe general population level, followed by Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Russia. Six of the ten countriesresponsible for most of the uncertainty in the global estimate were African nations, probably due tothe absence of high-quality data in the region, leading to the extrapolation by GBD region. This effectwas also seen in the sensitivity analysis run for the total number of HBsAg-positive infections in thepopulation aged 5 years (figure 5B). Eight of the top ten sources of uncertainty were African nations,probably due to the scarcity of data on children aged 5 years in Africa, along with the low use oftimely birth-dose vaccination or other prophylaxis for mother-to-child transmission. This findingreiterates the need for high-quality serosurveys among the general population, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. *\u00a7\u00b6 253/27/18, 8)15 AMGlobal prevalence, treatment, and prevention of hepatitis B virus inf...in 2016: a modelling study - The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Page 11 of 22http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(18)30056-6/fulltext?code=lancet-site Jump to Section GoFigure 5Sensitivity analysis of global HBsAg-positive infectionThe black line indicates the total.

This estimate did not take into account the year of thestudy, ageing of the infected population, the effects of prevention strategies, or mortality since thestudy was published. This global prevalence decreased to around 292 million in our model whenthese factors were taken into account. This finding shows both the progress that has been made incontrolling HBV infection globally and the importance of detailed modelling studies in addition tomore routine prevalence-based estimates. The difference between our global estimate andpreviously published estimates is largely due to the exclusion of older studies and studiesdone in blood donors and the inclusion of mortality and prophylaxis in our analysis.The total population living with HBsAg is indicative of the historical prevalence of HBV, whereas theprevalence among children aged 5 years also reflects access to preventive strategies, particularlyinfant vaccination. When taken together, these figures show the importance of robust prophylaxisschedules. For example, China had the greatest number of HBsAg-positive people, but ranked tenthin terms of HBsAg infections in children aged 5 years. Of the 16 countries with the greatest number ofinfected children aged 5 years, China was the only country with timely birth-dose coverage of 90% orhigher. Ten of these countries have not yet introduced timely birth dose, and Pakistan has verylimited coverage of timely birth dose, which is only available in the private sector. In Pakistan andelsewhere, the availability of birth dose as well as hepatitis B immunoglobulin is restricted to theprivate sector or mothers must pay out of pocket to access these measures for their infants.The largest strides towards the elimination of HBV disease globally have been in infant vaccination.Of the modelled countries, 94 were estimated to have already met the 2020 target of 1% prevalenceamong children aged 5 years, and 46 have already met the 2030 target of 0\u00b71% prevalence. However,many other countries have yet to meet these targets and have yet to introduce timely birth-dosevaccination. The peripartum antiviral treatment of mothers is another option for prophylaxesprogrammes and can go hand-in-hand with expansion or creation of screening programmes.Peripartum treatment of mothers might be a more viable option than administration of hepatitis Bimmunoglobulin because antivirals are more readily available and do not require refrigeration, and ashort course of oral antiviral therapy for HBV perinatal prophylaxis could be less costly than hepatitisB immunoglobulin. Although the high prevalence among children aged 5 years in many of the Africancountries that do not have timely birth-dose vaccination shows the importance of this intervention,maintaining high coverage of the three-dose vaccination is also imperative for reducing theprevalence and disease burden. Syria has maintained high coverage of three-dose and timely birth-dose vaccination since early on in its HBV vaccination programme, which was initiated in 1992.However, coverage of both began to decrease in 2011, causing the prevalence among children aged 5years to increase by 2016. Political conflicts could stall the progress made towards HBV eliminationunless public health systems are supported.The use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin, antiviral treatment, or both, will require that antenatalscreening for HBsAg be put in place. In 2016, PAHO Member States expanded their commitment tothe elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. This triple elimination strategywas also endorsed by WHO Western Pacific Regional Office and South-East Asia Regional Office in6,7,8,9,10,11 26 colitis?

These programmes will expand on existing programmes for HIV and syphilis to target otherdiseases, including HBV infection, with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and antiviral treatment. Thisfocus on the complete elimination of mother-to-child transmission is an integral part of acomprehensive elimination strategy.This study has several limitations. First, although data were available for 90% of the estimatednumber of infections globally, some of the countries for which data were extrapolated had largepopulations and some regions only had a few countries with data. Second, because of the absence ofrecent data, we used studies from before 1985 in Mauritania and Senegal. However, 97% of allincluded studies were done after 1990 and 83% after 2000. Third, although these estimates arecurrently the most accurate at the national level, they might obscure regional variations and do notaccount for certain populations (eg, immigrants, indigenous peoples and nations, people who injectdrugs, and sex workers) that might have a higher prevalence than the general population. Fourth, wedid not examine differences between rural and urban areas, which could have different access toprophylaxis. These limitations stress the need for national strategies or plans that target regions andpopulations most affected by HBV.Taking into account the effect of immigration and emigration was beyond the scope of this study, butcould have resulted in underestimation of the prevalence in countries with a substantial movementof people into or out of the country. Additionally, the model did not take into account HBV co-infections with HIV or hepatitis D virus (HDV), which cause faster disease progression than infectionswith HBV alone. HDV has a large effect on morbidity and mortality, but the effect of HDV co-infectionon HBsAg prevalence should be within the uncertainty intervals of our estimates. Although we usedthe highest-quality disease progression rates that were available at the time, the base estimatesmight not have been representative of all populations. Moreover, the model did not take into accountthe effect of clearance of HBsAg among chronic carriers. Rates of HBsAg clearance have been shownto be low, and clearance is most likely to occur in older individuals with inactive infection. HBsAg clearance would only affect overall prevalence in long-term forecasts because incidence isdependent on high viral load, and it has been shown that individuals who clear HBsAg can still go onto develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrapolation of HBsAg prevalence in children aged 5 years might underestimate or overestimate theactual prevalence in countries without data. Treatment and diagnosis estimates are probablyunderestimates. We found that diagnosis and treatment estimates were often higher than what wasreflected in the available literature. In many countries, almost all individuals diagnosed with HIV aretreated with antivirals that are also active against HBV, and thus a large proportion of those co-infected with HBV are under treatment.Norway and the UK have recently added routine HBV vaccination to their immunisation schedules,and these changes were not considered in the analysis. Although antiviral treatment of mothersremains low, it has been increasing, particularly in higher-income countries where screening ofpregnant women is a mainstay of their viral hepatitis programme. However, these countries tend tohave a low prevalence, and thus their effect on the global estimate is small.We now have all of the tools necessary to eliminate hepatitis B in children. In spite of this, 1\u00b78 millionchildren aged 5 years were infected with HBV in 2016, with a similar number of new infectionsoccurring annually. This analysis provides a marker on the road to elimination by quantifying the useof prophylaxis and treatment at the national, regional, and global levels. This work can supportnational strategies to eliminate HBV and decrease the number of new infections by 90% by 2030. Wehave provided a situational analysis that shows how countries with a high HBV prevalence, such asChina, can reduce the number of new infections through proactive national programmes.Correspondence to: Dr Homie Razavi, Center for Disease Analysis Foundation, Lafayette, CO19,27,28,2930,31 323/27/18, 8)15 AMGlobal prevalence, treatment, and prevention of hepatitis B virus inf...in 2016: a modelling study - The Lancet Gastroenterology first draft and finalised thedraft on the basis of comments from Observatory CollaboratorsDevin Razavi-Shearer, Lawati, Khalid Blach, Carlos E Mello, Philip Buti, Henry L Y Chan, AsadChaudhry, Rong-Nan Chien, Moon S Choi, Peer B Christensen, Chulanov,Mette Cowie, Cuellar, Mei-Hsuan Ryder, Rifaat Safadi, IvanSchr\u00e9ter, Shah, Ala Sharara, Manik Sharma, (D Razavi-Shearer BSc, I BA, S Blach MHS, S MBrandon MSE, C Estes MPH, K Murphy MSCS, H M Nde MPH, K Pasini MBA, K Razavi-Shearer BA, SRobbins MSPH, J D Schmelzer MPH, H Razavi PhD);
