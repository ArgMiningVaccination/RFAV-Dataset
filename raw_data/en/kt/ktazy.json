It is all inclusive of every aspect of the patient's genetic predispositions, food, medications, and environment. Homeopathic medicines can be combined with other traditional autism therapies. Homeopathy therapy must fit the individual person, not the requirements or diagnosis of a disease. One should never begin homeopathy for autism without consulting with a licensed homeopathic therapist. Note: This article is not intended as medical advice. It is not meant to replace a medical diagnosis by a licensed physician. Homeopathic treatment for autism should be prescribed by a certified licensed physician specialized in homeopathy autism. This article is intended to provide you with information about alternative treatments and therapies. What this page contains Does Homeopathy for Autism Work? Homeopathic treatment for autism is often complicated and challenging even for the most trained practitioners. It is a change in your life and the lifestyle you provide for your child. Additionally, treating autism with homeopathy is a long drawn process without too many visible improvements for weeks (and maybe even months). The upside of the argument, as many homeopathic practitioners claim, is that homeopathy tries to cure to the root cause rather and just subdue the symptoms. If this claim is true, what it means is that the effects of homeopathy for autism may last much longer than traditional medication, and hence worth the wait. It is important to note that modern scientific community does not offer much credence to this form of treatment of autism, though few argue that homeopathy and autism has strung a few success stories together. I am totally confused. I went to a homeopathic practitioner and she suggested that the homeopathic medicine for autism will not be effective unless I discontinue the traditional meds that my child is currently on. My GP has strongly recommended against discontinuing the medicines, he believes the risk is not worth it. What should I do? - Annabel Fortine, Mother of Autistic Child Answer: In short, listen to your general practitioner (GP). I understand that, as a parent, you may want to leave no stone unturned to help your [child with autism](https://www.autism360.com/does-my-child-have-autism/), but the success probability of homeopathy autism treatment are far and few between (though some remarkable stories exist). On the contrary, the positive (and negative) effects of traditional autism treatment are known, proven and continuously improved upon. Therefore, unless you have an appetite to experiment with your child's future (and you shouldn't), it would be unwise to forsake the proven medical treatments in exchange of a homeopathic miracle that most likely would not occur. Treating Autism with Homeopathy Homeopathic medicine is based on what is appropriate for that particular person under a set of conditions or symptoms they exhibit. Autism itself is a very serious condition with a wide variety of symptoms and treatments. Just as in traditional therapies for autism, the parents must have patience and commitment to the process. My recommendation is to find an open-minded, well trained, well known by referral, classical homeopath. Classical homeopaths will use a variety of detox and sequential approaches if necessary. Since each case is treated individually, detox may not be the first therapy. It may be added later to further enhance treatment and therapy. As with anyone treating your child, please remember to tell every practitioner and therapist what regimens you are following. Successful homeopathy treatment for autism depends solely on the ability of your practitioner to find the right remedy for your child. Many parents with autistic parents find it hard to be positive and confident that there is help available to assist you and your child in their development. Your love and acceptance of your child and the confidence you have in your practitioner will help immensely. Effectiveness of Homeopathy and Autism While the credibility of Homeopathy for Autism treatment is yet to be verified, certain studies have shown moderate to significant improvement in the following issues upon long term autism homeopathic treatment: - Sensory Processing Disorder - Tantrums - Tics or Tourette Syndrome - Violent or self-inflicting behavior - Language, speech & learning problems Why Homeopathy for Autism Treatment? Autism rates have risen exponentially over the last couple of decades. Have a look at some of the stats below: For this reason, many people are pointing fingers at whether vaccines cause autism in our children - there is a raging debate among scientific communities on whether it could be the mercury in vaccines that may have something to do with the [etiology of autism](https://www.autism360.com/etiology-of-autism/#No_Relationship_of_Vaccines_and_Autism). Others believe it is actually the vaccine itself, especially the MMR and DPT vaccines. This is one of the major reasons why many parents are turning to homeopathy, reluctant to inject anything toxic in their child's system. How does Homeopathic Therapy for Autism Work? Homeopathic therapy for autism involves removing all allergic tendencies in your child. This involves reviewing current medication regime, revising your child's diet chart and even scrutinizing at the environmental factors that may impact the growth of [children with ADHD](https://www.autism360.com/adhd-in-children/) and Autism. There are two main food allergies that will be considered. Cow milk and dairy products (casein allergies) along with gluten and wheat food allergies...Corn may be another food to look at as it has been genetically engineered over the past half century. Here is a simple, yet long list of Casein and Gluten based food that you need to avoid for your child with ASD: Table 1: List of most common Gluten and Casein rich diets that should be avoided For a detailed analysis, please refer to the post on [Gluten-free Casein-free (or GFCF) diet for Autism](https://www.autism360.com/casein-free-gluten-free-diet-for-autism/). Eliminating food allergens will be one of the key homeopathic treatments at the beginning. Since I am not an expert in homeopathy, the following information should merely be taken as my opinion and a brief explanation of some of the homeopathic therapies that may be recommended. Traditional Hands-on Osteopathic This is osteopathic manipulation of the head and back. The therapy should be conducted by an experienced practitioner and in a very gentle manner. Sensory Integration Therapy This therapy focuses on [activities for the sensory seekers](https://www.autism360.com/sensory-activities-for-autism/). The idea of this therapy is to stimulate and invoke the necessary [sensory input in everyday activities](https://www.autism360.com/sensory-input-in-everyday-activities/). Supplements Autistic children are often given a wide variety of supplements such as Vitamin B-6, Vitamin C, DMG, Magnesium, Omega 3 Fats and others to maintain nutritional balance. Energy healing This treatment will be suggested and is one that you can learn to perform yourself under the guidance of a knowledgeable practitioner. It involves Reiki, prayer and soothing forms of Yoga. Gluten and Casein Free Diet As discussed in Table 1, this diet is commonly called the GFCF diet. The theory behind eliminating gluten and casein from the diet is based on allergies which cause the proteins in foods to act improperly; thus affecting brain function. Do not start this diet without informing your practitioner, as eliminating these items from your child's diet will ultimately lead to some nutritional deficiencies. Your practitioner may suggest seeing a nutritionist to help plan healthy meals for the family following the GFCF diet. Emotional Freedom Technique Also referred to as EFT, Emotional Freedom technique is an amazing non-invasive therapy that is especially effective for children who suffer from tantrums. Your therapist can train you very quickly in as little as two sessions enabling you to administer this therapy yourself. It is a blend of gentle tapping on acupuncture points with verbal positive affirmations. Chelation Chelation therapy is the removal of toxic material such as mercury from the body. Early results may be astonishing, but unfortunately, they are usually short-lived. Your homeopathic treatment may include removing these toxins gradually over a period of time to allow for the best results. Other Miscellaneous Therapies This comprises behavioral, auditory, occupational, language and other related therapy techniques. These are often helpful and suggested for [children with add](https://www.autism360.com/add-in-children/) and autism. While these therapies alone may not provide positive results, they do help when combined with other homeopathic treatment. Let me re-iterate that I do not have sufficient training or experience in homeopathic therapy for autism and have included this article on request from our readers in our [autism forum](https://www.autism360.com/forum/). Homeopathy seems to have a few good options to offer, but you may want to consider speaking with your healthcare provider regarding some of the homeopathic treatments. I have worked with children who have been on a gluten free and casein free diet. It is not advised to eliminate both at the same time. My suggestion would be to eliminate the cow milk and dairy first for a period of 3-6 months. If there is no noticeable difference I would then add the gluten free diets Neither diet is easy at first, however, the benefits outweigh the struggles. Remember, diet is the key success factor for treating autism with homeopathy. "}
