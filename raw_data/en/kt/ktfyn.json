It is not meant to take the place of medical care.Please contact your medical provider when you are ill PRINCIPLES: The outline uses the following principles: - SAFETY is our main focus. \"Do no harm\" We relied on herbs which have the lowest risk/highest safety profile. They are considered 'food safe\" because people in some areas of the world eat them as food. - Taking two herbs in one category may give a better overall effect. Since each person is different, one herb may not be as effective as another herb. Taking two herbs in one category helps to assure some effectiveness. Sometimes two or more herbs are both effective. At other times a second herb may amplify or multiply the effect of the first herb. Ginger, Licorice and sometimes Chinese Skullcap multiply effects of other herbs. - Taking lower doses when well or less ill, higher doses when more ill. - The greater the quantity and the more substances we take, the more we risk a reaction or side-effect. This is true of anything we take. 'Safe' things can sometimes cause problems in large quantities. For example, cabbage. Cabbage is a safe food, but eaten in large quantities, it can cause problems. - There are always trade-offs. It may make more sense for a very sick person to take more herbs and risk more side effects than for a healthy person or a person who is less ill. - The number of days of illness and the corresponding severity of symptoms are based on the reports coming over the internet. Each individual's situation may/will differ. Use this only as a guide. - Nothing, NOTHING is better than: - Not touching your face - Washing your hands after you touch anything - Keeping a Social Distance of 6 feet - Staying at home STAGES of ILLNESS The best way to use the information included in the outline is to first choose the particular stage "}
