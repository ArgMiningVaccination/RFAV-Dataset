As the university increases on-campus operations, these principles will continue to guide the campus. UCR is committed to delivering in-person instruction, research opportunities, and student support services wherever possible. As a nationally-ranked residential public research university, an on-campus presence is essential to successfully advance our mission of instruction, research, and public service. Most classes will be delivered in-person. Campus gathering and student support venues, including libraries, Student Recreation Center, Highlander Union Building, bookstore, dining spaces, and residence halls, are open. All members of the campus community - including students, staff, and faculty - must adhere to public health and safety guidelines. Campus guidelines will continue to evolve as guidance from local, state, and national health authorities are updated. Please continue to visit the [COVID-19](http://campusreturn.ucr.edu/) site for updated information with specifics about operations on campus. FAQs I am a new UCR employee where do I go to submit my COVID19 vaccine records to meet with campus policy? Please navigate to Point and Click using the [link](https://chconline.ucr.edu/) and access your Employee Health Record. Add your immunization information under COVID Vaccine found in \"View My Medical Clearances and Vaccine Records.\" More detailed instructions can be found here: [Employee Vaccine Guide](https://documents.ucr.edu/campus-return/Employee-Vaccine-Guide.pdf). *Acceptable Proof of COVID-19 Vaccination COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card (issued by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention or WHO), which includes name of person vaccinated, type of vaccine provided, and date doses administered A photo of a vaccination card as a separate document A photo of a vaccine card stored on a phone or electronic device Documentation of vaccination from a healthcare provider Digital record that includes a QR code that when scanned by a SMART Health Card reader displays to the reader name, date of birth, vaccination dates, and vaccine type. How do I a request an exemption or deferral to the vaccine mandate? The UC Office of the President (UCOP) is presently in the process of reviewing the UC vaccination policy, with plans to implement updates in August 2023. As soon as the revised policy is approved, we will swiftly update the information and provide the latest details. The following key points have been highlighted: - Each year, students and employees will be required to either receive the COVID-19 vaccination or officially decline it. - Documentation of receiving a COVID-19 primary vaccine series will no longer be necessary for students and employees. Consequently, there will be no need for submitting approved medical or religious exceptions, or disability deferrals to access campus facilities. - Look out for future communications from the campus regarding the process of attesting or declining the COVID-19 vaccine similarly to the flu vaccine. Can I get a COVID test on campus? Yes, antigen test kits are available to faculty and staff using [the antigen kit request form](https://ucriverside.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Suvs4CwIMX76LQ) . The antigen test kits can be picked up from EH&S Tuesday through Thursday from 8am to 4pm, (3:50pm being the last window for pick up). Students can request kits through from [The Well](https://well.ucr.edu/). Where can employees obtain additional free face coverings/masks? Employees can request free face coverings from [Environmental Health & Safety](https://ehs.ucr.edu/coronavirus/facecoverings). Can I host an event on campus? Yes. Events and gatherings guidance can be found [here](https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/events-gatherings). Are resources available for instructors to assist with remote instruction? Yes. The [Teaching@UCR](https://teaching.ucr.edu/) site provides resources on revising your course for remote instruction, including key details on technologies and teaching strategies. RETURN GUIDELINES - Strict adherence to health and safety standards. Personal and institutional health and safety standards for on-campus activities will be in place, consistent with applicable public health guidelines. This likely will include correct use of face coverings, testing, and vaccinations. All on-campus activities, and anyone participating in these activities, will be required to strictly adhere to these standards. - Planning to offer most courses in-person. Smaller classes would be offered with normal classroom seating, larger courses would have reduced seating density, and graduate students would have almost all of their courses in-person. - A commitment not to switch remote classes to in-person on short notice. Classes initially scheduled for remote instruction in fall will not be shifted to in-person if public health conditions improve more than expected. However, if conditions do not improve as expected, classes initially scheduled for in-person instruction may be shifted to remote. VACCINATIONS The University of California has finalized a [policy](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/SARS-Cov-2) to require vaccinations of all students and employees accessing campus facilities at all UC locations, including UC Riverside. More information about vaccinations can be found [here](https://campusreturn.ucr.edu/vaccines). The UC Office of the President (UCOP) is presently in the process of reviewing the UC vaccination policy, with plans to implement updates in August 2023.

COVID-19 TESTING Effective May 11, 2023, the federal Public Health Emergency has ended, and the University of California (UC) has implemented a systemwide COVID-19 vaccination opt-out program for UC students and employees. Consequently, weekly COVID-19 testing is no longer mandatory for students and employees on campus.
