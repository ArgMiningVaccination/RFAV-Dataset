And we can't personally think of a greater gift that rounds out a year spent largely in the kitchen (shout out banana bread) and includes our two of favorite 2020 buzzwords (non toxic and sustainable) than safe, high quality cooking essentials. We reach for local and organic food because it is richer in nutrients, reduces carbon output and has lower pesticide residues. So we should also reach for cookware and tools used to make those carefully selected foods with the same shared goal of healthier choices and lower impact on the environment. We recommend ditching the plastic (bye BPA) and your old non-stick pans (bye Teflon), and helping your loved ones upgrade to more safe and sustainable options.
