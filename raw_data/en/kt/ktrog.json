The aim is to enable a person to regulate and direct the flow of chi, or vital force, within his or her own body. The student or patient is taught to focus his or her qi at dan tian, or vital center. From this center, the qi is said to emanate to distant regions of the body. Based on the experience of students who take qi gong courses for self -treatment purposes, it usually takes about three months for the exercises to show their effect. In cancer therapy, the Chinese practitioner prescribes exercises geared to the individual patient. Mechanism of Qi Gong therapy This physical -mental exercise , \"breathing skill\" balances yin and yang, strengthens blood circulation, and improves the patient's emotional and mental states. From the viewpoint of Western medicine, chi gong increases the absorption and utilization of oxygen from the blood, as does yoga. oxygen deficiency is typical of cancer cells and that when the body is rich in oxygen, cancer cells die. Practicing chi gong exercises has a positive effect on certain enzymes that play key roles in the body's maintenance of health.Through intensive practice of chi gong, \"a whole set of beneficial psychological and spiritual conditions emerge promoting emotional well - being, chi gong exercises build patients' confidence and steel their will to defeat cancer.
