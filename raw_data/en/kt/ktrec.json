The WHO Family of International Classifications provides a framework to code a wide range of information about health (e.g. diagnosis, functioning and disability, reason for contact with health services) and uses a standardized common language permitting communication about health and health care across the world in various disciplines and sciences. These internationally endorsed classifications facilitate the storage, retrieval, analysis, and interpretation of data in a uniform format allowing comparability of data of a population over different periods and also between different populations. The basis for the WHO-FIC and the principles governing the admission of classifications are set out in the paper on the \"WHO-FIC\". This paper also provides a protocol to those wishing to submit a classification for inclusion in the WHO-FIC. TYPES OF CLASSIFICATIONS: 1. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 2. International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 3. International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI) - Under Development CLASSIFICATIONS AND CLINICAL TERMINOLOGIESClassifications capture snapshot views of population health using such parameters as death, disease, functionality, disability, health and health interventions, which inform management and decision makers in the health system. Over time they also provide insight on trends, which informs the planning and decision making processes by health authorities. The varied applications in health information systems and the general availability of information and telecommunication technologies (ICT) have highlighted the need for increased interoperability. The base line information that is aggregated for public health purposes is increasingly derived from health records, which contain both patient care related information, and also information that is crucial for management, health financing and general health system administration. The accuracy and consistency of the health records is crucial to ensure the quality of care and sound management of health systems resources. This calls for accurate and consistent use of clinical terminologies and recognition of the particular importance of semantic interoperability. Possible synergies between classifications and clinical terminologies have been identified crucial for future work, particularly in the perspective of a growing automation of information processing. WHO and its network of collaborating centers are taking steps in that direction. International Classification of Diseases (ICD)The ICD is the international standard diagnostic classification for all general epidemiological, many of population groups and monitoring of the incidence and prevalence of diseases and other health problems in relation to variables such as the characteristics and circumstances of the individuals. In 1967, the World Health Assembly adopted the WHO Nomenclature Regulations that stipulate use of ICD in its most current revision for mortality and morbidity statistics by all Member States. The currently in use the Tenth Version of ICD (ICD-10) was endorsed by the Forty-third World Health Assembly in May 1990 and came into use in WHO Member States from 1994. It is being used to classify diseases and other health problems recorded on many types of health and vital records including death certificates and health records. In addition to enabling the storage and retrieval of diagnostic information for clinical, epidemiological and quality purposes, these records also provide the basis for the compilation of national mortality and morbidity statistics by WHO Member States. International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)The ICF is a classification providing a unified and standard language and framework for description of health and health-related domains. These domains are classified from body, individual and societal perspectives by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Acknowledging that every human being can experience a decrement in health and thereby experience some degree of disability, it measures health and disability at both individual and population levels. Since an individual's functioning and disability occurs in a context, the ICF also includes a list of environmental factors. Thus it 'mainstreams' the experience of disability and recognizes it as a universal human experience. By shifting the focus from cause to impact it places all health conditions on an equal footing allowing their comparability using a common metric - the ruler of health and disability. Furthermore ICF takes into account the social aspects of disability and does not see disability only as a 'medical' or 'biological' dysfunction. By including Contextual Factors, in which environmental factors are listed ICF allows to record the impact of the environment on the person's functioning. The ICF was officially endorsed by all 191 WHO Member States in the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly on 22 May 2001(resolution WHA 54.21). All the Health /Medical Care Institutions in India to efficiently Use ICD-10 & ICF.

Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only........ Mark Twain XNational Health Profile 2018The Republic of India (Bhrat Gaarjya) is one of the oldest civilizations with more than 1.2 billion people and most populous Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a Parliamentary system of Government in the world. India is the seventh-largest country by area as well as world's seventh-largest economy1 and it has achieved socio economic progress during the last 70 years of its independence. The country has become self sufficient in agricultural production and is one of the top industrialised country in the world and emerged as an important regional power. Over the seven decades since independence, life expectancy of the country has increased2, literacy rates have quadrupled and health conditions have improved to a great extent3. Location: India covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km (1,269,346 sq mi), extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere, the mainland extends between latitudes 8\u00b0 4' and 37\u00b0 6' north, longitudes 25' east and measures about 3,214 km from north to south between the extreme latitudes and about 2,933 km from east to west between the extreme longitudes. Boundaries: Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the south-west, and the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, India shares land borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan to the north-west; China, Bhutan and Nepal to the north; Myanmar to the east; and Bangladesh to the east of West Bengal. Sri Lanka is separated from India by a narrow channel of sea, formed by Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. Physical Diversity -The main land comprises of four regions, namely, the great mountain zone, plains of the Ganga and the Indus, the desert region and the southern peninsula. The Himalayas comprise three almost parallel ranges interspersed with large plateaus and valleys, which extends over a distance of about 2,400 km with a varying depth of 240 to 320 km in the northernmost part of the country. The plains of the Ganga and the Indus, about 2,400 km long and 240 to 320 km broad, are formed by basins of three distinct river systems - the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. They are one of the world's greatest stretches of flat alluvium and also one of the most densely populated areas on the earth. The desert region in the western part comprise of the great desert extending from the edge of the Rann of kuchh beyond the Luni River northward including the whole of the Rajasthan-Sindh frontier. While the little desert extends from the luni between Jaisalmer and Jodhpur up to the northern-west. Between the great and the little deserts lies a zone of absolutely sterile country, consisting of rocky land cut up by limestone ridges.The peninsular plateau is marked by a mass of mountain and hill. Prominent among these are the Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Maikala and Ajanta, flanked by the Eastern Ghats with average elevation is about 610 meters, and the Western Ghats where it is generally from 915 to 1,220 meters, rising in places to over 2,440 meters. India is rich in flora and fauna. Available data place India in the Tenth position in the world and 4th in Asia in plant diversity. It has the second position in Horticulture in world and has world's is greatest sundari tree (Mangrove in Sunderban Delta). Climate: The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and mountain climate. 1 https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/the-worlds-biggest-economies-in-2018/2 SELECTED SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATISTICS INDIA -2002 , CSO, & PI3 http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/reports_and_publication/statistical_publication/social_statistics/Chapter_3.pdf XINational Health Profile 2018Executive Summary A healthy population can undoubtedly contribute to economic growth and development of a country. India has made considerable progress in many health indicators. Life expectancy at birth has increased4, infant mortality5 and crude death rates6 have been greatly reduced, diseases such as small pox, polio and guinea worm have been eradicated, and leprosy has been nearly eliminated. The country strives towards achieving Universal Health Coverage. India accounts for a relatively large share of the world's disease burden and is undergoing an epidemiological transition that the non-communicable diseases dominate over communicable in the total disease burden of the country. In a recent report of India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), titled India: Health of the Nation's States: The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative(2017), it is observed that the disease burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases, as measured using Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), dropped from 61 per cent to 33 per cent between 1990 and 2016. In the same period, disease burden from non-communicable diseases increased from 30 per cent to 55 per cent. The epidemiological transition, however, varies widely among Indian states: 48% to 75% for non-communicable diseases, 14% to 43% for infectious and associated diseases, and 9% to 14% for injuries. National Health Profile (NHP), published annually since 2005, brings together all health related information in a single platform. It has six chapters covering Demographic, Socio-Economic, Health Status and Health Finance Indicators, Human Resources in Health Sector and Health Infrastructure. Importantly, it is a major source of information on various communicable and non-communicable diseases that are not covered under any other major programmes. Population Statistics: As per Census 2011, the total population of India is 1210.8 million with a decadal growth rate of 17.7 per cent. While 31.14 per cent of the population lives in urban areas, the rest lives in rural areas. The Sex Ratio (number of females per 1000 males) in the country has improved from 933 in 2001 to 943 in 2011. In rural areas the sex ratio has increased from 946 to 949. The corresponding increase in urban areas has been of 29 points from 900 to 929. Kerala has recorded the highest sex ratio in respect of total population (1084), rural population (1078) and urban (1091). The lowest sex ratio in rural areas has been recorded in Chandigarh (690). While 28.5% population of India lies between 0-14 age group, only 8.3% are above the age of 60 years. Vital Statistics: Estimated birth rate, death rate and natural growth rate are showing a declining trend. Estimated birth rate declined from 25.8 in 2000 to 20.4 in 2016 while the death rate declined from 8.5 to 6.4 per 1000 population over the same period. The natural growth rate declined from 17.3 in 2000 to 14 in 2016 as per the latest available information. The SRS (2016) shows that the Total Fertility Rate - the average number of children that will be born to a woman during her lifetime - in 12 States has fallen below two children per woman and 9 States have reached replacements levels of 2.1 and above. Delhi, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have lowest fertility among other countries. Fertility is declining rapidly, including among the poor and illiterate. The literacy rate of the country has shown an increase of 8.2% during the decade 2001-2011. Overall literacy rate of India is 73.0% whereas for males it is 80.9% and for females it is 64.6%. Rural literacy rate is 67.8% and urban 4 SELECTED SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATISTICS INDIA -2002 , CSO, Ministry of Statistics & PI 5 https://visualize.data.gov.in/?inst=55790a6e-b5df-4323-85bc-f6c940a33988&vid=768#6 SRS Bulletin XIINational Health Profile 2018literacy rate is 84.1%. The highest number of rural literates has been recorded in Uttar Pradesh (85.3 million). Maharashtra (40.1 million) has recorded the highest number of literates in urban areas. The Maternal Mortality Ratio has shown a decrease of 11 points during 2010-12 to 2011-13. According to the latest data available maternal mortality ratio is highest for Assam i.e. 300 per 1, 00,000 live births and lowest for Kerala i.e. 61 per 1, 00,000 live births in 2011-13. Infant mortality rate (IMR) has declined considerably i.e. 37 per 1000 live births in 2015; however, there is a huge gap between IMR of rural (41 per 1000 live births) and urban (25 per 1000 live births). There are noteworthy improvements in health indicators such as life expectancy, infant mortality rate (IMR) and maternal mortality rate (MMR) due to increasing penetration of healthcare services across the country, extensive health campaigns, sanitation drives, increase in the number of government and private hospitals in India, improved immunisation, growing literacy etc. Initiatives such as Janani Suraksha Yojana, Reproductive, Maternal, New-borns, Child and Adolescent Health Services and national programmes to curb incidences of diseases such as polio, HIV, TB, leprosy etc have played pivotal roles in improving India's health indicators. Yet, a huge disparity in the availability of healthcare resources continues to exist in India. The rural- urban divide is considerable when it comes to healthcare access. Fairly-developed states like Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have brought down their and MMR rates and states like Assam, Jharkhand continue to grapple with these issues even today. 050100150200250300350 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.0100.0 IMR,MMRLiteracy rateState /UT wise analysis Female Literacy IMR MMR 020040060080010001200140016001800 05000001000000150000020000002500000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 DeathsCases YearCases and Deaths due to Malaria in India Cases DeathsThere are many factors which have an impact on Maternal Mortality Ratio and education level of women is one of the most important factors in reducing maternal mortality. Education enhances women's ability to access existing health care resources, including skilled attendants for childbirth, and directly leads to a reduction in her risk of dying during pregnancy and childbirth. XIIINational Health Profile 2018Immunization: India has attained significant progress in achieving immunization coverage through Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) which provides prevention against six vaccine preventable diseases. In 2013, India along with South East Asia Region, declared commitment towards measles elimination and rubella/ congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) control by 2020. MR vaccine campaign is targeted towards 410 million children across the country7. Mission Indradhanush aimed to fully immunize more than 90% of newborns by 2020 through innovative and planned approaches. A total of 528 districts were covered during the various phases of Mission Indradhanush8. India has come a long way in immunisation but has to traverse far before achieving its targets. National health programmes , launched by the Government of India, have been playing crucial roles in tackling several serious health concerns, communicable and non-communicable diseases, over the last two decades. Malaria has been a problem in India for centuries, at one time a rural disease, diversified under the pressure of developments into various ecotypes. Both the cases reported and deaths due to malaria have come down over the years. The malarial death rate in India declined to 0.01 deaths per lakh population in 2016 from 0.10 deaths per lakh population in 2001. To achieve malaria-free country by 2027 and elimination by 2030, National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2017-22 for Malaria Elimination has been developed by National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. For effective implementation of various elimination strategies, the focus of the programme is laid on district-level rather than State-level. 050100150200250300350 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.0100.0 IMR,MMRLiteracy Female Literacy IMR MMR 020040060080010001200140016001800 05000001000000150000020000002500000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 20072008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 DeathsCases YearCases and Deaths due to Malaria in India Cases Deaths Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) is another programme implemented under National Health Mission. It has achieved millennium development goals in 2015 by halting and reversing the incidence of TB. The programme was initiated with the objective of ensuring access to quality diagnosis and care for all TB patients. Several notable activities such as notification of TB; case-based, web-based recording and reporting system (NIKSHAY); standards of TB care in India; Composite indicator for monitoring programme performance; scaling up of the programmatic management of drug resistant TB services etc. were implemented in the past. NIKSHAY, the web based reporting for TB programme has enabled to capture and transfer of individual patient data from the remotest health centres of the country. In 2017, National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2017-25 for TB Elimination framework has been adopted, which provides goals and strategies for eliminating TB in India by 2030. XIV7 National operational guidelines for introduction of measles -rubella vaccine 2017 8 http://www.missionindradhanush.in/about.htmlNational Health Profile 2018The number of patients diagnosed and registered for treatment of TB in India has reported as 1,444,175 patients were registered under RNTCP in 2017. National Programme for Prevention and Control of NCDs objective is to integrate the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) interventions in the NRHM framework in a bid to optimise scarce resources and make provisions to ensure long term sustainability of these interventions. The NCD cell implements and supervises activities connected to health promotion, early diagnosis, treatment and referral, thereby facilitating partnership with labs for early diagnosis in the private sector. It also seeks to create and sustain a fortified monitoring and evaluation system for public health through convergence with the ongoing interventions of National Health Mission (NHM), National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) and National Programme for Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE).Health Finance: The cost of treatment has been on rise in India and it has led to inequity in access to health care services. India spends only 1.02% of its GDP (2015-16) as public expenditure on health. Per capita public expenditure on health in nominal terms has gone up from Rs 621 in 2009-10 to Rs 1112 in 2015-16. The Centre: State share in total public expenditure on health was 31:69 in 2015-16. The share of Centre in total public expenditure on health has been declining steadily over the years except in 2017-18. Health insurance in India is a growing segment. Yet, it hasn't taken off fully and several measures are needed to improve and expand insurance coverage. In the country health insurance pays for only inpatient hospitalization and for treatment at hospitals in India. In 2000 government of India liberalized insurance and allowed private players into the insurance sector. The advent of private insurers in India saw the introduction of many innovative products like family floater plans, top-up plans, critical illness plans, hospital cash and top up policies. Out of 437,457 persons covered under insurance, 79% were covered by public insurance companies, with the remaining being covered by private insurance companies. Manpower for health services has been described as the \"heart of the health system in any country\". It is one of the most important aspects of healthcare systems and a critical component of health policies. In India, there is no reliable source giving the number of the members of the health workforce as more than half of the healthcare professionals work in the unorganized private sector. However, NHP has compiled detailed health manpower availability in public sector. The total number of registered Allopathic Doctors (up to 2017) is 1,041,395. There is an increasing trend in the availability of Dental Surgeons and Nurses per lakh population over the years. Number of Dental Surgeons registered with Central/State Dental Councils of India up to 31.12.2017 was 251,207. There is an increasing trend in number of Dental Surgeons registered with Central/State Dental Council of India from 2007 to 2017. Total number of registered AYUSH Doctors in India as on 01.01.2017 was 773,668. Health infrastructure is an important indicator for understanding the health care policy and welfare mechanism in a country. It signifies the investment priority with regards to the creation of health care facilities. Infrastructure has been described as the basic support for the delivery of public health activities. Medical education infrastructure in the country has shown rapid growth during the last 20 years. The country has 476 medical colleges, 313 Colleges for BDS courses and 249 colleges which conduct MDS courses. There has been a total admission of 52,646 in 476 Medical Colleges & 27060 in BDS and 6233 in MDS during 2017-18. There are 3215 Institutions for General Nurse Midwives with admission capacity of 129,926 and 777 colleges for Pharmacy (Diploma) with an intake capacity of 46,795 as on 31st October, 2017. There are 23,582 government hospitals having 710,761 beds in the country. 19,810 hospitals are in rural area with 279,588 beds and 3,772 hospitals are in urban area with 431,173 beds. 70% of population of India lives in rural area and to cater their need there are 156,231 Sub Centres, 25,650 Primary Health Centres and 5,624 Community Health Centres in India as on 31 st March 2017. XVNational Health Profile 2018Universal access to health care is a well-articulated goal for both global institutions and national governments. India's National Health Policy, 2017 envisions the goal of attaining highest possible level of health and well-being for all at for all ages through a preventive and promotive health care orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good quality health care services without financial hardship to the citizens. Under health related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) no. 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), a commitment towards global effort to eradicate disease, strengthen treatment and healthcare, and address new and emerging health issues has been pronounced. The gains of India in many health related indicators helped the country to make progress in achieving MDGs. More efforts, however, are required to reach the goals of Universal Health Coverage and those envisioned in SDG. Ayushman Bharat Mission, world's largest health scheme announced in the Union Budget 2018-19, is the latest initiative for expanding the health insurance net and targets 10 crore poor and deprived rural families.

Demographic indicators can be divided in two parts - Population Statistics and Vital Statistics. Population Statistics deals with size and growth of population, sex ratio, density of population etc. while Vital Statistics deals with birth rate, death rate, and natural growth rate, life expectancy at birth, mortality and fertility rates. State/UT wise performance of these indicators helps us to identify areas that need policy and programme interventions, setting near and far-term goals, and deciding priorities, besides understanding them in an integrated structure. Data in this section has been taken mainly from the \"Census of India\". India's population, as per census 2011 12108.5 lakhs (6232.7 lakhs males and 5875.8 lakhs females). Out of the entire census till date, the Average Annual Exponential Growth Rate has been negative only for the decade 1911-21. During this interval, population declined marginally due to great influenza epidemic and two successive bad harvests in West Bengal. [Table No. 1.1.1] The sex ratio of India during 1901 was 972 females per 1000 males. Since then, it has continued to decline decade over decade to 926 females against 1000 male in 1991 (except in 1981). The sex ratio has further improved from 1991 it was 933 and 943 female against 1000 female in 2001 and 2011 respectively in the country as per the information available at Table No. 1.1.1 and graphic presentation given at Figure No. 1.1.2. According to Figure No. 1.1.1, the sex ratios of 18 States/UTs were above national average while 17 States/UTs have registered below national average. The highest sex ratio of 1084 females per 1000 males was reported by State of lowest sex ratio of 618 females per 1000 males was reported by the UT of Daman & Diu followed by Chandigarh [Refer Table No. 1.1.2] The graphic representation of the population density of the country is given at Figure No. 1.1.3. The highest population density of 11320 populations per square kilometre was reported by NCT of Delhi whereas Arunachal Pradesh has reported the lowest population density of 17. [Refer Table No. 1.1.2] Age group-wise distribution of population of the country projected for 2015 and 2016 are given at Table No. 1.1.4(a) and Table No. 1.1.4(b) respectively. Accordingly to Table No. 1.1.4 (b), 27% of the total estimated population of 2016 were below the age of 14 years and majority (64.7%) of the population were in the age group of 15-59 years i.e. economically active population and 8.5% population were in the age group of 60 to 85+ years. The estimated Birth Rate, Death Rate and Natural Growth Rate in India during 1991 to 2016 are given in Table No. 1.2.1. There has been consistent decrease in the Birth Rate, Death Rate and Natural Growth Rate in India since 1991 to 2016. As on 2016 India has registered Birth Rate of 20.4 per 1000 populations and Death Rate of 6.4 per 1000 populations while the Natural Growth Rate was 14.0 per 1000 population in India. The Birth Rate in Rural was higher than in the Urban. Similarly, the Death Rate and Natural Growth Rate were also higher in rural as compared to the Urban. The population, however, continues to grow, as the decline in the birth rate is not as rapid as the decline in the death rate.5 National Health Profile 2018 The Life Expectancy of Life at Birth has increased from 49.7 years in 1970-75 to 68.3 years in 2011-15. For the same period, the Life Expectancy for Females is 70.0 years and 66.9 years for Males. [Table No. 1.2.6 (b)] Infant Mortality Rate has declined considerably (34 i.e. Per 1000 Live Births in 2016), however differentials of rural (38) & urban (23) are still high. [Table No. 1.2.7] As per the latest data available, Maternal Mortality Ratio is highest in Assam & lowest in Kerala. [Table No- 1.2.9] The Age-specific death rate is declining over the years; the rural-urban differentials are still high. [Table No. 1.2.11(b)] The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country was 2.3 whereas in rural areas it has been 2.5 and it has been 1.8 in urban areas during 2016 as per the latest available information.

India figures for 2001 includes estimated population of the three sub - divisions Viz. Mao Maram, Paomata and Purul of Senapati district of f. working out 'decadal growth' and 'percentage decadal growth' for India 1941 - 51 and 1951 - 61 the population of Tuensang district for 1951 (7,025) and the population of Tuensang (83,501) and Mon (5,774) districts for 1961 census of Nagaland state have not been taken into account as the areas were censused for the first time in 1951 Census and the same are not comparable. h. For calculating density, the area figure for India exclude 78,114 sq. Km. under illegal occupation of Pakistan and 5180 sq. Km. illegally handed over by Pakistan to China and 37555 sq. Km. under illegal occupation of China in Ladakh district and 1573 sq. Km. of three sub - division of Senapati district of Manipur. i. The data pertaining to three sub-divisions Viz. Mao Maram, Paomata and Purul of Senapati district of Manipur were finalized after release of PCA of Census 2011 and accordingly the figures for India has been revised.7 National Health Profile 2018Source: O/o Registrar General of India 8 National Health Profile 2018Source: O/o Registrar General of India Source: O/o Registrar General of India9 National Health Profile 2018Source: O/o Registrar General of India10 National Health Profile 20181.1.2 State/UT wise Distribution of Population, Sex Ratio, Density and Decadal Growth rate of Population : 2011 State/UT CodeIndia/State/UT Total population Sex ratio Population Density Decadal growth ratePersons Males Females INDIA 394 8.2 7 Jammu 5900640 889 124 23.6 11 22.4 24.5 27.9 21.3 India 11 National Health Profile 2018Notes: 1. The data pertaining to three sub-divisions Viz. Mao Maram, Paomata and Purul of Senapati district of Manipur were finalized after release of PCA of Census 2011 and accordingly the figures for India and State of Manipur have been revised. 2. For working out density of India and the State of Jammu & Kashmir, the entire area and population of those portions of Jammu & Kashmir which are under illegal occupation of Pakistan and China have not been taken into account. 3. For Census 2011, the population of \"Others\" has been clubbed with the \"Males\" for working out population, 0-6 population, literates and relates rates and ratios. 4. In working out 'decadal variation' and percentage decal variation' for 1941-1951 & 1951-1961 of India and Nagaland State, the population of Tuensang District for 1951(7.025) & the population of Tuensang (83,501) & Mon (50,774) districts for 1961 Census have not been taken into account as the area was censused for the first time in 1951 and the same are not comparable. 5. The 1981 Census could not be held owing to disturbed conditions prevailing in Assam. Hence the population figures for 1981 of Assam have been worked out by 'Interpolation'. 6. The 1991 Census was not held in Jammu & Kashmir. Hence the population figures for 1991 of Jammu & Kashmir have been worked out by 'Interpolation'. 7. The distribution of population of Pondicherry (Puducherry) by sex for 1901 (246,354), and 1931 (258,628) and 1941 (285,011) is not available. The figures of India for these years are, therefore, exclusive of these population figures so far as distribution by sex is concerned. 8. Arunachal Pradesh was censused for the first time in 1961.9. In 1951, Tuensang was censused for the first time in 129.5 sq.kms of areas only. In 1961 censused areas of Tuensang District of Nagaland was increased to 5356.1 sq.kms. 10. Due to non-availability of census data the figures for the decades, from 1901 to 1951 have been estimated for the districts of Kohima, Phek, Wokha, Zunheboto and Mokokchung of Nagaland. Estimation however could not be done for Tuensang and Mon as they were not fully censused prior to 1961. 11. As the sex break-up is not available for the year 1901. Figures for males and females have been estimated for the year 1901 for Madhya Pradesh. 12. One village Ramtapur (code No. 217 and 101 in 1951 and 1961 respectively) ofJukkal circle of Degulur taluka which was transferred under the state Reorganisation Act, 1956 from Maharashtra to Andhra Pradesh, till continues in Nanded district of Maharashtra. The population of this village has, however, been adjusted in Nizamabad district for the year 1901-1951. 13.

This section provides data on education, gender, poverty, housing, amenities, employment and other economic indicators. These indicators for the country and for the States will help in identifying the linkages between socio- economic indicators and achievement of health goals. According to 2011 Census, the overall literacy rate of India is 73%. At the time of Independence the country's literacy rate was abysmally low, 14%. Over the years literacy rate has been increasing but with varied rates in different states with some states like Kerala (94%) and Mizoram (91.3%) are well above the national average while states like Bihar has a dismal rate of 61.8%. There is also a concern for female literacy rate (64.6%) which is much below the male literacy rate (80.9%). There is a strong need to improve the overall literacy rate as improved literacy rate has an impact on increasing a country's economic growth rate and decreasing population growth rate. Also as India has a very young population, literacy will play a very important role in turning the young population into potential human capital. (Table 2.1.1). At the national level, the mean age at effective marriage for female in the year 2016 is 22.2 years and varies from 21.7 years in rural areas to 23.1 years in urban areas. Among the bigger States/UTs, the mean age varies from 21.2 years in West Bengal to 24.7 years in Jammu & Kashmir. Table (2.2.1) Before 2005, the official measure of poverty line was based primarily on food security. It was defined as the per capita expenditure needed for a person to consume enough calories and be able to pay for associated essentials to survive. Since 2005, the Government adopted Tendulkar methodology which moved away from calorie anchor to a basket of goods. Using the Tendulkar methodology, NITI Aayog estimates that during the year 2011-12, 25.7% of population in rural areas and 13.7% in urban areas live below the poverty line (Table 2.2.2). The second advance estimates for Per Capita Net National Income for the year 2017-18, at current prices is Rs. 112764 crore and Rs. 86689 crore at constant price (base year 2011-12) (Table 2.3.2). Safe drinking water is essential for good health. As on 01.04.2017, 13,25,302 habitations were provided with safe drinking water under National Rural Drinking Water Programme (Table 2.5.3). As on 01.04.2017, The habitations identified as affected from flouride and arsenic were 13,492 and 18,258 respectively in the country (Table 2.5.4(a) and Table 2.5.4(b) ).45 National Health Profile 20182.1 Education 2.1.1 State / UT wise Literacy Rate in India as per Census, 2011 S.

Each indicator is like a piece of a puzzle contributing to an overall picture. When indicators are tracked over time, they allow us to see how the health of population is changing. This chapter provides a broad overview on the incidence and prevalence of common communicable and non-communicable diseases, morbidity & associated mortality, health risks and performance of related national health programmes in the country. It also provides an overview of reproductive and child health in the country as well as information about National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS). Communicable Diseases Malaria has been a problem in India for centuries. At one time a rural disease, diversified under the pressure of developments into various ecotypes. These ecotypes have been identified as forest malaria, urban malaria, rural malaria, industrial malaria, border malaria and migration malaria; the latter cutting across boundaries of various epidemiological types. In 2017, maximum number of Malaria cases have been reported in Odisha (3,52,140 cases) and maximum number of deaths have been reported in West Bengal (29 deaths). The overall prevalence of the disease has diminished in 2012 and 2013 however there is a slight increase in 2014 and again started decreasing from 2015. [Table No. 3.1.1] Kala-azar is the second largest parasitic killer in the world. In India Leishmania donovani is the only parasite that causes this disease. Bihar accounts for most of the cases by Kala-azar. Out of the overall cases reported in 2017, 72% of the cases have been reported in Bihar.[Table No. 3.1.3] Dengue and Chikungunya transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, are a cause of great concern to public health in India. Every year, thousands of individuals are affected and contribute to the burden of health care. Dengue outbreaks have continued since the 1950s but severity of disease has increased in the last two decades. There has been considerable decrease in the number of swine flu cases/ deaths in the year 2014 as compared with 2012 & 2013. However, the number of cases and deaths has been drastically increased in the year 2015. In 2016, the cases have been decreased to 1786 and again increased to 38811 in 2017[Table No. 3.1.28]. Similarly, total of 63,679 cases of Chikungunya were reported in 2017 as compared with 64,057 cases in 2016.[Table 3.1.2] Total number of cases and deaths due to Chicken Pox were 74,035 and 92 respectively in 2017. Kerala has accounted for maximum number of cases (30,941) and West Bengal has accounted for maximum number of Deaths (53) due to Chicken Pox in 2017. [Table No.3.1.29 (B)]. Total number of Cases and Deaths due to Encephalitis were 12,485 and 626 in India during 2017 respectively. Assam has reported maximum numbers of Cases (5525) and Odisha has reported maximum number of deaths (246). [Table No. 3.1.30(B)]. Total number of Cases and Deaths due to Viral Meningitis were 7,559 and 121 respectively in 2017. Andhra Pradesh accounted for maximum number of Cases (1493) maximum number of Deaths (33). [Table No. 3.1.31 (B)] Since the reported Data is by and large from Government health facilities, it may have limitations in terms of its completeness as Private Medical & Health Care Institution still need to strengthen their reporting to their respective Government Health units.75 National Health Profile 2018 (i) Among the various communicable diseases reported by the States/UTs during the year 2017, the following communicable diseases accounted for the maximum percentage of cases reported:- Morbidity Reported on Major Communicable Diseases Acute Communicable Diseases -2017 (ii) Among the various Communicable diseases reported by the States/UTs during the year 2017, the following communicable diseases accounted for the maximum percentage of deaths reported: Pneumonia, 23% Acute Reported in Communicable Diseases -201776 National Health Profile 2018 (iii) Communicable Diseases with High Case Fatality Rate (About 2% and above) during 2017, as reported by the States/UTs.

The annual Cases and deaths due to Cholera in 1991 were 7,088 and 150, respectively which has now reduced to 494 and 3 respectively during the year 2017. (Table No. 3.1.6 (B)). (v) According to National AIDS Control Organization, 11,81,125 patients from 533 ART centers have ever started ART in the country till December, 2017. [Table No. 3.1.23]77 National Health Profile 2018Non- Communicable Diseases After completion of 70 years of independence, our country has witnessed remarkable progress in the health status of its population. However, over the past few decades, there has been major transitions in the country that have serious impact on health. Changes have been seen in economic development, nutritional status, fertility and mortality rates and consequently, the disease profile has changed considerably. Though there have been substantial achievements in controlling communicable diseases, still they contribute significantly to disease burden of the country. Decline in morbidity and mortality from communicable diseases have been accompanied by a gradual shift to, and accelerated rise in the prevalence of, chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancers, mental health disorders and injuries. Based on available evidence from NPCDCS, out of 3,57,23,660 patients attended NCD clinics, 8.41% people are diagnosed with Diabetes, 10.22% are diagnosed with Hypertension, 0.37% are diagnosed with Cardiovascular diseases, 0.13% are diagnosed with Stroke and 0.11% are diagnosed with Common Cancers (Table 3.2.1). During the year 2015, the lives of 4,13,457 and 1,33,623 people are cut short as a result of accidental and Suicide cases respectively. Many more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury. [Table No. 3.2.4] Suicide rates are increasing significantly for young adults including male, female & transgender in a wider population. Maximum number of Suicide Cases (44,593) is reported between the age group 30-45 Years. [Table No. 3.2.6(A),(B),(C)] Total number of disabled persons in India is 26,814,994 as per the Census 2011. [Table No. 3.2.8] Total number of cases and deaths due to snake bite are 1,42,366 and 948 respectively in 2017.

Health financing levers to move closer to universal health coverage lie in three interrelated areas: raising funds for health; reducing financial barriers to access through prepayment and subsequent pooling of funds in preference to direct out-of-pocket payments; and Allocating or using funds in a way that promotes efficiency and equity. Developments in these key health financing areas will determine whether health services exist and are available for everyone and whether people can afford to use health services when they need them. Health Finance indicators provide an understanding of patterns of investments, expenditure, sources of funding and proportion of allocation vis-\u00e0-vis other total allocations. It also provides an important tool to understand health outcomes in relation to the expenditure. Total public expenditure on health for the year 2015-16 stood at Rs 1.4 lakh crores. (Table 4.1.1) Per capita public expenditure on health in nominal terms has gone up from Rs 621 in 2009-10 to Rs 1112 in 2015-16. (Table 4.1.2) Public expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP was 1.02% in 2015-16. There is no significant change in expenditure since 2009-10. (Table 4.1.2) The Centre-State share in total public expenditure on health was 31:69 in 2015-16. (Figure 4.1.1) Total public expenditure on health (excluding other Central Ministries) in 2015-16 was Rs 140,054 crores, with Medical and Public Health comprising the major share (78.7%). The share of Family Welfare was 12.6%. (Figure 4.1.2) Urban and rural health services constituted 71% of the public expenditure on medical and public health in 2015-16. (Figure 4.1.3) The North-Eastern states had the highest and EAG states (including Assam) had the lowest average per capita public expenditure on health in 2015-16 (excluding UTs). (Table 4.1.5) The North Eastern states had the highest public health expenditure as a percentage of GSDP in 2015- 16 (2.76%). The value was 1.36% for EAG (including Assam) and 0.76% for major non-EAG states. (Table 4.1.5) Based on Health Survey (71st round) conducted by NSSO, Average medical expenditure incurred during stay at hospital from Jan 2013 - Jun 2014 was Rs. 14,935 for rural and Rs. 24,436 for urban in India. (Table 4.2.2(a) and Table 4.2.2(b)) Average total medical expenditure per child birth as in patient over last 365 days (survey conducted from Jan to Jun 2014) in a public hospital in rural area is Rs. 1,587 and in urban area is Rs. 2,117. (Table 4.2.3) Around 43 crore individuals were covered under any health insurance in the year 2016-17. This amounts to 34% of the total population of India. 79% of them were covered by public insurance companies. (Table 4.3.5) Overall, 80% of all persons covered with insurance fall under Government sponsored schemes. (Table 4.3.5) Public insurance companies had a higher share of coverage and premium for all types of health insurance policies, except family floater policies including individual policies. (Table 4.3.5) Compared to countries that have either Universal Health Coverage or moving towards it, India's per capita public spending on health is low. (Figure 4.4.3 and Table 4.4.1)169 National Health Profile 2018Explanatory Notes on Health Data Budget Estimates (BE): The 'Budget Estimate' for any ministry or scheme is the amount allocated to it in the budget papers for the following year. For instance, in the budget speech in February 2018, the Finance Minister presented budget estimates for expenditures under various heads for the 2018-19 financial year which runs from April 2018 to March 2019. Revised Estimates (RE): Once the financial year gets underway, some ministries may need more funds than was actually allocated to them under the budget estimates. The government approaches parliament with such supplementary requests for funds during the course of the financial year (in the monsoon or winter session). These supplementary demands are reflected in the revised estimates for the current year (2016-17). Thus, along with budget estimates for 2017-18, the Finance Minister presents the revised estimates for 2016-17.Actuals: Actual expenditures are the final amounts spent under different heads and may exceed (or fall short of) the Revised Estimates. Since the actual expenditure can only be assessed once the financial year is over and final accounts have been prepared, the Actual expenditures presented in the budget papers are for the earlier financial year i.e. for the year 2015-16. 1. PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH The three main categories of public expenditure on health are Medical and Public Health, Family Welfare and Others. These are explained below. 1.1 Medical & Public Health Medical and Public Heath under the Department of Health deals with health care, including awareness campaigns, immunization campaigns, preventive medicine, and public health.

Availability of adequate number of human resources with suitable skill mix and their appropriate deployment at different levels of health care set-up are essential for providing effective health care services for the population. In many developing countries, such as India, information on human resources in the health sector is incomplete and unreliable. This prevents effective workforce planning and management. National Health Profile aims to address this deficit by producing a more complete picture of India's health workforce. Human Resource indicators provide an overview of availability of trained and specialized medical, nursing and paramedical personnel in the country. These also give an idea regarding regional distribution and disparities. Human Resource indicators cover the details of allopathic doctors, dental surgeons, AYUSH doctors, nursing personnel and various paramedical health man-powers in the country. Number of registered allopathic doctors possessing recognized medical qualifications (under MCI Act) and registered with state medical council for the years 2016 and 2017 were 25,282 and 17,982 respectively. At present, average population served per government allopathic doctor is 11,039. (Table 5.1 and 5.3) There has been a marked improvement in the Dentist to population Ratio. Number of Dental Surgeon registered with Central/State Dental Councils of India up to 31.12.2017 were 2,51,207. (Table 5.2) India, with its kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage, is proud of some unique medicinal forms that look at health, disease and causes of disease in completely different ways. Best known as the AYUSH, its main focus is on holistic health and well-being of humans. Over the years with gaining popularity, there is a steady rise in total number of registered AYUSH Doctors in India from 7, 71,468 in 2016 to 773668 in 2017.(Table 5.4) AYUSH has maximum number of registered Ayurvedic doctors (55.44%), followed by registered Homeopathy Doctors (36.77%) in India. (Figure 5.4) There is an increase in the availability of Allopathic Medical Practitioners, Dental Surgeon and Nurses per lakh population over the years.

It also signifies the investments and priority accorded to create the infrastructure in public and private sectors. This section on Health Infrastructure indicators is subdivided into two categories viz. educational infrastructure and service infrastructure. Educational infrastructure provides details of medical colleges, students admitted to M.B.B.S. course, post graduate degree/diploma in medical and dental colleges, admissions to BDS & MDS courses, AYUSH Institutes, nursing courses and paramedical courses. Service infrastructure in health includes details of allopathic hospitals, hospital beds, Indian System of Medicine & Homeopathy hospitals, sub centers, PHC, CHC, blood banks, eye banks, and mental hospitals.

Situation becomes more complex by the fact that around 70% of Indian population lives in rural areas known for limited access to healthcare. The primary providers of healthcare in these areas are private clinics and hospitals, though there is a presence of Government funded public health services. While government has undertaken multiple initiatives to address the concern for service delivery and access to healthcare, there are still substantial gaps to be addressed for better healthcare infrastructure, access and its equity based distribution. At this outset, government realizes that effective health resource management, allocation and monitoring based on evidence for timely achievements of goals. There is need of comprehensive picture of Indian healthcare sector to address aforesaid challenges and provide accessible, acceptable, affordable, equity based and patient centered quality healthcare services for the community. There are constraints on public health resources therefore, it is essential to allocate resources based on real world data and do regular monitoring and impact assessment of the allocated resources. Recognizing the role of private health sector in Indian settings and its potential to supplement government initiatives and planning for public health resources, it has been felt to obtain reliable information on private sector healthcare resource deployment. This will also underpin government strategies to hitherto unreached segments of the population, where public health resources are constrained, potential to tie up with private sector can be explored for better service delivery. For resource constraint country such as India, having comprehensive information on both public and private health sector is prerequisite for planning resource allocation. Generation and adoption of such evidence will help in driving judicious health resource planning and allocation to reduce the disparities and inequities in all three dimensions to achieve the Universal Health Coverage. CBHI is committed to build an integrated health informatics platform which can provide reliable, accurate and relevant national health information and enable evidence based policy formulation and decision making. In line with the core strategies of generating evidence to facilitate rational planning and resource allocation, CBHI has embarked on an ambitious project to exhaustively map the healthcare establishments from both public and private sector, as one of its key initiatives. CBHI now envisages setting up of consolidated platform of healthcare resource information named National Health Resource Repository (NHRR) to fulfill its core objective & intends to develop a single source of healthcare resource information that contains information on healthcare resources of both public and private sector in the country. Acknowledging the relevance of evidence based health resource planning, CBHI in consultation with DGHS conducted a pilot study of the concept in 2014 to test the feasibility of the concept called NHRR. A street-by- street census was conducted to collect and comprehensively map 2098 public and private health facilities across four districts on 22nd September, 2015, recognizing the relevance of data as a navigating module for planning public health services, Shri.J P Nadda, Hon'ble Union Minister of Health & FW, announced the nation wise roll out of National Health Resource Repository. Vision Creating a robust, standardized and secured information technology enabled repository of country's healthcare resources befitting as a building block into country's long term strategy of digitalizing healthcare to strengthen evidence based decision making.292 National Health Profile 2018Goal NHRR envisages creating a single gateway of authentic, standardized, updated public and private healthcare resource intelligence and develop user friendly system with utility to serve as a decision making tool for varied categories of health system stakeholders.ObjectivesIt has been mandated to achieve the following objectives Promote evidence based planning and decision making in healthcare sector through provision of comprehensive data on healthcare resources (both public and private sector) in the country. Provide visibility of private sector healthcare resources to facilitate public private partnership initiatives for improve access and availability of health services Provide technology based solutions to improve efficiency of health systems by improving planning, provisioning of healthcare resources Improve informed decision making and community awareness by allowing access to holistic information on healthcare resources. Promote meaningful use of data collection and exchange services for better healthcare management by providing a common platform for sharing information. Promote convergence between similar programmes by providing interoperability Enhance effectiveness of programme planning and implementation at centre, state and district level by providing updated healthcare resource status. Provide a platform for managing emergencies effectively by providing information on all the healthcare resources (public & private) in the designated geography. Furnish standardized data, distribution of resources and trends on the global platform, using regularly updated health status indicators. Rationale from NHRR Stakeholders and users perspectivesDecision making in the healthcare sector is highly complex and have different levels ranges from single patient to country's policy makers at large. Stakeholders in health system range from single patient, community, providers, professional bodies, health Councils, various professional bodies, State, Central government and various development agencies etc It was comprehended that envisaged NHRR should be able to cater the requirements of all stakeholders. Considering relevance and classification of data to be captured under NHRR, all stakeholders can be divided into four categories- Policy Makers, National & State Programme Managers, community and Private Providers. NHRR aims to support decision making of all these stakeholders by providing reliable information, thereby, catering to the unmet needs of these stakeholders. Needs of Policy Makers: It is important that larger policy decisions are taken based on latest and reliable information on the available healthcare resources, their deployment and trends that can address entrenched problem of health system with real time solutions. To aid this, health policy and system planning must be demand-driven, and satisfy the needs of modern healthcare systems utilizing up-do-date information on country's healthcare resources. 293 National Health Profile 2018Needs of National and State Programme Managers Program planning involves identifying and projecting most critical needs of the different programme and community and by analyzing their existing ability to address those requirements. National and State Programme Managers draw their implementation plan keeping in consideration the gap analysis and priorities, presenting the case to higher -ups, executing the plan and evaluating the outcome of the efforts, and reporting that outcome back to partners, stakeholders, and to policy makers. Needs of Community: Community is a major stakeholder in the healthcare system where all the planning, decisions, services and provisions get concentrated, and eventually are the beneficiary of healthcare services and related interventions. In the current scenario, it is widely advocated that role of the community should not only be limited to recipient of services but it should also have community participation in decision making. Community decision making primarily involves decision making at two level; individual level and community at large. Information on availability, and affordability of health services influence access to health services. Needs of Private Providers: Private providers constitute a significant part of the health system in India which ranges from single providers to corporate hospitals. Private provider behavior is influenced by the interplay of policy-makers who set policy, enact legislation and enforce regulations. Similarly, it is also affected by purchasing power of populations and providers' experience, skills and motivations to deal with patient, government and their competitor. However, focusing on coverage, quality, cost, along with policy-makers, providers and people, serves as a helpful aide-memoire for private providers to organize their service better and eventually leading to service improvement. Data Variables Over 850 variables have been identified from extensive literature review of Indian Public Health Standard Guidelines (IPHS), individual national programme operational guidelines And National Quality Asuurance Guidelines for public health facilities. A Census at national level for health resource enumeration will be carried out to obtain data from all public and private health facilities of 29 States and 7 Union Territories, concurrently, and mapping all healthcare establishments in all the districts across the country. All the public health facilities including District Hospitals, Sub-Divisional Hospital, Taluka-Community Health Centre, Primary Health Centre, Sub Centre, other government hospitals and private hospitals , private doctors, diagnostic labs and chemists present nationwide shall be covered in the Census.294 National Health Profile 2018WHO Collaborating Centers for the Family of International Classifications (ICD-10, ICF & ICHI) In the World and India WHO works with a network of Collaborating Centers to develop, disseminate, implement and update the WHO Family of International Classifications to support national and international health information systems, statistics and evidence. The Collaborating Centers have been established to assist WHO and users with the development and implementation of WHO-Family of International Classifications. It is important that users bring to the attention of the respective Centre any significant problems they might encounter in the use of WHO-FIC classifications. Proposals for amendments or additions to the classifications should be directed, in the first instance, to the relevant Centre.

This will be the world's largest government funded health care programme. Benefits of the scheme are portable across the country and a beneficiary covered under the scheme will be allowed to take cashless benefits from any public/private empanelled hospitals across the country. The beneficiaries can avail benefits in both public and empanelled private facilities. To control costs, the payments for treatment will be done on package rate (to be defined by the Government in advance) basis. States would need to have State Health Agency (SHA) to implement the scheme. 2. the quality and coverage of Antenatal Care (ANC) including diagnostics and counselling services as part of the Reproductive Maternal Neonatal Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) Strategy. Shri J P Nadda, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare, launched PMSMA on 04-November-2016. PMSMA guarantees a minimum package of antenatal care services to women in their 2nd / 3rd trimesters of pregnancy at designated government health facilities. PMSMA is based on the promise \u2014 that if every pregnant woman in India is examined by a physician and appropriately investigated at least once during the PMSMA and then appropriately followed up \u2014 the process can result in reduction in the number of maternal and neonatal deaths in our country. 3. National Health Mission The National Health Mission (NHM) encompasses its two Sub-Missions, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the newly launched National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). The main programmatic components include Health System Strengthening in rural and urban areas- Reproductive-Maternal- Neonatal-Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A), and Communicable and Non-Communicable Diseases. The NHM envisages achievement of universal access to equitable, affordable & quality health care services that are accountable and responsive to people's needs.3.1 National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) (2005) National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in April 2005 and it morphed into National Health Mission (NHM) with launch of National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) during 2013. Thereafter, NRHM and NUHM became two sub-missions under the overarching NHM. NRHM seeks to provide equitable, affordable and quality health care to the rural population, especially the vulnerable groups. Under the NRHM, the Empowered Action Group (EAG) States as well as North Eastern States, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh have been given special focus. The thrust of the mission is 299 National Health Profile 2018on establishing a fully functional, community owned, decentralized health delivery system with inter-sectoral convergence at all levels, to ensure simultaneous action on a wide range of determinants of health such as water, sanitation, education, nutrition, social and gender equality. Institutional integration within the fragmented health sector was expected to provide a focus on outcomes, measured against Indian Public Health Standards for all health facilities. 3.2 National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) (2013) The National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) as a sub-mission of National Health Mission (NHM) was approved by the Cabinet on 1st May 2013. NUHM envisages to meet health care needs of the urban population with the focus on urban poor, by making available to them essential primary health care services and reducing their out of pocket expenses for treatment. NUHM would endeavour to achieve its goal through:- i) Need based city specific urban health care system to meet the diverse health care needs of the urban poor and other vulnerable sections. ii) Institutional mechanism and management systems to meet the health-related challenges of a rapidly growing urban population. iii) Partnership with community and local bodies for a more proactive involvement in planning, implementation, and monitoring of health activities. iv) Availability of resources for providing essential primary health care to urban poor.v) Partnerships with NGOs, for profit and not for profit health service providers and other stakeholders. It would primarily focus on slum dwellers and other marginalized groups like rickshaw pullers, street vendors, railway and bus station coolies, homeless people, street children, construction site workers. 4.

In order to facilitate the effective implementation of the Tobacco Control Law, to bring about greater awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco as well as to fulfil the obligations under the WHO-FCTC, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India launched the National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) in 2007- 08 in 42 districts of 21 States/Union Territories of the country with objective to bring about greater awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use and Tobacco Control Laws and to facilitate effective implementation of the Tobacco Control Laws. Further, the objective of this programme is to control tobacco consumption and minimize the deaths caused by it.15. The Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) (2003) PMSSY was announced in 2003 with objectives of correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable/ reliable tertiary healthcare services and also to augment facilities for quality medical education in the country. PMSSY has two components: (i) Setting up of AIIMS like Institutions. (ii) Upgradation of Government Medical College Institutions.Apart from declaration of six AIIMS in 2003, the PMSSY scheme has been enlarged to encompass setting up of many other AIIMS at different states and also upgradation of existing Government Medical Colleges/Institutions (GMCIs) in different states. 16. Janani Suraksha Yojana was launched in April 2005 by modifying the National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS). The Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) is a centrally sponsored Scheme which is being implemented with the objective of reducing maternal and infant mortality by promoting institutional delivery among pregnant women. Under the JSY, eligible pregnant women are entitled for cash assistance irrespective of the age of mother and number 303 National Health Profile 2018of children for giving birth in a government or accredited private health facility. The scheme focuses on poor pregnant w oman with a special dispensation for states that have low institutional delivery rates. Janani Suraksha Yojana was launched in April 2005 by modifying the National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS). The NMBS came into effect in August 1995 as one of the components of the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). The scheme was transferred from the Ministry of Rural Development to the Department of Health & Family Welfare during the year 2001-02. The NMBS provides for financial assistance of Rs. 500/- per birth up to two live births to the pregnant women who have attained 19 years of age and belong to the below poverty line (BPL) households. States were classified into Low Performing States and High Performing States on the basis of institutional delivery rate i.e. states having institutional delivery 25% or less were termed as Low Performing States (LPS) and those which have institutional delivery rate more than 25% were classified as High Performing States (HPS). The scheme also provides performance based incentives to women health volunteers known as ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) for promoting institutional delivery among pregnant women. 17. Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) (2004) Government of India initiated Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in 2004 with the aim to detect and respond to outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases. A Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) at Delhi, State Surveillance Units (SSU) at all State/UT head quarters and District Surveillance Units (DSU) at all Districts in the country have been established.Mission of IDSP is to strengthen the disease surveillance in the country by establishing a decentralized State based surveillance system for epidemic prone diseases to detect the early warning signals, so that timely and effective public health actions can be initiated in response to health challenges in the country at the Districts, State and National level. Objective of IDSP is to strengthen/maintain decentralized laboratory based IT enabled disease surveillance system for epidemic prone diseases to monitor disease trends and to detect and respond to outbreaks in early rising phase through trained Rapid Response Team (RRTs)18. National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) (2003) The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) is an umbrella programme for prevention and control of Vector borne diseases. Earlier the Vector Borne Diseases were managed under separate National Health Programmes, but now NVBDCP covers all 6 Vector borne diseases namely: 1. Malaria 2. Dengue 3. Chikungunya 4. Japanese Encephalitis 5. Kala-Azar 6. Filaria (Lymphatic Filariasis). The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) is the programme for prevention & control of these vector borne diseases as an integral part of the National Health Mission (NHM) of India. The NVBDCP envisages a self-sustained and well informed, healthy India free from vector borne diseases with equitable access to quality health care services nearest to their residences. The Programme activities are directed in a way to meet with the Millennium Development Goal of halting and reversing the incidence of malaria and other vector borne diseases by the year 2015. 19. National AIDS Control Programme (1992) National AIDS Control Organization is a division of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare that provides leadership to HIV/AIDS control programme in India through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies. In 1992 India's first National AIDS Control Programme (1992-1999) was launched, and National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) was constituted to implement the programme. Over time, the focus has shifted from raising awareness to behavior change, from a national response to a more decentralized response and to increasing involvement of NGOs and networks of PLHIV.304 National Health Profile 2018In 1992, the Government launched the first National AIDS Control Programme (NACP- I) to combat the disease. NACP I was implemented with an objective of slowing down the spread of HIV infections so as to reduce morbidity, mortality and impact of AIDS in the country. National AIDS Control Board (NACB) was constituted and an autonomous National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) was set up to implement the project. In November 1999, the second National AIDS Control Project (NACP- II) was launched with two key objectives to reduce the spread of HIV infection in India AND to increase India's capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS on a long-term basis. In response to the evolving epidemic, the third phase of the national programme (NACP -III) was launched in July 2007 with the goal of Halting and Reversing the Epidemic by the end of project period. Consolidating the gains made during NACP-III, the National AIDS Control Programme Phase-IV (NACP- IV) (2012- 17) was launched to accelerate the process of reversal and to further strengthen the epidemic response in India through a cautious and well defined integration process over the period 2012-2017 with key strategies of intensifying and consolidating prevention services with a focus on HRG and vulnerable population, increasing access and promoting comprehensive care, support and treatment, expanding IEC services for general population and high risk groups with a focus on behavior change and demand generation, building capacities at national, state and district levels and strengthening the Strategic Information Management System. 20. Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) (1997) The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme initiated early and firm steps to its declared objective of Universal access to early quality diagnosis and quality TB care for all TB patients'. The year 2012 witnessed innumerable activities happening towards the same. Notification of TB; case based web based recording and reporting system ( NIKSHAY); Standards of TB care in India; Composite indicator for monitoring programme performance; Rapid scale up of the programmatic management of drug resistant TB services are few of the worthwhile mention in this regard. NIKSHAY, the web based reporting for TB programme has been another notable achievement initiated in 2012 and has enabled capture and transfer of individual patient data from the remotest health institutions of the country.21. National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) (1992)Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) continue to be a major public health problem in India. Realizing the magnitude of the problem, the Government of India had launched a 100 per cent centrally assisted National Goitre Control Programme (NGCP) in 1962. In August, 1992 the National Goitre Control Programme (NGCP) was renamed as National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) with a view of wide spectrum of Iodine Deficiency Disorders like mental and physical retardation, deaf mutisim, cretinism, still births, abortions etc.. The programme is being implemented in all the States/UTs for entire population. The goal of NIDDCP is to bring the prevalence of IDD to below 5% in the country and to ensure 100% consumption of adequately iodated salt (15ppm) at the household level.22. National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) (1983)Govt. of India started National Leprosy Control Programme in 1955 based on Dapsone domiciliary treatment through vertical units implementing survey education and treatment activities. Govt. of India established a high power committee under chairmanship of Dr. M.S. Swaminathan in 1981 for dealing with the problem of leprosy. Based on its recommendations the NLEP was launched in 1983 with the objective to arrest the disease activity in all the known cases of leprosy. The National Health Policy, Govt. of India sets the goal of elimination of leprosy i.e. to reduce the no. of cases to < 1/10,000 population by the year 2005. The National Leprosy Eradication 305 National Health Profile 2018Programme took up the challenge and as a result of the hard work and meticulously planned and executed activities, the country achieved the goal of elimination of leprosy as a public health problem, defined as less than 1 case per 10,000 population, at the National Level in the month of December, 2005. 23. National Mental Health Program (NMHP) (1982)To address the huge burden of mental disorders and shortage of qualified professionals in the field of mental health, Government of India has been implementing National Mental Health Program (NMHP) since 1982. The Program was re-strategized in 2003 to include two schemes, viz. Modernization of State Mental Hospitals and Up-gradation of Psychiatric Wings of Medical Colleges/General Hospitals. The Manpower development scheme (Scheme-A & B) became part of the Program in 2009.The Government has supported the establishment of 23 Centres of Excellence under the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) since initiation of Scheme. To address the acute shortage of qualified mental health professionals in the country, the Central Government, under the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) is providing support for implementation of manpower development schemes by States/UTs for establishment of Centres of Excellence and strengthening/ establishment of Post Graduate (PG) Departments in mental health specialties. These schemes have resulted in increasing the availability of additional Human Resources in the field of mental health.24. National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCB) (1976)National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCB&VI) was launched in the year 1976 with the goal of reducing the prevalence of blindness to 0.3% by 2020.

The objective of this publication is to create a versatile database of health information of India which is comprehensive, up-to-date and easily accessible to all stakeholders in the healthcare sector. NHP provides recent trends in demography, disease profile (communicable and non communicable/lifestyle diseases) and available health resources that define a country's health status. Following the standard coding from Family of International classification (FIC) in presenting the diseases profile will improve interoperability of the data internationally. NHP provides relevant information to the planners, policy makers, health administrators, research workers and others engaged healthcare sector to take informed decisions. This publication will also be useful for medical post graduates and trainees of medical and paramedical personnel and will contribute further to the improvement of quality of health services and equitable distribution of health resources in the country. The research team for NHP assessed a large number of websites and publications dealing with management of health data relevant to health status of a nation and adopted a modified structure of six - indicators - Demographic, Socio-Economic, Health Status, Health Finance, Health Infrastructure and Human Resource in Health Sector in order to organize and manage the health information of India. This structure was discussed in great detail (with a range of people from senior health policy makers, administrators to epidemiologists and anthropologists) to assess its robustness to handle data now and afterwards and the need to include or exclude data from the existing publications. Identifying the most appropriate data sources for the selected indicators is an on-going research. Eventually we present the most updated data identified from various sources and are illustrated in the new format of tables with various combinations of parameters such as age, sex, urban, rural etc. NHP can contribute towards providing better universal and equitable healthcare to its people as envisaged in National Health Policy 2017 as it helps in informed decision making on policies and initiatives of various stakeholders in healthcare sector. Nevertheless, we recognize the need for continuous improvement of this publication to match the ever changing health needs of people and the paradigm shifts in program implementation to achieve higher levels of effectiveness. We envision that this structure of data organization will undergo further standardization and enhancement of the database. "}
