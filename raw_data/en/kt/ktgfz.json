Look no further than acupuncture allergy testing and treatment at Nao Medical! What is Acupuncture Allergy Testing? Acupuncture allergy testing is a non-invasive and painless way to identify allergies. During the test, small needles are inserted into specific acupuncture points on the body, and a small amount of the allergen is placed on the needle. If you are allergic to the substance, you may experience a mild reaction, such as redness or swelling at the site of the needle. How Does Acupuncture Allergy Treatment Work? Once your allergies have been identified through acupuncture allergy testing, our experienced practitioners will create a personalized treatment plan for you. Acupuncture can help reduce allergy symptoms by stimulating the immune system and reducing inflammation. In addition to acupuncture, we may also recommend dietary changes, herbal remedies, and other natural treatments to help manage your allergies.
