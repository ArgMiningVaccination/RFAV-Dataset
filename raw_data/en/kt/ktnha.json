Seidel-Morgenstern D. Flockerzi 2 1. The First Institute within the Max Planck Societ y Representing the Engineering Sciences At the beginning of the 21 st century the global society faces a problem. Given limited resources and a rapidly growing population, how it is possible to render modern production processes more economic while at the same time keep ing up and improving upon ecological standards? There can be no doubt this problem requires solutio ns that are both fast and feasible. On the other hand it is obvious that the desired solut ions should by no means have an ad hoc character. Instead, the concept of sustainability s hould serve as a guideline for all new developments. In order to avoid adverse effects it is crucial to have at one's disposal detailed knowledge of the fundamentals that govern the techn ological processes one is dealing with. However, such fundamental knowledge has traditional ly only been attributed to the basic sciences like physics, chemistry and biology. In co ntrast, the engineering sciences have traditionally been restricted to the mere applicati on of scientific knowledge. To some extent this situation had decoupled them from the fundamen tal sciences. For quite a while, industry and much of society hav e urged scientists to overcome this apparent gap. The engineering sciences should appro ach the fundamental sciences without missing out on concrete practical requirements. In other words: The modern engineering sciences are increasingly obliged to bridge the gap between basic research and industrial application. However, new prerequisites are required to make thi s essential bridging feasible. Thanks to the immense increase in computing power and capa city it is now possible to deal with systems of equations as they originate from the und erlying processes, and that are both very large and difficult to solve. Yet, tackling today's problems is not done by simply relying on computer power. In fact, the engineering sciences t hemselves have to focus to a greater extent on the development of new theoretical concep ts. Therefore, it is their task to further promote the paradigm shift in the engineering sciences towards a research that is increasingly focused on the development of new syst em-oriented methods and tools that are suitable for the analysis, synthesis and control of complex technical and biological systems. The Max Planck Society, which is by charter devoted to fundamental research, has paid tribute to this trend by founding the Max Planck In stitute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems. It is here that, within a highly interdisc iplinary research concept, chemical and control engineers, bio-engineers and system scienti sts are doing research together with mathematicians as well as natural and computer scie ntists. Their main aim is to develop new methods to render dynamic processes more efficient with a clear emphasis on chemical and Overview 3 bio-chemical processes. In this respect, there are two critical goals that must be met. First, the understanding of processes concerned with the s ynthesis and separation of substances both in chemical and biological systems must be aug mented. Second, the ultimate objective is to subsequently use this knowledge to manipulate the respective processes to achieve the desired result. 2. Foundation and Growth In 1996 the senate of the Max Planck Society (MPG) decided to establish the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems following the recommendations of a mixed commission of experts from the MPG and from v arious engineering research societies in Germany to found the first institute that is ded icated to the engineering sciences. Prof. Dr.- Ing. Dr. h.c. mult. Ernst Dieter Gilles (Univer-sity of Stuttgart) was appointed as the founding director of the institute. Because the Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg (OvGU) has a long standing tradition of excellence in the engineering sciences, Magdeburg was identified as a suitable place for the establis hment of this new MPI. The scientific work at MPI started in March 1998 in a temporary space (1300 m2 area) rented in the ZENIT-building on the campus of the m edical faculty at OvGU. Simultaneously, the realization of the MPI's new building (5700 m 2 area) located near the Elbe river was planned and prepared. The construction was started in fall 1999 and finished in summer 2001. In August 2001 the entire institute moved int o the new building where the scientific work was continued in September 2001. A very import ant prerequisite for our experimentally oriented research activities was the establishment of a bench scale laboratory hall (200 m 2 area in main hall) including satellite rooms for co nducting experiments that are potentially explosive. As an important condition for the successful scient ific establishment of the MPI and for its interaction with OvGU, the new faculty for Process and Systems Engineering was founded, which became one of the most important scientific c ollaboration partners of the institute. Within OvGU, new chairs were founded which play a k ey role in the interface to the MPI. These are the chairs for Bioprocess Engineering, Pr ocess Systems Engineering and Systems Theory of Technical Processes. From 2000 to 2002 the board of MPI directors was co mpleted by three appointments. These positions were filled in conjunction with thr ee university chairs at the faculty for Process and Systems Engineering. Prof. Dr.-Ing. Udo Reichl , formerly with the company Essex Ltd., joined the institute in July 2000 as th e director for the research field of Bioprocess Engineering. He is also full professor f or the same area at OvGU. In July 2001, 4 Prof. Dr.-Ing. Kai Sundmacher , formerly with Clausthal University, was appointed director for the research field of Process Engineering in co njunction with a full professorship for Process Systems Engineering at OvGU which he has he ld since 1999. A year later, Prof. Dr.- Ing. Andreas Seidel-Morgenstern , who has been a full professor for Chemical Proces s Engineering at OvGU since 1995 and who had been an external MPI scientific member since 1998 became the institute's fourth director. He gui des the MPI's research activities on Physical and Chemical Foundations of Process Engine ering. After these appointments, since fall 2002, the MPI's founding director, Prof. Ernst Dieter Gilles who is also a honorary professor at OvGU, has focused his activities on th e System Theoretical Fundamentals of Process and Bioprocess Engineering. In November 2001, the institute was proud to be abl e to involve Prof. Dr.-Ing. J\u00f6rg Raisch closely into its research activities as an appoint ed external scientific member of the MPI. Prof. Raisch founded the MPI research group on System and Control Theory in June 1998, and has guided it since. Simultaneously, he i s a full professor of Systems Theory of Technical Processes at the electrical engineering d epartment of the OvGU. The collaborations of the MPI with the electrical e ngineering department in Magdeburg were further intensified when Prof. Dr.-Ing. Achim Kienle, who has guided an MPI research group on Process Synthesis and Dynamics since March 1998 and prepared his habilitation thesis at the MPI, became full professor for Automa tion/Modeling in 2002. In July 2000, Prof. Dr. Dietrich Flockerzi joined the MPI. He established a research group dealing with the mathematical foundations of dynamical systems in May 2001. He is also a lecturer in engineering cybernetics at OvGU. In the course of the directors' appointments and th e establishment of a total of eight research groups (for more details see section 4), t he number of Ph.D. students, postdoctoral scientists, visiting scientists, and members of the technical staff was steadily growing during the period covered by this report (see Fig. 1). By the end of April 2003, the total number of staff employed at the MPI was 152.

Research Concept Technological processes must meet increasingly high and diverse specifications. It does not suffice that, for example, in a chemical plant a specific product is synthesized but it must also be produced meeting high quality standards at minimal environmental pollution, most economical usage of resources and maximum yield. Ou r institute is facing the challenge of designing, structuring and controlling technologica l processes, with particular focus on chemical engineering and biotechnology . This not only requires a sound knowledge of technic al plants and the underlying physical, chemical or biological phenomena, but methods from engineering and mathematics for the analysis and synthesis of dynamic systems are also indispensable. Therefore, engineers are closely cooperating with chemists, biologists and m athematicians. Research topics treated at the institute are rather diverse. As illustrated in Fig. 2, they cover the synthesis, analysis and control of chemic al reactors and separation processes; the collection of thermodynamic and kinetic basic data; the study of biochemical processes; the analysis of networks of functional units in biologi cal cells; and the design of integrated navigation systems. However, all these research act ivities share a common basis: they are all related to methods and tools which are provided by system sciences , i.e. system sciences is an important integrating factor in the institute's research concept. 6 In particular, all research projects are related to dynamic process models, i.e. suitable mathematical descriptions of the time-dependent beh avior of the considered processes. Due to the diversity of chemical unit operations and ap paratuses concerning the development of chemical process models, one focus is on systematiz ation of model building. The object is to support and partly automate the modeling procedure using methods from computer science. For this purpose, a software package is being devel oped at the MPI that is already being used for the systematic modeling of chemical as wel l as biological systems. When modeling cellular systems in biology, it is necessary to ide ntify metabolic pathways and signal transduction units and to describe them in submodel s. The dynamic model of the whole biological cell is then composed of many of such su bmodels.

This systematic modeling procedure generally yields the structure of a process model. Specific values for unknown parameters have to be d etermined by experimentation. Furthermore, such models deduced from theoretical c onsiderations require experimental validation. To conduct these experiments, the MPI i s equipped with chemical and biological laboratories as well as a multi-floor open-bay lab where bench-scale pilot plants can be set up. Based on process models, the dynamics of technical and biological processes can be studied. Using mathematical methods, it is, for exa mple, possible to analyze which qualitative dynamic behavior a plant can exhibit depending on its operating con ditions. Via computer simulations, critical states can be invest igated without risk, or tedious experiments can be replaced with computations that take merely seconds. Overview 7 Most importantly, however, it is possible to use pr ocess models to solve the core problem of engineering: process synthesis, layout, and cont rol, i.e. the design of technical plants and processes. A single apparatus can be properly dimensioned and designed, whole groups of apparatuses can be assembled to build com plete production plants, or several basic functions can be integrated in a single unit. Such extensively interconnected or integrated plants show a level of complexity that m akes it impossible to understand or control them without the use of model based methods. To fin d the most advantageous design for a plant, mathematical optimization methods can be used, and in computer simulations the behavior of different variants can be compared. For safe and economic operation of such plants, control engineering plays a crucial role. However, with increasing complexity of a plant, the design of control structures becomes more and more demanding. To find the optimal contro l control strategies, advanced methods of model based controller synthesis and model reduc tion techniques are essential. Engineering problems always focus on the solution o f real world problems. Therefore, solutions that were developed using mathematical mo dels will eventually have to demonstrate their effectiveness in experimental tes ts which are carried out in the institute's labs and in collaboration with industrial partners. 4. Organisation of Research The MPI's research is focused on challenging, compl ex technical and biological systems, which require a maximum degree of interdisciplinary interactions between different scientific disciplines in order to create new and s uccessful solutions. In order to achieve a maximum degree of interdisciplinary collaboration w ithin the institute, the classical departmental structure was made more flexible by th e establishment of research groups . As an important advantage of this group structure, it allows the MPI to adopt new research directions more quickly than a rigid departmental s tructure. At the moment, eight research groups are active whose names and leaders are given in Fig. 3. 8 The board of directors makes decisions regarding th e establishment of new research groups and approves the research budgets applied fo r by the groups. To strengthen the interdisciplinary cooperation, researchers from dif ferent groups work together in project areas. Each research project and each of its subpro jects at the institute is related to one of these projects areas. Hence, scientists from severa l disciplines share their specific perceptions and methodologies in the examination of a certain research topic. Fig. 3: Research groups cooperate within project areas. The interdisciplinary approach of the MPI is manife sted in two respects. First, several methods and approaches from chemistry, mathematics and engineering are used to examine one object from different perspectives. Second, oft en the same method is employed to investigate problems from several different applica tion areas. Thus, interdisciplinary cooperation is of great importance to the research being done at our Max Planck institute as can be seen from the matrix of research activities in Table 1.

Depending on the development of the scientific focus of a certain project, it might be moved into another project area. Simultaneously, depending on the scientific experti se needed in the considered project, further MPI research groups will be included in the research activities. In this respect, the matrix organization of MPI is a very useful and fle xible platform to carry out research projects and to push them forward into new, promising direct ions. 10 5. Project Areas at MPI In the following, the main objectives and the conte nts of the established MPI project areas will be outlined. 5.1. Research Area: Network Theory Mathematical models have been widely accepted as us eful tools for the solution of many technical problems. Mathematical modeling can help to plan more specific experiments, to evaluate experimental results in greater detail, or to accelerate the development of novel technical solutions, for example. However, sufficie ntly reliable models are a prerequisite for the successful application of model-based methods. The models must comprise the complete scientific knowledge necessary to solve a specific problem. Therefore, they have to be very complex in many cases. The development of n ew models is time-consuming and requires extensive knowledge and experience. The pu rpose of this project area is to simplify the model development by systematizing the modeling approaches for chemical and biochemical processes, and by integrating computer aided tools into the modeling process. The basic idea of the systematic modeling approach pursued here is to subdivide process models into elementary modeling units . The modeling units are elements of a modeling library and can be combined into new models of arbi trary complexity. This modular approach offers the following advantages: Frequently used submodels need not be re-created ag ain and again but are available from a model database. Alternative approaches, e.g. for the description of diffusion or reaction processes, can be exchanged easily. During model formulation, the modeler can concentra te on the underlying physical assumptions without being bothered by the mathemati cal representation. The transparency and reusability of existing models is increased. In the framework of several current projects, model databases for different chemical and biochemical processes are being developed. Implemen tation and utilization of the modeling units require a suitable computer tool. The compute r aided modeling system ProMoT (Process Modeling Tool) is such a tool. Overview 11 5.2. Research Area: Hierarchical Structures In many areas of application, process complexity ha s increased tremendously during the last few years, often defying the use of traditiona l synthesis and control methods. In the absence of sound theoretical concepts, heuristic ap proaches are prevalent at the moment. They are intrinsically problem specific and typical ly involve an extensive trial-and-error stage. Clearly, a mathematically consistent way of treatin g complex synthesis and control problems would be highly desirable. The growing complexity in technical processes is pr imarily due to the increasing interaction between different components in large-s cale systems. In chemical engineering, for example, there is a trend towards production pl ants relying to a greater extent on energy integration and material recycles in order to impro ve processes both in an economical and ecological sense. This development constitutes an e normous challenge to systems and control theory: traditional methods for the synthes is of process control strategies are based on an isolated treatment of small and typically rat her simple components; such an approach obviously does not meet the requirements of an incr easingly complex and integrated reality. It will inevitably lead to unsatisfactory (i.e. far from optimal) solutions. On the other hand, treating a complex overall system as some type of u nstructured conglomerate is clearly out of the question as the difficulties related to comp utational implementation usually grow exponentially with problem size. Hierarchical approaches may offer a cure for this d ilemma. They rely on decomposing the overall problem into sub-problems and reassembling their solutions in a hierarchical structure. Sub-problems are solved using process mo dels of different abstraction levels: higher-level, long-term decisions are made on the basis of a \"coarse\" model of the o verall process, whereas lower-level, short-term decisions stem from detailed models of individual process units. Although such an approach is extremely intuitive, so far a systematic and mathematically sound strategy only e xists in a rudimentary form. Hence, an essential objective within this project area is to improve the practical applicability of this strategy. Important new advances for the solution of this pro blem can be expected from a close cooperation between the areas of systems theory and biology: the abstracting approach of systems theory facilitates the discovery and use of analogies between problems from nature and technology. Nature, for example, is capable of very efficiently solving extremely complex regulatory tasks in a huge variety of completely different org anisms. Apparently nature also makes use 12 of some sort of hierarchical structure. If one succ eeds in understanding the principles of such biological regulatory processes, a systems theoreti c approach can help to transfer them to complex control problems from the fields of chemica l engineering (where the task is to control material and energy flows) and transportati on systems (where traffic flows are to be controlled), to name two. A more fundamental unders tanding of the basic principles used by nature to structure and solve complex biological re gulatory tasks can therefore also be beneficial when addressing problems of how to desig n complex control systems for diverse technical applications. 5.3. Research Area: Population Balance Systems Populations of similar objects are frequently chara cterized by a distribution of certain properties . Typical examples are particles of a solid, molecu les or cells. Some important parameters needed to characterize these objects are , for example, their size and shape or their chain length or moisture content. In populati ons of several objects these characteristics are not identical. The corresponding distribution f unctions change frequently with time and also depend on the local positions of the objects ( e.g. in a stirred reactor). For several important processes, a quantitative understanding o f systems with distributed properties is of essential importance, e.g., for comminution or precipitation processes to produce powders and pigments (as drug components or dyes), for crystallization processes to purify and isolate dissolved components, for the fo rmation of colloidal suspensions or for the drying of solid particles . Although there are significant differences between the processes mentioned above, population balance models allow the dynamics of the distribution of the different specific properties to be described in a unified manner. A f ew first examples of successfully applying a rigorous mathematical modeling for predicting par ticle size distributions in crystallization processes and chain length distributions in polymer ization processes have been given in the last years. However, there are many areas and appli cations that require further intensive research in order to be able to design and optimize processes with distributed parameters. One field of interest is the development of process monitoring techniques which are required to follow changes of the relevant distribution func tions. There is a need for efficient numerical methods to solve the underlying balance equations. Furthermore, reliable scale up concepts need to be developed, and improved control strategi es for population balance systems are required. Overview 13 5.4. Research Area: Reduced Models The synthesis and control of processes in chemical engineering and of biological systems have a decisive influence on the quality of the pro ducts and on the production costs. Safety regulations, environmental aspects and energy speci fications must also be taken into account when designing process strategies. Synthesis and control methods are based on mathematical models describing the relevant features of the underlying real process . On the one hand, rigorous detailed mathematical modeling of technical processes or cel lular systems offers a precise approximation of the real process, on the other han d it will inevitably lead to models of high dimension and of high structural complexity. As a c onsequence, such detailed models may be too complicated for a rigorous analysis of their dynamical behavior and for a practical design of efficient control strategies. Moreover th eir size and complexity may pose numerical problems and result in computational costs one migh t not be willing to accept. Furthermore, it is (in general) quite a delicate decision whether a \"successful\" numerical routine really has produced the correct answers. In biological systems the complex functionality of metabolic and regulat ory networks and of cell cycles needs to be mapped out. Based on sys tems theory and on the cooperation with biologists and computer scientists, mathematical mo dels of amenable size and structure are established. The decomposition (modularisation) of a network and the analysis of the resulting subnets (modules) and their interconnecti ons is an approach that promises to be successful in tackling the manifold aspects of biol ogical networks, aiming at a better understanding based on reduced models. Always keeping in mind the specific problem formula tion, for example, to detect multiple steady states, oscillations or b ursting phenomena, to analyze the pathways in signal transduction and in metabolic or regulatory networks, to optimize biological processes, to improve the process design, to design a robust control scheme in the presence o f uncertainties, to detect and compensate disturbances, one is thus interested in reduced models of the underlying process . These simplified models should still be capable of reflecting the es sentials of the dynamical behavior and should allow the construction of effective and comp utable control strategies. In the project 14 area Reduced Models, mathematical methods and tools such as invariant manifolds and waveform solutions are developed that lead to reduc ed models possessing the necessary precision for the specific task. The concepts deriv ed from the reduced model are sufficient to arrive at efficient strategies for the synthesis an d control of the real process under consideration. 5.5. Research Area: Integrated Processes In the chemical industries, the conversion of subst ances and the purification of the desired products usually are carried out in sequentially st ructured reaction-separation trains. In many cases, the performance of this classical chemical p rocess structure can be significantly improved by an integrative coupling of different pr ocess units. The integration of unit operations in multifunction al processes very often gives rise to synergetic effects which can be technically exploited. By suitable pr ocess design an efficient and environmentally benign process operat ion can be achieved. Possible advantages of process integration are: higher productivity, higher selectivity, reduced energy consumption, improved operational safety, improved ecological harmlessness by avoidance of au xiliary agents and chemical wastes. Due to the interaction of several process steps in one apparatus, the operational behavior of an integrated process unit can be much more comp lex than the behavior of a single unit. Therefore, suitable methods for process design and control have to be developed and applied, ensuring optimal and safe operation of the considered integrated process. The major objectives of the research in this projec t domain are to develop new concepts for process integration , to investigate their efficiency and to make them available for technical application. For this purpose, experiment al tools and theoretical methods are closely combined. To prepare the applicability of n ew processes on an industrial scale, miniplant technologies are used intensively in the institute's experimental investigations. Reactive distillation processes, chromatographic re actors, direct fuel cells, membrane reactors and fixed bed reactors with thermally coup led reaction zones are subjects of our current research activities in this project area. Overview 15 5.6. Research Area: Coupled Processes Complex processes commonly consist of several indiv idual sub-processes interacting with each other. Typical examples are: metabolic and regulatory networks in biological sys tems, production processes in chemical engineering, combined transport and traffic systems. In general it is not possible to correctly predict the behavior of the coupled overall process just by relying on knowledge about the individual u nits. This is because a qualitatively new behavior may emerge from the coupling. As an illustrative ex ample, consider two stable subsystems which after coupling result in one unsta ble overall system. It is to be emphasized that the abstract methods of systems theory which a re essentially and originally independent of any particular application are of crucial import ance when problems of analysis, optimal design and control of coupled processes are approac hed. In the area of biological systems , it is especially animal cells and microorganisms that are of interest as these produce desired vaccines, recombinant proteins, antibiotics and hormones. A detailed analysis of the complex metabo lic, regulatory and signal transduction pathways will contribute to a better understanding of cell growth, gene expression and formation of various products. Thus, with the help of well-specified manipulations of the genome or suitable process control strategies, it w ill be possible to increase the productivity of industrially relevant strains and to optimize bi o-technological processes. Moreover, it is expected that general principles can be deduced fro m the highly integrated, natural cellular processes, which can then be applied to and used, i n technical systems. As far as chemical engineering systems are concerned, material and energy recycles between individual process units account for an opt imal utilization of raw materials and energy alike. Typical examples are reactor-separato r-systems where unconverted reactants are separated from the products and subsequently re cycled to the reactor. Highly integrated gas production and purification processes coupled w ith fuel cells that serve as decentralized energy supply systems as well as integrated concept s for the production of biological agents in bio-reactors with downstream post-processing are further examples. The common interest in all these cases is directed towards optimal design and control of the respective coupled processes. Yet another area where coupled and highly complex p rocesses are encountered is the realm of modern traffic engineering . For example, the interplay between transport syst ems 16 on both roads and railways has to be coordinated. H igh precision navigation on inland waterways constitutes a further illustrative exampl e. 5.7. Research Area: Hybrid and Discrete-Event Syste ms For many purposes, especially in the context of con trol systems analysis and design, both the process under consideration and the specificati ons to be met can be adequately modeled by discrete event or hybrid systems. A discrete eve nt system (DES) describes the occurrence of certain selected events in a real pla nt, for example the crossing of well-defined threshold values by temperature or pressure variabl es. If only the temporal order of events matters, a logical discrete event system is an appropriate choice. Logical DES can be formulated as (finite) automata, formal languages, Petri nets, etc. If additional time information (other than ordering) is important for judging the correct functioning of the respective process, timed discrete event systems have to be used. Examples are timed automata, timed Petri nets, and Max-plus-algebra. F inally, a model containing both discrete event components and continuous dynamics with nontr ivial interaction is called hybrid. Hybrid models are ubiquitous in modern control systems, where di screte (logic) control functions influence, and are influenced by, continu ous plant and controller dynamics. Technical examples which fall into the category of hybrid and discrete event systems are Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) chromatographic processe s, discontinuously operated multiproduct batch plants, automatic start-up of ch emical processes, and biological processes in cells. In cells metabolic processes ar e continuous, while the decisions often take place on higher regulatory levels in a discret e manner. 6. The Project \"Crystallization\": An Example of Int erdisciplinary Cooperation of MPI Research Groups The project \"Crystallization\" is part of the projec t area Population Balance Systems. It is carried out in interdisciplinary collaboration betw een the research groups Process Dynamics and Synthesis (PSD), Physical and Chemical Foundati ons of Process Engineering (PCF) and Systems and Control Theory (SCT). Crystallizati on from solution or melt is a very important unit operation which serves for the produ ction of solids and for purification/separation purposes. Product quality u sually depends strongly on the crystal size distribution that can be described by population ba lance models. The three MPI research groups listed above study the complex dynamics and control of crystallization processes by means of experimental and theoretical tools in link ed subprojects as illustrated in Fig. 4. Overview 17 Fig. 4: Linked research activities in the project \"Crystal lization\". (1) OvGU, (2) University of Stuttgart. The PSD groups focus is on the investigation of aut onomous oscillations, which may frequently arise in continuous crystallizers with f ines dissolution and product classification. The objective is to gain a better understanding of the behavior and to develop suitable methods for designing and operating crystallization processes with potential instabilities. The PCF group is active in using crystallization techni ques for separation and purification of chemicals, particularly enantiomers. They provide d ata on solid-liquid equilibria and crystallization kinetics, and develop the experimen tal basis for determination of essential 18 process parameters to be fed into the population ba lance models developed by the PSD group. Based on these population balance models, th e SCT group designs H -feedback controllers which are able to remove the aforementi oned sustained oscillations in continuous crystallizers. Furthermore, control strategies for the production of predefined crystal size distributions in batch crystallizers are developed using methods from nonlinear control theory. Similarly, there are several other research project s at MPI where scientists from different research groups work closely together to bring in d ifferent expertises and views which are indispensable in attaining innovative solutions to challenging scientific problems. Examples for such fruitful interdisciplinary collaborations are the projects on Reactive Distillation, Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells, Simulated Moving Beds, Biological Reaction Networks , etc. 7. Publications The complete publication lists of the research grou ps are provided in a supplemental volume to this status report. Here, we focus on an overall survey of the general development of MPI publications during the period of this repor t. As can be seen from Fig. 5, there was a continuous increase of the total number of published journal articles and conference contributions . The total number of the institute's publications from 1998 to the end of 20 02 was 201 (journal articles: 111, conference contribution: 90). At this point, it sho uld be mentioned that depending on the publication culture of certain engineering discipli nes established at the MPI, either journal publications or conference contributions can have m ore prestige. Following the MPG standards, Fig. 6 illustrates the development of the proportion of MPI journals articles which were registered in the Science Citation Index (SCI, in total: 72), and in the Databank Cluster which includes CAPLUS, INSPEC, COMPENDEX and SCI ( DB- Cluster: in total 94). Over the years, there is a c lear increase of the number of registered publications.

We also carried out a citation analysis on the MPI publications registered both in the SCI and in the DB-Cluster. The essential results are do cumented in Fig. 7. It shows the short- term-impact of cited publications for papers published during the first three years of the Institute. The average number of citations per pape r is given for the time period 1998-2003. For SCI-papers it is 3.72 and for the papers SCI Fig. 7: Average number of citations of an MPI publication. According to Science Citation Index (SCI) and Databank Cluster (DB-Cluster). Overview 21 This is significantly higher than the average value in the engineering sciences which is 2.9 according to the analysis of the Institute for Scie ntific Information (ISI National Science Indicators, 1981-1995). Obviously, the MPI publicat ions were well accepted in the related scientific engineering communities. Of course, if p apers which appeared from 2001 to April 2003 were also included into the analysis, the aver age citation rates are lower because these papers did not have enough time to be cited. 8. Scientific and Technical Staff In this section, a collection of statistical data i s given which quantifies the number of MPI scientists as well as the number of technical staff involved. As of 31 December 2002, a total of 141 employees were working at the MPI. As illust rated by Fig. 8, the largest fraction of staff is held by our students working towards a Ph.D. degree. They are about one third of the overall workforce. About one fifth of our workf orce was senior scientists and postdocs , i.e. experienced scientists with a Ph.D. degree. In carrying out the research projects, the scientif ic staff was supported by 24 student research assistants (17% of workforce). These are undergraduates who d o their work at MPI in parallel to their studies at OvGU. The resea rch work at MPI is an important additional experience for their education and gives us the cha nce to identify the students being most capable of pursuing Ph.D. studies after they gradua ted. Very often our research assistants simultaneously prepare their student theses (\"Studi enarbeit\") or diploma/master theses. 17% Central Services 17% Administration 4% Fig. 8: Composition of MPI personnel as of 31 December 200 2. 22 For preparing and performing the experimental work in the institute's chemical and biological laboratories the scientists are also sup ported by a total of 11 laboratory technicians and engineers. This indispensable scientific-technical personnel makes up 8% of the MPI workforce. Moreover, 17% of the MPI staff represent the central services such as the library, the secretarial service, the computer serv ice, the mechanical workshop, the electrical workshop, the service for our bench scale hall, and the MPI house keeping service. Last but not least, the MPI has an administrative staff who supports the scientists in project budgeting, collecting offers for and purchasing of technical devices, etc. This staff is only 4% of the total number of employees. It is worth mentioning that the number of available working places in the MPI's new building is 205. Thus, there are about 60 spaces le ft which will be filled in the next few years primarily by personnel payed from external funds. M any activities are currently under way to attract additional external funds from third partie s. 8.1. Age and Gender Distribution The average age of all 141 coworkers is only about 33 years old. The age distribution is displayed in Fig. 9. It is remarkable that nearly h alf of the institute's staff are less than 30 years old. Only about 6% of the workforce are age 5 0 and older. As additional information, the age distribution of all scientists is depicted in Fig. 10 which specifies also the fraction of permanent and temporary employments in the 5-year age groups. As of 31 December 2002, there were 76 scien tists employed at the MPI, 29 of them senior scientists and postdocs, 47 of them Ph.D. st udents. Of these scientists, 75% are 35 years old or less which reflects a very young scien tific workforce at our MPI. Overall only 10 scientific coworkers of 76 hold permanent positions . This is in full agreement with the overall policy of the Max Planck Society to operate its ins titutes with a relatively small number of permanent scientific staff. Fig. 11 shows the distribution of our scientific co workers according to gender. The percentage of female scientists is about 21%. This is a considerably higher propor tion of females than normally encountered in engineering sc iences in Germany.

Graduate Students As pointed out above, the graduate students represe nt one-third of the total MPI staff and two-thirds of scientific coworkers. All of them are registered at the OvGU and are seeking a Ph.D. degree in Chemical and Process Engineering or in Engineering Cybernetics. Fig. 12 gives a survey of the development of the number of Ph.D. students from the foundation of the institute to the end of 2002. The total number of graduate students has steadily increased during the last few years. 0510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Number of Ph.D. Students 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 from abroad from Germany Fig. 12: Development of the number of Ph.D. students from ab road and from Germany. The same is true for the portion of students coming from abroad, whose percentage is now more than 50%. This clearly shows that our inst itute is highly attractive to engineering students from national as well as from internationa l schools. It is important to mention that this trend was achieved despite the fact that the n umber of students in chemical engineering and related disciplines in Germany has been continu ously decreasing for the last decade. This is the reason for our current efforts to initi ate new masters and diploma programs together with our colleagues at OvGU. In the future , we expect a further increase in the number of international students, which is also due to the increasing number of short-term guest scientists who very often act as a bridge to attract new students. The largest fraction of foreign Ph.D. students come s from Asia, especially China and India. The second largest group originates from eas t European countries, mainly Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Romania, Ukraine and Russia. This i s mainly due to traditionally excellent collaborations between east German universities and their academic partner institutions in eastern Europe. In the future we would like to furt her extend the collaborations with east European universities and academies, also in the fr amework of common research projects. Overview 25 8.3. Guest Scientists The MPI has intense interactions with a large numbe r of short-term visiting scientists as reflected by Fig. 13 which illustrates the distribu tion of these visitors with respect to their home countries. 0246810 12 14 USA Russia / Ukraine Czech Republic England Switzerland Poland Netherlands Australia China Belgium India Romania Yugoslavia France Italy Sweden Scotland Canada Belo-Russia Bulgaria Countries Number of Visits Fig. 13: Number of visits by international scientists to th e MPI from 1998 to 2002 (with a stay of at least two days). Among the visitors are guest professors who stay fo r several months to work directly within one of the research groups, scientific visit ors who give courses and talks during a stay of several days, and experts from industry who come to exchange ideas on common research projects. From 1998 to 2002, a total of 95 German scientists and 69 guest scientists from abroad visited our institute. Among the international gues ts, 86% came from the European countries, 9% from America, the rest from Asia and Australia. 26 9. Teaching Activities and Recruiting of Students The teaching activities of the heads of the MPI res earch groups are focused at OvGU. They also give specialized lectures, mandatory lect ures, and laboratory courses and act as supervisors for diploma and master theses. For deta ils, the reader is referred to the research group reports. Additionally, some group heads have given courses at the University of Stuttgart. Ph.D. students from the MPI participate as assistants for the student practical exercises accompanying the lectures at OvGU. The to pics of our teaching activities are closely related to the new diploma and master progr ams which were started at OvGU in recent years with significant encouragement from th e MPI side: Systems Engineering and Cybernetics (5 years, diplo ma program) Computer Aided Process Design (5 years, diploma pro gram) Environmental and Energy Process Engineering (5 yea rs, diploma program) Molecular and Structural Product Design (5 years, d iploma program) Chemical and Process Engineering (1.5 years, master program) These programs were introduced because the traditio nal process engineering program is currently not able to attract enough German student s. This is a phenomenon which can be observed at universities throughout Germany. On the other hand, industrial companies have a very strong need in excellently educated chemical and process engineers. However, in contrast to the classical chemical engineering educ ation, more system-oriented engineers are needed who are better prepared to synthesize, a nalyze and control complex chemical and biotechnological processes from the molecular l evel up to the plant level. This is the background for our intense efforts to contribute to the development of attractive new curricula in the field of process and systems engineering. In addition to our teaching activities and to our c ontributions in the strategic development of the profile of the engineering programs at OvGU, we also try to directly attract students from high schools of the German federal state Saxon y-Anhalt to study engineering sciences or natural sciences. In this respect, two important activities were started: A NaT-working project (NaT: Natural and Technical sciences) was initiate d in a direct partnership of the MPI with five regional hi gh schools. This project is being funded by the Robert-Bosch-Foundation for three yea rs. On a regular basis, the MPI offers one-week laboratory courses , each spring and each fall, for interested students from high school s in Saxony-Anhalt. These courses are organized and taught by our Ph.D. students. Overview 27 10. Cooperations with Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg Many research projects of our institute are perform ed in close collaboration with universities in Germany and in abroad. At the insti tute's location, the intense partnership with OvGU is of particular importance. Although the OvGU , which was founded in 1993, is amongst the youngest in Germany, it has a long and successful tradition: it evolved from the former University of Technology, a Teachers' Traini ng College, and the well-known Medical Academy at Magdeburg. About 9500 young people, many of them from abroad, are studying in one of the nine departments. The MPI building is located at the edge of the OvGU campus with a short distance to most departments. As a prerequisite for the establishment of the MPI in Magdeburg, in 1997 the Department of Process and Systems Engineering was newly founde d by merging the already existing institute for chemistry, the institute for process engineering, the institute for plant design and environmental engineering, and the institute for fl uid dynamics and thermodynamics. Currently, 11 full professors, 2 associate professo rs and 2 assistant professors are active in the department. As outlined in section 2, three directors of the MP I (U. Reichl, A. Seidel-Morgenstern, K. Sundmacher) are appointed professors at the Departm ent for Process and Systems Engineering and two heads of MPI research groups (A . Kienle, J. Raisch) are appointed professors at the Department for Electrical Enginee ring. Furthermore, E.D. Gilles is an honorary professor at the Department for Process an d Systems Engineering. 11. Important Joint Research Projects Many research projects are being pursued jointly be tween MPI research groups and external partners from academic as well as industri al institutions. Here only the most important, larger projects are given. In particular , two joint research groups (\"Forschergruppen\") were successfully applied for t ogether with members of OvGU departments, and were funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG): DFG research group 447: Membrane Supported Reaction Engineering : 8 sub- projects in collaboration with the Department for P rocess and Systems Engineering and the Department for Mathematics, DFG research group 468: Methods of Discrete Mathematics for Synthesis and Control of Chemical Processes : 5 sub-projects in collaboration with the Departme nt for Mathematics and the Department for Electrical E ngineering. 28 Moreover, during the period of this report, there h ave been a number of DFG projects in cooperation with partners at the University of S tuttgart in the framework of special research areas (SFB = Sonderforschungsbereiche): SFB 412: Computer Aided Modeling and Simulation for the Anal ysis, Synthesis and Control of Chemical Processes SFB 495: Topology and Dynamics of Signal Transduction Proces ses In SFB 412 several MPI research groups have been in volved in projects on structured modeling of chemical and biological systems, the de velopment of tools for computer aided modeling of chemical and biological systems, the de velopment of low order dynamic models using nonlinear waves, the development of hierarchi cal concepts for process control, and population balance modeling of crystallization proc esses. The modeling tool ProMoT and the simulation environment DIVA are an outcome of the SFB 412. These tools are fur ther developed at the MPI and used for various applicati ons including membrane reactors, fuel cells, reactive distillation, systems biology, etc. Further collaborations between MPI research groups and university groups were established in the framework of several joint proje cts supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). In these project, in dustrial partners are also involved: BMBF joint project: Optimal Control of Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCF C) using Methods of Nonlinear Dynamics (Partners: Meltec Ltd./Magdeburg) In the area of Systems and Control Engineering, a j oint research project on Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in the Reha bilitation of Spinal Cord Injured Persons and Stroke Patients is funded by the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt and the BMBF (Project \"Innomed\"). The MPI's partners are th e OvGU, the company Hasomed Ltd. and the MEDIAN-Klinik NRZ in Magdeburg. Overview 29 12. Competence Network on Process Engineering The MPI is a founding member of the German Competen ce Network on Process Engineering (Kompetenznetz Verfahrenstechnik Pro3\" ) which was initiated in February 2000 jointly with the University of Stuttgart, the Unive rsity of Karlsruhe, the University of Kaiserslautern, and several industrial companies. T hese are BASF AG, Cognis Deutschland Ltd., Degussa AG, IPF KG, Lurgi AG, Merk KG, Rausch ert Verfahrenstechnik Ltd., and Siemens AG. The competence network's goal is to find new techni cal solutions in process and bioprocess engineering, to speed up the transfer of knowledge from fundamental research to industrial applications , to promote excellent educational activities in pr ocess engineering, and to attract highly qualified nation al and international students, postdocs and guest scientists. The main focus of the research ac tivities within the competence network is on process design, process control, and product design (Pro3). The network is structured into working committees t hat meet regularly to initiate research projects, to organize workshops on new topics in pr ocess engineering and to exchange experiences. Three heads of the MPI research groups are chairmen of the working committees for integrated processes (A. Seidel-Morg enstern), fuel cell systems (K. Sundmacher), and modeling of population dynamics of disperse and polymeric systems (A. Kienle). The MPI received financial support from the compete nce network in the form of scholarships, start-up funding for a project on rea ctive separation, and support for carrying out international workshops (see section 14). 30 13.

Workshops and Symposia During the last five years, our research groups hav e organized several international workshops with participants from European and Ameri can countries: Workshop on Particulate Processes (2000): The contributions were published in a special issue of Chemical Engineering Science . Workshop on Reactive Distillation (2001): The contributions were published in a book by Wiley-VCH which appeared in January 2003. Workshop on Hierarchical Concepts for Complex Technical and Bio logical Systems (2001). During this workshop the idea was created to initiate a related joint project proposal was for the 6 th Framework Programme of the European Commission. Workshop on Flatness-based Control of Distributed Parameter Sys tems (2003). Meeting of the International E. coli Alliance (2003). For the first and second of these workshops, the MP I received supporting funds from the German Competence Network \"Verfahrenstechnik Pro3\". In close cooperation with the DECHEMA, the VDI (German Association of Engineers) and the Otto-von-Guericke- University Magdeburg, a series of one-day DECHEMA Regional Colloquia was initiated with participants from academic institutions and in dustrial companies. The discussed topics were Fuel Cells Systems (2000), Fluidized Beds (2002) and Perspectives for Membrane Processes in Catalytic Processes (2003). Moreover, in 2002 the MPI organized a workshop on Modern Methods of Particle Analysis - Applications, Problems, Limits and Compa rability with significant assistance from colleagues at the OvGU. 32 PSD Group, A. Kienle 33 Research Group: Process Synthesis and Dynamics (PSD) Prof. Dr.-Ing. Achim Kienle This report covers the period from 1 March 1998 to 30 April 2003. 34 1. PSD Group Introduction The research of the process synthesis and dynamics group focuses on computer-aided analysis, synthesis and control of complex chemical processes. For that purpose, suitable mathematical modeling techniques as well as suitabl e methods and tools for model-based analysis and synthesis are developed. Special empha sis is on nonlinear dynamics of chemical processes, which can be a source of unexpe cted and surprising behavior. A thorough understanding of nonlinear dynamics is not only of scientific interest, but also a necessary prerequisite for optimal design and opera tion of chemical processes. The above mentioned methods and tools are applied t o various challenging example processes. An overview is given in Fig. 14. Current applications include: integrated processes like reactive distillation processes, coupled fixe d bed reactors with recuperative heat exchange, membrane reactors, and a high temper ature fuel cell with internal reforming; particulate systems like crystallization processes and a polymerizatio n process for the production of low density polyethylene; hybrid systems like simulated moving bed chromatographic processes and multi product batch p lants; continuously operated multi unit chemical plants consisting of reactors and separato rs with mass and energy recycles. This last activity is allocated to the project areas coupled processes and hierarchical concepts . The PSD group has been supporting the establishment of the Max Planck Institute from the very beginning. The research activities of the PSD group are located at the interface between chemical engineering, systems dynamics and process control. Together with the SBI group it develops the modeling and simulation s oftware ProMoT/Diva and supports its application within the other research groups. The head of the research group, Achim Kienle, has r ecently accepted a position as a full professor at the OvGU. In the future, all research of the PSD group will be done in close cooperation with his university group. PSD Group, A.

Computer Aided Modeling of Chemical Processes Modern industrial chemical processes are highly int egrated systems with a complex dynamic behavior. A thorough understanding of such processes requires detailed mathematical models based on physical and chemical knowledge. The development and implementation of such models of chemical processes is a demanding and time consuming task. The aim of computer aided modeling systems is to facilitate and accelerate the model implementation. A computer aided modeling system sh ould enable its users to incorporate their process knowledge into a simulation model wit hout being bothered by algebraic manipulations or mechanical coding work. The develo pment of a computer aided modeling system can be subdivided into two major parts. The first step is the structuring of the physical and chemical modeling knowledge into elements of a model library. The second step is the development of a software tool that is able to retr ieve the modeling information from the library and to generate simulation programs from th at information. The work of this research group addresses both steps. As a guideline for the structuring of chemical proc ess models, Gilles [1] proposed the Network Theory for Chemical and Biochemical Process es. In joint research these concepts were extended to spatially distributed systems and population balance systems [9]. PSD Group, A. Kienle 45 According to this concept, models can be structured in a horizontal direction, i.e. on one level of detailedness of the model description, and in a vertical direction, by decomposing a coarse model description into subunits on a more detailed level. The horizontal structure provides a high flexibility for the model library. The vertica l structure improves the transparency and readability of the structured model. As a very simi lar methodology can be used for the structuring of microbiological models, it is possib le to use the same computer tool for the development of chemical and biological models. That tool - the Process Modeling Tool ProMoT - is being developed in joint research with the SBI group. ProMoT is an object-oriented tool for the equation based modeling of chemical and biological processes. It is based on a structured and equation -based modeling approach. Process models in ProMoT consist of modules which can be ag gregated to hierarchies of arbitrary depth. All modeling entities in ProMoT are organize d in a specialization hierarchy with multiple inheritance. Models in ProMoT can be imple mented using either a text-based modeling language or a graphical user interface. The modeling tool ProMoT is used in the framework o f the DFG research group \"Membrane Supported Reaction Engineering'' located at the OvGU. The DFG research group investigates different types of membrane reac tors, identifies new application fields for membrane reactors, and assesses the potential of me mbrane reactors for selective oxidations. The PSD group of the Max Planck Institu te Magdeburg contributes to the joint project by identifying reaction kinetics and by dev eloping a library of re-usable fixed bed reactor and membrane reactor models [8]. The model library has proved to be rather flexible and applicable not only to membrane reactors, but a lso to other membrane processes. Currently, the library is being used by the group o f A. Seidel-Morgenstern to model a liquid phase membrane separation process. As a fuel cell c an be regarded as an electrochemical membrane reactor, there are also connections to the activities of K. Sundmacher's group. The PSD and the PCP groups collaborate closely on t he development of structured models of fuel cell systems and their implementation in Pr oMoT. Further applications of systematic modeling are multiphase reactors and reaction separ ation processes. A model library for such processes is currently being developed. It wil l support the institute's activities in the area of reactive distillation processes and plantwi de control problems. 46 mass_store energy_storeconvection dispersion reaction heat_cond Fig. 15 : Screenshot of a membrane reactor model implemente d in ProMoT. 4.2. Nonlinear Wave Propagation in Chemical Process es The dynamic behavior of many chemical processes is governed by spatio temporal pattern formation also termed as nonlinear wave propagation . Typical examples for this type of behavior are traveling reaction zones in catalytic fixed bed reactors and traveling mass transfer fronts in separation processes. The invest igation of nonlinear wave propagation in chemical processes often provides easy understandin g of the dynamics without tedious calculations and thereby leads the way to new ideas for model reduction, and improved process operation and control. Our research on nonlinear wave propagation in chemi cal processes is integrated within the joint research project SFB 412 on \"Computer aided m odeling and simulation for the analysis, synthesis and control of chemical processes\", which is located at the University of Stuttgart and funded by the DFG.

Initial contributions were concerned with nonlinear wave propagation and nonlinear model reduction for nonreactive multicomponent distillati on processes [4]. It was shown that the concentration and temperature profiles in such a sy stem can be easily constructed from a linear superposition of elementary nonlinear waves. These results were used for nonlinear model reduction. Subsequently, these low-order dyna mic models were used for the generation of a supervisory control system for the startup of distillation plants in joint research with the SCT group [7], for open-loop dyna mic optimization of load and specification changes [18], and for nonlinear model predictive co ntrol of distillation columns [3]. Other successful applications of nonlinear waves are conc erned with the control of simulated moving bed chromatographic processes, which will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Recent contributions are concerned with nonlinear w ave propagation in combined reaction separation processes [5,6,2]. Typical examples for combined reaction separation processes are reactive distillation processes, chromatographi c reactors, and membrane reactors. These types of processes have received a lot of attention in the chemical engineering community during the last decade due to potential economic be nefits. However, only little was known about their dynamic behavior when we started with o ur research. 48 feed A A B Bdirection of port switching and of fluid flow zone III zone IVzone Iextract solvent raffinatezone II 0 50 100 150 20000.511.5 solvent extract feed raffinatez [cm]c [vol%]I II III IV 1. Scheme of the SMB process 2. Dynamic behavior 3. Test plantA general framework for analyzing and understanding the dynamics of these processes was developed. In a first step, simultaneous phase and reaction equilibrium was assumed. The theory makes use of transformed concentration v ariables, which were first introduced by Doherty and co-workers for the steady state design of reactive distillation processes. It is shown that these transformed variables can be direc tly generalized to the dynamic problem considered here. Furthermore, they can also be appl ied to other reactive separation processes, for example fixed bed or countercurrent chromatographic reactors. They provide profound insight into the dynamic behavior of these processes and reveal bounds of feasible operation caused by reactive azeotropy. It was show n that reactive azeotropy, which is a well-known phenomenon in reactive distillation, may also arise under very similar conditions in other reactive separation processes, e.g. chroma tographic reactors. 4.3. New Modes of Operation and Control of Simulate d Moving Bed Chromatographic Processes Chromatographic separation processes are increasing ly applied to the purification of pharmaceutical compounds in fine chemistry or biote chnology. Fig. 17: Simulated moving bed chromatography. PSD Group, A. Kienle 49 Due to a higher productivity, lower solvent consump tion and a better exploitation of the adsorbent phase in comparison to the classical batc h separations, the concept of the simulated moving bed (SMB) is currently the preferr ed method of solving a large number of separation problems. The SMB process consists of a number of chromatogra phic columns, connected in series. Two input nodes, feed and solvent, and two outputs, extract and raffinate, define four different separation zones. The components A and B are separated by using a simulated countercurrent flow between the liquid and the soli d phase. The movement of the solid phase is approximated by cyclic switching of the inlet an d outlet ports in the direction of the fluid flow. If the flow rates of the liquid and the adsor bent phase are chosen properly, the more strongly adsorbed component A can be withdrawn with the extract and component B appears in the raffinate. Unfortunately, the operation of an SMB unit close t o its economic optimum causes a high sensitivity to disturbances. Even small fluctuation s of the operating parameters may lead to a contamination of the products. Optimal operation of SMB processes in practice will therefore require some suitable feedback control. Due to the mixed continuous and discrete dynamics of the SMB process and the rather low availability of measurement information, control of SMB processes to ensure a safe and economical opera tion while guaranteeing the product specifications is a challenging task. For industria l production processes, simple control algorithms that can be easily implemented and handl ed by the operators are preferred. Therefore, two different relatively simple but effi cient control strategies were developed [13]. The first method represents an inferential co ntrol scheme, which was motivated by established techniques for distillation column cont rol. The position of concentration fronts in the SMB unit is inferred via UV measurements in eac h separation section of the apparatus. No mathematical model is required. The controller r ejects disturbances by stabilizing the position of these characteristic concentration fron ts. This control technique works well for constant feed concentration. Hence, this strategy i s suitable if the feed is supplied in larger batches from previous reaction processes. This is t he case in a large number of practical applications. However, because of the indirect cont rol of the product purities with UV signals, an offset in the product purity may occur for proce sses with unforeseen disturbances of the feed concentration. Nevertheless, this offset is si gnificantly smaller than in the open loop system. The second algorithm is a model based controller an d enables more direct control of the desired product purities. It makes use of the nonli near wave characteristics of the process. The desired product purities are adjusted by direct ly manipulating the location of the different concentration fronts in the process. Again this is achieved with simple PI-control. For the 50 practical implementation of this control strategy t he concentration profiles are reconstructed from UV measurements by means of a state observer. Hence, detailed knowledge of the adsorption isotherms is required. The control algor ithm automatically adjusts maximum productivity and minimum solvent consumption withou t longwinded optimization calculations. This control algorithm can therefore also be used f or fast optimization of SMB processes. This control strategy is very useful for a comforta ble realization of some new ideas for operating SMB processes with periodic forcing of so me suitable operating parameters within every single switching interval. In particular, a n ew mode of operation with periodic forcing of the feed concentration was developed in joint resea rch with the PCF group of A. Seidel- Morgenstern [14,15] and filed as a patent [16]. The new mode of operation is called 'ModiCon', which is an abbreviation for modi fied con centrations. The method can be easily applied to SMB plants using standard equipment (e.g . gradient pumps). It was shown that the productivity of SMB processes can be increased significantly through ModiCon with simultaneous reduction of the solvent consumption. In addition, the desired product purity can be directly adjusted by feedback control. 4.4. Synthesis, Dynamics and Control of Reactive Di stillation Processes Reactive distillation integrates chemical reaction and distillation into a single processing unit. Such an integrated process can be very econom ical compared to conventional processes where reaction and separation are carried out in different processing units. However, design and operation of such an integrated process can be difficult due to the increased complexity. Besides the theoretical investigations on nonlinear wave propagation in reactive distillation processes mentioned above, main achievements of the PSD group in the field of reactive distillation are concerned with stability and uniqu eness of steady states, and control as well as computer aided synthesis of reactive distillatio n processes. Many results have been obtained in joint research with the PCP group of A. Sundmacher. It was shown that multiple steady states, bistabili ty and nonlinear oscillations may arise quite frequently in reactive distillation and may c omplicate column operation. Different sources for these patterns of behavior were systema tically identified [6]. Emphasis was on kinetic instabilities, which are caused by self-inh ibition of the heterogenous catalyst and which may arise quite frequently in heterogeneously catalyzed reactive distillation processes. The production of fuel additives by reactive distil lation was considered as a practical example [10,11]. These investigations provided the first ri gorous experimental verification of multiple steady states in reactive distillation. Further, fu ndamental insight into the dynamic behavior of PSD Group, A. Kienle 51 reactive distillation processes was obtained and co nclusions for safe and reliable column operation were drawn. 0.20.30.40.50.10.150.20.25 heating rate [kW]TAME concentration in bottoms [](1) (2) (3) 330 340 350 36000.511.5column height [m] temperature [K](1) (3)(2)a) b) (1) (3)experimental results model predicitons Fig. 18: Multiple steady states for the production of fuel ether TAME by reactive distillation. First encouraging results were obtained for compute r aided synthesis of reactive distillation processes using mixed-integer nonlinear programming techniques combined with physical insight [17]. However, at the moment this approach is limited to simple model systems. For more complex systems computational difficulties may arise. Depending on the starting conditions, either many different local optima are found or no solution at all. Further developments on the optimization strategy, includin g suitable modeling approaches, the generation of suitable superstructures and starting values, and improved optimization algorithms are being investigated in a joint resear ch project with Prof. Weissmantel from the Mathematics Department of the OvGU. The project is funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG). Reactive separation processes for closely boiling m ixtures were proposed as a new field of application for the reactive distillation technolog y, [19,17]. Typical examples are mixtures of hydrocarbon isomers, which play an important role i n the chemical process industry and are usually hard to separate. A typical separation prob lem is the separation of isobutene from the C4 fraction of a cracking plant. The proposed react ive separation processes are illustrated schematically in Fig. 19. 52 To achieve the separation a reactive entrainer is a dded, which selectively reacts in a first reactive distillation column with the component to be separated. Simultaneously the reaction product can be separated from the inert components in the first column. In a second column, the reaction product is split back into the reactan ts. Simultaneously, the reactive entrainer and the desired component can be isolated in the pr oduct streams of the second column and the entrainer can be recycled to the first column. Fig. 19: Simplified flowsheet of the proposed reactive sepa ration process. The separation of iso-olefines from hydrocarbon mix tures by etherification or hydration reactions were studied as possible applications of these reactive separation processes [19,17]. The ideas were filed as a patent [20]. 4.5. Nonlinear Dynamics of Reactor Separator Networ ks Conventional chemical process plants typically cons ist of reactors and separators. In the reactors, reactants are partially converted to desi red products and in the subsequent separators unreacted reactants are separated from t he products and recycled into the reactor. A typical industrial example process, whic h is being studied in the Process Synthesis and Dynamics Group within a joint BMBF research pro ject with TU-Donezk and the AZOT company from Ukraine, is illustrated in Fig. 20. intermediate product reactive entrainerreactionforward backward reactioninertcomponentreactive componentsinert components 53 Fig. 20: Simplified flowsheet of an industrial plant for th e production of acetic acid. Another industrial application studied in joint res earch with the BASF and BASELL companies is a plant for the production of low dens ity polyethylene as illustrated in Fig. 21.

Further it was found that this behavior is directly related to the recyc les in the respective plant. To fully understand the different patterns of behav ior which can arise in such recycle systems, a simple model system was analyzed in a fi rst step. This model system consists of a continuous stirred tank reactor and a flash with reactant recycle. Relevant issues are feasibility, uniqueness and stability of steady sta tes, as well as sensitivity to disturbances. Due to the simplicity, an analytical approach was p ossible using methods from stability, bifurcation and singularity theory. The analytical results were validated by some numerical investigations using advanced continuation techniqu es. It was shown that the behavior crucially depends on the structure of the underlying base- control involving level and flow controllers [12]. Even for a simple isothermal reactor with a first order reaction, complex patterns of behavior can be introduced by the recycle. Depending on the underlying base-control, either no steady state at all, a multiplicity of steady states or nonlinear oscillations may occur. Suitable control structures were determined which allow smooth and stable operation under all conditions [21]. Recently, the investigations were extended to systems with finite delay in the recycle. Nonlinear dynamics of the underlying system of delay differential equa tions is a new and challenging field of research, which will be further investigated togeth er with the MF group. The results mentioned above have been obtained in j oint research with Prof. Pushpavanam from the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras.

PCP Group Introduction The MPI Research Group \"Physical and Chemical Process Engineering (PCP)\" was founded in October 1998 with Kai Sundmacher as the head. In 1999, he was appointed to a full professorship as the new chair for Proc ess Systems Engineering (PSE) at the Otto-von- Guericke-University Magdeburg (OvGU). Since then, K. Sundmacher has guided the research activities of the PCP group and the university chair simultaneously. Both groups have very intense scientific collaborations, which are reflected in a number of common research projects. In July 2001, K. Sundmacher was appointed as Director at MPI where he is responsible for the field of process engineering. The research of the group \"Physical and Chemical Process Engineering (PCP)\" covers the design, operation and analysis of complex chemical processes. It is focused on the system-orientated analysis of all physica l and chemical phenomena involved and their interaction on hierarchical time and length scales. Special attention is paid to the quantitative characterization and description of the physical and chemical transport phenomena as well as to the analysis of the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the processes and systems under investigation. Therefore, methods of mathematical modeling and simulation are closely combined with experimental concepts. Among the latter, miniplant technology is a unique and important tool in the group's experimental investigations. Experiments in the miniplant environment allow the extrapolation of the collected data towards industrial macroscales. This is very important to the ability to transfer fundamentally new reaction and separation technologies developed at MPI into industrial application. The current research activities of the PCP group are clustered in four fields: multifunctional reactors and reactive separations (since 10/1998), fuel cell processes (since 10/1998), electrochemical membrane processes (since 01/2001), dynamics of particulate systems (since 04/2001). The list of these four research fields corresponds to the chronological order in which the research activities were started at MPI and the scientific staff was hired. PCP Group, K. Sundmacher 61 2. Members of the PCP Research Group As of 30 April 2003, the group of Prof. Sundmacher consisted of six scientists with Ph.D. degrees, including one guest scientist from UCTM Sofia (Prof. M. Christov) and one honorary scientist from Karlsruhe University (Prof. E.U. Schl\u00fcnder), and 11 graduate students working towards a Ph.D. In accordance with the MPI research structure, the PCP group is organized in four project teams clustered according to the major research activities as given in section 1 of this group report (see following Table, next page). All scientists work in non-permanent positions. Out of the 16 scientists working in the PCP group, 50% come from abroad. As technical staff, one process engineer and one laboratory coworker support the PCP scientists regardless which special research topic is addressed. Furthermore, the research is supported by nine undergraduate students from the Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg. Five of them are currently working on their Diploma thesis supervised by PCP scientists. It should be mentioned that all group members still belong to the first generation of Ph.D. students and scientists because the typical duration to prepare a Ph.D. thesis in process engineering is about four years. This is compounded by the fact that as part of their work, most Ph.D. students had to support the design of new experimental devices such as special miniplants which were available after the new MPI building was ready for use in September 2001. Therefore, as a result of the MPI foundation history and the scientific culture in process engineering, the first PCP group members will receive their Ph.D. degrees in 2004. In accordance with the collaboration contract between MPI and Otto-von-Guericke- University, Prof. Sundmacher also guides the res earch activities of the university chair for Process Systems Engineering. At the Univ ersity, currently six Ph.D. students (D. Adityawarman, Heidebrecht, M. Ivanova, C. Steyer, M. Gundermann) are working on the preparation of their theses. All of them are engaged in topics which have direct links to MPI research projects. Furthermore, one researcher with a Ph.D. degree (Dr. R. Fr\u00f6mmichen) completes the scientific work group under the direction of the university chair. All scientists are supported by E. Felsch who is responsible for the chair's preparative and analytical chemistry. 62 Composition of PCP group as of 30 April 2003 Group Member Status Background joined PCP in Prof. K.

Survey of research projects of PCP group Project Area: Integrated Processes Project: Reactive Distillation Reactive distillation combines reaction and distillation in one single unit. The benefits of this approach are lower energy consumption and a reduction in the number of process units. However, this also results in a more complex process behavior. A detailed analysis of this behavior is the subject of this project. The PCP group activities are focused on: experimental investigation of reactive distillation using miniplant technology, reaction systems undergoing liquid phase splitting, coupled reactive distillation columns for the sepa-ration of closely boiling mixtures, use of reactive distillation for oxidation and hydro-genation processes.

Appropriate process models are being developed and validated experimentally. Based on these models control strategies will be designed and tested. The PCP group is involved in two subprojects: development of a family of fuel cell models of different complexity to describe MCFC operation under dynamic and steady state conditions, experimental studies at a 300 kW MCFC of type \"Hot Module\" in order to validate selected MCFC models and to test developed control strategies. 66 Subproject: Modeling of the MCFC process P.

A main goal is to derive general criteria that will allow the potential of the principle to be quantitatively evaluated, and to be compared to conventional fixed-bed reactors. The objectives of the PCP research activities are: the development of a new electrochemical mem-brane reactor based on oxygen-ion conducting membranes and its implementation for partial oxidation of light alkanes such as ethane and butane, modeling the membrane reactor as a prerequisite for the analysis of transport resistances and for optimial process control using electrochemical variables.

Research Highlights 4.1 Reactive Separations 4.1.1 Kinetic Instabilities in Reactive Distillation One of the key issues for the conceptual design and for the understanding of the operational behavior of reactive distillation processes using heterogeneous catalysts as distillation packing is the detailed analysis of the reaction micro- and macrokinetics [1]. In particular, Prof. Sundmacher, in close cooperation with Prof. Kienle and colleagues at Stuttgart University, contributed to the understanding of kinetic instabilities observed in catalytic distillation columns, exemplified by t he synthesis of the fuel ethers MTBE and TAME from methanol and isobutene or methanol and isoamylenes, respectively [2,3]. 4.1.2 Reaction Distillation with Liquid Phase Splitting In the open literature, so far there is very limited information on reactive distillation in systems undergoing liquid phase splitting although there may be a number of potential applications in the production of important chemicals. Therefore, the PCP group decided to investigate the fundamentals of this type of process in more detail, both by model-based process analysis and with miniplant experiments. As a suitable model reaction, the hydration of cyclohexene using solid acid catalysts was selected. The liquid-liquid equilibria as well as the vapor-liquid equilibria of this reaction system were investigated [4]. Macroreticular ion exchange resins and zeolites were found to be suitable catalysts. New structured packings coated with zeolite catalysts are being developed in collaboration with Prof. Schwieger, University of Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg. In order to understand the behavior of reactive distillation in the presence of liquid phase splitting, residue curve maps (RCM) were investigated. Special attention was given to the possibly different reaction rates in the two coexisting liquid phases. As illustrated in Fig. 23, PCP Group, K. Sundmacher 69 from the bifurcation analysis of the RCMs, feasible distillate and bottom products of a countercurrent reactive distillation column were identified [5,6]. It was found out that a hybrid column, combining reactive and nonreactive zones, is required to obtain high purity cyclohexanol (Fig. 24). Based on these results, a reactive distillation miniplant was planned and realized in the institute's laboratory. The miniplant is currently being prepared for first reactive distillation experiments. Fig. 23 : Bifurcation diagram of singular point Fig. 24: Flow scheme of proposed in dependence on the Darmk\u00f6hler reactive distillation process number [5]. for cyclohexanol synthesis [4]. 4.1.3 Coupled Reactive Distillation Columns For the separation of closely boiling mixtures (isobutene from C4 crack fractions) coupled reactive distillation columns offer the possibility of significantly reducing the number of operating units and their energy demands. This useful process was worked out and patented in close collaboration with the PSD group of Prof. Kienle [7-10]. As illustrated in Fig. 25, in the first hybrid column the reactive component isobutene reacts with methanol reversibly to methyl-tert.-butylether (MTBE). Since the other C4 components are nonreactive with respect to methanol, they leave the column with the distillate. Due to its high boiling point, MTBE is obtained as bottom product which is fed to the second column. There, it is split back into isobutene, which is the desired top product, and methanol which is recycled to the first column. The catalyst percentage per distillation tray was found to be a key parameter for the qualities of the top and bottom products. It should be mentioned that this coupled column Stable Node Saddle PointKinetic CyclohexanolCyclo- hexane Catalytic Packing Inert PackingInert Packing 70 scheme is applicable to all closely boiling mixtures whose components have different DIB in BottomIB in Dist.

These products can be identified as stable singular points of a reactive condenser and a reactive reboiler, respectively. The singular point equations and their bifurcational behavior were investigated in collaboration with Prof. Flockerzi (MF group) [11]. For a given reactive mixture, all potential top and bottom products are located on a unique singular point curve. The location of this curve is strongly influenc ed by interfacial vapor-liquid mass transfer resistances. In Fig. 27, the shadowed areas indicate the product regions that can be attained if membranes are applied in order to control the mass transfer of components between the vapor phase and the reactive liquid phase [12]. Recently, we proposed a new set of generalized transformed composition variables which are useful for the identification of reactive azeotropes in both phase equilibrium controlled and mass transfer controlled systems [13].

Equilibrium line) [12]. 4.2 Fuel Cell Processes 4.2.1 Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC) The PCP research activities on DMFCs were dedicated to the detailed understanding of the operational behavior of liquid fed DMFC s equipped with polymeric proton exchange membranes (PEM). This type of cell is an excellent candidate for future generations of mobile power supply systems since it combines an easy storage of the fuel, the direct integration of hydrogen abstraction from methanol into the anodic oxidation process, and operation at low temperatures allowing for highly dynamic load variations. On the other hand, due to the high degree of process integration realized in the DMFC concept, there are a number of fundamental drawbacks to overcome to enable its later use in technical systems.

The first model-based dynamic analysis of the DMFC operational behavior was developed and published in collaboration with the group of Prof. Scott at the University of Newcastle [18]. Fig. 30 shows some illustrative results of dynamic experiments that were carried out under a periodically pulsed methanol feed concentration. This led to the important finding of a significant increase in the average cell voltage at reduced fuel consumption. The comparison between the experimental dynamic data (Fig. 30, top) and simulated results (Fig. 30, bottom) shows a good qualitative agreemen t. The model data revealed that the methanol crossover transport through the membrane is the key issue for an adequate description of the dynamic fuel cell behavior. By dynamic feeding, the methanol crossover can be significantly decreased and this results in a considerable increase in the cathode potential. Fig. 30: Cell voltage response to periodically pulsed methanol feed concentration: experimental data (top) and simulation K. Sundmacher 73 In order to get a more detailed insight into the dynamics of the complex coupled transport processes, a special DMFC miniplant was designed suitable for monitoring the fuel cell behavior under various load scenarios. As an example of the dynamic results obtained with the miniplant, the observed cell voltage nonlinear response behavior to a sharp block pulse of the current density starting from open circuit level is depicted in Fig. 31. Fig. 31: Cell voltage response to a pulse change of the current density obtained from a miniplant experiment [20]. For the interpretation of the miniplant data, a rigorous fuel cell model was derived which describes the multicomponent mass, charge, and energy transport within the electrode diffusion layers, the catalyst layers and the PEM. This spatially distributed model is based on the generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations [20]. Validated rate equations are still missing in the open literature for the quantitative description of the reaction processes taking place in the catalyst layers. This is why the PCP group started to investigate the electrochemical ox idation of methanol at small scale half cells (area: 2 cm 2) by means of a novel cyclone flow cell which yields rate data at well defined flow conditions [21]. Work was also done with one of the most important electroanalytical tool, alternating current Electrochemical Impedance S pectros-copy (AC-EIS) in close collaboration with Prof. Christov from UCTM Sofia [22]. For the interpretation of the obtained impedance spectra (Fig. 32), rigorous nonlinear models are being derived which must also account for time drift effects of certain parameters. This approach leads to a much higher consistency of the identified parameters than the classical interpretation via electric equivalent circuits. 74 Fig. 32 Impedance spectra for electrochemical methanol oxidation at carbon supported Pt/Ru electrodes [21]. (f = increasing, b = decreasing frequencies) In order to be able to transfer these mesoscopic rate data to the macroscale of a real fuel cell, the concentration and temperatures fields in the anodic and cathodic flow compartments have to be determined. For this important scale-up task, the PCP group follows the approach to develop reduced flow field models starting from rigorous flow field simulations (CFD = computational fluid dynamics). As a first step, the dynamics of the concentration distribution in the laminar flow field of a selected channel geometry was investigated both experimentally by means of flow visualization techniques and by 3D flow field simulations (see Fig. 33). The latter were carried out in close collaboration with the group of Prof. Tobiska from Mathematics Department at OvGU [24]. PCP Group, K. Sundmacher 75 . Fig. 33: Snapshot of the dynamic tracer mixing process in the liquid filled anode manifold of a DMFC, left: experimental tracer visualis ation, 3D CFD simulation carried out with CFX [24]. 4.2.2 Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) Since May 2002, the PCP group has analyzed the process dynamics for Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) within a joint research project with four partners, which is funded by the German Ministry for Research (BMBF) and coordinated by Prof. Sundmacher. As an Important basis for the experimental part of this reearch project, a 300 kW MCFC stack (Hot Module by com-pany MTU-Friedrichshafen) was installed in the power supply system of the University Hospital in M agdeburg by the collaborating company IPF. The installed MCFC stack consists of 300 single cells and is operated at 600\u00b0C using natural gas as feed. As a special feature of this process, the fuel component methane is internally converted by steam reforming into hydrogen whic h is then directly oxidized at the MCFC anode (see Fig. 34). Fig. 34: Working principle of Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell with direct internal reforming. As an important basis for the experimental part of this research project, a 300 kW MCFC 76 This leads to a direct heat and mass integration. The exothermic hydrogen oxidation supplies its heat of reaction to the endothermic reforming reaction, while the latter reaction supplies hydrogen to the electrochemical oxidati on. By this integration concept, very high degrees of fuel conversion and current yield are achievable. As a further feature of the MCFC integration concept, the carbon dioxide produced at the anode is fed to the cathode side where it is consumed by electrochemical reduction with oxygen to carbonate ions which are transported through the electrolyte melt. The objectives of MPI research in the field of the MCFC are the following: (i) formulation of a hierarchical family of MCFC process models of different complexity in order to understand the nonlinear dynamic properties of the MCFC stack at various operating conditions, (ii) experimental validation of the model-based predictions and the derived control strategies using the 300 kW MCFC stack installed at the University hospital, (iii) development of optimized process operating strategies based on reduced process models in close collaboration with the PSD group (Prof. Kienle). Fig. 35: Step responses of MCFC state variables to current load change (dimensionless quantities). Left: CO 2 concentration along the cathode channel; right: overall cell potential [25]. In the In the MCFC stack, the anodic and cathodic reactants are transported in crosscurrent directions to each other. Therefore, a 2D simulation is required to describe this real process adequately. As the first step towards such a complex 2D cell model, the PCP group and the Chair for Process Systems Engineer ing formulated a 1D countercurrent MCFC model [25, 26]. The spatial discretization of the coupled mass, energy and charge balances results in a large scale differential-algebraic system (DAE). Depending on the model formulation, DAEs of index one or two are obtained. Their numerical solution was partly PCP Group, K. Sundmacher 77 O2-(SE)2e- cooperation with the PSD group of Prof. Kienle and the group of Prof. Pesch at the University of Bayreuth. Fig. 35 illustrates the predicted MCFC response behavior to a step input of the electric cell current in terms of the cathodic carbon dioxide concentration and in terms of the cell voltage. 4.3 Electrochemical Membrane Reactors Since 1999, the PCP group has been using fuel cell principles to design electrochemical membrane reactors which can be used not only for the production of electricity, but also for gas purification [27-28]. Recently, a new type of high-temperature electrochemical membrane reactor was proposed for the controlled partial oxidation of light alkanes based on oxygen ion conducting membranes. The research is carried out in close cooperation with the Chair for Technical Chemistry at OvGU (Prof. Rau) and the PCF group (Prof. Seidel- Morgenstern) within a research network entitled \"Membrane Supported Reaction Engineering\" which is funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG). Fig. 36: Working principle of electrochemical membrane reactor for partial oxidation of butane to malenic acid (MA) [28. Fig. 36 illustrates the proposed reactor concept which is subject of a patent application [29]. The cathode compartment is fed with air whose oxygen is reduced to oxygen ions at a 78 [min]Butane OxygenButane log(/[Scm-1]) 0 = Time [min]Butane OxygenButane log(/[Scm-1]) platinum catalyst layer. These ions are transported through the solid electrolyte (SE) the anode catalyst layer. In the case of butane partial oxidation, a VPO catalyst is used. The catalyst activity and selectivity for partial oxidation of butane to malenic anhydride depends on its oxidation state. The basic idea of the electrochemical reactor concept is to control the catalyst oxidation state (VPO red/VPO ox) via the flux of oxygen ions from the cathode to the anode, which in turn can be controlled by adjusting the external electric current. The controllability of the catalyst selectivity makes this process very attractive not only for butane oxidation, but also for other partial oxidations of light alkanes. As an important requirement to the feasibility of this electrochemical membrane reactor, the operating temperature of the ion conducting membrane has to match the operating window of the oxidation catalyst. Therefore, membrane materials must have a reasonable conductivity at temperatures around 400\u00b0C. This is also to avoid the deposition of carbon at the anode. In cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Stuttgart (group of Prof. Aldinger), new perovskite materials (LSGM = La 0.9Sr0.1Ga 0.85Mg 0.15O3-) tested as membranes because they have reasonable ionic conductivity at temperatures from 400 to 600\u00b0C, i.e. within the operating window of the VPO catalyst which itself is a mixed conductor.

In this long-term research project, our research activities are currently focused on identifying and quantifying all relevant transport and reaction phenomena in the membrane-catalyst-assembly, by systematic experiment s as well as by the formulation of adequate process models [30]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to determine PCP Group, K. Sundmacher 79 Microemulsions Precipitated particles the ionic conductivity of membrane materials and to investigate the ionic/n-type/p-type conductivity domains of the VPO catalyst (see in Fig. 37 and Fig. 38). 4.4 Dynamics of Particulate Processes Particle precipitations are often very fast ionic reactions taking place in an aqueous phase. The size of the particles formed depends on the local supersaturation and the local growth conditions within the solution. Due to high reaction rates, precipitation processes are controlled mainly by the mixing phenomena of the ionic reactants in the bulk solution. This is why precipitation processes and the resulting particle size distribution are very sensitive with respect to the flow field within the reactor. In order to decouple the particle generation processes from the fluid dynamic conditions, we use water-in-oil-microemulsions as reaction media. These microemulsions are thermodynamica lly stable emulsions (droplet diameter 5 - 100 nm) can exhibit a complex phase behavior whose characterisation is the subject of our current laboratory activities. Fig. 39 illustrates the basic idea of the proposed emulsion precipitation process. The precipitation reaction A + B C(solid) is started from two microemulsions which are fed into a stirred tank reactor. The reactants A and B which are stored in the emulsion droplets, meet due to droplet exchange phenomena and subsequently undergo a chemical conversion. This creates a supersaturation in the droplets which is needed to generate nuclei which, in turn, permit particle growth. Precipitation in microemulsions, due to the limited amount of reactants dissolved in a single droplet, can produce nanosized solid particles with a very narrow size distribution. Fig. 39: Formation of solid particles by precipitation in microemulsions: principle of the process. 80 As a model reaction, we are currently investigating the precipitation of calcium carbonate particles in cyclohexane/water/Marlipal microemulsions [31]. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and SEM are used as analytical tools for offline particle size analysis. Together with the chair for process systems engineering at OvGU a special miniplant was developed with online particle size analysis based on ultrasound extinction. For the analysis of the composition and morphology of the solid particles formed, an X-ray diffraction (XRD) device was purchased together with the PSF group (Prof. Seidel-Morgenstern). Parallel to the experimental investigations, the PCP group has started to model the emulsion precipitation process by means of population balance equations. Their solution is the subject of a collaboration with the group of Prof. Hackbusch at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Leipzig. Furthermore, we started to apply Monte-Carlo techniques to simulate the dynamics of mult idimensional property distributions. A close collaboration with Prof. Ramkrishna at the University of Purdue, USA, is in preparation. 5. Selected Teaching Activities, Ph.D. Projects 5.1 Teaching Activities at OvGU (K.

Raisch 87 Research Group: Systems and Control Theory (SCT) Prof. Dr.-Ing. J\u00f6rg Raisch This report covers the period from 1 June 1998 to 3 0 April 2003 88 1. SCT Group Introduction The Systems and Control Theory Group was founded in 1998. It cooperates closely with the research group on Systems Theory in Engineering (\"Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Systemtheorie technischer Prozesse\") at the Otto-von-Guericke Uni versity. The university group was established in September 2000 and is also headed by J\u00f6rg Raisch. The group's research interests are - not surprisingly - in the area of S ystems and Control Theory (SCT). SCT has been recognised as a research area in its own right for several decades. Roughly speaking, its subject is the analysis and synthesis of dynami cal systems, in particular the design of control systems. As a result, SCT provides an array of analysis and synthesis methods and tools which have been successfully applied to solve a great number of application problems. Additionally, it has served as a bridge between a v ariety of application areas, e. g. chemical engineering, mechanical and manufacturing engineeri ng, economics, biology, etc. By translating specific application problems into a un ique mathematical framework, SCT provides a common language that allows scientists a nd engineers with extremely diverse technical backgrounds to communicate and hence gene rates considerable synergy effects. This general perspective of SCT is reflected in our group's research interests. We address both challenging problems from the \"core do main\" of SCT and - in cooperation with other research groups from the MPI and elsewhere - problems from a number of application areas. In this way, we hope to contribute to advanc ing SCT as a subject and, at the same time, to help increase interaction between the dive rse research fields at the Max-Planck- Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems . SCT Group, J. Raisch 89 2. Members of the SCT Group As of March 1, 2003, the group consists of six Ph.D . students, a postdoc and a secretary. Ph.D. students: E. Mayer (since Nov. 1, 1998) N.-O.

Survey of Research Projects Some of our research projects aim at developing con trol synthesis methods (these are also referred to as \"theoretical\" projects), others at solving specific application problems. We try to keep a good balance between theoretical and application projects; we also attempt to match projects in the sense that results obtained f rom theoretical work are immediately transferred into specific application projects. Thi s is indicated in Fig. 40. It is followed by a list of projects, including information on cooperat ing partners and, if applicable, external funding sources. More detailed information on a sma ll number of representative projects can be found in Section 4.

SCT Group, J. Raisch 91 Project area: Hybrid and Discrete-Event Systems Project: Hybrid Control Systems Abstract: Hybrid control systems consist of continu ous and discrete-event components. Although such systems are ubiquitous in engineering, a generally feasible solution method does not yet exi st. We follow an approach that is based on \"safe\" discrete approxima tions of continuous components. This approach translates the overall hybrid problem into a purely discrete one, which can subse quently be solved using established methods from discrete-event syste ms theory. Researchers: D. Gromov, J. Raisch Partners: Australian National University (T. Moor), Melbourne University (J. of Proc esses Abstract: High Throughput Screening (HTS) plants are used for analysis of chemical or biological substances, where, for a lar ge number of sample batches, several operations have to be execu ted in the same specific time scheme. This project addresses the sc heduling problem for HTS processes, i.e. it aims at determining the optimal (in the sense of throughput maximisation) sequence and timi ng for all operations during a screening run. Researchers: E. Mayer, J. Raisch Partners: T ransportation Engineering Abstract: Max-Plus-Algebra is an established method in DES (discrete event systems) theory, which is particularly useful for i nvestigating cyclic processes, e.g., identifying bottlenecks and predic ting propagation of delays. It has been applied to analyse the suburban train network of Stuttgart and to investigate inland waterways where synchronisation is required for locks and narrow stretches. It can also be used for online rescheduling and, in combination with suitab le continuous control, in a hierarchical feedback scheme for the overall control of transportation networks. Researchers: D. Li, E. Mayer Partners: INS Group Funding: MPI Start: 11/1998 92 Project: Automatic Start-up of Chemical Processes Abstract: The start-up problem for chemical process es is essentially characterised by two aspects: (i) as a wide operati ng range has to be covered, linearised models are not adequate; (ii) s pecifications are \"coarse\" and can therefore often be formalised by d iscrete dynamic models. This makes start-up a hybrid control task, which can be addressed using methods developed in our group's pr oject on hybrid control systems. These methods have been successful ly applied to a distillation column system. Researchers: A. Itigin (Stuttgart University), J. R aisch Partners: Plants Abstract: Control of discontinuously operated multi product plants is a highly nontrivial hybrid control problem. In practice, rec ipe-based approaches are prevalent. They provide solutions wh ich are (i) often even nominally far from optimal and (ii) open-loop and therefore extremely sensitive to unforeseen disturbances. We investigate an alternative control strategy which combines an opti misation based approach with an abstraction-based method from hybr id systems theory. Researchers: B.V. Mishra, Project Project: Model Abstraction for Control Purposes Abstract: There exists a natural tradeoff between m odel accuracy and model simplicity. In control applications, there is a par ticularly large scope for model simplification (approximation, abstractio n), as feedback constitutes an efficient way of \"combatting\" model uncertainty. A central requirement within this context is \"safety\" : each controller enforcing the specifications for a safe abstraction must be guaranteed to \"work properly\" for the underlying sy stem. Researchers: J. Raisch Partners: Australian National University 93 Project: Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulati on (FES) in the Rehabilitation of Stroke Patients and Patients with Spinal Cord Injuries Abstract: Electrical nerve-stimulation of paralysed muscles can be used to generate muscle contractions. In combination with a ppropriate sensor technology and feedback control, this can be exploited to elicit functional movements, such as walking and cy cling. Depending on the degree of disability, the goal may be tempor ary assistance, e.g. during re-learning of gait, or permanent repla cement of lost motor functions (neuro-prostheses). In the context of control, the most challenging aspects are the interaction betwee n FES and voluntary muscle activity and the complexity of neu ro- musculoskeletal systems, the latter requiring the u se of reduced models.

In most cases, however, several reaction schemes can be considered as plausible a-priori hypotheses. This p roject aims at providing a set of methods that can be used to safe ly discard hypotheses on the basis of qualitative properties o r measurement information. Researchers: C. Conradi Structures Project: Hierarchical Control Theory Abstract: Hierarchical control can be interpreted a s an attempt to handle complex problems by decomposing them into smaller s ubproblems and reassembling their solutions into a \"functionin g\" hierarchical structure. So far, heuristic approaches have been p revalent. However, they cannot guarantee that the overall sol ution does indeed meet the specifications. In contrast, our pr oject aims at a formal synthesis method that can provide such a gua rantee. Our approach is based on a hierarchy of models describi ng a given plant at various levels of abstraction. Researchers: D. Gromov, A. Itigin (Stuttgart Univer sity), J. Raisch Partners: Stuttgart University Start: 01/1999 Project: Plantwide Control Chemical Processes Abstract: This projects aims at applying hierarchic al concepts to design a plantwide control strategy for an acetic acid produ ction plant in Sewerodonetsk, Ukraine. A complex dynamic plant mod el has been developed by the PSD Group and is being validated t hrough experimental data. Several aspects make the problem extremely demanding from a control point of view: the model i s high-order and nonlinear, it reflects material recycles between di fferent parts of the plant, and its structure changes instantaneously af ter the occurrence of certain internal events (e.g. phase splits). Researchers R. Waschler and A. Kienle area: Population Balance Systems Project: H-Control of Population Balance Systems Abstract: Many processes, such as crystallisation a nd polymerisation, are characterised by a large number of individual parti cles which differ with respect to one or more properties. The tempora l evolution of the distribution density is typically described by a pa rtial integro- differential equation (population balance model), w here the integral part represents \"nonlocal effects\". For a simple cl ass of population balance models (linear, with concentrated control i nput and measurement signals), infinite-dimensional H-control theory can be adapted to optimise performance, subject to the usu al stability constraints. and pharmaceutical indust ries, crystallisation is used for the production of solids from liquids. Product quality usually depends heavily on crystal size distribution (CSD), whose dynamics can be described by population balance models. Our group investigates two control problems for crystallisati on processes. First, continuously operated crystallisers often exhibit s ustained oscillations around the desired operating point, wh ich need to be removed to provide constant product quality. This i s achieved by applying H feedback techniques. Second, in batch crystallisat ion, the CSD at the end of a batch-run needs to be shape d according to product specification, e.g., by selecting a suitabl e cooling policy. The cooling policy, in turn, is generated using flatnes s-based control theory. Subproject: Control Funding: MPI Start: 06/1998 96 4. Research Highlights In the following, we highlight a few of our group's research activities. The selection is meant to provide an idea of our research philosophy and therefore includes both projects of primarily theoretical focus and applied focus. 4.1. Control of Crystallisation Processes In the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, crys tallisation is used for the production of solids from liquids. Supersaturation, which is gene rated either by cooling or by evaporation of solvent, represents the driving force for the tw o processes dominating crystallisation dynamics: nucleation, i.e. the production of new cr ystals, and crystal growth. Furthermore, phenomena such as attrition, breakage and agglomera tion of crystals may occur. Since nucleation, growth, etc. take place simultane ously, crystals of different sizes are present in a crystalliser. Product quality depends heavily on crystal size distribution (CSD), i.e. the distribution of crystals with respect to c rystal size. The evolution of the CSD over time is usually modelled by a population balance equation (PBE). This is a partial differential equation, sometimes with an additional integral par t representing breakage, attrition, and agglomeration phenomena. It is coupled to one or mo re ordinary differential equations (ODEs) resulting from a solute mole balance of the liquid phase and, if necessary, an energy balance of the system. Hence, commonly accep ted models for crystallisation processes are relatively complex, nonlinear, infini te-dimensional systems. This makes model-based controller synthesis a challenging task , both for continuously operated and batch crystallisers. 4.1.1. Continuous Crystallisation Dissolution of small crystals (fines dissolution) i s frequently used in industrial continuous crystallisation plants (Fig. 41) to improve the pro duct CSD. This effectively shifts the CSD towards larger crystal sizes and often makes the di stribution narrower. However, these benefits are being paid for by a deterioration of t he dynamic process behaviour: fines dissolution often leads to sustained oscillations o f CSD and solute concentration around the designated operating point . Clearly, this interferes with the aim of providing constant product quality and therefore motivates the design of suitable feedback controllers to stabilise the crystalliser at high f ines dissolution rates.

A detailed population balance model for an evaporat ive crystalliser has been developed by our cooperation partners at the University of St uttgart [3]. In a first step, based on physical considerations, this model is simplified t o allow analytical determination of the steady state. This step does not include lumping of the model and hence preserves t he infinite-dimensional nature of the system. We can n ow linearise around the steady state to obtain a transfer function relating the control inp ut (the fines dissolution rate) to the third moment of the CSD, which is assumed to be the measu red output. Reflecting the infinite- dimensional character, the transfer function is irr ational with infinitely many poles and zeros. Clearly, as we use a linearised version of an alrea dy simplified model, we need to emphasise robustness during the control design, i.e. we seek a controll er that will tolerate a large degree of model uncertainty. H-theory provides a framework for the synthesis of robust controllers, which has recently been extende d to a class of infinite-dimensional systems. In a related project (see Section 3), we h ave shown that this approach also covers the type of population balance models we obtain in a crystallisation context. Applying this method to the problem at hand yields an irrational controller transfer function [2], which, for implementation purposes, needs to be approximated b y a rational, i.e. finite-dimensional, transfer function corresponding to a finite set of ordinary differential equations. Simulations of the resulting controller in closed loop with the detailed population balance model from [3] are shown in Fig. 42. They demonstrate the effectiv eness of our approach. 98 0 0.5 10102030400100200300400500600 L [mm] t [h]mdf [g/mm] itched on at ht10 0= (right). Nevertheless, one might ask what we gain by pursuin g a late lumping philosophy, i.e. by lumping the controller instead of the process model . The gain is twofold. First, late lumping preserves the infinite-dimensional nature and, as a consequence, physical intuition during the entire design process. This is especially impor tant in H-synthesis, where a proper choice of weighting factors in the cost function is extremely difficult without that sort of intuition. Second, with late lumping, it is possibl e to quantify the degree of suboptimality implied by the lumping-related approximation. 4.1.2. Batch Crystallisation The control problem posed by the batch-wise operati on of crystallisation plants is quite different. In batch crystallisation, the vessel is initially filled with undersaturated solution. Supersaturation is generated by gradual cooling (Fi g. 43). The CSD obtained at the end of the batch is determined by the temperature-time pro file applied to the process. This, essentially, defines an open-loop control problem, namely how to find a temperature trajectory producing a predefined CSD. SCT Group, J.

This model allows the de rivation of a closed set of ordinary differential equations for a finite number of leadi ng moments of the CSD. The solution makes use of the flatness concept from nonlinear control theory: a dynamic system is called differentially flat if there exists a \"flat output\", which is a functio n of the system state and input, such that, conversely, the state and input o f the system can be expressed as functions of the flat output and finitely many of its time de rivatives. This represents an invertibility property which is extremely useful for the solution of open-loop control problems. Although the system of moment equations derived from the PBE form is not flat, it can be made so by applying state dependent scaling of time. Such syst ems are called orbitally flat. Applying the same scaling of time to the PBE yields a simple tra nsport equation. Exploiting these two properties - orbital flatness of the moment equatio ns and the simple structure of the time scaled PBE - the open-loop control problem can be s olved in a very elegant way. A procedure has been developed which enables the anal ytic computation of the corresponding temperature profile for any desired (and physically meaningful) CSD [4, 5]. Based on these results, it is also possible to determine a control policy that optimises the final CSD by solving a static optimisation problem. Simulation results for a typ ical optimization problem - maximising the ratio of final seed crystal mass and nucleated crystal mass - are shown in the right half of Fig. 44. The left half of the fig ure shows the temporal evolution of the CSD obtained from a conventional linear cooling policy. To obtain experimental validation for both the continuous and the batch control results, we co operate with the PCF group. 100 Fig. 44: Temporal evolution of CSD in a batch crystalliser: linear cooling policy (left), optimal cooling policy (right). 4.2. Hybrid Control Systems The control of physical or chemical processes by di gital computer programs often leads to heterogeneous systems which include both continuous and discrete-event dynamics. Such hybrid control systems generally exhibit highly complex behaviour. From a n engineering point of view, the systematic design of hybrid cont rol systems is of particular importance. This represents a mathematically challenging task, primarily because of the nature of hybrid state sets: purely continuous systems usually exhib it a nice (vector space) structure. This implies that a rich set of analysis tools can be ap plied to investigate continuous system dynamics. Purely discrete systems can be described by discrete, and in most cases finite, state sets. Hence, the dynamical behaviour of finit e discrete systems can, at least in principle, be completely investigated by finite enu meration type methods. The state set of a hybrid system is the product of the state sets of i ts constituent components. In general, it is therefore neither finite nor does it exhibit vector space structure. A natural approach to avoiding this problem is to r esort to approximation-based control synthesis methods: roughly speaking, the external b ehaviour of the continuous component is approximated by a discrete-event system (DES); if t he specifications are also discrete, this turns the hybrid control problem into a purely disc rete one, which, in a subsequent step, can be addressed using established methods from the fie ld of DES theory. Approximation-based synthesis of hybrid control systems has been an act ive area of research for a number of years, with important contributions from, among oth ers, P. ANTSAKLIS', B. KROGH'S AND J. LUNZE'S groups. All of these approaches require the approximation to be safe , meaning that any controller enforcing the specifications fo r the discrete approximation must be guaranteed to do the same for the underlying contin uous model. Failure controller synthesis on the approximation level, ho wever, does not imply that the hybrid control problem cannot be solved, as increasing app roximation accuracy may still allow determination of an adequate controller. We have th erefore suggested a method that provides a set of discrete approximations (all of t hem realisable by finite automata), which are strictly ordered with respect to approximation accuracy, e.g. [6, 7]. These \" l-complete approximations\" exactly represent the external beha viour of the continuous system under consideration over an interval of 1+l sampling instants [8, 13], where sampling [9], or event-tri ggered [10]. Clearly, increasing l will increase approximation accuracy, but will also (exponentiall y) increase complexity. In cooperation with T. MOOR from the Australian National Universit y and J. DAVOREN from the University of Melbourne, we have explored a number of promisin g approaches to alleviate this problem. Increasing the integer parameter l increases approximation accuracy uniformly - even though the given specifications may only require a refinement of certain aspects of the discrete approximation. Hence, in [14], we develope d a procedure that, in case of failure during the controller synthesis step, locates the p otential reason for failure in the currently used approximation. The refinement procedure then f ocuses its efforts on those aspects of the approximation that have caused the failure inst ead of doing an unspecific global refinement. Another approach to counter the increase of complex ity is the use of modular controllers. In [11], we identified conditions under which two d iscrete controllers, each enforcing a particular specification for a continuous plant mod el, will have an admissible parallel composition that enforces both specifications simul taneously. Hierarchical control can be interpreted as an attem pt to handle complex problems by decomposing them into smaller subproblems and reass embling their solutions in a hierarchical structure. In the context of hybrid sy stems, formal methods have been explored, e.g., by P. CAINES' and S. SASTRY'S groups. In our project on hierarchical control systems, we have investigated an approach that is b ased on a hierarchy of models describing a given plant at various levels of abstr action. It captures intuitive concepts like information aggregation between different levels of control and, in [15], has been applied to a hybrid control setting. In [16], we considered a more specific hierarchical hybrid control architecture in some detail. It is characterised by a high-level discrete-event controller that switches between a finite number of low-level conti nuous controllers attached to a given continuous plant. From an application point of view , this architecture is attractive because it may be computationally much more efficient to gener ate safe approximations for the closed- loop composition of a low-level controller and the plant model than for the latter alone. 102 Obvious examples are low-level controllers which as ymptotically force the continuous state onto a lower-dimensional manifold. To compute l-complete or other safe approximations, one basical ly needs to propagate bounded subsets of the plant state space under the flow corresponding to the plant dynamics, and to intersect the results with other b ounded sets. This clearly represents a major problem for nonlinear flows. In practice, one often resorts to exhaustive simulation type methods, where instead of a set, a large numbe r of single points is propagated over time. This not only interferes with the aim of find ing a safe approximation, but also drastically increases computational requirements, especially fo r high-dimensional systems. In cooperation with D. FLOCKERZI, we have investigated a class of nonlinear systems where safe approximations can be computed very efficientl y: monotone dynamical systems, which are fairly common in chemical engineering applicati ons, are characterised by the fact that there exists a partial order in the state space whi ch is preserved under the progress of time. In cooperation with the PSD group, we successfully used our results to synthesise a discrete-event controller for the automatic start-u p of a distillation column. Controller synthesis was based on a nonlinear 42nd order plant model; the specification was to drive the plant state into a well-defined vicinity of the desired operating point within 20 minutes. Fig. 45 shows a comparison between the open-loop ca se, where the control inputs corresponding to the desired operating point were a pplied to the plant model, and the closed-loop case consisting of continuous plant mod el and discrete controller [12]. In the former case, it takes many hours to converge to the desired target region (indicated by horizontal lines), in the latter case, this is achi eved, as required, within 20 minutes. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 110203040tray number [] methanol mole fraction [] 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 110203040tray number [] methanol mole fraction [] Fig. distillation column: min 10 SCT Group, J. Raisch 103 4.3. Throughput Maximisation for Screening Systems High Throughput Screening (HTS) plants are used for analysis of chemical or biological substances. Although hundreds of substances are agg regated on a single microplate (\"batch\"), a large number of batches have to pass t hrough the plant resources, e.g. incubators, liquid handling devices, transport devi ces, etc., in the same specific time scheme. This motivates the specific scheduling task for HTS plants, namely to determine a sequence and time scheme for all operations that wi ll lead to maximal throughput or, equivalently, will need minimal time to achieve a d esired throughput. The task is set apart from scheduling problems in other applications area s by a number of requirements: while progressing through several operations, each single batch may pass the same machine more than once; more than one batch will be present in the system at the same time, and there are no buffers between the machines; a batch may occupy two or more machines simultaneously when being transferred from one mach ine to another; additionally, there will be upper time bounds (\"due dates\") defined by the u ser. A number of scheduling approaches have been suggest ed for specialized HTS plants. However, as development goes towards large flexible HTS plants (Fig. 46), a general scheduling approach is needed which can be used ind ependently of the specific combination of machines and transport devices. Fig. 46: Flexible scheduling plant (CyBio AG, Jena). This project represents a cooperation with CYBIO AG , a leading manufacturer of HTS plants. In many cases, due to the specific nature o f the substances to be screened, 104 operating schemes in their plants have to be strict ly cyclic, i.e. the time distance between two consecutive batches (\"cycle time\") is required to be constant (see Fig. 47). Throughput maximisation is then equivalent to minimisation of cycle time. To formalise this scheduling problem, we need a mathematical model for cyclic pr ocesses and for all constraints to be satisfied. A key ingredient is a compact and effect ive formulation for the so called disjunctive constraints, which state that no resource of the pl ant can be used by more than one batch simultaneously. Based on this, the scheduling probl em can be reformulated as a (generally very large) mixed integer nonlinear optimisation pr oblem (MINLP). Next, the size of the problem formulation can be reduced considerably by using a suitable parametrisation for the degrees of freedom of the scheduling task. However, even small MINLPs may be extremely hard to solve, hence an important step within this project was the discovery of a transformation that makes the problem a linear one. The resulting MILP (mixed integer linear problem) is an exact representation of the underlyi ng scheduling problem and can be solved using, for example, branch and bound methods. The r esult is guaranteed to be a globally optimal solution. An illustrative example is given in Fig. 47: the top part shows a cyclic operating scheme for a problem requiring six alloca tions on three resources per batch. The lower part shows the corresponding minimal cycle-ti me scheme. Interestingly, completion of a single batch takes longer in the optimal scheme. 050100150200250300Machine 3Machine 2Machine 1 time >T T T T T T T T T 050100150200250300Machine 3Machine 2Machine 1 time >TTTTTTTTT Fig. 47: Examples for cyclic operating scheme (Gantt charts ). Individual batches are shown in different colors. The proposed method has been successfully applied t o a sample scheduling problem for a modern, fully automated flexible HTS system, wher e screening runs involve up to 150 resource allocations per batch. So far, we have onl y investigated the optimal open-loop case. In a next step, closed-loop aspects such as r e-scheduling after failures will be taken SCT Group, J. Raisch 105 into account. The funding for this project has been provided by the German Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) under their AiF-sch eme. First results appeared in [17]. 4.4. Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES) in the Rehabilitation of Stroke Patients and Patients with Spinal Cord In juries The overall theme of this project is to investigate the application of controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) for the rehabilitation stroke patients and patients with spinal cord injuries. It is well known that electrical nerve-st imulation can be used to generate contractions of paralysed muscles. In combination w ith appropriate sensor technology and feedback control, this can be exploited to elicit f unctional movements, such as walking and cycling, and hence to restore certain motor functio ns. Depending on the degree of disability, the intention may be temporary assistance, e.g., du ring re-learning of gait, or permanent replacement of lost motor functions (neuro-prosthes is). Beside these functional effects, FES has several secondary therapeutic benefits: it impr oves muscle size and strength, increases the range of joint motion and improves cardiopulmon ary fitness by providing significant training effects. FES is therefore potentially more attractive for rehabilitation purposes than conventional methods such as passive bracing of the joints. Fig. 48 explains the principle of controlled FES for a specific problem, the control of knee-joint angle by quadricep stimulation. Controller StimulatorSpinal cord injury Sensory Fig. 48: Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) for knee-j oint angle control. 106 The knee-joint angle is measured and fed back to th e controller, which generates a suitable stimulation pattern to achieve tracking of a reference trajectory. Stimulation can either be applied directly to the peripheral motor nerves (as shown in Fig. 48) or, if the reflex arcs in the lower spinal cord are still intact, to the sensory nerves. The latter causes an indirect stimulation of motor nerves while ensuring the natural inhibition of antagonistic muscles. A general problem with FES is rapid muscle fatigue. External stimuli, which replace the missing commands from the central nervo us system, tend to invert the recruitment order of muscle fibres: motorneurons wi th larger diameter are activated first as they have a lower threshold; they recruit the faste r and more powerful (type 2 or white) fibres, which fatigue more quickly than the slower, but less powerful, type 1 or red muscle fibres. Electrical stimulation is realised by attac hing surface electrodes to the skin, because the alternative, implanting electrodes, is much les s convenient and carries a serious risk of infection. Our FES project builds on extensive previous studie s at a number of institutions, e.g. the Centre for Rehabilitation Engineering (CRE) at the University of Glasgow. Both investigators in our FES project, T. Schauer and N.-O. Neg\u00e5rd, we re with the CRE before joining our group in late 2001 and early 2002, respectively. Th e project is organised within four subprojects, the first two addressing fundamental q uestions in the FES context, the other two aiming at transferring results into medical and therapeutical practice. 4.4.1. Nonlinear Modelling, Identification and Robu st Control of Electrically Stimulated Muscles Neuro-musculoskeletal systems are complex, nonlinea r and, due to muscle fatigue, rapidly time-varying. An adaptive scheme based on o n-line identification of simplified model structures is therefore an attractive possibility f or controller design. In this context, restrictions imposed by the intended use in a clini cal environment are of prime importance. For example, goniometer measurements of joint angle s are to be preferred to powerful optical analysis systems, simply because the latter may be affected by physiotherapists working with the patient. The identification scheme proposed in [21] takes such restrictions into account. An implicit self-tuning scheme, which does not need explicit identification of a plant model, has also been investigated and is desc ribed in [18]. Another approach is to work with less detailed model information, to empha sise robustness during controller design and to accept a certain degree of performance degra dation. We have applied backstepping control synthesis techniques to a lower-limb model reflecting the well-known equations of motion and passive joint properties, but containing only an extremely rudimentary description of muscle dynamics plus the correspondi ng uncertainty bounds [20]. Within this SCT Group, J. Raisch 107 subproject, we cooperate with the University of Gla sgow (K. Hunt), the Politecnico di Milano (F. Previdi), and Imperial College London (A. Astol fi). 4.4.2. Electromyography-based Control of FES in the Rehabilitation of Hemiparetic Patients Because of the interference caused by voluntary mus cle activity, controlled FES in hemiparetic patients is a potentially more demandin g problem. In this subproject, we investigate how to detect such voluntary muscle act ivity through electromyography (EMG) and how to exploit this information when controllin g lower-limb movements by FES. Simultaneously applying electrical stimulation and performing EMG measurements on the same muscle group requires special hardware and sig nal processing routines in order to minimise stimulation artefacts within the EMG measu rements. This is currently being investigated in the gait analysis laboratory at the MPI, which has recently been established with funds from the Ministry of Education and Cultu ral Affairs of Saxony-Anhalt. Medical assistance is provided by our cooperation partner, the neurological rehabilitation centre MEDIAN KLINIK NRZ (P. Sch\u00f6nle). 4.4.3. Control of FES-assisted Gait Training Treadmill training with partial body weight support represents a promising new rehabilitation technique for improving the mobility of hemiparetic patients. Peripheral stimulus due to repeated strides on a motorised tre admill assisted by physiotherapists may lead to a reorganisation and an activation of spina l circuits and reflexes which allow an independent motor control of gait at spinal level. We intend to improve this technique by means of multichannel FES of the initially paralyse d muscles (Fig. 49). Goniometers, inertial sensors and force sensitive r esistors are employed to determine joint angles, gait phases, foot clearance and strid e length for feedback control. An improvement in gait quality in the early stage of r ehabilitation and an increased amount of training are expected. Similar to treadmill trainer s, electromechanical gait trainers can be enhanced by FES. Using gait trainers, the control o f FES is simplified, as the position of the legs is constrained to a predefined path; this redu ces the mechanical degrees of freedom. For this subproject, there are two medical and one industrial cooperation partners, MEDIAN KLINIK NRZ, HEDON-KLINIK, and KRAUTH & TIMMERMANN G MBH. 108 TreadmillGoniometerHarness support Electrical stimulation using surface electrodes(d) (b) (c) (a) FSR Intertial sensor Fig. 49: Treadmill training using multichannel FES: (a) per oneal nerve stimulation, (b) quadricep muscle group, (c) hamstring muscle group, (d) gluteus maximus. 4.4.4. Development of Mobile and Stationary FES-cyc ling Systems with Motor Assist FES-cycling represents another promising rehabilita tion tool. Crank angle and cadence are measured and fed back to generate a suitable st imulation pattern for the major leg muscles [19]. Additional force sensors are used to tune the stimulation pattern. This is particularly important for hemiparetic patients, wh ere voluntary muscle activity must be taken into account to achieve good results. In cooperatio n with the Centre for Rehabilitation Engineering at the University of Glasgow and HASOME D GMBH, a biomedical engineering company, our group is developing motor assisted FES -cycling systems. They are based on commercially available ergometers and recumbent tri cycles. SCT Group, J. Raisch 109 4.5. Research Related Activities Organisation of International Workshops (J.

Seidel-Morgenstern 115 Research Group: Physical and Chemical Foundations of Process Engineering (PCF) Prof. Dr.-Ing. Andreas Seidel-Morgenstern This report covers the period between August 1998 a nd April 2003 116 1. PCF Group Introduction The activities of the research group \"Physical and Chemical Foundations of Process Engineering\" started in August 1998 with the appoin tment of Prof. A. Seidel-Morgenstern as an External Scientific Member of the Max Planck Soc iety. With this appointment, the basis was laid for a good cooperation of the MPI with the Otto-von- Guericke-University (OvGU) in Magdeburg and in particular with the Faculty of Pro cess and Systems Engineering where A. Seidel-Morgenstern is the head of the Chair of Chem ical Process Engineering. The main activities in the busy initial period of b uilding up the MPI were focused on the recruiting of suitable co-workers for the whole ins titute and for the PCF group and the planning of research laboratories for the first tem porary location in the ZENIT building and in parallel for the new building. In 1999 Dr. H. Loren z and J. Kaufmann joined the group. With their help, the laboratories were equipped and firs t scientific projects were initiated. Since several groups at the MPI identified the investigat ion of various types of crystallization processes and of population balance systems as a ch allenging and integrating project area for joint research, the PCF group began to develop a research program in this field. The focus was set on the experimental and theoretical s tudy of crystallization processes that can be used for the isolation and purification of pharm aceutical drugs (in particular, enantiomers). In 2000 our lab was capable to measure reliable sol ubility data for enantiomeric systems. When A. Perlberg and M. Kaspereit joined the group as the first Ph.D. students, new activities were initiated devoted to quantifying th e rates of crystal growth and the equilibria of adsorptive and chromatographic separation processes . Further activities devoted to systematically investigating reaction processes sup ported by membrane separation were started at the end of 2000. To investigate this res earch area, a major project proposal was elaborated. Since the beginning of 2001 the German Research Foundation (DFG) has supported 8 different subprojects at the Magdeburg University and at the MPI within the framework of the DFG Research Group \"Membrane Suppo rted Reaction Engineering\". After the start of a second major joint project focused o n combining chromatography and crystallization for the separation of enantiomers ( in cooperation with the company Schering in Berlin, financed by the German Research Ministry), further co-workers joined the group. At this time, our research work also became increasing ly interesting for students from the OvGU as documented by a growing number of diploma and ma ster thesis projects. Thus, the last months in the ZENIT building were characterized by significant space problems and the end of 2001 was the right time to move into the new bui lding. Here again, several months were needed to reinitiate and expand the experimental wo rk, however, this time there were many more possibilities. In particular the experimental work on crystallization was intensified. A significant catalyst for this development was Dr. A . Mahoney who joined us as a postdoc CF Group, A. Seidel-Morgenstern 117 introducing profound expertise in the analysis of p opulation balance systems. The possibilities in the new building also triggered jo int projects with other groups at the MPI. Examples are the analysis of new types of simulated moving bed processes in cooperation with the PSD group (A. Kienle) and the evaluation o f the potential of confocal laser microscopy for investigating electrochromatographic processes in cooperation with the BPE group (U. Reichl). The latter activities are part o f a larger research project which is devoted to quantifying electrokinetic phenomena and the dynami cs of capillary electrochromatography conducted in collaboration with U. Tallarek (OvGU). In July 2002 A. Seidel-Morgenstern became a Scienti fic Member of the Max Planck Society and a director at the MPI. To promote the e xcellent cooperation between the MPI and Otto von Guericke University he continued as th e head of the Chair of Chemical Process Engineering. In recent months further co-workers have joined the group (e.g. Y. Shan, M. Elsner, E. Rapp) expanding our range of activities in the fiel ds of crystallization and chromatography. Also, the experimental basis has been further impro ved, e.g. a powerful mass spectrometer was recently acquired in cooperation with the BPE g roup (U. Reichl). The acquisition of an X- ray diffractometer is also in progress, in cooperat ion with the PCP group (K. Sundmacher), which will allow us to study, for example, crystal structures and phenomena of polymorphism in more detail. 2.

Physical and Chemical Data required for the An alysis and Design of Separation and Reaction Processes The development and production of new products with improved or previously unknown properties increasingly requires the application of new and more complex technologies. To understand, to quantitatively analyze and to optimi ze the under-lying processes, a large number of physical and chemical data and parameters has to be known. Although there are data banks available and theoretical concepts allow the prediction of certain physical and chemical parameters, their experimental determinati on is of immense importance. This is particularly true for complex molecules currently i solated in large diversity from natural products or synthesized daily by organic chemists. To characterize such molecules and to design processes that involve these molecules, the measurement of numerous 124 thermodynamic and kinetic data is required. Thus, o ne goal of the PCF group is to determine physical and chemical data and parameters that are related to the chemical engineering and bioengineering processes investigated at the MPI. D ue to their importance in the understanding and design of separation and reaction processes there are currently activities to determine the following parameters or functions: Solid-liquid phase equilibria (melting diagrams, so lubilities) Growth rates of crystals Adsorption equilibria Transport rates in porous media (diffusion coeffici ents, permeabilities) Heat capacities and phase transition enthalpies Reaction rates Depending on the specific type of data, there are d ifferent experimental techniques and equipment in use. Besides the application and impro vement of established techniques, the goal is, in particular, to develop new concepts tha t allow the determination of reliable data in less time and with lower requirements concerning th e sample amounts. One project is concerned with the elaboration of a new method allo wing the measurement of the relation between the solubility of a certain substance, the type of solvent and the temperature. The method is based on heating a saturated solution of the substance of interest in a reaction calorimeter, at a sufficiently small heating rate, ensuring the attainment of equilibrium. The thermal effect resulting from the dissolution proce ss is recorded continuously and applied to determine the solubility temperature. In Fig. 51, h eat flow curves measured for different mixtures of a pharmaceutical compound in acetonitri le as solvent are shown. The solubility temperature can be taken from the curve offset (T off ) as indicated. Further development of the calorimetric method for solubility determination wa s directed toward the investigation of the \"solubility curve\" over a broad range of temperatur es from a single calorimetric run to significantly shorten the experimental time effort. The principle is illustrated in Fig. 51 (right), where the measured heat flow is presented together with the derived solubility curve. For comparison, independently obtained solubility data are given. Results covering different chemical systems and an evaluation of the potential of the promising new method are summarized in [1-3].

Right: Determination of the solubility curve from a single experiment (reacti on calorimeter DRC/Setaram, 40 wt% rac. mandelic acid in water, total sample mass 70 g, heating rate 0.5 K/min) [1, 3]. In another project, the growth of crystals in a sol ution was observed using laser optical techniques . Focused beam reflectance measurements (FBRM, Lasent ec \u00ae) were used for inline size determination in particulate systems. T he measurement principle allows the determination of chordlength distribution data, whi ch cannot readily be compared with results from other particle size measurement techniques suc h as microscopic image analysis or laser diffraction. This technique is therefore an o bject of research activities in the field of measuring particle size distributions. Fig. 52 (lef t) shows the application of a FBRM probe in an isothermal crystal growth experiment using mande lic acid in water. Fig. 52 (right) demonstrates results regarding a ca libration of the FBRM. The cube weighted median chordlength was used as an indicato r for the size increase of initially added seed crystals. The expected particle size distribut ion was obtained using parallel microscopic image analysis. The reconstructed particle size dis tribution was extracted from the chordlength distribution data of the same sample us ing a calibrated kernel [4]. The transformation shows good results at particle popul ations > 200 \u00b5m. 126 Fig. 52: Left: Isothermal crystal growth experiment for dete rmination of growth kinetic parameters, time = 0 min: seed crystals of a specific size frac tion are added to a supersaturated solution, FBRM no. of chordlengths counted: confirm s pure growth without nucleation, density measur ements, concentration (inline): acoustically determined. Right: Comparison of expec ted and reconstructed particle size distribution based on FBRM measurements [4]. To understand the chromatographic separation of ena ntiomers it is essential to know the adsorption isotherms that form the driving force fo r the separation process. Since in the process of developing new drugs the amount of pure substances is usually very small, we are trying to develop methods that generate reliabl e data with a minimum amount of sample material. Typical results of applying a perturbatio n method [5,6] are summarized in Fig. 53. In collaboration with the University of Belgrade (Prof . Petkovska) a method was developed which is based on the frequency response analysis o f a fixed-bed filled with the adsorbent. The inlet concentrations are periodically altered b etween two constant levels and the responses are recorded using suitable detectors. Fr om these responses the adsorption isotherms can be extracted [7]. Fig. 53: Left: Determination of isotherm parameters by pertu rbation method. The retention times of small perturbations applied to a column equilibrat ed on different concentration levels can be related to the local derivatives of an isotherm model (centre, inset) [5, 6].

Seidel-Morgenstern 127 Several projects are devoted to quantifying and ana lyzing concentration changes in reacting systems in order to determine and model ra tes of chemical reactions. As an important basis for the project \"Membrane Supported Reaction Engineering\" in cooperation with the PSD group (A. Kienle) the rate of the oxid ative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene was studied experimentally by applying a V O X/-Al2O3-catalyst (1.37 % V, 167 m2/g). By analyzing fixed-bed experiments performed i n a wide temperature and residence time range the reaction network given in Fig. 54 (l eft) was postulated and the individual reaction rates r 1-r5 were quantified [8]. In Fig. 54 (right) experiment al and predicted conversion data for a fixed-bed reactor validating the derived kinetic equations are given [9]. 0 20 40 60 80 100 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 catalyst temperature [\u00b0C] conversion [%] FBR - 6000 FBR - 19000 FBR - 38000 Sim - 6000 Sim - 19000 Sim - 38000 C 2 H 6 C 2 H 4 CO 2 CO r 1 r 3 r 4 r 2 r 5 CO 2 CO r 1 r 3 r 4 r 2 r 5 a) b) C 2 H 6 C 2 H 4 CO 2 CO r 1 r 3 r 4 r 2 r 5 CO 2 CO r 1 r 3 r 4 r 2 r 5 a) b) Fig. 54: Quantified reaction network of the oxidative dehyd rogenation of ethane and predicted (Sim) versus measured conversions in a fi xed-bed reactor (FBR) for several residence times (in s -1) [8, 9]. 4.2. Analysis and Design of Separation and Reaction Processes The PCF group is currently investigating several se paration and reaction processes in detail. A main topic is the development and design of processes capable of isolating and purifying fine chemicals. A particularly difficult task in this area is the separation of enantiomers. These are pairs of molecules which are , like our hands, mirror images of each other. To produce certain drugs, the pharmaceutical industry frequently needs the pure enantiomers. In order to isolate the desired specie s, special crystallization processes, membrane separation and preparative chromatography are investigated. Mandelic acid has been chosen in several projects a s a model system. Studies of the solid liquid equilibira revealed that this acid bel ongs to the compound forming systems, i.e. the racemate cannot be resolved by crystallization procedures alone [10]. However, an asymmetric mixture with an initial enantiomeric com position exceeding the eutectic one, may be used to obtain the enantiomer in excess with hig h purity by applying a suitable 128 crystallization procedure. Fig. 55 shows the ternar y solubility phase diagram determined for the mandelic acid/water system [11,12]. The region that can be used to gain the (+)- enantiomer is indicated by the yellow triangle bord ering on the 60\u00b0C-isotherm. A typical experiment is also presented. An aqueous solution o f mandelic acid with an enantiomeric excess of about 59% of the (+)-species was subjecte d to a cooling crystallization procedure. The separation process was performed in a batch of 2 liters and initiated by seeding. The on- and offline measured process data shown, clearly de scribe the course of the crystallization process.

An attractive alternative to performing conventiona l crystallization in the two phase region is to produce pure enantiomers using crystallizatio n by entrainment in the three phase region. The applicability of the process is restric ted to conglomerate forming enantiomeric systems. The principle of the \"preferential crystal lization\" process is illustrated in Fig. 56. CF Group, A. Seidel-Morgenstern 129 racemate DL & seeds (L-threonine) L-threonine crystals of ABracemate region D-threonine saturated solution + D saturated solution + L + D Tcryst + T saturated solution + L B CADundersaturated solution E Fig. 56: Principle of the preferential crystallization and a possible quasi-continuous operation mode. In equilibrium the liquid phase will have racemic c omposition (point E) and the solid phase will consist of a mixture of crystals of both enant iomers. However, as the system approaches equilibrium under special conditions it is possible to preferentially produce just one of the enantiomers after seeding with homochiral crystals. The process is based on the specific driving forces due to the different supersaturation s and initial surface areas of each enantiomer. The goal of our work is to study the pr eferential crystallization process systematically and to develop a new quasi-continuou s operation mode. In the first experiments, the amino acid threonine was used as a model system. Reliable thermodynamic data (like the metastable zone width and the ternary solubility phase diagrams of threonine in the used solvents) and kno wledge of the temporal concentration changes of the enantiomers during the process are r equired for a successful operation and for a mathematical description of the process. Prel iminary experimental results using a newly developed on-line polarimetry technique in combinat ion with refractometry proved the general applicability of this process [14]. The tec hnique developed enables us to follow the resolution process directly and to recognize the li mit of the region of \"safe\" resolution (Fig. 57). 130 In order to study crystallization processes on a la rger scale, a 20 liter mini-plant unit was set up. Besides performing enantioselective crystal lization processes this unit will also be used by the PSD group (A. Kienle) and the SCT group (J. Raisch) to study issues related to crystallization dynamics and control of particle si ze distributions. Fig. 57: Left: Polarimetric signal for the resolution of bot h enantiomers. Right: Phase diagram for the preferential crystallization process with a n excess of L-threonine at the beginning (point A) [14]. As a powerful alternative to enantioselective cryst allization, simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography is being investigated. This is a per iodically operated multi-column countercurrent process which possesses several inte resting features. In our group we are interested in improving the performance of conventi onal isocratic SMB processes with constant operating parameters. One concept under in vestigation is the introduction of streams with different solvent strength. These grad ient concepts possess the potential to reduce the overall solvent amount required for the separation and to deliver more concentrated product streams [15-17]. In collaborat ion with the PSD group (A. Kienle) a new operation mode was developed which is based on a pe riodic variation of the feed concentration during the shift period. This mode ex ploits the concentration dependence of the migration speeds of concentration fronts in fix ed-beds under nonlinear conditions. Compared to the conventional technology using const ant feed concentrations, a higher productivity can be achieved and the solvent consum ption can be reduced [18-21]. Fig. 58 shows that under the influence of a forced feed con centration variation the concentration fronts in the unit change their position allowing t he operation of the process under different conditions. The task of optimizing these more sophi sticated SMB processes is currently being studied in cooperation with Profs. Tobiska an d Weismantel (Magdeburg University, Faculty of Mathematics) in the framework of a DFG r esearch group. For experimental investigations, a SMB mini-plant unit has been set up at the MPI. CF Group, A. Seidel-Morgenstern 131 Fig. 58: Left: Effect of a non-constant feed concentration o n the internal concentration profiles in a SMB unit. Right: Corresponding change s of the area of possible operation parameters (\"separation region\") [18 - 21 ]. In cooperation with U. Tallarek (OvGU) in recent ye ars, several aspects of chromatographic separation have been investigated: the application of smaller column dimensions (capillaries) to reduce sample amounts a nd time for analysis, monolithic stationary phases to reduce pressure drops, and ele ctric fields to increase separation efficiencies. In all these innovative areas, cooper ations have been established (e. g. with Prof. Marek in Prague and the company E. Merck in D armstadt) and initial experimental and theoretical results have been obtained [22-25]. In cooperation with the BPE group (U. Reichl) the effects of diffusion, electroosmosis and electr ophoresis have been studied using Confocal Laser Microscopy. Fig. 59 illustrates the observed pronounced differences of the concentration profiles of charged and uncharged ana lytes in a porous sphere during desorption under the absence and presence of an ext ernal field [26]. The results demonstrate the large potential of driving the flow in an optimized manner by electric fields and/or pressure. 132 Fig. 59: Distribution of fluorescent molecules in a porous g lass bead during intraparticle transport by diffusion (left) diffusion and electro osmosis (center) and diffusion, electroosmosis and electrophoresis (right) [26]. 4.3. Integration and Combination of several Process es At the MPI, several types of process integration ar e being investigated. This offers the possibility for various cooperations. It is a futur e goal to develop, based on several examples, a more comprehensive and general understanding of s uch processes. One example studied in our group is the combination of reaction and adsorptive separation in a chromatographic reactor. In this ar ea, together with the university group, the reaction rates of several heterogeneously catalyzed hydrolysis reactions are determined based on calorimetric measurements. Complementary, adsorption isotherms on the same catalysts are determined using the methods describe d above. Initial results of studying the combined process prove the necessity of a careful a djustment of the two key process [27]. Another area of interest for us is to apply possibl e techniques for enantioseparation in a coupled manner. An example is illustrated in Fig. 6 0 where continuous SMB chromatography is used first to deliver partially enriched product s [28]. The desired final purity is then achieved through enantioselective crystallization. This arrangement improves the overall performance compared to the exclusive application o f the expensive chromatographic step [29]. 0 50 100 150 200 050100150200050100150200250 0 50 100 15 0200 0 50 100 150 200 255 b) c) uep ueo Dm Intensity (a.u.)

A rac emic feed is partially resolved by SMB-chromatography and then split into the pure enantiomers by subsequent enantioselective crystallization (left). Numerical simulation for a pharmaceutical compound reveal the possibility of substantially in creased productivity of the chromatographic step (right) [28, 29]. A larger research project is devoted to use membran es in reactors. Initially the focus was the selective removal of a certain product through a porous reactor wall [30,31]. Currently, intensive activities are devoted to studying the po ssibility of dosing one or more reactants into the reactor via membranes. These types of memb rane reactors possess the potential to improve the selectivity with which a certain interm ediate product can be obtained. The concept is, in particular, interesting for performi ng partial oxidation reactions or selective hydrogenations. In cooperation with membrane produc ers and the group of Dr. Uchytil (Prague) the mass transfer properties of various po rous ceramic composite membranes have been studied and quantified [32]. Important questions that need to be answered in ord er to develop and evaluate the membrane reactor concept are currently being invest igated in several groups at the MPI in close cooperation with several groups at the Otto v on Guericke University and funded by the German Research Foundation (Forschergruppe \"Membran unterst\u00fctzte Reaktionsf\u00fchrung\"). Joint issues that are studied experimentally and th eoretically are, for example, heat transfer and cooling problems, mathematical problems related to a proper formulation of boundary conditions at porous walls, and the comparison of f ixed-bed and fluidized-bed reactors. In the PCF group in particular the application of a series connection of several fixed-bed reactor segments is being analyzed. Based on the de termination of the reaction rates for the switching Feed (c 1=c 2)Eluent c1 > c 2 c1 < c 2 enantiomer 1Eluent enrichment (c 1=c < c 2 enantiomer 1Eluent enrichment (c 1=c < c 2 enantiomer 1Eluent oxidation on supported VO x catalysts and a developed mathematical model for t his type of reactor, optimal dosing profiles were calcu lated. The results obtained deliver some generally applicable rules for a successful reactor operation. The applicability of the reactor concept has also already been proven experimentally [33]. Typical results of experiments carried out in a one stage membrane reactor (PBMR) and in a fixed-bed reactor (FBR) are shown in Fig.61. The oxygen dosing in the PBMR led to significant improvements in the ethylene selectivity in comparison to the FBR opera tion where all reactants were fed together at the reactor inlet. In cooperation with Prof. Pus hpavanam (IIT Madras) it was further shown theoretically that besides adjusting local oxygen c oncentrations also the residence time behavior of the different reactants has to be caref ully analyzed [34]. Fully optimised, the reactor concept is capable of delivering highly fav orable selectivity-conversion characteristics (Fig. 61 b) [35]. Fig. 61: a) Experimental setup of a packed bed membrane re actor (PBMR), b) Performance of fixed bed reactor (FBR) and PBMR [33, 35]. At the MPI there is intensive cooperation within th e membrane reactor project with the PCP group (K. Sundmacher) which is studying electro chemical membrane reactors and the PSD group (A. Kienle) which is studying reaction ki netics and developing modular models for various types of membrane reactors. Mem brane N M em brane 2 M xygen .

Reichl Group: Bioprocess Engineering (BPE) Prof. Dr.-Ing. Udo Reichl This report covers the period between July 1999 and April 2003. 142 1. BPE Group Introduction The activities of the BPE Group began in Summer 200 0 with the appointment of U. Reichl as Director and Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society. Until September 2001 laboratories in the Zenit building (Magdeburg) were shared with researchers of the newly established Chair of Bioprocessing at the OvGU. The focus during this period of time was to structure and organize research activities, select and order laboratory equipment such as bioreactors, cell cultivation systems, instruments for on- and off-line analysis, and coordinate the prerequisites for safety levels S1/S2 with loca l authorities. The main emphasis was on the establishment of animal cell culture technology and virology, set-up of first experiments in microcarrier cultures at 4 to 20 L working volume, downstream processing e.g., crossflow- filtration or chromatography, and method validation . In parallel, several course lectures, special lectures, laboratory courses and seminars a t the Faculty for Process and Systems Engineering in Magdeburg were prepared. Due to the restrictions in laboratory (50 m 2) and office capacity, the number of scientists (2) and n on-scientific staff (4) increased slowly and totaled 6 employees in September 2001. With the completion of the new Institute building i n September 2001, the spatial conditions improved significantly. Today the BPE Group shares about 400 m2 of laboratory space at safety levels S1 and S2 with the SBI Group. An addi tional 100 m 2 of S2 laboratories are available for research of the Chair of Bioprocessin g. Start-up in the new laboratories took only a few weeks and the first experiments with ani mal cell cultures and viruses started in November 2001. Since then we have realized a major expansion of our experimental and analytical methods for studying animal cell culture processes in detail. The main focus is on the analysis of growth of adherent cells (primary a nd transformed cell lines) in various static systems and bioreactors up to 20 L, detailed studie s of virus replication in animal cell culture for vaccine production, microscopical investigation s of viral infections in single cells and cell populations, mathematical modeling of relevant aspe cts of the bioprocesses at the bioreactor and the cellular level, and optimization of downstr eam processing methods, in particular preparative chromatography.

Optimization and Scale-up of Bioprocesses: Inf luenza Vaccine Production in Microcarrier Systems Using animal cells in biotechnology requires detail ed research to find the right cell for each specific product and process. One can select betwee n primary or transformed cells growing in suspension or on surfaces. After opting for one cell line, cultivation methods (Fig. 63), process conditions and parameters as well as downst ream processing methods have to be selected and optimized. Decision criteria for optim ization strategies are mostly quantitative data on different aspects of the process in questio n. Based on a detailed understanding of the biological mechanisms of cell growth and produc t formation, together with mathematical models of all relevant steps of a bioprocess, an in crease in product yield and purity should be achieved. As an example we have started to implemen t this for a process of equine influenza vaccine production that was previously set up accor ding to an industrial production scheme. Fig. 63: Two possibilities for controlled cultivation using microcarrier systems in our lab (5 L bioreactor (B. Braun Biotech, Melsungen, Germany) a nd 6 parallel reactors of 0.5 L (Infors, Basel, Switzerland). In this case, the host for the influenza virus is a n adherent Madin Darby Canine Kidney cell (MDCK), which prefers serum addition during gr owth, whereas during virus infection, a serum-free medium should be used [1,2]. Dealing wit h cells growing on a surface in bioreactors, requires the use of microcarriers for scale-up and a short exponential growth phase followed by contact inhibited growth until co nfluency. At this point the process is stopped to wash the cells and to remove serum const ituents that interfere with virus infection. 150 Fresh serum-free medium is added together with viru s-seed and the process is continued. The end of the virus production is the release of v iruses, apoptosis and cell breakage. Using this process, we have set up and validated st andard on-line analytics as well as numerous off-line analytical methods (Fig. 64, Fig. 65). In view of using these data for mathematical modeling, we selected new methods that need little sample preparation and are easy to standardize. Monitoring and control is done by PCS7 software (Siemens, Karlsruhe, Germany). As an example for a typical cu ltivation, the uptake and release of the two major cellular carbon and energy sources, gluco se and glutamine, as well as the corresponding metabolites lactate and ammonia are s hown in Fig. 64. Different immunological assays are used for the determination of virus yield (HA, TCID 50 , PFU). The cells are counted and the concentrations of most am ino acids in the medium are determined (Fig. 65). Additional information like osmolality o f the medium as well as phosphate, protein and pyruvate concentrations are collected for speci fic questions.

These detailed data allow us then, to develop strat egies to improve productivity and yield for such a process acting on different levels by: optimization of medium composition (glucose, glutam ine, amino acids, growth factors, salts, vitamins, etc.) for cell growth and virus re plication reduction of inhibitor concentration (lactate, ammo nia) finding optimal carrier and cell densities definition of infection strategies (time point of i nfection, multiplicity of infection) determination of process parameters (aeration, stir ring, temperature, etc.) comparison of different cultivation methods (roller bottles, microcarriers, suspension, perfusion, wave bioreactors\u00ae, etc.) investigation of scale-up possibilities development of monitoring and control strategies (f eeding, perfusion, etc.) 4.2. Quantitative Analysis of Metabolic and Regulat ory Networks of Cellular Systems: Microscopical Analysis In viral vaccine production a single mammalian host cell (MDCK) is the smallest production unit.

Growth of MDCK Cells on Microcarriers and in Static Systems MDCK-cells grow as monolayers on surfaces and are g rowth limited by contact inhibition. To better understand the growth dynamics in differe nt culture systems and to support mathematical modeling of cellular growth, we quanti tatively characterize the growth behavior and describe cellular morphology on the surface of microcarriers both in the bioreactor systems and in static cultures such as T-flasks and roller bottles (Fig. 66). Fig. 66: left: Trypsinated MDCK cells in suspension, (Sytox orange nucleic stain); middle: MDCK of a cult ure flask; right: MDCK cells on a microcarrier, sample from a stirred 5 L bioreactor. 4.2.2. Cell Cultivation Monitored under the Microsc ope In addition to the examination of bioreactor or cul ture bottle samples, it is inter-resting to study the development of host cells under controlle d growth conditions directly under the microscope. An inverted microscope equipped with a video camera coupled to an image processing system and an incubator allows us to cul tivate cells with controlled atmospheric CO 2, temperature and medium (Fig. 67). Depending on th e culture chambers used, several batch and perfusion cultivation strategies are poss ible. Fig. 67: left: Cultivation equipment for microscopic visualization ; middle: MDCK cells grow on the culture chamber surface as monolayer (DIC); right: MDCK cells 24 h after infection with influenza virus (DIC). BPE Group, U. Reichl 153 4.2.3. Virus Replication in Microcarrier Culture Typically, qualitative aspects (e.g. virus attachme nt mechanism, molecular biology and general timing of events) are well established to d escribe influenza virus replication in host cells. To support our modeling activities, quantita tive information on replication dynamics is required. Therefore, we will extend our investigati ons of the interactions between influenza virus and host cells which will allow us to follow the time course of virus development in different cellular compartments (GFP-mutants, endoc ytosis, transcription of the viral genome, expression of virus proteins) and the cell specific response to viral infections (apoptosis, flow cytometry). Fig. 68: MDCK cells on microcarrier, time course of influen za infection and development, cells stained with poyclonal anti-influenza antiserum and Alexa 4 88 (Molecular probes); left: 5 h after infection; middle: 10 h after infection; right: 22 h after infection. Taking bioreactor samples at regular intervals afte r infection allows us to get information about the real infection dynamics and the infectivi ty of the virus in populations of cells (Fig. 68). Samples were stained immunologically and analy zed with a confocal laser scanning microscope [3]. The results were compared with othe r data obtained during the production process e.g. from hemagglutination (HA) and infecti vity assays (Fig. 69). Furthermore, we are trying to develop a reliable virus quantificati on assay based on the agglutination activity of the influenza HA protein. In collaboration with the electron microscopy group at the Robert Koch Institute Berlin (Dr. M. \u00d6zel) we are investig ating several microscopical methods to differentiate between virus particle numbers and vi rus infectivity. 154 Fig. 69: left: Time course of virus infection in microcarri er culture (4.5 L wv) analyzed by HA (- TCID50 of Cellular Systems: Inf luenza Virus Replication in MDCK Cells Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in analy zing and understanding bioprocesses. Even in most of the well-established animal cell cu lture systems there is much to be learned about the dynamics of cell growth, kinetics of prod uct formation, stoichiometry of cellular metabolism and the complex interaction between obse rved state variables in a bioreactor under study. Combined with results from extensive e xperimental investigations at the cellular and bioprocess levels, adequate mathematical models not only allow the detailed analysis of the system under investigation, but also the design of optimization strategies. At present, our work focuses on the dynamics of vir us replication in single cells and populations of cells. The aim is to reveal basic la ws that control the replication of viruses in animal cells, to investigate the interaction of vir uses with their host in bioprocesses and to use this knowledge to optimize vaccine production p rocesses. The simplest models of virus dynamics can be formulated by applying either struc tured or unstructured approaches [4]. An unstructured model does not consider intracellular phenomena. In the case of the virus infection cycle, a system of three differential equ ations describe how the numbers of uninfected cells, infected cells and free virus par ticles change over time. In a structured model, different state variables are used to model virus replication in different cellular compartments such as membrane, endosome, cytosol or nucleus. Based on genetic and molecular mechanistic data, rate equations are expr essed for viral transcription, translation, protein expression and for reactions catalyzed by v irus-encoded enzymes. As a model system we focus on the replication of in fluenza virus in adherent MDCK cells. 0,00E+00 1,00E+06 2,00E+06 3,00E+06 U. Reichl 155 Mathematical models for influenza virus infection o f animal cells take only the first steps of infection, virus binding and endocytosis, into acco unt. No model has been formulated which describes the entire infection cycle and the overal l growth dynamics. Our model considers the individual steps of the process such as attachm ent, internalization, genome replication and translation, and progeny virion assembly (Fig. 70). Based on this model and a set of initial conditions, it is possible to predict the s ystem's behavior at any moment in time, to analyze its sensitivity with respect to parameter c hanges, to identify possible targets for molecular engineering or to develop strategies for improving yields in vaccine production. Furthermore, detailed insight into the interactions of viruses and host cells might help to improve our understanding of virus-related diseases and to develop therapies. Fig. 70: Influenza A - virus replication. In the model, an average cell surrounded by a small quantity of medium and infected by a certain number of virus particles is considered. We assume that each virus participates in only one replication cycle - the progeny virus part icles released do not reinfect the cell. The model is represented by a system of 39 nonlinear or dinary differential equations which are solved numerically by means of algorithms provided by ProMoT/DIVA, a software package developed by the SBI and PSD Group in our institute to build structured dynamic simulation models. 156 The model reveals the factors that limit the growth rate of progeny virus and its release. The viral genome is stored in the virion as viral r ibonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. When a new vRNP complex is being formed in the nucleus it binds to M1 protein - a matrix protein which stabilizes the viral membrane. Among all prot eins making up a virus particle, this is the most abundant and simulations show that the total a mount of M1 limits virus replication (Fig. 71 left). Other newly synthesized viral proteins (n ucleoprotein NP, viral polymerases) and viral RNAs are also incorporated into vRNP complexe s, but accumulate in the nucleus and their numbers increase linearly with time. A simila r situation takes place in the budding stage, when newly synthesized vRNPs represent a limiting f actor. Simulations also help to understand factors require d for the optimization of the overall growth rate of influenza virus. One attractive idea to obtain more progeny virus particles is speeding up transcription of viral RNAs by improvin g viral polymerase activity or translation efficiency at cellular ribosomes. Fig. 71 right sho ws that increasing the transcription rate by a factor of two results in an increase in the number of released virons of slightly more than 100% after 12 h. The model allows us to estimate the cellular resour ces consumed by virus replication. Simulation results show that the number of cellular surface receptors and endosomes as well as other resources such as the number of free nucle otides or amino acids are not significantly influenced by influenza virus propaga tion. Fig. 71: left: Viral components in the nucleus. M1 protein (() is limiting at the stage of vRNP formation, whereas viral capsid proteins and vRNA accumulate i n the nucleus, e.g. nucleo protein NP (--- ); right: Number of virions released from the cell with increase of polymerase transcription rate by factors of 1.0 ((), 1.5 ((((() and 2.0 (---). Our further activities focus on obtaining kinetic i nformation on basic replication steps for parameter estimation and model validation. Using di fferent methods of microscopical BPE Group, U. Reichl 157 analysis of virus infection (see 4.2) we want to qu antify several rate coefficients, overall dynamics and cellular events such as the switch fro m viral protein production to RNA genome replication or cellular defense mechanisms. Furthermore, work is in progress to better characterize changes in cellular metabolism during viral infection by means of metabolic flux analysis using tools developed by SB I Group and the use of flow cytometry to investigate cell-virus interactions during cultivat ions in New Matrices and Ligands for Affinity Chromatography For the production of pharmaceuticals using microor ganisms or cell cultures, product purification (downstream processing), next to the a ctual biosynthesis, is often the most expensive and time-consuming step. Based on the phy sical and bio/chemical properties of the desired product and contaminating molecules in the cultivation broth, a broad range of separation methods can be applied (Fig.72). For mos t applications, chromatographic methods are the key steps during the processing of bioactive components. Among these are classical gelfiltration, ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction and affinity chromatography which are operated in a packed or fixed bed mode. Fig. 72: Overview on downstream processing methods. We have chosen the influenza virus as an example fo r optimizing downstream processing methods in vaccine production. So far, the commerci al production of inactivated human influenza vaccines relies on the cultivation of the virus in embryonated hen's eggs. In a next step, filtration followed by continuous centrifugat ion of the allantoic fluid is used to purify viral Accumulation of products in cells Release through cell disruption Excreted products Cell -Chromatography Product Polishing, Formulation High-resolution techniques 158 antigens. However, to overcome limitations in produ ction and to improve existing influenza vaccines, many companies are currently establishing animal cell culture based upstream processes. With the additional need to further redu ce possible negative side effects on humans or animals such as allergic or autoimmune re actions, new downstream processing schemes also have to be developed. In a recently es tablished industrial process [2] virus particles are clarified with a combination of depth filters, inactivated with binary ethyleneimine (BEI), concentrated by ultra filtration (UF, 20-50 fold, 100 kDa MW cut off) and subsequently purified on a gel filtration column (Sepharose CL-2 B). While this process is robust enough for industrial applications, recovery and purity of the final product as well as overall process economics could probably be improved considerably b y optimizing individual steps. As an example, effluent concentration profiles of the two virus membrane proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from a gel filtration c olumn are shown in Fig. 73. Fig. 73: Elution profile of HA, NA and protein of equine in fluenza virus from gel filtration chromatography. V and Vc are the effluent and column volume, respectively. The overall yield of the process for HA is only 38% while NA remains at its activity level during purification. Contaminating protein is reduc ed by more than 95%. Chromatography plots show a broad HA peak and sharp NA as well as protein peaks. This is either related to the release of single HA molecules or HA bound to c ellular membranes during virus replication or it indicates the destruction of inta ct viruses due to the high shear stress 2,0 U. Reichl 159 involved in UF. Experimental work is in progress to further characterize individual processing steps and develop methods to analyze virus size dis tributions. Besides detailed investigations on how to improve the performance of existing technologies, we also focus on the development of Expanded Bed Affinity Chromatogr aphy (EBAC) to purify virus particles and viral antigens. At present we are investigating the use of several base matrices [5] and ligands (e.g. polyclonals, lectins) required for th e specific purification of whole virions or viral surface membrane proteins based of specificity. Fur thermore, matrix properties, kinetics of binding, ligand-virus and non-specific interactions as well as elution characteristics, recovery and purity of the harvests are characterized in det ail (Fig. 74). Fig. 74: Breakthrough curve of inactivated equine influenza virus showing HA and NA activities from affinity hromatography in a packed bed. V and C den ote volume and concentration of the effluent where as C 0 and V C are the feed concentration and column volume, resp ectively. The experimental work will be supported by mathemat ical modeling of relevant aspects of the process to optimize EBAC on a preparative scale . Additionally, the physical and chemical parameters involved in this adsorption process will be evaluated in collaboration with PCF Group. Eventually, this information will not only a llow us to develop an EBAC for virus purification but also to compare different downstre am processing methods and to evaluate recovery, purity and process efficiency for various options. 0 30 60 90 120 0123 NA (U/mL) HA HA (log units) Volume (mL) 0369 NA 160 5.

SBI Group Introduction Research in modern molecular biology is mainly desc riptive and qualitative. It is focused on the understanding of molecular details. Thus, it concentrates on the study of single components such as genes and proteins and on the in dividual interactions between these molecules. However, the analysis of the overall hol istic behavior determined by the interactions of a high number of cellular component s has been paid little attention in the past. To understand the complex structure and behavior of metabolism, signal-transduction and regulation requires an overall holistic analysis. D ue to the multitude of interacting components, an understanding of these processes jus t by reflection is not possible. Here, the aid of mathematical modeling is absolutely esse ntial to combine the available biological knowledge with a system-theoretical way of thinking . In combination with recent results in developing new measurement technologies of intracel lular components, the system- theoretical approach opens the way to a quantitativ e description of cellular systems. As an emerging field of interdisciplinary research, Systems Biology is based on a system- theoretical approach. It studies the interplay of a ll interacting components that are relevant for a specific cellular system. From an abstract po int of view, Systems Biology aims at transforming structural and topological characteris tics of a cellular system into functional dynamics. It can be expected that this approach wil l allow better and faster solutions to medical and biotechnological problems. Research in Systems Biology will only succeed if in terdisciplinary cooperation between biologists, engineers and computer scientists is es tablished. Above all, model analysis must be linked very closely to experimental studies. In experiments, a systematic stimulation of a biological system can be achieved by quantitative c hanges in the experimental conditions (substrate, composition, temperature, etc.) or by c onstructing well-defined isogenic mutant strains. To analyze a systems response, parallel me asurements of the transcriptom, the proteom and the metabolom must be taken distributed over time. These measurements can then be used to validate the model structure and to identify the model parameters. Model based experimental design as well as formulation an d testing of hypotheses will allow a very strong interlocking of theory and experiments. Rese arch in the field of Systems Biology requires powerful computing tools for modeling and simulation as well as for system analysis and system design. The Systems Biology group at the MPI started its re search activities in June 1998, continuing a longstanding cooperation on catabolite repression in Escherichia coli with the group of Prof. Lengeler, University of Osnabr\u00fcck. T his cooperation was initiated several years ago at the University of Stuttgart and then t ransferred to Magdeburg in 1998. SBI Group, E. D. Gilles 165 The activities in developing a very general tool (P roMoT) to set up mathematical models for cellular functional units were also transferred from Stuttgart to Magdeburg in 1998. This tool is based on a modular modeling concept reflect ing the natural modular structure of biological systems. It is important to stress that the modeling concept underlying ProMoT assigns elementary modeling objects to elementary c ellular components. This assignment guarantees a high level of biological transparency and facilitates the interdisciplinary cooperation between biology and systems engineering . It also encourages the acceptance of mathematical modeling in biology because it allows scientists to perform virtual experiments on computers that are analogous to experiments in a real biological laboratory. After starting research work in Magdeburg, the Syst ems Biology group has continuously extended its activities by taking up studies on a n umber of additional aspects of metabolic regulation and signal-transduction including both p rokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Although the research group itself is composed of r esearchers from different disciplines, all activities are based on a close cooperation with ex ternal biological groups, with the main focus of their work on the specific research area o f cooperation. The group has built up a well-equipped fermentation laboratory to perform ex periments with isogenic mutant strains of E. coli and other microorganisms. The quantitative determi nation of important parameters, such as metabolite concentrations in fermentation e xperiments is a major task for the set up and validation of the mathematical model. Here, exp erimental methods for sampling, sample preparation and sample analysis are being developed through the combined effort of the research groups SBI and BPE (Prof. Reichl). The fun ctional units under investigation are mainly focused on global control and signal-transdu ction systems. Examples of functional units in prokaryotes are: ca tabolite repression, general stress response and two components signal-transduction in E. coli, redox control in Rhodospirillum rubrum and phototaxis in Halobacteria. The EGF induced MA P kinase cascade and the TNF induced apoptosis in mammalian cells as well as cel l cycle regulation in yeast are examples of signal-transduction units in eukaryotic cells un der investigation. Together with the PSD group of Prof. Kienle, the modeling and simulation environment ProMoT/Diva is being developed and adapted for cellular systems. The mod els set up by the Systems Biology group are rather large. With the group of Prof. Flo ckerzi (MF), new strategies to structure and to reduce the models are under investigation. S everal methods for experimental design are also being analyzed together with Prof. Raisch (SCT) and Prof. Doyle (UC, Santa Barbara, USA). 166 2.

Bacterial Signal-Transduction and Regulation 4.1.1. Introduction and Objectives Bacteria have to face drastic changes in their surr oundings. To cope with these changes they have to respond and adapt quickly. Adaptation requires the ability to sense signals, to process them and to respond in an appropriate way. Sensors for external stimuli are often membrane proteins like the methyl chemotaxis protei ns that mediate chemo- and phototaxis. Often one or more sensor proteins are linked to a s ingle signal-transduction system that then allocates the information from these sensors to the various regulatory systems. The bacterial phosphotransferase system can be seen in such a way . It integrates information from a number of sensors specific for a certain carbohydra te but it also integrates information about the internal state of the cell by measuring the con centrations of the metabolites PEP and pyruvate. Facultative photosynthetic bacteria like Rhodospirillum rubrum integrate different environmental stimuli such as the availability of O 2 and light apparently by sensing the redox state of electron transfer chain components to cont rol photosynthetic and respiratory gene expression. In most cases the response is the activation or ina ctivation of a transcriptional regulator that controls a defined set of genes, but there are also other responses like regulation of flagellar movement. A certain signal will only affe ct one or a small group of regulators and thereby a defined number of genes. According to the number and specificity of genes, affected regulations can be designated as specific or global. Because of the complex SBI Group, E. D. Gilles 173 interactions of bacterial signal-transduction syste ms with each other and with central metabolic pathways, these systems are impossible to interpret intuitively. Understanding these systems and cellular behavior requires the co mbination of biological methods that analyze molecular mechanisms of signal perception a nd transduction with powerful mathematical and system theoretical methods that al low the analysis of complex systems even in a quantitative manner. For the setup of mat hematical models, different strategies can be pursued starting either with basic analysis of t he metabolic network or with a detailed reproduction of existing knowledge. 4.1.2. Redox Control in Photosynthetic Bacteria This project uses the strategy of basic analysis of network capabilities. The facultative phototrophic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum offers unique opportunities to study redox control of gene expression and membrane differentia tion in prokaryotes. The biosynthesis of intracytoplasmic photosynthetic membranes (PM) is h ierarchically dependent on different environmental stimuli, such as O 2, light and C-source. There is evidence that these stimuli affect gene expression via a signal-transduction sy stem that uses the redox state of the respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport c hain components (ubiquinone, cytochromes, cytochrome oxidases) as molecular sign als (Fig. 76). Fig. 76: Electron transport chain components of H20 reduced hNADH- dehydrogenase 174 We study the formation of PM in bioreactor cultures under aerobic, semi-aerobic and anaerobic photosynthetic conditions. To adjust semi -aerobic growth, a unique process control strategy was developed that uses the pH of the culture to adjust the dissolved oxygen to values below 0.5%. A metabolic profile of the ce ntral carbon metabolism of these cultures was obtained by the determination of key enzyme act ivities. This information was then used to perform metabolic flux and pathway analysis of t he redox metabolism of R. rubrum [1]. Under semi-aerobic conditions, succinate and fructo se were utilized simultaneously, but not by diauxic growth, with succinate being regenerated by reactions of the reductive TCA-cycle. Fructose was utilized solely via the EMP-pathway. H igh pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase activities were found to be spe cific to the semi-aerobic state. The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway does not contri bute to fructose breakdown, as no glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity could be detected under any condition. We demonstrated that, under oxygen-limited conditions, NADPH is supplied mainly by the pyridin-nucleotide transhydrogenase. We also confir med that the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes are present at significant levels during se mi-aerobic growth, albeit at lower levels than under fully aerobic growth. We showed that dur ing photosynthetic growth on distinct substrates the net CO 2 fixation and maximal biomass yield is a global stoichiometri c constraint despite a large degree of freedom in the network [2]. Furthermore, the phenomenon that the Calvin cycle for CO 2 fixation is needed as a redox sink, even in the case where a net CO 2 release occurs, could be predicted correctly. A dy namic model of the electron transport chain was developed which allows the testing of different hypotheses for redox-mediated regulation by simulating the redox s tate of electron carriers. The simulations show that: (i) there is strong coupling between red ox states of ubiquinone and NAD/NADH and (ii) ubiquinone is more reduced under low-light conditions than under high-light conditions. We hypothesize that the redox state of ubiquinone controls PM formation in addition to other signals and that semi-aerobic gro wth with succinate/fructose as C-sources affects the ubiquinone pool in a way essentially id entical to light signaling, thus yielding maximal expression of PM in the dark [1]. 4.1.3. Mathematical Modeling of Catabolite Repressi on in E. Coli Another strategy was applied in the project \"Mathem atical Modeling of Catabolite Repression in E. coli.\" In this project, it was possible to start with a quite detailed model describing molecular interactions because many phys iological and molecular details were already available. The term catabolite repression d escribes the phenomenon that some carbohydrates are able to repress the uptake of oth er carbohydrates. This effect is most pronounced in the presence of glucose. The system t hat is responsible for most effects is the SBI Group, E. D. Gilles 175 bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotran sferase system (PTS). The PTS represents a group translocation system that mediat es uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of a number of carbohydrates. It co nsists of the sugar specific enzymes and the general components EI and HPr. A special task i s assigned to EIIA Crr . Although this protein can be considered to be a protein specific for the Glc-PTS, it is coded within the pts - operon together with the genes for EI and HPr. If E IIA Crr is in its phosphorylated state, indicating no PTS mediated transport, it activates the adenylate cyclase. This enzyme produces cAMP that acts in a complex with Crp as a transcriptional activator for all genes subject to catabolite repression. In addition to th e regulation by cAMP.Crp, these genes are also subject to specific regulation. If EIIA Crr is in its unphosphorylated state, indicating uptak e of glucose or another PTS substrate, it is able to complex with certain permeases or catabolic enzymes thereby inactivating them. The model that was set up describes the reactions o f the PTS, the uptake of the PTS substrates glucose and sucrose, and the uptake and metabolism of lactose, a non-PTS substrate, whose uptake and metabolism is repressed by glucose according to the two mechanisms described above. Glycolysis and drains i nto monomer synthesis are described in a simplified form. The regulation of gene expres sion and the control of enzymatic activities are also considered. To reduce the model, the hiera rchy of transcriptional regulation with the sigma factor of RNA polymerase representing the top level, cAMP.Crp the medium level and the specific regulators the lowest level of the hie rarchical organization was implemented in such a way that signals are transduced from the top to the bottom only [3]. The model was set up with data and parameters from literature and predictions were compared with measurements. To get these measurements that allow for parameter estimation with system level methods, a set of experiments was performed with the wild-type strain, which was grown under varying but well-defined experimental c onditions. Because these data allowed only a small subset of the parameters of the model to be estimated, the experiments were complemented by the construction and analysis of a set of isogenic mutants and the establishment of further measurements that allowed measuring intracellular variables like the phosphorylation state of EIIA Crr . These experiments allowed the estimation of more parameters, which enabled a good reproduction of me asurements by the model. But the model still deviated from reality. These deviations were analyzed and demanded the consideration of additional regulations or alternat ive metabolic pathways in the model. Some of these regulations had not been described previou sly, like the existence of a specific regulator for the gene for EIIBC Glc which was characterized a few months later. Other effects had not been recognized before. It was known that l actose, a non-PTS substrate, is able to provoke some catabolite repression. Our experiments showed a substantial dephosphorylation of EIIA Crr during growth with lactose and the time course of this 176 phosphorylation state during diauxic growth. We ass ume that glucose produced intracellular from lactose is phosphorylated by the PTS. This rea ction was previously ascribed to glucokinase but the characterization of strains mut ated in glucokinase showed that this enzyme is not essential for lactose metabolism [4]. As the PTS is central to the model, it is obvious t hat kinetic parameters of the phosphotransfer reactions and of the central metabo lism are important for system behavior. To analyze these parameters, other types of experim ents had to be conducted. Fermentations with limiting amounts of PTS substrat es were carried out and the equilibrium was disrupted by pulses. In another type of continu ous experiment, the concentration of carbohydrates was varied from saturating to limitin g amounts. These experiments showed the relationship between extra- cellular carbohydra te concentration and the PTS phosphorylation state. Measurements of glycolysis i ntermediates and the phosphorylation state of EIIA Crr in pulse experiments allowed the modeling and vali dation of the dynamic response of the PTS and the central metabolism. The analyses showed that there are defined time hierarchies in the system [5]. The current model that was extended to describe gro wth with additional carbohydrates comprises 85 ODEs and uses about 300 kinetic parame ters. Smaller sub-models exist, that allow more detailed analysis, e.g., of the PTS reac tions. In the future the validated model will be used to discriminate between alternative hypothe ses and it will be subjected to system level analysis. 4.2. Modeling Tool and Concept 4.2.1. Introduction and Objectives Research in the field of systems biology requires p owerful computing tools for modeling, simulation, system analysis and synthesis. The tool s developed are based on a general modeling framework that was introduced for chemical process engineering and is now being adapted for biological systems. The developed softw are tools were applied to different subprojects of the Systems Biology Group. Further a pplications will include modeling of virus dynamics in cooperation with the BPE group (Prof. R eichl). The overall aim is to provide a framework for model ing cellular systems that will serve as a basis for software tools that support model setup a nd model analysis. ProMoT provides a large library with sub-models for the description o f all cellular processes. The simulation environment DIVA allows simulation as well as param eter analysis, parameter estimation and bifurcation analysis. SBI Group, E. D. Gilles 177 4.2.2. Modular Modeling Concept The modeling concept is based on the analysis of th e available knowledge on metabolism, signal-transduction, and cellular control and the c ombination of these with system-theoretical methods. The modeling procedure thus has to be base d on the molecular structure of the functional units in such a way that a cellular unit is represented by an equivalent mathematical sub-model. This modular approach is a new feature in the mathematical modeling procedure and guarantees a high transparen cy for biologists and engineers. The basis of the framework is the definition of a c omplete but finite set of elementary modeling objects (Fig. 77). They should be disjunct with respect to the biological knowledge they comprise to prevent overlapping. The modeling process proceeds along two coordinates: a structural and a behavioral coordina te. The structural coordinate represents a progressive combination and linkage of elementary m odeling objects to higher aggregated model structures. Higher aggregated model structure s are called \"functional units.\" Modeling along the behavioral coordinate means that equation s have to be assigned to each of the elementary modeling objects. Fig. 77: Overview elementary modeling objects. 178 Functional units are defined according to three bio logically motivated criteria. A common physiological task. All elements of a func tional unit contribute to the same physiological task. Easily recognizable exampl es are the specific catabolic pathways for individual carbohydrates, or the biosy nthetic the different amino acids, nucleotides and cofactors fr om their precursors. Common genetic units. The genes for all enzymes of a functional unit are organized in genetical units and in a hierarchical structure. These are at the lowest level the operons and regulons. A regulon is a grou p of operons that is controlled by a specific regulator. Regulons are typical for m ore complex metabolic pathways that contain too many genes (enzymes) for one opero n, or contain genes (enzymes) expressed in different amounts or under d ifferent conditions. More important for our considerations are, however, gene tic units at a higher hierarchical level, in particular, modulons. These are groups of operons and regulons, which are controlled by global regulators that respond to more general physiological states. Control by these global regulators is epist atic, i.e., superimposed and dominant over the specific control systems mentione d before. A common signal-transduction network. All elements of a functional unit are interconnected within a common signal-transduction system. The signal flow over the unit border (\"cross-talk\" or \"cross-regulation\" ) is small compared to the information exchange within the unit, such that the coordinated response to a common stimulus (\"stimulon\") helps to identify the members of a unit [6]. How modules should be delimited from a theoretical point of view is still an open question. However, decomposing a network as far as possible into units with non- retroactive signal transfer is desirable since this allows a straightforward analysis by means of system-theoretical tools. In the projec t, a number of signal- transduction pathways - from a \"simple\" two-compone nt system in E. coli up to the complex mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) - a re analyzed with respect to their role in physiology, their dynamics, and their interaction with other signal- transduction units. Once modules are found, they ca n be systematically analyzed and classified, creating a library of units that co uld be reused. This will simplify the set-up of models, since many parts of signal networ ks, e.g. the MAPK cascade, are found in several signal-transduction pathways. his research is done in close cooperation with Prof. Flockerzi. His MF group also gives us continuous support in model reduction techniques and the analysis of stru ctural properties of biochemical networks. SBI Group, E. D. Gilles 179 4.2.3. Modeling and Simulation Tool ProMoT/Diva for Biological Systems Modular models are implemented in the equation-base d and object-oriented modeling tool ProMoT [7] that is being developed and maintained t ogether with the group of Prof. Kienle (PSD). ProMoT supports the development of modules a s classes in an object-oriented inheritance hierarchy. This concept from computer s cience is especially used to build extensible libraries of reusable modules. ProMoT is therefore used by a number of research groups at the MPI for biological models as well as for models used in chemical engineering. Models in ProMoT can be developed graphically, as a flow-chart of connected modules within a graphical user interface (GUI), or using a modeling language (Fig.78). Fig. 78: Structure of ProMoT. The tool supports model development and debugging t hrough different views of model structures and with algorithms for handling the res ulting differential-algebraic equation system. With these algorithms, the equations can be checked for structural consistency and are optimized symbolically to achieve good simulati on performance. The resulting models are computed as compiled subroutines in the simulat ion environment DIVA, which allows for the efficient numerical solution of large-scale sys tems. A collaboration with the PCF group (Prof. Seidel-Mo rgenstern) focuses on establishing new methods of parameter estimation in DIVA, employ ing mathematical models both from chemical engineering and systems biology. 180 4.3. Control of Cell Proliferation in Eukaryotes 4.3.1. Introduction and Objectives Cells continually sense their surrounding environme nt and make decisions based on the information received via nutrients, growth factors, hormones and/or chemokines. These extracellular signals are transmitted into the nucl eus, inducing gene expression, thus controlling essential cellular processes such as ce ll proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis (programmed cell death). Since it is related to bas ic properties of the cell, defective signal processing is responsible for a variety of diseases , for instance, cancer and diabetes. One essential response governed by signal-transduct ion is cell proliferation. The division cycle of eukaryotic cells is divided into discrete phases: mass growth (G1 phase), replication of the genetic material (S phase) and finally chrom osome separation, chromosome distribution and cytokinesis (G2/M phase). This seq uence is controlled by \"checkpoints\", ensuring that each cell cycle phase is initiated on ly after successful completion of the preceding phase. Cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) - forming distinct kinase complexes with phase-specific cyclins to provide different functio nality - are at the heart of cell cycle control. Both signal-transduction and regulation of cell pro liferation are too complex to be understood intuitively. In signal-transduction, the high number of components involved, the complex crosstalk phenomena among the different pat hways and the crucial role played by the dynamics form a picture that is difficult to gr asp. In cell cycle regulation, furthermore, all regulators are embedded in a highly interconnected network including positive and negative feedback loops, with many different regulatory mech anisms at the DNA, mRNA and protein level. As a first step towards an understanding of this en tanglement, several signal-transduction pathways in mammalian cells as well as the cell cyc le regulation in yeast have been analyzed. Dynamic mathematical models were structur ed as a set of sub-models according to the modular modeling approach. SBI Group, E. D. Gilles 181 4.3.2. EGF-induced MAP The EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor), TNF (Tumor Necro sis Factor) and Insulin signaling pathways are of great interest since they play a ke y role in tumor growth, arthritis and rheumatism. Understanding cell decision processes requires the analysis of the crosstalk mechanisms between survival and death receptors suc h as the TNF receptor or Fas receptor. For this reason, we have developed indepe ndent models of the survival pathways (EGF and insulin induced MAP kinase cascade) and the apoptotic TNF pathway, which can then be combined into a full model in the future. The EGF receptor is expressed in all mammalian organs. EGF receptors play a complex role during embryonic and postnatal development and in tumor progression. A mathematical model of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade activated by the EGF receptor has been recently published [8]. The model includes the binding of EGF, receptor internalization and trafficking, the signal complex formation, the resulting activation of Ras-GDP/GTP, and the MAPK cascade. The model suggests interesting properties: the ligand concentration might be of marginal importance over a 100-fold range, whereas the initial speed of receptor activation is a crucial parameter. By separating the signal triggered by the internalized receptors from the signal triggered by receptors remaining on the cell surface, the possible role of the receptor internalization can be elucidated: at high EGF concentration internalization leads to signal attenuation and at low EGF concentration internalization amplifies the signal. Fig. 79: the rk. 182 4.3.3. TNF-Induced Apoptosis Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces a broad spectru m of cellular responses such as differentiation, immune response or apoptosis via a highly complex signaling network. TNF induced signal-transduction is controlled by two di stinct membrane receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. While it is known that TNFR1 on its own is c apable of triggering either apoptosis or gene induction, the role of TNFR2 still remains unc lear. Our model [9] describes the experimental data of different stimulation protocol s. Several hypotheses could be obtained from the model; regarding the crosstalk between the two TNF receptors, for example, that the binding of TRAF2 to TNFR2 is not sufficient to induce almost complete depletion of TRAF2 from the cytosol that was observed. During th e model development it was shown that cIAP1 ubiquitinates TRAF2. 4.3.4. Mathematical Modeling of Cell Cycle Regulati on in Eukaryotes For the field of cell cycle regulation in eukaryote s, systematic development and validation of a modular, system- and signal-oriented mathemati cal model was first carried out for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. Several sub-models have been developed, which, when connected, are able to represent the major aspects of the complete system of cell cycle regulation in yeast [ 10, 11, 12]. In particular, as exemplified by the analy sis of a sub-model describing the G1/S-transition [10,1 1] mathematical modeling can lead to direct conclusions on the biological system under consid- eration. Here, major conclusions include (i) biolog ical knowledge on the regulatory network under consideration is sufficient to explain the observed behavior, (ii) the seemingly complex behavior resul ts from the interplay of regulatory circuits, which ha ve to be viewed in a quantitative way to begin understanding the entire network's function and (ii i) mathematical modeling gives hints that this network constitutes a relatively robust regulatory module. Fig. 80: Modular model structure for G1/S- control in budding yeast. SBI Group, E. D. Gilles 183 Robustness - qualitatively stable functionality des pite uncertainty - seems to be a general, essential feature of cellular control circ uits. The same property, however, provides a challenge to the investigator because it hinders th e estimation of kinetic parameters and thus the quantitative understanding of cellular regulati on. Using the control of mitosis as an example, the value of mathematical modeling in the elucidation of cellular control circuits under these constraints was investigated [12]. Para meter estimation accuracy gives a quantitative measure for robustness, which in this case strongly supports the concept of highly optimized tolerance, i.e. of the co-existenc e of robustness and fragility in cellular control. Similar observations concerning robustness of most parameters (but sensitivity towards flaws in network structure) were made for s ignal-transduction, namely the TNF, EGF and insulin models. A differentiated view on robust ness and identifiability is thus required, but realistic models of cellular control are possib le despite limited quantitative data. 4.4. Structural Network Analysis 4.4.1. Introduction and Objectives A major current challenge in systems biology is to clarify the relationship between structure, function and regulation in complex cellu lar networks. However, dynamic mathematical modeling of large-scale networks is di fficult, as the necessary mechanistic detail and kinetic parameters are rarely available. In contrast, structure-oriented analyses only require network topology, which is often well known. Projects in the field of structural network analysis therefore aim at directly gaining a better understanding of - predominantly metabolic - networks, but also at identifying const raints that could be exploited for the development of more detailed dynamic mathematical m odels. 4.4.2. Stoichiometric Network Analysis Stoichiometric network analysis has become an impor tant approach for understanding the functionality of metabolic networks. Specifically, metabolic pathway analysis serves to study the complete space of admissible steady-state flux distributions, also taking into account the reaction reversibilities. A promising approach is t he concept of elementary flux modes. These structural elements are unique for a given me tabolic network and can be considered as non-decomposable steady state flux distributions using only a minimal set of reactions. For a very similar theoretical concept (extreme pat hways), we showed that it yields identical results for most realistic applications, and that, hence, pathway analysis could be unified 184 [13]. For computer-based modeling of cellular systems, an alysis of metabolic network stoichiometry has been considered only to a minor e xtent. Therefore, we developed the FluxAnalyzer, a user-friendly package for MATLAB\u00ae f acilitating integrated pathway and flux analysis for metabolic networks within a graphical user interface [14]. It serves as modeling tool for our own projects [2,15], industrial corpor ations and academic research groups worldwide. Arbitrary metabolic network models can b e composed and linked with network graphics leading to interactive flux maps. They all ow for user input, control of a powerful collection of tools and algorithms, and display of calculation results. Pathway analysis in larger networks is hampered by the combinatorial ex plosion of possible routes. We derived a theoretical upper bound for the number of elementar y modes, depending on network size [16]. The FluxAnalyzer has been applied to complex networks with more than 500,000 elementary modes, which far exceeds other published pathway studies. Applying the elementary-mode analysis to the centra l metabolism of E. coli, we showed that an integrated analysis of elementary modes can be u sed to reconstruct key aspects of cellular behavior from metabolic network topology, namely to reliably classify mutant phenotypes, to analyze network robustness and flexi bility, and to quantitatively predict functional features of genetic regulation. More gen erally, we conclude that robustness of metabolic networks is linked to redundancy, and tha t hierarchical genetic control supports this robustness by finding a trade-off between netw ork efficiency and flexibility [15]. Elementary-mode analysis also proved suitable for metabolic flux analysis, which is often difficult because the metabolite balancing equation is underdetermined. For a network model of R. rubrum , we demonstrated that elementary modes enable one to identify fixed, additionally required, and never observable fluxes [2]. The concept will be also applied to analyze a model for infected MDCK cells (BPE group of Prof. Reichl). Fig. 81: FluxAnalyzer: E. coli central metabolic network. SBI Group, E. D. Gilles 185 4.4.3. Discrete Abstractions In the process of developing a dynamic mathematical model, one often faces uncertainty with respect to network topology and reaction mecha nisms. This usually implies the existence of several plausible reaction schemes and , hence, basically leads to the development of families of differently structured m odels followed by a model discrimination step. When developing accurate continuous models, t his process is severely impeded by the time-consuming task of parameter identification. Pu rely discrete models are much easier to establish, but are often \"too coarse\" to completely distinguish between competing hypotheses. Together with the SCT group of Prof. Raisch the str ength of both approaches were combined. We related sets of continuous models asso ciated with a reaction scheme to individual discrete models. Discrete models (reacti on networks) that are not able to explain available experimental data are discarded in a firs t step. This reduces the number of competing hypotheses and, hence, greatly facilitate s the remaining discrimination task. Obviously, it is of utmost importance not to discar d any continuous model that conforms to experimental data during the first step. We were ab le to prove that the behavior of any discrete model covers the quantized behaviors of all associated continuous models. In h ybrid systems terminology, we construct finite automata, each representing a conservative abstraction of an infinite set of ordinary differential equation models [17]. The approach has been tested for smaller networks in intracellular signaling. Future work will include its refinement and application to complex regulatory networks in signal-transduction and genetic regulation. Fig. 82: Automaton for the MAP kinase cascade. 186 5.

Flockerzi 191 Research Group: Mathematical Foundations of Dynamical Systems (MF) Prof. Dr.rer.nat. Dietrich Flockerzi This report covers the period from May 2001 to Apri l 2003 192 1. MF Group Introduction Given limited resources, how is it possible to rend er complex modern production processes more efficient while improving upon econo mic and ecological standards? In answering this question it is obviously crucial to have detailed knowledge of the fundamental principles governing the underlying technical proce sses and a precise framework for their formulation. The engineering sciences have traditionally been re stricted to the application of scientific knowledge. The modern engineering sciences are incr easingly forced to bridge the apparent gap between fundamental research and industrial app lication. Tackling today's problems cannot be done by relying on mere computing power. New means are required. The need to focus on the development of new models, methods and tools, typically stated in mathematical terms, becomes more and more apparent. This shift of paradigm is reflected in our Max Planck Institute where engineers are pushin g research forward together with mathematicians, biologists and computer scientists within a highly interdisciplinary research concept. The common aim is to improve the analysis of dynamic processes so that based on their newly discovered properties such processes can be run in the desired controlle d way. The formulation of appropriate mathematical models based on the fundamental relationships in the natural sciences and the exper ience from experiments is a major task in tackling the projects investigated by the research groups of the MPI. Detailed mathematical modeling of technical processes or cellular systems offers a rather precise approximation of the real processes but will inevitably lead to mode ls of high dimension and high structural complexity. Consequently, such detailed models may be too complicated for a rigorous analysis of their dynamical behavior and for a prac tical design and implementation of efficient control strategies. Thus, reduction methods on a fi rm mathematical basis are urgently needed to arrive at mathematical models, which, on the one hand, still describe the relevant features of the underlying real process and, on the other hand, can be investigated analytically or numerically at acceptable computati onal costs. Of course, synthesis and control strategies derived from a reduced model nee d to work reliably for the real process. MF Group, D. Flockerzi 193 The Research Group Mathematical Foundations of Dynamical Systems was founded in May 2001 to assist in the mathematical formulation of models , to do model reductions and modularization on a rigo rous mathematical basis, to offer alternative mathematical approaches to app lied problems, to help with the validation of a successful numerical routine, to do fundamental research on topics that are conne cted to the applications put forth at the Max Planck Institute, to restate plausible or formal arguments in mathema tically precise terms, to translate publications from the mathematics community, there by narrowing the gap between the languages used by mathematicians, engin eers and biologists. Another important function of the MF group is to pr ovide any kind of service or help requested by the staff of the Max Planck Institute in many fields of mathematics (analysis, algebra, geometry, topology, stochastics, etc.) individually and in intensive courses. 2. Members of the MF Research Group Dietrich Flockerzi at the MPI since July 2000 head of research group since it was founded in May 2001 The group is to be a small one with only two or thr ee further members (one funded by the MPI, one or two by a third party). A graduate of ma thematics and cybernetics at the University of Stuttgart is a promising candidate fo r joining Mathematical Foundations of Dynamical Systems . He possesses the prerequisites to tackle the math ematical problems in the new projects on Population Balance Systems. 194 3. Survey of the Research Projects Project Area: Reduced Models Project: Invariant Manifolds The geometric theory of Invariant Manifolds for systems of differential equations in finite or in infinite dimensions offers a precise reduction mechanism to lower dimensionality since the reduced system will be an exact subsystem of the given system. In case such a n invariant manifold is attractive, the long-time beh avior of the reduced system presents a reliable approximatio n of the asymptotic behavior of the original system. Thi s is of particular use since algorithms exist for computing approximations of invariant manifolds with high accuracy.

Such integrated processes are modeled by systems of nonlinear differential equations and can, in the beginning, be investigated by general mathematical methods. But typically, the performance requirement s pose novel challenges for a mathematician as well a s for an engineer.

Flockerzi MPI 01/2002 Project Area: Coupled Processes Project: Nonlinear Dynamics of Coupled Processes From a mathematical point of view, systems of equations for coupled and integrated processes can be approached by using similar methods. From the chemical engineering side, the questions posed are more specific to the system class. So for coupled processes, the discussion is concentrated on the ne w effects generated by coupling different units, e.g. reactors and separators. In Systems Biology the decomposition of coupled systems is of primary inte rest for answering the manifold open problems concerning metabolic, regulatory and signal transduction pathw ays.

Research Highlights 4.1. Invariant Manifolds The local geometric theory of dynamical systems con cerning bifurcations via center manifolds and the global geometric theory referring to homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations are advanced with respect to the speci fic applications from chemical engineering. In addition, results partly known, partly to be developed concerning Singularity Theory and Inherent Structures (such as symmetry and monotonicity) are employed for solving the specific problems from the application side. Quite often, phenomena that are generic in applied problems are mathematically non-generic. As an example we mention that chemical equilibrium curves originate from non-generic vertical bifurcations (cf. section 4.1.4 below and [10]). The design of safe reduction algorithms is of utmos t importance in ordinary and partial differential equations as well as in integr o-differential and functional-differential equations showing dominant sub-dynamics. The detect ion of suitable scales of time, variables and parameters justifying a generalized quasistationarity assumpt ion is of particular interest in many applications since it l eads directly to reduced models. Hereby, the decomposition into slow and fast variables, into ma sters and slaves, may vary within phase space. Thus, in a nonlocal setup, the quasistationa rity can, in general, not be checked by examining pointwise linearizations. The nonlocal ca se presents a tough problem for theorists, and there are many pitfalls on the way. In [6] we p resent a series of counterexamples to the method of Intrinsic Low Dimensional Manifolds as it is frequently employed in combustion theory 1. The derivation of quantitative statements is a conditio sine qua non for any kind of approximation. Here, it is essential to know how distinctive the dichotomies within the underlying system really are in order to establish bounds on how slow and how fast certain dynamics need to be for proving the applic ability of abstract theorems and how accurate a chosen approximation needs to be for achieving r eliable numerical solutions. Such error bounds are necessary for the validation of the reduced models and their numerically computed solutions. For example, in fin ite dimensions, the closeness of the 1 Warnatz J., Mass U., Dibble W.: Combustion, Spring er Verlag 2000 MF Group, D. Flockerzi 197 reduced model and the original model cannot be meas ured by the respective vector fields a fact that is sometimes overlooked (cf. [5], [6]). A challenging goal of the project Invariant Manifolds is the identification of system classes (in chemic al engineering and systems biology) that allow a simple detection of dichotomi es via the spectral properties of linearized systems. Of course, any concept for synthesis and c ontrol that is obtained from the reduced finite dimensional model needs to be proven so effi cient that it can be applied to the underlying real process safely and successfully. Systems biology tries to explain the complex functionality of meta bolic and regulatory networks, cell cycles and signal transduction pathw ays. Based on systems theory and interdisciplinary cooperation, mathematical models of amenable size and structure have been, and still need to be, established. The decomp osition ( modularization ) of a network and the analysis of the building blocks ( modules ) and their interconnections present a promising approach for answering the manifold open problems i n biological reaction networks. For special classes, the geometric theory of Invariant Manifolds in conjunction with Stability Theory can be applied with success. So, the problem of localizing and analyzing dominant sub-dynamics and of detecting hidden hierarchies wi thin a complex network can sometimes be solved by the definition of appropriate coordina tes and suitable scales. Invariant Manifold Theory then constitutes one way to take advantage o f inherent hierarchies, e.g., to describe the attractor containment, the transi tion phase, the switches and the input-output relations, to offer computable approximations, to understand the robustness of inherent network st ructures, to analyze the sensitivity with respect to paramete r variations. Important aspects of modularization are the definit ion and the structural investigation of single modules, the analysis of the interconnection s of several modules (e.g. as shown in a synchronization process) and finally their synthesi s and control. Which interconnections of which modules generate a model that reflects the dynamics of the given network? Which interconnections of which modules lead to a m odel showing the behavior that the underlying system is to be designed for? 198 Such questions are investigated in cooperation with the SBI research group of Prof. Gilles. Also, sensitivity issues in biological networks hav e been addressed in collaboration with Prof. Gilles' group. 4.1.1. Reduced Models There are many cases where simplified models of the underlying process can be helpful. Always having in mind the specific problem formulat ion, for example, to detect multiple steady states and switching surf aces (cf. section 4.1.4 and Fig. 83), to establish oscillations or bursting phenomena (cf . section 4.1.3, Fig. 84 and Fig. 85), to analyze the pathways in signal transduction and in metabolic or regulatory networks, to improve the process design, e.g. to optimize bio logical processes like the virus dynamics (cf. section 4.1.2) to design a robust control scheme in the presence o f uncertainties, to detect and compensate for disturbances, such simplified or reduced models should still be capable of reflecting the essentia ls of the dynamical behavior and should allow the constructio n of effective and reliable control strategies. Fig. 83: Bistability with a switching curve S and pure prod ucts. For initial values below S the concentrations of th e products A and B tend towards the concentration of the pure product A, for initial va lues above S towards the one of the pure product B. 00.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 uvS AB EMF Group, D. Flockerzi 199 Proposed reduction mechanisms include: (a) The restriction of the dynamical process to an attractive invariant manifold of desirably small dimension and the discussion of the detailed model on it or more roughly the restriction to an approximation of such an attracti ve invariant manifold and the discussion of an approximation of the induced detai led model on it (cf. approximate center, slow and inertial manifolds and quasistatio nary approximations). (b) Finite expansions with respect to eigenfunction s or empirical eigenfunctions (Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve method) leading to finite-dimension al substitute systems in the case of partial differential equations, the method of mo ments in the case of population balance systems. For example, given a slow/fast decomposition in a r eaction-diffusion or a transport- reaction system of parabolic partial differential e quations, a Galerkin-type reduction or a more general reduction based on empirical eigenfu nctions often allow the derivation of a finite dimensional ordinary differential equat ion on an approximate inertial manifold (cf. Prof. Kienle's PSD and Prof. Sundmach er's PCP group). (c) The assumption of special structures for the so ught solutions like wave-form solutions in separator systems, reactive distillations or in chromatography (cf. Prof. Kienle's PSD group). (d) The abstraction of the detailed model within a more general framework, e.g., within the theory of hybrid systems or automata, exploitin g hierarchical structures and additional properties like symmetry and monotonicit y (cf. the behavioral system theory promoted by Prof. Raisch's SCT group). Qualitative and, if possible, quantitative error bo unds need to demonstrate the success of any model reduction. Within the project area Reduce d Models at the MPI the Research Group Mathematical Foundations of Dynamical Systems develops methods and tools that lead to reduced models possessing the necessary pre cision for the specific task. So, model reduction can be validated in a series of applicati ons. 4.1.2. Virus Dynamics In developing bioprocess concepts for vaccine produ ction, one of our main interests is the presentation of a, not too complex, mathematical mo del, that describes the cell growth and replication of influenza viruses in MDCK cells (cf. [2]). Based on experiments on cell metabolism, on virus replication in fermenters and single-cell cultures and based on the determination of industrially relevant on- and off- line values for glucose, ammonium, lactate, aminoacids and virus titer, this model allows us to develop concepts for process monitoring 200 and control. These concepts then help to analyze th e sensitivities of the process, for example, the yield variations, and facilitate the v alidation of these processes. This research is performed in cooperation with Prof. Reichl's gro ups at the MPI and the OvGU Magdeburg. 4.1.3. Bursting and Coding in a Hemin-Oscillator Oscillatory behavior in the pH -value was observed during the oxidation of sulfite by hydrogen peroxide mediated by hemin in a continuous stirred tank reactor. With increasing flow rate the oscillations evolve from relaxation o scillations to more complex bursting behavior. Fig. 84: A typical solution for the 3D-Hemin-system . Fig. 85: pH(t) for 3D- and 6D-Hemin-system For the 6D-Hemin-system a 3D reduced model is defin ed on an attractive and slow invariant manifold. Fig. 85a shows a typical solution for the reduced model, Fig. 85b compares the pH- value of the reduced model (left) and of the full m odel (right). MF Group, D. Flockerzi 201 The proposed relaxation mechanism involves the auto catalytic oxidation of 3HSO by H2O2. Equilibria between pH -dependent forms of hemin account for the consumpti on of protons and provide the feedback steps that give rise to oscill atory dynamics.Numerical simulations show that two pH -dependent reactions suffice to obtain bursting osc illations which resemble those observed in the experiments (cf. Figures 2, 3 and [ 9]). The small amplitude oscillations between the bursts refer to the possible coding of biological information. This research is performed in cooperation with the Biophysics Depart ment of the OvGU Magdeburg. 4.1.4. Singularity Analysis of Reactive Separations Singular points like pure components, azeotropes, r eactive azeotropes or pinch points of reactive reboiler and reactive condenser models are analyzed. Five typical one-reaction systems with different liquid nonidealities, two of them involving liquid phase splitting, illustrate the bifurcations of singular points for the reactive reboiler as well as for the newly introduced reactive condenser. This research toward s the conceptual design of continuous counter current reactive distillation processes is performed in cooperation with Prof. Sundmacher's PCP group (cf. [10]). Fig. 83 presents one of the typical residue curve maps for a reactive condenser. 4.2. Nonlinear Control The work on Nonlinear Control is concerned with fundamental principles of distur bance attenuation in nonlinear control problems. It is ba sed on the theory of integral manifolds for differential games and has no specific application in mind. In Dissipation Inequalities and Nonlinear H-Theory ([8] and [1]) we consider smooth control systems w hich are influenced by an exogeneous input )(tvt Rd, e.g. by a disturbance signal. The dynamics are gi ven by a smooth ordinary differential equation ),,, (vuxtfx=& (1) with xRn where uRm is the control variable that is to be chosen as a function of t or of (t, x). Given a scalar instantaneous pay-off ),,, (0vuxtf and a time interval []ett,0 we are looking for mappings (t, x) u (t, x) and a scalar function V (t, x) such that the dissipation inequality (,()) ()), (, (), (, (00 0 0txtVdt 202 holds true for rather arbitrary v(t). In [8] we describe various ways of constructing fe edback control laws that give rise to such dissipation ine qualities. Usually, one speaks of H-control laws or worst-case strategies. Here, the state x(t) of our system may vary significantly from equilibria so we do not resort to linear H-theory. There is however one hypothesis ( H ) which we impose on f and 0f and that is always satisfied in the affine-quadrat ic scenario. The dissipation inequality (2) can be viewed as the minmax-half of the saddle-point condition for the two-person zero-sum differential game dt vuxtfet tuv vu),,, ( min min 0! ! = (3) ,)(), ,,, ( to subject 0 0xtxvuxtfx = =& with fixed terminal time et. In fact, if u(t, x), v(t, x) is a saddle-point of this game (3) then (2) holds true with the value V(t 0, x 0) of the game as a function of the initial data. With the Lagrangian function ). ,,, (),,, (: ),,,, ) requires that ( vuyxtL vuyxtL yxtH uv vu= = (5) is well defined and smooth. The main result of [8] for differential games satisfying hypothesis (H ) is a precise version of the principle that the foll owing three facts are shown to be equivalent: (a) The Isaacs problem admits a solution. (b) The Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equati on 0),, (= +T x t VxtHV (6) is solvable given the appropriate terminal conditio n. (c) The Hamiltonian (yxtxHyT =& (7) has an integral manifold of the form y = S(t,x) that achieves the appropriate terminal values. MF Group, D. Flockerzi 203 The Hamilton-Jacobi equation (6) plays a central ro le since any solution V(t,x) gives rise to an inequality similar to (2), namely dt tvtxtVtxtutxtfT Hu(t, x, y) is u-component of the saddle-point of the Lagrange func tion L. (8) holds true for any v(t) a .)(0 0xtx= (9) Thereby it is clear that the problem of finding con trol laws which give rise to dissipation inequalities can be reduced to the problem of solvi ng (6) locally, i.e., on a neighborhood of the solution curve {ettttxt 0:)) (, ( } of (9). Such local solutions are provided by characteristics of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (6) which are embeddable into local integral manifolds. A characteristic is a curve )) (~), (~, (tytxtt such that )) (~), (~(tytx is a solution of the canonical equation (7) with terminal value pres cribed by the integral manifold y = S(t,x). A characteristic can locally be embedded if the assoc iated nonautonomous Riccati matrix differential equation does not possess a conjugate point. When does a control law u = u(t, x) exist that gives rise to a dissipation inequality and how can it be established in concrete situations? Roughly summarizing [8] the answer runs as follows: Consider for every []ettt,0 with the system (9) being in the state )(tx all characteristics )) (~), (~, (tytxt with )()(~txtx= and make sure that none of them has a conjugate poi nt in the time interval [ ett,]. Then there is a scheme for computing the control law by repeat edly solving boundary value problems. This answer is based on the tacit assumption that o ne has manageable criteria for the absence of conjugate points. Since such criteria ar e hard to establish due to the indefiniteness of the Riccati equations we present alternative approaches for the affine- quadratic scenario that partly avoid these difficul ties. The price to be paid is exhibited in certain disturbance restrictions. 204 5.

INS Group Introduction The research group Integrated Navigation Systems (INS) is actively involved in the development of state of the art navigation systems for inland and coastal navigation. The integrated navigation system that has been developed in cooperation with German waterway authorities is intended to improve the safety of navigation in difficult situations like night and foggy weather and relieves the pilot of the routine work usually involved with navigation. The project started more than 20 years ago at the Institute of System Dynamics and Control at the University of Stuttgart. Prof. Gilles has been the head of the project since its inception. As a result of the long development time, the Integrated Navigation System has reached a mature state and is used today on many ships. Fig. 86 shows a typical navigation situation on the river Rhine as displayed on the navigation screen. Fig. 86: Navigation display. The research group at the MPI is currently addressing a couple of problems that have not been successfully solved up to now. The open problems are mainly in the areas of modeling the dynamic behavior of ships, sensor fault detection, sensor integration, and automatic track keeping for vessels of different sizes in narrow bends.

Research Highlights 4.1 Integrated Data Processing Knowledge of the ship's position and course is an essential requirement for navigation. One of the major characteristics of the Integrated Navigation System is the integration of different sensors with complementary error characteristics. Measurements from various sensors are combined into one state estimate. Blending of the different sensor signals is done based on a model of the ship's dynamics by the well-known Kalman filter approach. 4.1.1 Kalman filter techniques Kalman filter techniques based on a linear state space model of the form GwBuAxx \u000e\u000e tD RvHxy\u000e with state vector x, known inputs u, and measurements y have been popular since the early 1960s. The family of Kalman filters (the general structure is applicable both to continuous-time models where tDtww{ and to discrete-time models where tDis a time- difference operator) yield optimal estimates of the system state x and its covariance matrix C at some given time t. The properties of Kalman filters hold for a linear model under the assumption that the noise processes v and w are independent Gauss-Markov processes. (In practice, and especially in navigation applications, both assumptions are often violated; the dynamics are non-linear, and the noise isn't Gaussian.) The problem of linear filter design is generally solved by the Kalman filter provided that INS Group, E. D. Gilles 211 the underlying dynamics are linear and exactly known, and any noise or uncertainty is Gaussian with known characteristics. This means that the difficulties of filter design are actually moved into modeling. For the nominal model (the one without noise parameters) one can benefit from the rich variety of models whose development has been forced by the needs of control applications. In addition, a detailed description of noise characteristics is needed which is an often underestimated problem. 4.1.2 Application Demands Apart from the common theoretical foundations, different applications impose completely different demands on the processing of sensor data. These different kinds of applications clearly call for different models to be used. The safety of navigation requires reliable information about the ship's position and course under all conditions. The detection of sensor failures plays an important role here, whereas the precision of data is only a secondary issue. Control applications generally require the state estimates to be continuously available, as predictions may, under certain conditions, be substituted for unavailable measurements. The data processing must not introduce additional delays of a kind that could affect the dynamics of the closed-loop system. It can be assumed that a detailed model of the ship's dynamics is available. Measurements for model identification and model validation are usually carried out under \"optimal\" conditions where the effects of unwanted disturbances can be kept to a minimum. The measurement precision to be achieved exceeds the demands of usual navigation applications; it can be increased by repeated experimentation. As the goal of data grabbing is to obtain a model, the data processing itself cannot be based on that model. Noise reduction plays an important role, but it is limited to simple filtering related to models that represent basic physical constraints (e.g., kinematic behavior and bounded energy). Recently, an extensive comparative analysis of several model structures was carried out with respect to their fitness for state estimation (data filtering and prediction) as needed by control applications [6]. 212 4.1.3 Nonlinearities The ship's dynamics to be modeled are basically nonlinear due to three different reasons: 1. Essential nonlinearities are introduced by the rotational motion of the ship. The structure of these is simple, and the nonlinearities can easily be compensated for if the rotation is sufficiently known. 2. The hydrodynamics yield forces that are mainly nonlinear functions of the ship's velocity relative to the water. The effects involved are very complex (e.g. transitions from laminar to turbulent flow patterns), and therefore these will be modeled by rather simple approximations. Precise modeling of the hydrodynamic forces requires exact knowledge of the stream velocity field around the ship that cannot be measured in practice, the model will be based on an estimate of that velocity. 3. The usage of geographic coordinates for the ship's position involves non-linear coordinate transforms. The handling of these is easy as it is sufficient in practice (especially in the case of inland shipping) to replace them with a constant linearization. As the nonlinear hydrodynamic models are just being established, the question of whether the linearizations currently in use are sufficient will be addressed in the near future. 4.1.4 Non-uniform Sampling For the sake of simplicity, the representations of dynamic model and Kalman filter equations are usually given in continuous time (preferred for the model) and/or sampled at equidistant points in time (preferred for the measurements). The sensor equipment used on board enforces a different situation: measurements may be provided at different sample frequencies, and due to varying levels of disturbance there may be some samples missing. This means that the measurements are provided at non- uniform sample intervals, and in general there will be only a subset of the measurements provided at each of these. The Kalman filter can easily (and without loss of exactness) be extended to this situation; the approximations used for the discretization of the continuous problem require the sample times to be bounded. The key issue in the application of Kalman filters to a complex navigation system is a robust implementation that handles different sources of data in an asynchronous manner. The implementation done in our Integrated Navigation System supports not only the usage of arbitrary sample frequencies, but even allows measurements affected by varying transport delays to arrive in time-reversed order, triggering a roll-back mechanism. INS Group, E. D. Gilles 213 4.1.5 Model Uncertainties The theoretical Kalman filter approach requires the underlying dynamic model to be known exactly. A quite common approach consists of including the effects of model errors in the system noise parameters. As far as unmodeled causal effects are concerned, it is clear that these errors are in some sense deterministic, and the Gaussianness of noise is lost. While this procedure is unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view, increasing the system noise level leads to filters with reduced sensitivity to model parameters, which are preferred in practice (the so-called \"sub-optimal filtering\"). 4.1.6 Signal Validation Faulty sensors may produce disturbed signals that have to be detected and ignored. From the Kalman filter point of view, there is a probability distribution assigned to each of the expected sensor values - when very unlike values occur, the sensor will be regarded as faulty. Original situation: GPS multipath reflections Simulated correction: Suspicious data is around the bridge confuse the controller. discarded; the position is predicted based on a model of the ship's dynamics.

Commercial receivers do their best to reject faulty measurements but cannot completely achieve that without knowledge of the ship's dynamics. As they tend to filter the measurements on their own, disturbances are attenuated and hard to detect. The current work focuses on that point, especially on the effect of multipath reflections caused by metal constructions like bridges, etc. The disturbances produced by these effects are usually very small, - measured in meters - and fall below the limit of the GPS overall precision. They may be detected by the corresponding changes in velocity that are a violation to the underlying ship dynamics. Fig. 87 demonstrates the rejection of GPS data disturbed by multipath reflections using a comparison against predicted positions. The switching of sensors may lead to transients in the filtered signal. While applications like chart display must receive any information as soon as possible, control applications need special handling to suppress these transients. 4.1.7 Noise Modeling Until now, many of the noise parameters involved were taken only as raw approximations of their \"true\" values. The filtering of data works sufficiently well in practice with somewhat \"overestimated\" noise parameters, though there may be better results attainable. Signal validation, in contrast, requires the noise estimates to be as sharp as possible. To obtain reasonable values for the noise parameters requires a thorough investigation of the noise properties of the disturbances one can expect. The question of how the non- Gaussian noise, e.g., resulting from stream influence or nonlinear hydrodynamic forces, can effectively be approximated by a Gaussian noise process still has to be addressed. 4.2 Modeling of Ship Dynamics Unlike in open sea, a continuously changing course and reduced space availability characterize navigation on inland waterways. In order to achieve the required performance, ship models, as a mathematical representation of the available knowledge about the ship's behavior, are included in several modules within the Integrated Navigation System. This is particularly the case with the sensor signal processing and the track keeping modules. Their performance strongly depends on the accuracy of the model representing the ship dynamics. During navigation, several variables characterizing the ship's movement have to be monitored as well as influenced by the Integrated Navigation System. These variables, shown INS Group, E. D. Gilles 215 in Fig. 88, are the linear and angular positions and velocities, which describe the ship's translational and rotational movements respectively. These variables can be influenced by means of the propulsion system and the rudder angle . A dynamic ship model generally represents the interdependencies between the described variables with a set of differential equations. Several ship models have been developed in the past and are available in the literature. Although the use of some of them in the Integrated Navigation System has led to acceptable results, they have failed to appropriately represent the dynamics of inland vessels under certain conditions. The particular characteristics of inland navigation demand the following model features: x\u0003High precision, because of the reduced space availability in inland navigation. x\u0003A low number of well identifiable parameters that can be determined despite the restricting conditions on many inland waterways. x\u0003Robustness against water current, i.e., the required precision should be met for upstream and downstream navigation, in spite of the water current present in rivers.

For those that do meet the structural simplicity requirements, the necessary accuracy is not achieved under particularly difficult conditions, such as big ships navigating downstream through tight curves. The considered models fail to properly reproduce the drift behavior, which is strongly present in the described situation. The drift implies the presence of a sway (lateral) velocity component, causing the direction of movement to differ from the ship's length axis by a \u00aadrift angle\u00ba , as shown in Fig. 88. The impact of the water current on this effect can be observed by comparing the small drift angles in upstream navigation with the much larger angles needed when navigating downstream. As the described restrictions in the use of the available models in the Integrated Navigation System are a limiting factor in the performance of the system, efforts are being made to develop dynamic ship models that meet the special requirements for inland navigation. Based on the following aspects, a physically motivated approach has been chosen: x\u0003The requirement of high accuracy in spite of simplicity can only be achieved by selecting a reduced number of effects to be included in the model. This is only possible starting from relationships that have a physical interpretation. x\u0003Analyzing robustness against water current requires the explicit consideration of the effect of the current on the model variables. This property is not met by any of the available models. It can be achieved at a physical level, by considering that the hydrodynamic drag forces depend on the relative velocity between ship and water, while the inertial forces are affected by the velocity relative to ground. x\u0003A physical interpretation of model parameters makes it possible to estimate their values based on physical ship properties like mass and geometry. This could be helpful given the restricted identification conditions. Based on Newton's second law, and the consideration of nonlinear hydrodynamic drag force components and added masses, recent work [7] has led to the following drift dynamics model for the simpler case of still water: rKLv \u0000\u0000EEE \u000e\u0010 \u0006 The parameters L and K are velocity independent. Although it results from the consideration of the relevant physical aspects, the structure is still remarkably simple and contains only two parameters. As compared to former models used for inland vessel control, experimental results based on turning circle maneuvers confirmed improved performance in INS Group, E. D. Gilles 217 describing the drift behavior in still water. Current efforts concentrate on the extension of the developed model, accounting for the effect of water current, as well as the application of the model to the different tasks of the Integrated Navigation System. 4.3 Model Based Ship Control The integrated navigation system includes a feature for automatic track keeping of inland vessels. The control task is defined as keeping a well-defined location of the ship (e.g. the bow) on a given track along the river. The track is usually defined by the pilot beforehand and saved as part of the electronic navigation chart. Moreover, for many situations it is appropriate to allow for an offset to the predefined track, e.g., to make way or to pass other ships on the same track. This offset can be adjusted online by the pilot by means of a joystick. The control algorithm has to calculate an appropriate rudder movement based on the current position of the ship, the desired position and the offset to the guiding line. While keeping a ship sailing along a straight line is already a difficult task due to significant unknown disturbances (current, wind) and model uncertainties (changing and unknown load), following a narrow bend in the river requires a much greater effort. To achieve the smallest possible deviation from the given track, the controller has to anticipate the required ship movement and compensate for the curvature in the given guiding line. The necessary calculations for the rudder angle require an accurate model of the ship dynamics and therefore falls into the framework of model based control. The approach to the control problem is illustrated in Fig. 89 and consists of two basic parts: the feed-forward controller and the feedback controller. The feed-forward controller is designed to be a good approximation of the inverse ship dynamics. Ideally, the series connection of feed-forward controller and ship model would result in perfect track keeping in the absence of disturbances. However, due to the physical limitations of the rudder system and possible non-minimum phase systems (depending on the reference system chosen) perfect track keeping control is not possible. Interestingly, the non- minimum phase behavior can be removed by an appropriate choice of the controller reference point so that the major performance limitation is due to the limits of the rudder system. 218 Fig. 89: Control loop The current research follows two approaches for the design and implementation of the feed-forward controller: a predictive control strategy to invert the ship dynamics in the least square sense (see Fig. 90), and alternatively an analytic inversion of the differential equations. Both approaches have their merits and the insight gained by applying one method usually helps improve the other as well. The major argument for a predictive solution is the easy integration of constraints into the control problem. Besides the obvious physical constraints of the steering gear, a good controller is supposed to work with small and slowly changing rudder angles. Moreover, human pilots have certain expectations about how the ship should behave that usually translate into a stronger emphasis on the turn rate while position accuracy is only secondary. All that can easily be handled in the predictive control framework. However, it comes at the cost of a significant computational burden that makes real-time implementation a big challenge. Although the average computation time is, due to the receding horizon approach, relatively small (good start value from last optimization run); a typical course change, as introduced by the pilot for giving way to other vessels, still requires more than one second of computation time. Immediate reaction to pilot commands is essential for safe and reliable navigation, so that the predictive control approach is currently not suitable for day-to-day usage. original track in chart filtered reference trajectory control panel feedforward feedback KalmanfilterINS Group, E. D. Gilles 219 Fig. 90: Predictive control strategy. In comparison to the predictive control approach, the use of the analytic inversion of the differential equation system describing the ship dynamics results in a very small computational load. However, there is no inherent guarantee that the solution is in any way suitable for the application if the given trajectory is infeasible for the given constraints. This problem can be indirectly approached by imposing certain restrictions on the reference trajectory. Because the second and third order derivatives of the reference trajectory correspond to turn rate and turn rate acceleration respectively, limiting them to reasonably small values is sufficient for the purpose at hand. From an application point of view, this means that the user interface for editing tracks on the navigation system restricts the possible curvature of a track to feasible values. The track is internally represented as a Spline function so that the calculation of the required derivatives is very simple. deviation from intended coursepredicted coursemathematical ship modelrudder signal220 5.
