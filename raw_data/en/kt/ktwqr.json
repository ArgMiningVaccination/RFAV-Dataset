An example of a UUID in its standard form is 40e74fae-c0ab-11dfb090-0017f2300bf5. GUID are essentially guaranteed to always be unique, no matter where or by whom they are generated. Although facility is assigned a sequential integer code which will be generated by database system and used as a unique facility identifier, still the implementation of unique integer code as facility identifier is very much dependent on database system which generate these numbers and does not ensure an essential guarantee to be always unique e.g. in case if database is ported from one DBMS system to another, the unique sequential numbers (or auto increment primary keys of tables will change) In order to avoid this problem, we propose to use guide along with unique facility identification code to be used as attributes in Facility master Data Element Type PGWD Is Part of any Part, if any Data Format Bits Size 16 ValidationValues Default ValueOwner MDDS - Health Domain Committee Based on MDDS - Health Domain Committee Version 0.1 Status Draft Date Agreed Verification CommentsDate of Publication National Committee on Meta Data and Data Standards for Health Domain Overview Report 175 9. Episode Name of Data Element (Episode ID/05.009.0001) Description of Data ElementIdentifier assigned to a Patient Episode. An episode of care consists of all clinically related services for one patient for a discrete diagnostic condition from the onset of symptoms until the treatment is complete. Thus, for every new problem or set of problems that a person visits his clinical care provider, it is considered a new episode. Within that episode the patient will have many encounters with his clinical care providers till the treatment for that episode is complete. Even before the resolution of an episode, the person may have a new episode that is considered as a distinctly separate event altogether. Thus, there may be none, one or several on-going active episodes. All resolved episodes are considered inactive. Hence they become part of the patient's past history. A notable point here is that all chronic diseases are considered active and may never get resolved during the life-Time of the person, e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc. Data Element Type PGWD Is Part of any Part, if any Data Format Varchar Size 50 ValidationValues Default Value Owner MDDS - Health Domain Committee Based on MDDS - Health Domain Committee Version 0.1 Status Draft Date Agreed Verification Comments Date of Publication176 National Committee on Meta Data and Data Standards for Health Domain Overview ReportName of Data Element (Episode Type/05.009.0002) Description of Data ElementThis data element describes the type of the episode.

Encounter Name of Data Element (Encounter ID/05.010.0001) Description of Data ElementA patient encounter is a record of a patient's arrival in the health facility for any form of diagnostic and/or therapeutic event. It is essential to retain permanent records of all patient encounters. Unique ID to be assigned for each patient encounter.A clinical encounter is defined as (1) an instance of direct provider/ practitioner to patient interaction, regardless of the setting, between a patient and a practitioner vested with primary responsibility for diagnosing, evaluating or treating the patient's condition, or both, or providing social worker services. (2) A contact between a patient and a practitioner who has primary responsibility for assessing and treating the patient at a given contact, exercising independent judgment. Encounter serves as a focal point linking clinical, administrative and financial information. Encounters occur in many different settings - ambulatory care, inpatient care, emergency care, home health care, field and virtual (telemedicine). It must be ensured that no encounter number is arbitrarily assigned. The system will need to ensure this. When linking records from diverse systems, episode and encounter reconciliation through appropriate merging and demerging will need to take place.

The Primary data element for XYZ Analysis: Current Available Stock Quantity. A system of categorization, with similarities to Pareto analysis, the method usually categorizes inventory into three bands with each band having a different management control associated. Although different criteria may be applied to each category the typical method of \"scoring\" an inventory item is that of annual stock value of said item (quantity in stock X cost of item) with the result then ranked and then scored (X, Y or Z). Bandings may be specific to the industry but typically follow a 70%, 90%, 100% banding in that X class items represent 70% of the stock value (although they may account for 20% number wise), Y class items fall between 70% and 90% of the annual stock value with C class the remaining. In practical terms the complex high cost materials typically fall into the X class items, with the consumable, low cost (and typically fast moving) classed as X class.

For a product, these attributes include, but are not limited to, manufacturer, product description, material, size, color, packaging, and warranty terms. When a business takes an inventory, it counts the quantity of each stock keeping unit. SKU can also refer to a unique identifier or code that refers to the particular stock keeping unit. SKUs are not always physical objects. Anything that can be sold separately from anything else has a stock keeping unit, such as extended warranties, delivery fees, installation fees, and licenses.
