Product Details In general, we consume too much omega-6 in our diets, and not enough omega-3, but, the truth is, we need both linoleic acid and linolenic acid for optimal health and for the development of our body's inflammatory response. Creating a balanced ratio, and ensuring the oils remain in their pure state is key. Our brains are 60% fat so ensuring that we're getting healthy fats is critical to brain and body function. Our one-of-a-kind Balance Oil is uniquely formulated with healthy fats our bodies cannot make on their own, omega-6 & omega-3, in a ratio which studies suggest is optimal for maximum benefits.* Most oils are heated and processed, rendering them toxic and inflammatory. We use low temperature, expeller-pressed technology to protect the delicate alpha-linolenic acid (organic flaxseed) and linoleic acid (organic, unrefined safflower). This process guarantees the highest quality nutrients can be easily absorbed in the body. These essential nutrients play critical roles in multiple biological processes, including regulating the structure and function of cell membranes, intracellular signaling, and gene expression.* Safflower oil, flaxseed oil, gelatin, glycerin, and water.

Balance Oil FAQ Are Omega 6's bad for you? Oxidized Omega 6's found in heated oils are not good for you. Our products use an unrefined, non-oxidized Omega 6 from Safflower Oil which contains essential fatty acids pivotal to the health of our mitochondria and our muscular function. Unfortunately, most Omega 6 sources are now limited in the USA due to the introduction of hybrid oils that are high oleic. Ours is naturally high linoleic. The most concentrated source of linoleic acid is in whole organic raw seeds like sunflower, chia and pumpkin seeds. Omega 6 fatty acids evolve into Prostaglandin 1 series (from linoleic to gamma linolenic to dihomogammalinoleic into PG1, a powerful anti-inflammatory Prostaglandin) and Arachidonic into PG2 which overall turns on responses and is one kind of inflammatory response. Arachidonic acid is an essential fatty acid. We must consume it, we cannot synthesize it. Can I cook with Balance Oil? Dramatic heat will destroy the double bonds of the lipids, which makes them rancid, so it is best to add after cooking. For great recipes using Balance Oil, check out our Recipe Blog.

It wasn't until then that I thought deeply about how lifestyle factors (diet, environment, genetics, etc.) were impacting the health of my cells. While I believe that better health starts with a clean, nutrient-dense diet, many of us with medically complex diseases may have to turn to supplements to make up for the shortcomings of our biochemistry.
