The Commission on Higher Education is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and the Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation. In 2005, the Commission approved the extension of the scope of institutional accreditation to PCOM's Georgia branch campus. The College is also approved by the D epartment of Education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which granted recognition in 2004 to GAPCOM as an approved PCOM branch campus. GA-PCOM is authorized by the Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission of Georgia as a branch campus of PCOM. The doctor of osteopathic medicine programs at PCOM are accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation of the American Osteopathic Association. PCOM's physician assistant program is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Educ ation for the Physician Assistant (ARC -PA). The doctoral program in clinical psychology is accredited by the Committee for Accreditation of the American Psychological Association (APA), 202-336-5979; www.apa.org/ed/accreditation. The doctoral, educationa l specialist and M.S. programs in school psychology are approved by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). The certification program in school psychology is approved by the Department of Education, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Philadelp hia College of Osteopathic Medicine's Doctor of Pharmacy program has been granted Candidate status by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, 20 North Clark Street, Suite 2500, Chicago, IL 60602-5109, 312/644-3575; FAX 312/664-4652, web site www.acpe - accredit.org.\" With respect to clarification of the meaning of Candidate accreditation status, graduates of a program so designed would, in the opinion of ACPE, have the same rights and privileges of those graduates from a fully accredited program. The Candidate accreditation status denotes a developmental program that is expected to mature in accord with stated plans within a defined time period. It should be underscored, however, that decisions concerning eligibility for licensure by examination or reciprocity reside with the respective state boards of pharmacy in accordance with their state statutes and administrative rules. Should Candidate accreditation status be awarded to a program, ACPE would, however, make its position known and make recommendations consistent with that position. Documents of accreditation are on file in the President's Office, with copies in the Office of the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, and may be seen upon request. Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine The general objectives of the educational program are expressed as \"core competencies\" --- the domains of knowledge and skills in which all students must demonstrate competency to earn the degree, Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine: 1 Osteopathic principles and practice, which are established and incorporated in the development of skills. 2 Patient care that is compassionate, appropriate and effective for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of health. 3 Medical knowledge about established and evolving biomedical, clinical and cognate (e.g., epidemiological and social -behavioral) sciences and the application of this knowledge to patient care. 4 Practice -based learning and improvement that involves investigation and selfe valuation of patient care, appraisal and assimilation of scientific evidence, and improvements in patient care. 5 Interpersonal and communications skills that result in effective information exchange and teaming with patients, their families and other healt h professionals. 6 Professionalism, as manifested through a commitment to carrying out professional responsibilities, adherence to ethical principles, and sensitivity to a diverse patient population. 7 Systems -based practice, as manifested by actions that demonstrate an awareness of the larger context and system of health care and the ability to effectively call on system resources to provide optimal care. 8 Information literacy, as manifested by the capability to access, understand and apply biomedical inform ation, and actions that demonstrate the skills necessary to utilize information technology tools to effectively access information from various resources and formats. The Basic Sciences and Preclinical Years The first two years lay the foundation with intense concentration on the basic sciences, anatomy, biochemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience, physiology, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology, taught in integrated course units that emphasize clinical applications. PCOM also recognizes that medical practice is more than science. Coursework in ethics and patient communication helps the student relate well to patients, while content in medical law and public health prepares the student for the complex world of private practice. PCOM students begin preparation for the world of clinical medicine from their first day as medical students. The curriculum combines basic science and clinical course content with integrated courses such as Cellular and Molecular Basis of Medicine, as well as integrated approaches to the pharmacology, pathology, medicine and surgery related to respiratory, genitourinary, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. The basic sciences are complemented by instruction in clinical subjects such as internal medicine, surgery, neurology, psychiatry, pediatrics, epidemiology, OB/GYN, family medicine, rehabilitation medicine, geriatrics, radiology, oncology and physical diagnosis. The principles and practice of osteopathic medicine are taught throughout the medical curriculum. All students attend small group sessions during the first and second year to develop communication and diagnostic skills. These special instructional activities include patient observation, case conferences and basic clinical skills workshops. In addition, an active standardized patient and robotic simulation program introduces first and second year students to patient care through examinations of patient actors in a simulated practice setting, augmented by clinical exercises on high-tech human patient simulator manikins. Clinical Education The program is designed to afford progressive student responsibility for all phases of patient care under the direction of experienced physicians. This includes history taking, physical examinations, daily patient rounds, lectures, conferences and case presentations. Students rotate through services in medicine, family practice, manipulative medicine, surgery, cardiology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry, otorhinolaryngology and office-bas ed preceptorships. On elective clerkships, students may choose to pursue special interests at other medical institutions anywhere across the nation. All students receive additional training in osteopathic manipulative medicine during the third year. The last two years emphasize clinical training experiences. Philadelphia Campus students are assigned to clinical clerkships throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and neighboring states. This unique training network comprises 58 affiliated hospitals, five Healthcare Centers, numerous outpatient units and scores of physicians' offices. These clinical settings become teaching arms of the College; in effect, the Commonwealth is our campus. Students at the Georgia Campus are assigned to clinical clerkships throughout Georgia and the Southeast. One o bjective of the College is to encourage graduates to practice in communities where health care services are most needed. Therefore, each student entering PCOM must be willing to accept clinical education assignments throughout the region. Each senior stude nt serves at least eight weeks in an under - served community clerkship. An alternative rural elective is offered to a limited number of students, whereby the student may select an area of alternative health care delivery or a rural area of intense medical n eed. In the past, students have chosen studies in India, Israel, Africa, Appalachia and Indian Health Service sites. Special Programs - Philadelphia Campus DO/MBA In conjunction with Saint Joseph's University, a master of business administration degree may be earned by DO program students who concurrently complete a five- year course of study for the DO degree and a two-year program for the MBA.

The mission of the ODL program is to prepare leaders in the art and science of managing strategic change by teaching the competencies and skill sets for improving organizational performance and realizing human potential. A key training focus of the program is the development of program evaluation methods and the creation and use of performance-based outcome measures. Undergraduate Fellowship in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine The undergraduate OMM Fellowship seeks to assist in the development of the student into a highly skilled clinician in all aspects of osteopathic medicine. Students may enter the undergrad uate fellowship after their second year of study. with Roxborough Memorial Hospital, Chestnut Hill Hospital and many others, approximately 125 PCOM interns and residents are currently in GME training. Master of Arts (MA) in Healthcare Ethics This progr am responds to the increasing need for experts in ethics medical practice and prepares physicians for a wide range of applications of a background in ethics, including consulting, leadershipof hospital ethics committees, and application of the expertise in their own medical practices. This degree combination will augment the medical curriculum by enabling PCOM medical graduatesto better understand and address the ethical, cultural, and philosophical issues that influence health care and professional practice. The healthcare ethics curriculum will require 36 hours of graduate level coursework, including transfer and waived credit, taken during two summer sessions and four semesters of evening classes in the joint program, conducted in partnership with St. Joseph's University. GRADUATE PROGRAMS Clinical Psychology - Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) PCOM's Psychology Department presents a practitioner-scholar program that prepares graduates for leadership roles in clinical psychology. The PsyD program is a multi-year American Psychological Association accredited curriculum designed for in-career professionals.

All students enter the program as candidates for the 2 -year master of science degree.. The program provides a strong base of biomedical content in the first year, followed by a concentration in the second year. Upon successful completion of the first year of the graduate program, students are awarded the Certificate of Graduate Study. DO/PhD in Cellular and Molecular Biology The Joint DO/PhD Program is a collaborative initiative between the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USci ). The purpose of the Program is to provide a joint degree offering for students who wish to pursue physician -scientist careers and seeks to attract to PCOM those students with specialized career plans. The research -intensive program provides three full years of research fellowship training within the four-year osteopathic medical program. The three- year r esearch component culminates in a research project and dissertation defense. PCOM award s the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree after successful completio n of the DO Program. USci aw ards the Doctor of Philosophy degree upon successful completion of all requirements for the PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology Program, including dissertation defense and submission of a final manuscript for publication. The DO/PhD Program is designed to t rain physician -scientists who will contribute to the fund of knowledge by conducting original, high quality scientific research with the perspective of a clinical practitioner. The program represents a critical link between bench and bedside by combining medical training with research training and will produce clinical scholar -practitioners who can make ongoing contributions to the osteopathic clinical, scientific and academic community Students are accepted into the program as part of their original appli cation to osteopathic medical school; hence acceptance to the DO and PhD components occurs simultaneously, with USci approving the acceptance into the PhD Program. Non- acceptance to the Joint DO/PhD Program does not preclude a student from being accepted to the DO program only, through the normal PCOM admission process. For Information regarding admission: http://www.pcom.edu/Admissions/admissions.html Doctor of Pharmacy Philosophy The PCOM School of Pharmacy - Georgia Campus curriculum emphasizes patient-centered care, a model consistent with the applied emphasis of PCOM's graduate and medical programs. The mission of the GA -PCOM PharmD program is to educate caring, proactive pharmacists according to a practice model in which the practitioner assumes responsibility for a patient's medication-related needs and is held accountable for this commitment. The program also responds to the need for pharmacists in the nation, the state of Georgia, and the southeastern region. The pr ogram educates pharmacists who prepare and provide drug products and assume responsibility for the rational use of drugs by contributing to the design, implementation, monitoring and modification of therapeutic plans that will achieve defined goals and improve therapeutic outcomes. Educational Goals The GA-PCOM School of Pharmacy prepares generalist, entry-level pharmacists who are able to deliver high- quality pharmaceutical care. To achieve this mission, students must develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that enable them to competently: (a) provide population-based and patient-specific pharmaceutical care, (b) manage and use resources of the health care system, and (c) promote health improvement, wellness, and disease prevention. While preparing pharmacy practitioners is the primary mission of the Doctor of Pharmacy program, the program also provides an avenue by which students may explore a broad range of career opportunities. The pr ogram therefore aspires to foster interest in the creation of new knowledge to enhance patient health outcomes and quality of life and also to prepare students for further education. Curriculum The pr ogram is configured in a curricular format in which students complete: 1. the pre-professional phase (3 or 4 years) of general education, biomedical and pre-pharmaceutical sciences instruction at under graduate colleges 2. the last four years of pharmacy sciences and practice instruction at the GA -PCOM facility , as well as clinical experiences at clinical sites throughout Georgia and the southeast. Each term is a 13 week period, corresponding to the calendar used by the PCOM Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine programs in both Philadelphia and G eorgia. The extension of coursework over the three terms each academic year provides the opportunity for the across-the-curriculum development of skills. The curriculum is composed of course s in biomedical sciences, pharmaceutical sciences, social/behavioral/administrative sciences, and clinical sciences. A number of elective courses are available to allow students to enhance their knowledge of pharmacy-related topics in specific areas. There are five Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE) in which students are given exposure to pharmacy practices in a variety of different practice sites and begin their hands-on experiences. The final year of the program consists of the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPE) in which students are required to complete eight different rotations. These rotations consist of five weeks in a particular pharmacy practice site. Required rotations include: - Medicine - Ambulatory Care - Hospital Practice - Community Practice Elective rotations will include rotations such as (but not limited to): - Cardiology - Infectious Diseases - Pediatrics - Compounding Pharmacy - Pharmaceutical Industry Management This curriculum, including active learning skills development time, is designed to develop the knowledge, professional skills, professional attitudes and values that are required for an entry-level pharmacist.

Financial Aid Information http://www.pcom.edu/Financial_Aid/Apply_for _Financial_Aid/Apply_for_Financial_aid.html Refund Policy If a student withdraws from classe s within seven weeks from the start of the term, a pro-rata refund or tuition credit may be authorized. In th e case of full withdrawals, the effective date of the withdrawal is the date on which the student filed with the dean a written notification of withdrawal or a request for a l eave of absence. For courses not conducted on a weekly schedule, summer sessions, and for clinical clerkships in the DO and Phys ician Assistant programs, the refund is prorated according to the percent of the clerkships or course completed as indicated in parentheses below. REFUND SCHEDULE Withdrawal Within: Tuition Owed Credit 1st week of class 0% 100% (up to 5% of instructional time) 2nd week of class 10% 90% (more than 5% but no more than 10% of instructional time) 3 rd & 4th week of class 25% 75% (more than 10% but no more than 25% of instructional time) 5th through 7th week of class 50% 50% (more than 25% but no more than 50% of instructional time) After 7 th week of class 100% 0% No fee or portion of a fee is refundable. The re fund policy is subject to change at the discretion of the Board of Trustees, but in no instance will such a change become retroactive. All federal financial aid funds are credited or re turned in compliance with the Federal Return Policy schedule. In special circumstances, including medical/fam ily emergency, military reservist activation, or academic dismissal (or denial of academic a ppeal) based on a previous term's academic performance, the Senior Vice President for Academ ic Affairs and/or the Chief Financial Officer may authorize a full refund of tuition or a refund great er than what is applicable according to the refund policy. Return of Title IV Funds The Financial Aid Office is required by fe deral program guidelines to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence pr ior to completing more than 60 percent of a payment period or term. The federal Title IV financial aid programs must be recalculated in these situations. If a student leaves the Co llege prior to completing mo re than 60 percent of a payment period or term, the Financial Aid Office recalculates eligibility for Title IV funds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the following Federal Return of Title IV funds formula: Percentage of payment period or te rm completed = the number of days completed up to the withdrawal date di vided by the total days in the payment period or term. (Any break of five days or more is not counted as part of the days in the term.) This percentage is also the percentage of earned aid. Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percentage of unearned aid using the following formula: Aid to be returned = (100 percent of th e aid that could be disbursed minus the percentage of earned aid) multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed during the payment period or term. If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, the College would be required to return a portion of the funds and the student would be required to return a portion of the funds. Keep in mind that when Title IV funds are re turned, the student borrower may owe a debit balance to the College. If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him/her, the institution would owe the student a post-withdr awal disbursement that must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal. The Colle ge must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is resp onsible no later than 45 days after the date of the determination of the date of the student's withdrawal. Refunds are allocated in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans Federal Perkins Loans Federal Graduate (PLUS) Loans Other assistance under this Title for which return of funds is required Copyright Policy It is the policy of Philadelphia College of Os teopathic Medicine to comply with the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976. All PCOM faculty, staff, students are expected to act as responsible users of the copyrighted works of others whic h includes making informed decisions based on the fair use exemptions to the copyright laws. U.S. laws protect the rights of individuals regarding their own works. The penalties for violation of copyright law can range from college sanctions to civil and criminal prosecution. Persons who copy and distribute copyrighted material without legal permission may be found liable for civil or criminal copyright infringement. Civil penaltie s for federal copyright in fringement provide for significant financial compensation for damages su ch as $150,000 for each willful act. Criminal penalties can be up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. The College cannot protect students, faculty or staff from a copyright complaint, and the co llege may also be required by law to disclose information to a complainant for use in pursuing le gal action. Copyright infringement may also result in college-imposed sanctions for misconduct. Federal copyright law protects \"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium,\" which includes works of literature, music, drama, film, sculpture, visual art, architecture, and other creative media. (Title 17, U.S.Code, S ection 101.) Most works published after 1923 (except those authored by the U.S. Government) should be presumed to be copyright protected, unless there is information or notice from the copyr ight holder that the wo rk is in the public domain Works published prior to March 1, 1989, ge nerally require a copy right notice to be protected, but those published on or after Ma rch 1, 1989 are not required for copyright protection. Copyright Office Circular 22 explains how to determine the copyright status of a work. The doctrine of \"Fair Use\" (section 107 of the U.S. copyright law) in limited situations permits the use of a copyrighted work, including re producing portions of th at work, without the copyright owner's permission. Section 107 of the C opyright Act establishes four basic factors to be examined in determining whether a use cons titutes a \"Fair Use\" under the copyright law. These factors are: a) The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; b) The nature of the copyrighted work; c) The amount and substantiality of the portion of the work used in rela tion to the copyrighted work as a whole; and d) The effect of the use in question upon the pot ential market for or value of the copyrighted work. No factor is determinative of a person's right to use a copyrighted work without permission. Educational use alone is not sufficient to make the use in question a fair one. Photocopies or other reproductions can be furnishe d only under certain conditions, if they will be used solely for private indivi dual study, scholarship, or resear ch. Use of the reproduction for other purposes may make the user li able for copyright infringement. PCOM reserves the right to refuse to accept a co pying request, if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law. (17 U.S.C. 207, and under title 17 of the U.S. Code as amended by Pub. Law 94-553: 108, 702. Dated August 9, 1977). PEER-TO-PEER FILE-SHARING The College has implemented measures within the PCOM information system that prevent the use of Peer to Peer file sharing applicatio ns on all campus network computers. However, students should be aware of the implications and risks of using such applications on personal computers. Copying or distributing copyrighted media such as songs, movies, software, video games, text and pictures, without authorization from th e copyright owner may constitute copyright infringement. The Copyright Owner has the right to control, within certain limits, how their works are published, distributed, and sold, and the correlative right to be paid for the use of a work.

The policy includes the following: a. Prohibition Against Unlawful Presence of C ontrolled Substances on Campus (refer to campus policy section of this handbook). b. Prohibition Against the Unauthor ized Presence of Alcoholic Be verages (refer to campus policy section of this handbook). c. Prohibition Against Being Under the Influen ce of any Controlled Substance at off - campus classes, seminars or off cam pus on clerkships or internships. When a student is suspected of being under the infl uence of alcohol or drugs, that student will be reported to the Student Affairs a nd appropriate actions will be take n. This may include referral to counseling support programs, suspension or termination of enrollment at PCOM. SUPPORT AVAILABLE Graduate and professional educati on can be a time of great stress. A student may be unable to successfully adapt to these stresses and engage in potentially harmful coping mechanisms such as alcohol or drug abuse. The College Policy on Dr ug and Alcohol Abuse repr esents the intent of the College to enable students to resolve subs tance abuse problems by requesting and receiving compassionate, confidential professional assistance. In an effort to help our students and to protect pa tients and others from the harm that an impaired student may cause, PCOM's goals include: 1. Providing effective and compassionate as sistance to the impaired student before irreversible harm is done to his/her health, educational process, el igibility for licensure, or ability to function competently upon graduation. 2. Providing a means by which the impaired st udent may request and receive confidential professional assistance without stigma or penalty, and ther eby encourage self-reporting and personal responsibility. 3. Enabling the impaired student to confront his/her problem and, where feas ible, receive effective therapy with minimal disruption of the student's education. 4. Establishing a process that focuses on couns eling and therapy as a front-line approach before disciplinary action is necessary. SEEKING HELP Students at the Philadelphia Campus concerned about their own potential substance abuse should contact the Asst. Dean for Student Affairs or the College psychi atrist at 215-871-6870. Students on the Georgia Campus concerned abou t their own potential substance abuse should contact the Coordinator for Stude nt Affairs at 678-225-7534 or the Talbot Recovery Center at 800-445-4232 or 770-994-0185. Reports by Concerned Individuals If a student suspects impairment of another student, Philadel phia Campus students should seek guidance from the Assistant Dean for Student Af fairs or the Campus Psychiatrist. Students on the Georgia Campus should seek guidance fr om the Student Affairs Coordinator. General Detection of the Impaired Student At the discretion of the Senior VP for Academic Affairs, a student may be required to submit to psychological assessment and/or a urine and/or bl ood screening to detect alcohol abuse or the presence of illegal drugs based on reasonable suspicion of impairment. Medical professionals will perform such assessments and toxicology tests w ith reports sent in confidence to the Senior VP for Academic Affairs, at no cost to the student. If such screening measures detect impairment, the Senior VP for Academic Af fairs may remand the matter to the Student Professional Conduct Committee. Students who have declined an assessment and/or recovery plan will automatically be remanded to the Student Professional Conduct Committee for dismissal proceedings. In accordance with the College Disciplinary Polic y, any student found guilty of the use, sale or distribution of illegal drugs, either on-campus or off-campus will be subject to permanent termination of enrollment. LEGAL SANCTIONS PCOM is in compliance with all applicable fede ral, state and local dr ug and alcohol laws, and vehicle codes. Any student convicted of a drug- related offense will be suspended which includes immediate termination of all forms of financial aid. All students should be aware of the legal sanctio ns under state, local, and federal law for the unlawful possession or distribution of prescription or illicit drugs and alcohol, as well as the health risks associated with abus e of controlled substances or al cohol. The following is a review of the legal sanctions under local, state, and federal law for the unlawful possession or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol: DRUGS PENNSYLVANIA STATE LAW: 1. The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 Pa. C.S.A. 780-101 et seq., sets up five schedules of controlled substances based on dangerousness and medical uses. It prohibits the manufacture, distribution, sale or acquisiti on by misrepresentation or forgery of controlled substances except in accordance with the Act as well as the knowing possession of controlled substances unlawfully acquired. Penalties for first-time violators of the Act range from thirty days imprisonment, $500 fine, or both for possession or distribution of a small amount of marijuana or hashish, not for sale, to fifteen years or $250,000 or both for the manufacture or delivery of a Schedule I or II narcotic. A person over eighteen years of age who is convicted for violating The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, shall be sentenced to a minimum of at least one year total confinement if the delivery or possession with intent to deliver of the controlled substance was to a minor. If the offense is committed within 1,000 feet of the real property on which a university is located, the person shall be sentenced to an additional minimum sentence of at least two years total confinement. 2. The Pharmacy Act of 1961, 63 Pa. C.S.A. 390-8 makes it unlawful to procure or attempt to procure drugs by fraud, deceit, misrepresentation or subterfuge or by forgery or alteration of a prescription. The first offense is a misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment, a $5,000 fine, or both. 3. The Vehicle Code, 75 PA, C.S.A. 3101 et seq., which was amended effective July 1,1977, prohibits driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, or both, if the driver thereby is rendered incapable of safe driving. A police officer is empowered to arrest without a warrant any person whom he or she has probable cause to believe has committed a violation, even though the officer may not have been present when the violation was committed. A person so arrested is deemed to have consented to a test of breath or blood for the purpose of determining alcoholic content, and if a violation is found it carries the penalties of a misdemeanor of the second degree, which includes imprisonment for a maximum of thirty days. GEORGIA STATE LAW: \"Controlled Substances\" This broad category of illegal substance is defined in Drug schedules I-V, Official Code of Georgia Annot ated (O.C.G.A.), Sections 16-13-25 to 16- 13- of chemical co mpounds, opiates, hallucinogens, derivatives, isomers and other materials. The State Board of Pharmacy may add new materials to the list as required. \"Dangerous Drugs\" This is an even broader category of illegal substance and is defined in O.C.G.A. 16-13-71, describing hundreds of chemicals and other compounds. The Georgia General Assembly may add drugs to the list as required. A chart detailing the penalties for violati ng Georgia's Controlled S ubstances and Dangerous Drugs law is in the Appendix of this handbook. A summary of the criminal penalties is listed below. Criminal Punishment a. \"First offender\" treatment for mere possession of minor amounts of a c ontrolled substance or dangerous drug. A person never before convicted of possession of a small amount of the above material may, at the judge's sole discretion, be afforded first-offende r treatment, resulting in no entry of a plea of guilty and no record of any conviction, if the defendant successfully completes a court-monitored comprehensive rehab ilitative program (O.C.G.A. 16-13-2(a)). b. Possession of one ounce or less of marijuana. Imprisonment for 12 months or less and/or a fine not to exceed $1,000, or \"public works\" (c ommunity services) not to exceed 12 months (O.C.G.A. 16-13-2(b)). c. Possession, manufacture or distribution of controlled substances. This is punishable by confinement of up to 30 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million, depending on the schedule sequence of the controlled substance involved, as well as the amount (See O.C.G.A. Section 16- 13-30 and Section 16-13-31). The manufacture, distribution or possession with intent to distribute any controlled substance or marijuana within 1, 000 feet of an elementary or secondary school, park, playground, recreation center, housing project or drug-free commercial zone can result in up to 40 years in prison with a fine of up to $40,000 (See O.C.G.A. Section 16-13-32.4, 16-13-32.5 and 16-13-32.6). A detailed chart outlining th e state penalties for crimes involving various controlled substances is available in the Student Affairs office. Federal Laws 1. The Federal drug laws, The Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., are similar to the Pennsylvania Controlled Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, but contain, for the most part, more severe penalties. Schedules of controlled substance are established, and it is made unlawful knowingly or intentionally to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess with intent to distribute or dispense a controlled substance. If the quantity of controlled substance is large (e.g. 1,000 kg of a mixture or substance containing marijuana), the maximum penalties are life imprisonment, a $4,000,000 fine, or both. Lesser quantities of controlled substance (e.g. 100 kg of a mixture or substance containing marijuana) result in maximum penalties of life imprisonment, a $2,000,000 fine, or both. The distribution of small amounts of marijuana for no remuneration or simple possession of a controlled substance carries a maximum of one year's imprisonment, a $5,000 fine, or both, with the penalties for the second offense doubling. Probation without conviction is possible for first offenders. Distribution to persons under the age of twenty-one by persons eighteen or older carries double or triple penalties. Double penalties also apply to the distribution or manufacture of a controlled substance in or on or within 1,000 feet of the property of a school or college. 2. Students who have been convicted under stat e or federal law involving the possession or sale of a controlled substance, are ineligible for federal student aid for specific periods (ranging from one year to an indefinite period depending on the nature of the offense and whether the student is a repeat offender). B. Alcohol 1. The Pennsylvania Liquor Code, 47 Pa., C.S.A., 1-101 et seq., controls the possession and sale of alcoholic beverages within the Commonwealth. The Code as well as portions of the Pennsylvania Statutes pertaining to crimes a nd offenses involving minors, 18 Pa., C.S.A. 6307 et seq., provide the following: 2. It is a summary offense for a person under th e age of twenty-one to attempt to purchase, consume, possess or knowingly and intentionally transport any liquor or malt or brewed beverages. Penalty for a first offense is suspension of driving privileges for 90 days, a fine up to $300 and imprisonment for up to 90 days; for a second offense, suspension of driving privileges for one year, a fine up to $500, and imprisonment for up to one year; for subsequent offense, suspension of driving privileges for two years, a fine up to $500 and imprisonment for up to one year. Multiple sentences involving suspension of driving privileges must be served consecutively. 3. It is a crime intentionally and knowingly to sell or intentionally and knowingly to furnish or to purchase with the intent to sell or furnish, any liquor or malt or brewed beverages to any minor (under the age of twenty-one). \"Furnish\" means to supply, give or provide to, or allow a minor to possess on premises or property owned or controlled by the person charged. Penalty for a first violation is $1,000; $2,500 for each subsequent violation; imprisonment for up to one year for any violation. 4. It is a crime for any person under twenty-one years of age to possess an identification card falsely identifying that person as being twenty-one years of age or older, or to obtain or attempt to obtain liquor or malt or brewed beverages by using a false identification card. Penalties are stated in (2) above. 5. It is a crime intentionally, knowingly or recklessly to manufacture, make, alter, sell or attempt to sell an identification card falsely representing the identity, birth date, or age of another. Minimum fine is $1,000 for first vi olation; $2,500 for subsequent violations; imprisonment for up to one year for any violation. 6. It is a crime to misrepresent one's age knowingly and falsely to obtain liquor or malt or brewed beverages. Penalties are as stated in (1) above. 7. It is a crime knowingly, willfully and falsely to represent that another is of legal age to obtain liquor or malt or brewed beverages. Penalty is a minimum fine of $300 and imprisonment for up to one year. 8. It is a crime to hire, request or induce any minor to purchase liquor or malt or beverages. Penalty is a minimum fine of $300 and imprisonment for up to one year. 9. Sales without a license or purchases from an unlicensed source of liquor or malt or brewed beverages are prohibited. 10. It is unlawful to possess or transport liquor or alcohol within the Commonwealth unless it has been purchased from a State Store or in accordance with Liquor Control Board regulations. The University will cooperate with the appropria te law enforcement authorities for violations of any of the above-mentioned laws by an employee in the workplace or student. 11. The use in any advertisement of alcoholic beverages of any subject matter, language or slogan directed to minors to promote consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited. 12. No advertisement of alcoholic beverages shall be permitted, either directly or indirectly, in any booklet, program, book, yearbook, magazine, newspaper, periodical, brochure, circular, or other similar publication, published by, for, or on behalf of any educational institution. DRUG CONVICTION AND FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY Substance Abuse Question on the Free App lication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Question 23 on the FAFSA form asks if the student has ever been convicted of a drug related offense. Failure to answer this question will au tomatically disqualify the student from receiving Federal aid. Falsely answering this question, if discovered, could result in fines up to $20,000, imprisonment, or both. Under the Higher Education Act, a student may become ineligible for federal student aid upon conviction of any offense involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs while receiving Title IV federal financial aid. Federal aid includes Federal Direct Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans, Federa l Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Federal ACG Grants, Fe deral SMART Grants, Federal TEACH Grants, Federal Work Study, and Perkins Loans. FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID PENALTIES FOR DRUG CONVICTIONS Possession of Illegal Drugs: First Offense: 1 year ineligibility from the date of conviction Second Offense: 2 years ineligibilit y from the date of conviction Third and Subsequent Offenses: Indefinite in eligibility from the date of conviction Sale of Illegal Drugs: First Offense: 2 years ineligibil ity from the date of conviction Second and Subsequent Offenses : Indefinite ineligibility from the date of conviction CONVICTIONS DURING ENROLLMENT According to the United States Department of Education, if a student is convicted of a drug offense after receiving Federal aid, he or sh e must notify the Financial Aid Department immediately and that student will be ineligible for further aid and require d to pay back all aid received after the conviction. REGAINING ELIGIBILITY A student can regain eligibility for federal st udent aid funds by successfully completing a drug rehabilitation program. To be su fficient to reinstate financial ai d eligibility, the program must: include at least 2 unannounced drug tests AND be recognized as a Federal, State, or local government agency program. A student will re gain eligibility on the date of successfully completing the program. Transfer of Credits Doctor of Osteopathi c Medicine Programs PCOM does not routinely accept transfer st udents; however, a transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on places available in the class. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an AOA-accredited college of oste opathic medicine or who is eligible for re-admission to the previously atte nded college of osteopathic medicine. The initial request for transfer must orig inate from the dean of the college or university from which the student wishes to transfer and must be directed to the dean of the PCOM campus to which he or she is applying. Application materials must be submitted and a formal interview with the Faculty Committee on Admissions will be required. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses successfully passed at the previ ous college that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. Physician Assistant Program The physician assistant program does not offer advanced placement based upon transfer of credits for academic work completed at other institutions of higher learning or upon credit for experiential learning. Applications are not accepted from graduates of medical schools. Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program Students may be able to obtain credit for co mparable academic work completed at other accredited institutions of higher education. Up to six (6) credits may be transferred; all credits must have been earned with a grade of B or be tter. All decisions regarding such advanced standing are made on a case by cas e basis by the Program Director and the Vice President for Graduate Programs and Planning.

Doctor of Psychology Programs The PsyD in Clinical Psychology program does not accept transfer credits. Students who have taken a required course prior to matriculati on or who believe that through study and experience they have mastered the requisite knowledge may request to waive a require d course. The waiver should be discussed with the Program Director , and the student shoul d request the course syllabus and reading list from the Course Instru ctor. The \"Request for Course Waiver\" form must be submitted to the Director of the Psy.D. program and must give the reason for the request for a waiver at least two weeks pr ior to the start of the course in discussion. The Director will determine whether the student is permitted to take a waiver exam. The waiver examination will be graded as \"Waiver\" or \"No Waiver\" by the Director of the Psy.D. program and one other faculty member. Only one exemption examination may be taken per course. There is no penalty for not receiving a waiver. Students may waive a maximum of two courses . Being exempt from/waiving a required course do es not lessen the number of credits a student must take, but rather allows the student to take elective courses in place of the waived courses.

Program in School Psychology are al ready trained at the Ed.S. or Certification level, all students will be able to transfer credits from their Ed.S. or Certification training into the Psy.D. program.

In cases where students have not had specific course work in each domain, they are asked to attach to the Transfer Course Documentation Form a narrative describing how they achieved competence in the specific area or to remediate by taking the needed course(s) School of Pharmacy Georgia Campus does not routinely accept transfer students; however, a transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on places available in the class.
