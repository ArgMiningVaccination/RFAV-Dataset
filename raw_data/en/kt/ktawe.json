DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: On behalf of the Federal Council on the Aging, I am pleased to submit a preliminary summary of the 1989 annual report. This document examines the history and present membership of the Council. It also highlights the various positions taken by the Council on a number of legislative and other issues concerning the well-being of the elderly. We are hopeful that the Council's view will be considered as the 101th Congress convenes for its second ses- sion. We appreciate the continuing interest of the Special Committee on Aging and look forward to another year of cooperative efforts with committee members and staff toward our mutual goal of service to older Americans. Sincerely, INGRID C. AZVEDO, Chairman. SUMMARY OF THE 1989 ANNUAL REPORT I. INTRODUCTION A. Background The Federal Council on the Aging (FCoA) is the functional successor to the earlier and smaller Advisory Council on Older Americans, which was created by the 1965 Older Americans Act. In 1973, when the FCoA was created, Congress was concerned about Federal responsibility for the interests of older Americans, and the breadth of vision that such responsibility would reflect. Having decided to upgrade the existing (1)2 advisory committee, Congress patterned the legislative language authorizing the FCoA after the charter of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The FCoA is authorized by Section 204 of the Older Americans Act, as amended. The Council is composed of 15 members appointed 5 members each by the President, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. Council members, who are appointed for 3-year terms, represent a cross-section of rural and urban older Americans, na- tional organizations with an interest in aging, business and labor, and the general public. According to statute, at least nine members must themselves be older indi- viduals. The President selects the Chairperson of the Council from the appointed mem- bers. The FCoA is mandated to meet at least quarterly, and at the call of the Chair- person. Functions of the Council include: -Continually reviewing and evaluating Federal policies and programs affecting the aging for the purposeof appraising their value and their impact on the lives of older Americans; -Serving as spokesperson on behalf of older Americans by making recommenda- tions about Federal policies regarding the aging and federally conducted or as- sisted programs and other activities relating to or affecting them -Informing the public about the problems and needs of the aging by collecting and disseminating information, conducting or commissioning studies and pub- lishing their results, and by issuing reports; and -Providing public forums for discussing and publicizing the problems and needs of the aging and obtaining information relating to those needs by holding public hearings and by conducting or sponsoring conferences, workshops, and other such meetings. The Council is required by law to prepare an annual report for the President by March 31 of the ensuing year. Copies are distributed to Members of Congress, gov- ernmental and private agencies, institutions of higher education, and individual citi- zens interested in FCoA activities. Funds appropriated for the Council are-included in the overall appropriation of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). These funds are used to underwrite meetings of the Council, to support staff, and publish information tracts authorized by the Council. The results of its public meetings and activities concerning issues and policies af- fecting older Americans are shared with the President, Congress, the Secretary of DHHS, the Assistant Secretary for Human Development Services (HDS), the Com- missioner of the Administration on Aging (AoA), National and State Aging organi- zations, and others interested in the well-being of older Americans.

ACTION OF THE FEDERAL COUNCIL ON THE AGING DURING CALENDAR YEAR 1989 A. Development of a Plan for a 1991 White House Conference on Aging Following the plan first detailed in its 1986 Annual Report to the President, and developed in 1987 and 1988, the Federal Council on the Aging (FCoA) let a contract to the University of Illinois at Chicago to develop an orderly, relevant and economi- cally reasonable scenario for the 1991 White House Conference on Aging. As part of the plan development the FCoA held a Forum during its November 1988 meeting. The Forum was part of the Gerontological Society of America Conference held in San Francisco. The Council, following the mandate of the 1987 Reauthorization of4 the Older Americans Act (P.L. 100-175), submitted the resultant plan to the Presi- dent and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on March 22, 1989. B. Intra-State Targeting of Federal Funds to Older Amerncans Act Designated Groups So that a clearer picture might be drawn as to how States were attempting to follow the Congressional mandate for targeting Older Americans Act funds and services to the frail, low- income, and minority elderly, the FCoA held a forum during its August, 1988 meeting in Washington, D.C. The Council learned that this issue was becoming ever-more contentious, with several State Departments on Aging facing legal action as a result of their intra-State funding formulas. In order to help assure that sufficient information would be available to deter- mine ways to adequately address these evolving issues, particularly in view of the approaching reauthorization of the Older Americans Act in 1991, the Council invit- ed the Acting Deputy Commissioner on Aging and the Director of Census Programs of the Population Division of the Bureau of the Census to brief them on the special tabulations system and the needs of the Aging Network for specifically designed special tabulations to assist in targeting. Following this briefing, the Council issued a recommendation to the Acting Commissioner on Aging strongly urging that the Administration on Aging convene, as soon as possible, a working group to discuss and develop recommendations for the nature and content of special census tabula- tions relating to aging programs. This recommendation further advised that the group should include representatives from the FCoA, the Administration on Aging, various levels of the Aging Network, the Bureau of the Census,-and the Interagency Task Force on Aging Data. In light of recent changes which impact the distribution of Older Americans Act Funds to American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians (Title VI), par- ticularly the increasing numbers of tribes that have become eligible to receive these dollars since the required tribe size was reduced to 50 individual elders, the Council issued a recommendation in opposition to the limitation or \"capping\" of the number of eligible tribes. C. Catastrophic Health Insurance and Long-Term Care- Following a briefing during their June 1989 meeting by representatives of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) on the content and implementation of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, the Council issued a recommendation that decision on the method of assessing premiums to participants under the Act be postponed for 1 year. The recommendation was forwarded to the Chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. The legisla- tion has since been repealed. *aD. Older Workers and Employment During their- August Quarterly Meeting, the Council studied various aspects of the involvement of older persons in-the workplace. Presentations were provided by representatives of- the-National Energy and Aging Consortium, the Edison Electric Institute, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), and the Office of Job Training at the U.S..Department of Labor. National Energy and.Aging Consortium.-This presentation included a description of the history and structure of the consortium and a discussion of its purpose and activities. The Consortium now has 13 State affiliates and members were encouraged to es- tablish new organizations in States where none was in place. Edison Electric Institute.-This presentation included a discussion of the elderly customer awareness training program at the Institute to help utility company em- ployees better understand the unique needs and values of their elderly customers, improve communication skills, and to inform employees of community resources available to the elderly. American Association of'Retired Persons.-This presentation included a descrip- tion of the New Roles in Society program, \"Life Work: Options for Older Workers in the Future\" project. Offwe of Job Training Programs.-This presentation outlined the current status of the Jobs Training Partnership Act (JTPA) and recent legislative proposals, particu- larly those which would effect the 3 percent set-aside program for older workers. At their November Quarterly Meeting, the Council heard a presentation by the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor concerning the problems facing5 older working women. Their program included a discription of their data bank on child care programs (CHOICES) which has recently been implemented, and a discus- sion of the elder care component which is being developed and should be on line by spring 1990. E. Statement of Commendation and Tribute to the Honorable Claude Pepper The Council issued a statement in honor of the late U.S. Congressman Claude Pepper. The statements was prepared and sent to his family and his office. The fol- lowing is the text of that statement: A TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN CLAUDE PEPPER The recent death of Florida Congressman Claude Pepper ended a public career whose greatness is reflected in both its breadth of accomplishment and its lasting influence on our culture at large. Claude Pepper, as much as any public figure of his generation, changed the way Americans view the inevitable process of aging. Due largely to Pepper's support for Social Security and public health insurance, and his opposition to forced retirement, old age is no longer considered a period of inevitable poverty and decline. As our fear of aging has decreased, we have seen a virtual renaissance in its possi- bilities. Our society is appreciably less obsessed with youth as the ideal which de- fines our public policy, commerce, and esthetic values. It is no longer acceptable to stigmatize the elderly as, in Pepper's memorable words, \"toothless, sexless, humor- less, [and] witless\". Despite his vast influence, Congressman Pepper would never have sought full credit for these changes. And in fact, this quintessential Southern gentleman was as much as symbol as an agent of our nation's cultural and demographic transforma- tion. As Pepper himself proved by his continued political skill and vitality well into his eighties, the later years can truly represent a flowering of the full potential for leadership. Pepper, often characterized as a \"champion of the elderly\" was in fact a friend of all who were vulnerable to abuse or neglect. He was a champion of human- ity. The steadfastness of Pepper's humane generosity earned him the goodwill, recog- nition and respect of not only his constituents but virtually all Americans, whether or not they agreed with him on specific issues. Claude Pepper's passion for justice, his faith in the democratic process, his moral consistency, and his salty good humor will be missed by all of us-those of us who knew him well and those who did not. He is truly irreplaceable. We the members of the Federal Council on the Aging therefore add our voices to the many already raised in tribute to Congressman Claude Pepper, a good friend, a respected colleague, and a standard of excellence for all in public service. Other issues and activities in which the Council will be involved in 1990 include the following: A. Aging America: Trends and Projections The FCoA will participate for the third time in the development, printing, and distribution of the demographic report-Aging America: Trends and Projections, 1989-90. The publication is a cooperative effort with the Administration on Aging, the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). B. Preparations for a 1991 White House Conference on Aging In accordance with provisions of the Older Americans Act which states: \"The Sec- retary shall establish an advisory committee to the Conference which shall include representation from the Federal Council on the Aging and other public agencies and private nonprofit organizations as appropriate\", the Council will participate fully in the planning and preparation for a 1991 White House Conference on Aging should such conference be called by the President. C Public Education To aid in the provision of the informational and educational needs of older Ameri- cans, a clearer and more realistic perception of elderly is emphasized. A key concern of the Council is the continued broad distribution of current and meaningful demo- graphics, most especially with regard to the 1990 census.6 D. Silver Anniversary of the Older Americans Act The Federal Council on the Aging will be conducting and participating in activi- ties commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the signing of the Older Americans Act of 1965. III. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS In 1990, the Federal Council on the Aging will approach its work through the four standing committees described below. A. Targeting and Access to Services This committee will continue its work in studying intraState funding formulas and their effectiveness in the distribution of Federal funds as prescribed by the Older Americans Act. The committee will also examine other issues involving access to services for the elderly, and will investigate methods to overcome obstacles which are encountered by older persons seeking these services. B. Quality of Life and Housing This committee will continue to examine and recommend ways to improve hous- ing conditions for older persons. Among the topics that the committee may study are issues involving congregate and shared housing, reverse mortgages, board and care facilities, and homelessness among the elderly. C Health This committee will continue its efforts calling for the Congress and the life insur2 ance industry to work together in drafting long-term care legislation that will allow a realistically larger role for the insurance industry in the funding of long-term care needs of an aging population while reducing the projected staggering costs to the Federal Government. Among other issues which may be addressed are the crisis facing rural hospitals, prescription drug abuse, and eldercare. The committee will also closely monitor the continuing debate over catastrophic health care coverage. D. Ethics and Legal Issues Throughout 1990, this new committee of the Council will examine and evaluate progress in areas of ethical and legal concern -to older persons. Among the issue areas which may be explored are those involving guardianship, power of attorney, wills, living wills and living trusts, elder abuse, private/public sector relationships, and financial and retirement planning.APPENDIX 2 REPORTS FROM FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ITEM 1. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE JANUARY 25, 1990. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your letter requesting an update of the annual report, Developments in Aging. We have enclosed the most recent data concerning United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs which assist older Americans. These enclosures are comprised of contributions from five USDA agencies: the Agricultural Research Service, the Extension Service, the Economic Research Service, the Forest Service, and the Food and Nutrition Service. Sincerely,JACK C. PARNELL, Deputy Secretary. Enclosures. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE RESEARCH RELATED TO THE ELDERLY Studies are conducted at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University, Boston, MA, which address the following problems of the aging: 1. What are nutrient requirements to insure optimal function and well-being for an aging population? 2. To what extent can proper nutrition prevent or slow the progressive loss of tissue function with aging? 3. What, if any, is the role of nutrition in the genesis of major degenerative conditions associated with the aging process? In addition, studies are performed at the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center (BHNRC), the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center (GFHNRC), and the Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC) on the role of nutri- tion in the maintenance of health and prevention of age-related conditions, includ- ing cancer, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. A list of Agricultural Research Service projects related to nutrition and the elderly is attached.

Moreover, guinea pigs fed high vitamin C containing diets had higher levels of vitamin Cin their lens and were more resistant to photoirradiation damage. o D. Rush HNRCA Nutrition Epidemiology & Aging 10/0184-09/30/89 $1,090,753 Abstract: Epidemiological studies are designed to identify the determinants of nutritional status inthe elderly and to relate nutritional status to health and well-being. A nutritional status surveyinvolving 1,016 free living and institutionalized subjects revealed that nutritional supplements werebeing used by 451 of the males and 55Z of the females. Considering nutrients from diet alone, morethan 151 of the subjects between 60 and 98 years of age have intakes less than 2/3 the RDA forvitamins A, D, B-6, B-12, folacin, $2,463,735 J. Sadowski of the Elderly Abstract: Studies are being done on the dietary requirements of the elderly for folacin, vitamin-B-12, pyridoxine, vitamin D and K. Aging has been found to decrease the capacity of human skin to produce vitamin D-3 from its precursor, cholesterol. o W.

I- 614 HIGHLIGHTS OF RESEARCH FINDINGS RELATED TO NUTRITION AND PREVENTION OF DISORDERS ASSOCIATED wrrH AGING NUTRITION STATUS AND CATARACT FORMATION Previous animal studies have suggested an association between nutritional statusand cataract formation in the lens of the eye. The formation of cataracts can lead toblindness in the affected eye. Therefore, the relationship between nutritional statusand cataract formation was examined. Those nutrients believed to influence thelens' ability to protect itself from the damaging effects of oxygen were studied. Thesubjects in this study were between 10 and 70 years of age. Seventy-seven subjectshad a cataract in at least one lens. Blood levels were determined for many vitaminsand minerals. The results suggested that the risk of cataract was reduced for sub-jects with the highest blood levels for vitamin D and carotenoids. Persons with cata-racts were found to have lower values for vitamin C and higher values for vitaminB-6 and the mineral selenium. The results obtained are consistent with the ideathat cataract formation may be delayed by nutrients that inhibit oxygen and accel-erated by those nutrients that influence the activation of oxygen. VITAMIN C STATUS AND NUTRIENT INTERACTIONS IN HEALTHY ELDERLY As part of its mission to study the relationship between nutrition and aging, theUSDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University carried outa survey of the nutritional status of healthy elderly in the Boston area. One purposeof the survey was to describe age- and institutionalized healthy elderly. Ap-proximately 1,000 volunteer subjects were studied. This report focuses on the vita-min C status of the 677 free-living subjects for whom vitamin C intake and bloodvitamin C data were available. Six percent of the males and 3 percent of the fe-males showed marginal vitamin C status. Average plasma vitamin C levels werehigher in the females compared to the males at all levels of vitamin C intake. Vita-min C supplement use was associated with higher blood levels for other vitaminsincluding vitamins B-6, B-12, E, and folate for both sexes. Females also showed in-creased levels of vitamin A with increased intake of vitamin C. From the results ofthis survey, increased levels of vitamin C in elderly females appear to be associatedwith improved status of vitamin E and folate. EXERCISE AND AGING Increased physical activity in the elderly has been shown to increase life expect-ancy even into advanced old age. Normal age-related changes in body composition, including increased fat mass and decreased muscle and bone mass, may be due inpart to decreasing physical activity. There is evidence that fat mass in physicallyactive adults shows no increase with age per se but rather is indirectly related toamount of exercise. Changes in body composition associated with age and/or inac-tivity are associated with decreased glucose tolerance and a greatly increased riskfor developing mature-onset diabetes. Research showed that 12 weeks of strengthtraining 3 days per week by adults 60-72 years resulted in a marked increase inextensor and flexor strength. This increase in muscle strength was associated withan 11.4 percent increase in the total muscle size of the thigh. A progressive resist-ance training program also was used to condition the knee extensor muscle of agroup of 10 institutionalized elderly men and women (mean age, 90 \u00b13 years). Regu-lar aerobic conditioning 4 days per week also causes significant improvement in V02max in glucose-intolerant older subjects. Such training also improves glucose toler-ance, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rates, and muscle glycogen stores. Thesestudies indicate that the capacity of skeletal muscle to adapt to an exercise inter-vention is preserved well into old age. VITAMIN B-6-DEFICIENCY AFFECTS INSULIN AND GLUCOSE IN ELDERLY The vitamin B-6 requirements of the elderly have been studies with four malesand four females, 61 to 67 years old, who completed a 3-month study in a metabolicunit. The effects of B-6 nutriture on plasma glucose and serum insulin levels werestudies, and glucose tolerance tests were conducted. The study protocol consisted ofa 5-day baseline period, followed by 17 to 20 days of a B-6-deficiency period duringwhich the subjects ingested a vitamin B-6-low diet. A person was considered B-6-deficient when the xanthurenic acid excreted in a 24-hour urine sample after a Itryptophan load was 300 mg or more. Following the B-6-deficiency period, therewere 3 stages of B-6-repletion, each lasting 21 days, during which periods the sub-jects ingested diets containing increasing amounts of vitamin B-6. Serum insulin15 levels was elevated during B-6-deficiency, and the increase was much greater in males than in females. Among males, but not females, an increase in plasma glu- cose also was observed during B-6-deficiency. The results of this study will help es- tablish requirements for vitamin B-6 in the elderly. SEASONAL VARIATION IN VITAMIN D REQUIREMENTS OF AGING WOMEN Currently there is no consensus on how to define the vitamin D requirement of the elderly. To develop a working definition of vitamin D adequacy, the relationship between vitamin D intake and serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) was examined in 333 healthy postmeno- pausal women enrolled in a calcium supplement field trial. When serum 25 (OH)D concentration drops below 32 mg/ml, then a late winter increase in PTH concentra- tion occurs. This seasonal increase in PTH has the potential to accelerate bone loss. The vitamin D intake required to maintain an adequate 25(OH)D level and prevent the wintertime increase in PTH was found to be 220 IU daily for healthy ambulato- ry postmenopausal women. Subjects with altered absorption or metabolism of vita- min D will require higher intake. To the extent that seasonal increases in PTH ad- versely affect bone health, as is commonly thought, the recommended dietary allow- ance for vitamin D of 200 IU daily is too low. ASSESSMENT OF BODY COMPOSITION IN AGING INDIVIDUALS An essential component in nutritional status assessment is the measurement of the body's fat-free mass (FFM) or lean body. One's ability, however, to accurately measure this compartment is limited in older individuals. Therefore, a study was undertaken to validate the total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) technique for assessing FFM in middle-aged and elderly individuals. One hundred fourteen men and women between 35 and 90 years of age served as research volunteers. Each vol- unteer underwent body composition assessment using traditional methods as well as the TOBEC method. The findings of the project demonstrated a significant relation- ship between the TOBEC measures of conductivity and the other traditional meth- ods of FFM assessment. It also was determined that the TOBEC method would be a better assessment of FFM in middle-aged and elderly prople because it is not affect- ed by changes in bone mineral content. VITAMIN E SUPPLEMENTATION AND IMMUNE RESPONSE IN ELDERLY Supplementation of old mice with vitamin E and glutathione has been shown to improve immune responsiveness. Therefore, the effect of daily vitamin E supple- mentation (800 IU for 30 days) on immune responses of 32 healthy subjects (60+ years old) was examined in a double-blind trial in a Metabolic Research Unit. De- skin tests lymphocyte prolif- eration, as well as interleukin 2(IL-2), prostaglandin E 2, plasma lipid peroxides, and other nutritional biochemistry profiles, were evaluated before and after treatment. In the vitamin E-supplemented group: (1) The vitamin E content was higher (P 0.005) in plasma and white blood cells than in the placebo group; (2) the cumulative score and number of positive antigens in DTH response were elevated; (3) the mito- genic response to optimal doses of ConA were increased; (4) IL-2 formation in re- sponse to ConA increased and (5) PGE2and plasma lipid peroxides were decreased. The data suggest that vitamin E supplementation improves immune responsiveness in healthy elderly. VITAMIN A AND VITAMIN E INTAKES IN ELDERLY Many comprehensive studies of the elderly ahve indicated that vitamin A defi- ciency is uncommon. Blood values for vitamin A have been shown to be similar in persons of various ages. Other studies have indicated that vitamin A storage levels in the liver are normal throughout the aging process. Despite these reports, other studies have shown that the elderly were consuming less than two-thirds of the RDA for vitamin A. This observation implies that the RDA may be too high for se- lected elderly persons. Liver overload with vitamin A can result in liver damage. The elderly often supplement with megadoses of vitamin E that have been shown to increase vitamin A uptake and storage. Accordingly, a study was conducted to deter- mine the relationships of supplemental and total vitamin A and vitamin E intake on vitamin A status. The main finding is that supplemental vitamin A is associated with greater levels of the ester form of vitamin A in blood and indicate that the elderly may be more sensitive to this form. Five of the elderly subjects with ex- tremely elevated circulating retinyl ester form of vitamin A also had indications of liver disease. Thus, vitamin A supplementation appears to result in more of the16 ester forms of vitamin A in blood of the elderly, which, in turn, may be associated with liver damage. REGULATION OF FERRITIN SYNTHESIS BY IRON Iron is essential in the diet, but in excessive amounts can damage the cells of the body. To prevent this, excess iron is stored in cells within a protein ferritin, made up of two types of subunits. In order to ensure enough ferritin molecules when the cell contains excess iron, formation of new ferritin is regulated by the level of free iron in the cells. It is now shown that this response occurs at the level of the cell DNA (transcription) and also at the site of protein formation (translation). The latter mechanism is rapid and ensures a quick build-up of new ferritin molecules, while translation control allows flexibility of the relative amounts of the two differ- ent types of subunits making up the ferritin molecules. This latter control point can optimize the ferritin molecule shell to promote efficient iron storage. EFFECT OF DIETARY CALORIE RESTRICTION As we age, our immune system does not function as well as when we are young. This decrease in immune function contributes to increased incidence of infectious disease and cancer in the aged. One of the most effective days to delay onset of im- munological changes associated with aging is dietary calorie restriction. The mecha- nisms of immunostimulatory effect of calorie restriction are not well understood. Calorie restriction has been found to reduce prostaglandin.E2 (PGE2) formation, a substance which suppresses cell-mediated immune function. The reduction in PGE2 formation, by calorie restriction, may, therefore, be an underlying mechanism for the immunostimulatory effect of calorie reduction. Although calorie restriction is very effective in delaying age-associated changes in immune response in rodents, it's recommendation to elderly persons is not practical. However, by understanding the mechanisms of effectiveness of calorie restriction, other more practical dietary inter- ventions can be designed. The importance of these findings is that PGE2 level-can be changed by dietary factors such as fat and vitamin E. ADEQUATE COPPER ESSENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM Dietary deficiency of copper, an essential micronutrient, impairs the immune system of humans and other animals. The biochemical mechanisms responsible for suppressed immune system in copper deficiency are unknown. Accordingly, studies were performed to examine the effects of dietary copper deficiency on the character- istics of several major classes of immune cells in the blood of young rats. Blood was chosen for analysis because it may be readily obtained from humans and may be useful for monitoring their copper status. Relative percentages of T-lymphocytes, were significantly reduced, while the percentage of B cells and monocytes were ele- vated by Cu deficiency. In vitro responsiveness to optimal concentrations of antigens was decreased 2-3 fold by Cu deficiency. The results demonstrate that dietary Cu deficiency alters the relative numbers and function of T-cells in peripheral blood of young rats and suggest that these changes may enhance susceptibility to infection. COPPER DEFICIENCY ALTERS RESPONSE OF PLATELETS Daily diets in the United States often contain less copper than required to com- pensate for daily losses through excretion. It is important, therefore, to assess the possible health consequences of low dietary copper. Knowledge needed to make such an assessment can be obtained by delineating which physiological components are altered when dietary copper is restricted. The present report shows that copper defi- ciency in rats affects the interaction between cytoskeletal proteins and alters the physiological response of platelets to thrombin, a naturally occurring platelet activa- tor. Specifically, copper deficiency enhanced myosin association with the cytoskele- ton of thrombin-activated platelets. Furthermore, the rise in intracellular free calci- um that normally occurs following thrombin activation was decreased 35 percent by copper deficiency. These findings indicate that functional properties of platelets, in- cluding secretions that depend on the interplay between cytoskeletal components following activation, are likely to be altered by copper deficiency. Since Platelets play a major role in homeostasis and thrombosis, and are involved in inflammation, immune reactions and interactions with tumor cells, changes in platelet function as- sociated with altered interaction between cytoskeletal components may contribute to the health effects of low copper status.17 ENERGY INTAKE AND BODY COMPOSITION RESPONSES TO EXERCISE IN OVERWEIGHT WOMEN Approximately one-third of American women are estimated to be overweight or obese. Several health risks are associated with obesity such as premature heart dis- ease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Overweight women will be at greater risk for these diseases once they have reached menopause. Thus, it's important to establish effective treatment programs for controlling weight prior to menopause. A study was conducted of 12 overweight women to determine the effect of daily exercise on food choices and nutrient intake. Body weight, lean body mass and body fat were measured throughout the study to determine if exercise af- fected body composition. Exercise did not affect, consistently, food choices or intake of calories, carbohydrate, protein or fat. Exercise did increase lean body mass. On the average, after 18 days of daily aerobic exercise, lean body mass increased ap- proximately 1 kg (2.2 lbs.) with exercise of moderate duration and an additional 1 kg with exercise of long duration. Exercise did not affect body fat consistently. The lack of an exercise effect on food intake indicates that individual response to exercise is not predictable. Thus, a weight control program of exercise alone cannot guarantee reduced food and caloric intake or loss of weight or body fat. DIETARY FATTY ACIDS AFFECT BLOOD PRESSURE IN ADULT MEN Coronary artery disease (CAD) causes more than half a million yearly deaths in the U.S. at a cost of over $60 billion a year. The dietary link between diet and CAD is most evident in the fat component. The decreased incidence of the disease ob- served during the last 20 years has been in part attributed to changes in type and quantity of fat Americans consume. A study was conducted to elucidate the bio- chemical mechanism and possibly reveal the cause-effect relationship. A diet con- taining a relatively high quantity of polyunsaturated fatty acids of the omega type fed to 24 free-living male subjects was found to cause increased production of a bio- logically potent substance called prostaglandin (PG)E2. PGE2 influences myocardial and coronary circulation and contributes to regulation of blood pressure. These re- sults suggest that some of the physiologic effects of certain diets are due to metabol- ic alternation of a group of hormone-like compounds called eicosanoids of which PGE2 is a member. DIETARY POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS REDUCE BLOOD COAGULATION Large intakes of saturated fatty acids are believed to increase the risk for heart attacks. This is caused by changes in blood platelets which make them clump more easily. Substituting polyunsaturated fatty acids for some saturated fatty acids in the diet should make platelet aggregation more difficult, and heart attacks more rare, by increasing the amount of aggregating agent needed to clump the platelets. In this study, minimum amounts of aggregating agents (ADP and collagen) needed to aggregate platelets were measured. Two groups of healthy men were fed diets which differed only in their amounts of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Total fat and saturated fatty acid levels did not differ between diets. It was found that the aggregation thresholds for ADP and collagen increased on the high polyun- saturated fatty diet, meaning that increasing the relative amount of polyunsaturat- ed fatty acids in the diet may decrease the risk for heart attacks. The effect of these fish oil fatty acids on blood platelet function was studied in rats by monitoring the responses of the cells in various types of agents that promote clot formation. Plate- lets from animals fed fish oil demonstrated decreased responsiveness to agents that stimulate signals by binding to receptors on the cell membrane. However, when an agent (fluoride) that bypasses the cellular membrane and stimulates platelets direct- ly was used, no differences were observed in responses between platelets from the two groups. These results suggest that dietary marine oils act to dampen receptor- mediated signals by interfering with the flow of information from the membrane surface to the interior of the cell. INFLUENCE OF DIETARY FIBER OF CHOLETSEROL There is a need to identify dietary components in foods which are effective in low- ering plasma cholesterol. The influence of combinations of oat and wheat bran on cholesterol and vitamins A and E were evaluated in cholesterol fed rats. When diets containing a mixture of oat and wheat fiber (2:1) were fed, significant reductions in liver cholesterol levels were observed. The availability of vitamins A and E was not affected by dietary fiber in cholesterol-fed rats. Oat fiber in combination with wheat18 fiber (2:1) provides sufficient oat fiber to effectively lower cholesterol. Oat fiberalone resulted in the greatest cholesterol reduction. - EFFECT OF AGE ON CALCIUM RETENTION IN BONE Osteoporosis, or thinning of the bones, is a serious health problem in the UnitedStates which occurs especially in older women and may be affected by the amountof calcium eaten. In an effort to determine whether increasing the calcium in thediet would result in \"stronger\" bones, young and aged female rats were used. Theyoung rats fed high calcium diets formed \"stronger\" bones compared to no effect forthe old rats also fed the higher amount of calcium. These results suggest that toassure strong bones, young people should eat foods that will provide adequate calci-um build-up in their bones. In contrast, in older females the use of dietary calciumsupplement may not prevent bone loss. EFFECT OF MENOPAUSE AND AGING ON SERUM CALCIUM AND PROTEIN Varying effects of menopause and aging on serum total and ionized calcium con-centrations have been reported. This has contributed to the difficulty in understand-ing the factors which regulate calcium and bone health in postmenopausal women.Accordingly, serum concentrations of total and ionized calcium, albumin, and globu-lins and serum pH were measured in 402 normal women, aged 18 to 72 years, whowere being enrolled into field trials. Serum total calcium was found to increase aftermenopause and decrease with aging. In serum, part of the calcium is ionized andpart is bound to albumin and globulins, with more binding at high pH. The increaseat menopause was associated with increases in serum globulins and serum pH. Theage-related decline in total calcium was associated with an age-related decline inserum. albumin concentration. Serum ionized calcium concentration did not varyeither with age or menopause. This study demonstrates the value of measuring ion-ized calcium in clinical studies of calcium and bone metabolism. BORON DEPLETION CAUSES BONE MINERAL LOSS IN HUMANS Osteoporosis is a disorder of older people which is characterized by the loss ofbone calcium and increased chances of bone fractures. Osteoporosis affects about 15to 20 million persons in the United States. About 1.3 million fractures caused byosteoporosis occur annually in people aged 45 years and older. A recent study hasconfirmed that the dietary lack of the mineral element, boron, contributed to the urinary loss of bone minerals and perhaps to the incidence of osteoporosis. Thus, a study was performed on 15 postmenopausal wom en and older men with the objec- tive of determining if the lack of boron in the diet may cause changes indicating suboptimal calcium metabolism and bone loss. The blood levels of three hormones involved in calcium metabolism, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, calcitonin and osteocalcin,were changed by boron deprivation in a way similar to that observed in women whohave postmenopausal osteoporosis. Boron apparently is needed for optimal calciummetabolism, and thus, is needed to prevent the excessive bone loss which oftenoccurs in postmenopausal women and older men. Eating diets rich in fruits, vegeta-bles, legumes, and nuts, which contain high amounts of boron, may help prevent osteoporosis. FECAL MUTAGENICITY, RISK FACTOR FOR COLORECTAL CANCER Cancer of the colon accounts for the second most common cause of cancer deathsin this country. To a large extent, diet and lifestyle have been implicated as con-tributory to this high mortality. In a search for indicators of risk, the ability of stoolextracts to cause mutational changes in certain test bacteria has been measured.Fecal mutagenicity was measured in 68 patients with colorectal cancer and 114 con-trols. Samples also were tested for fecapentaenes by high performance liquid chro-matography, to permit the separation of fecapentaene and non-fecapentaene muta-genicity. When samples containing high concentrations of* fecapentaenes were ex-cluded, the remaining TA98 mutagenicity was associated with a four-fold excess riskof colorectal cancer that achieved marginal statistical significance. It appears, there-fore, that this test system has predictive value in risk assessment for colon cancer. EXTENSION SERVICE, USDA AND STATE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICES The Cooperative Extension System, a nonformal educational network, links re-search, science, and technology to the needs of the elderly and to the caregivers ofthe frail elderly. This network of Federal, State/Territories and local governments19 employs 15,000 professionals most of whom devote a portion of an FTE to work with volunteers and other agencies and organizations to enhance the quality of life for many older people. CAREGIVING Caregiving in America is going to be in state of crisis as the number of older people continues to increase and the number of women in the work force continues to increase. Therefore, the Extension System is addressing the caregiving issue. Below are some ways this is being accomplished. Arkansas.-The Volunteer Information Provider Program (VIPP) is being con- ducted to reduce the economic impact of health care cost and to improve the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers. Volunteers in communities are trained to provide information on caregiving skills and community resources to caregivers. Over the past 2 years, 2,327 caregivers were able to extend the time that they kept their frail elderly at home (and out of a nursing home) by 1 year. This resulted in a savings of about $11,000 to each family/society. Montana.-Most aging programming that took place related to the issue of care- giving for dependent elderly. Pre- and post-tests on the myths and realities of aging consistently have indicated that substantial learning about the aging process does occur in the classes related to the understanding of aging. Parent caregiving (or caring for any elderly loved one) seems to be an issue whose time has come. Aging programs reached more than 11,000 persons by providing programs and information regarding nutrition and housing options for the elderly, in addition to the general aging and family life concerns. New Hampshire.-The Volunteer Information Provider Project (VIPP), a 21-hour workshop series developed at the University of Missouri's Center for Aging Studies, was offered to 6 of the 10 New Hampshire Homemakers Advisory Councils. Forty- eight volunteers received information related to aging and shared this information with 184 adults who were caring for their elderly friends or relatives. Caregivers and volunteers reported that, as a result of VIPP, they had gained skills and knowl- edge about the aging process, communication techniques, stress management, per- sonal care of the elderly person, consumer practices, and community resources for the elderly. Fifty caregivers reported a behavior change, stating that they were more effective in managing their stress and contacting community agencies for help in caregiving. Five counties offered a total of seven followup sessions to the VIPP. Seventy-two participants, attending these sessions, reported gaining knowledge about various topics including Medicare, Medicaid, housing options for the elderly, and Alzheimer's disease. North Carolina.-Two hundred and forty-seven caregivers for the elderly partici- pated in training sessions designed to increase their knowledge and skills in provid- ing elderly care. Oregon.-Educational programs were offered to adult children who are caregivers for dependent elderly parents. Texas.-23 counties involved 848 family members, respite volunteers and nursing home staff in seminars designed to enhance physical care skills, knowledge about normal aging versus various diseases affecting older adults, constructive problem solving and copying skills, involving other family members, and awareness of com- munity resources, Many agencies cooperated to bring this information to partici- pants including the Texas Department on Aging, Area Agencies on Aging, Depart- ment of Human Services, Department of Health, Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, South Texas Geriatric Education Center in San Antonio, Amer- ican Association of Retired Persons, Southwestern Bell, and local public libraries, hospitals, home health agencies, physicians, nurses and ministers. Evaluation re- sults showed that an increase in coping and problem-solving skills and greater knowledge about aging enabled participants of the seminar series to manage their stress and improve their relations with their older family members. DMEr, NuTRiToN AND HEALTH The elderly as a group are highly vulnerable to misleading information about nu- trition. Thus, as the elderly population increases, health and fitness will continue to be areas of primary concern to Cooperative Extension programming. More emphasis will be placed on specific nutritional requirements of the elderly. Alabama 1989.-Two thousand and eighty-six adults, senior citizens, and youth participated in workshops on nutrition and health lifestyles based on currently rec- ommended dietary guidelines. Followships surveys indicated that total of 924 indi-20 viduals gained knowledge and adopted new diet practices as a result of attending these workshops.Connecticut.-Extension home economists in Hartford and Middlesex counties de-veloped a two-part series on \"Using Medications Wisely\" aimed at elderly consum-ers. A $200 grant from the State Department of Aging defrayed the cost of the vi-suals developed for the series. The cooperative effort of the Department of Aging inpromoting programs and Cooperative Extension in implementing programs resultedin 25 programs being presented to 1,019 elderly consumers in Hartford and Middle- sex counties.Georgia 1989.-Educational Programs of the-Fort Valley State College for senior citizens were:-conducted five Wills and Estate Planning Workshops with 550 people participat- ing;-provided income tax assistance to to 40 senior citizens in two counties;-maintained senior citizen ID card program reaching 750 senior citizens in 30counties resulting in an average savings of $60 per month on prescription and nonprescription drugs;-assisted low-income senior citizens in filling out 1040A income tax forms;-sponsored five health fairs, one health conference, and reached 1,540 seniors; -and-conducted one seminar, Job Partnership Training Act (JPTA), to train 30 mi- nority senior citizens.Louisiana 1989.-Ten thousand elderly became aware of their nutritional needs atvarious stages of elderly life. A total of 9,672 elderly citizens improved their qualityof life through consuming nutritious food. Approximately 10,820 elderly learned pre-ventive measures: for health problems related to diet. Specific behavioral practicesimproved were control of excessive food intake, and the traditional habit of consum-ing foods high in fat, sugar, and salt. They also began to consume new nutritiousfoods. Approximately 250 elderly and young family members, suffering from heartdisease, improved their diets by consuming foods low in cholesterol, sugar andstarches. More than 3,000 people having hypertension improved their diets andstress management practices through workshops, training, counseling, and methoddemonstrations.North Carolina.-Major programming focused on diet and heart disease, weightcontrol, and physical activity. Many walking exercise groups were formed.South Dakota.-Twenty-five volunteer leaders presented a nutrition lesson to 320elderly people. Sixty older people attended lessons on \"Food, Medicine and You\"that were taught in cooperation with doctors and pharmacists. One hundred andfifty seniors partiepated in lessons on \"Cooking for One or Two.\" Seniors reportedchanging eating habits by consuming more calcium, using more low-fat products,and eating a greater variety of foods. They also reported that they were exercisingmore. A program offered in four sites raised seniors awareness of medicare and sup.: plemental health insurance.Texas.-A Minority Peer Educator Project was partially funded with a grant fromthe Administration of Aging. Sixteen counties in Texas and one in Missouri haveparticipated in the pilot project. Forty peer educators (20 Black and 20 Hispanic)have been teaching 800 nutrition site participants how to prevent or reduce hyper-tension and late, on-set diabetes. The methods used have been specially developedvideotapes followed by discussions. Depression has been a topic of great interest thathas been addressed. Based upon the pilot efforts, revisions are being made in thetraining curriculum for the peer educators. Early in 1990, the program will be dis-seminated across the State. Area Agencies on Aging and county Extension staffs are cooperators in this endeavor.Washington.-Ninety-five people, 50 years of age or older, have been trained andare functioning as Master Volunteers. They teach food preservation, food prepara- tion, and Community Service Employment Project (SCSEP) counselorsconducted on going job clubs for trainees 55 years and older. Sixteen percent of theSCSEP trainees graduated into unsubsidized employment. The Senior CompanionProgram (SCP) has included monthly training for volunteers. Training consisted oftopics such as assertiveness; hospice; community resources; elderhostel; fuel assist-ance; and medicare. Volunteers then shared this information with their clients.SCSEP employability and support counselors will continue assisting income eligiblepersons, 55 and older, to obtaining training sites. Emphasis will continue in the job21 development aspect of the project. SCSEP volunteers will continue to provide re- sources for home-bound elders. Money saved by keeping older people independent in their own homes is over 360,000 dollars/year and 31 older workers graduated to un- subsidized employment. North Carolina.-Two thousand nine hundred and two individuals acquired a combination of knowledge in retirement/estate planning. Results indicated that par- ticipants updated wills and changed banking and investment procedures. LIVING ARRANGEMENTS AND HOUSING Economic and social pressures continue to weigh heavily upon the elderly. The growing shortage of decent and affordable housing is forcing communities to utilize new housing arrangements. Connecticut.-Container gardening was developed for the wheel chair senior citi- zens at Dinan Memorial Center. This served as a means of therapy for many elderly who had enjoyed gardening when they were younger. To avoid legal problems, aWl sites were tested for lead as well as elemental nutritent levels. District of Columbia.-Urban vegetable gardening expansion and community im- provement programs were conducted for senior citizens and the elderly who could not leave home to participate in general Extension programs. Specific accomplish- ments: A 24-hour per day, 7 days a week educational Tip.O-Phone service was estab- lished in FY 1988. It makes accessible 275 educational subjects to the elderly, poor, and other local citizens. Iowa.-Legal, financial, leisure needs and changing life-styles of the later years were addressed through counseling, workshops, media releases, video, and bulletins. Seven hundred and fifty-eight family members attended workshops on evaluating their housing alternatives during retirement years. Two thousand three hundred and thirty family members analyzed nursing home insurance policies, compared benefits and considered purchases in light of personal goals. Preretirement program- ming assisted 563 persons in developing leisure and financial plans. A newsletter increased awareness on aging issues of 2,340 individuals, age 60 and over. One hun- dred and fifty-two persons were involved in two-generation farm family workshops on estate planning, work organization, communication, and financial planning. Three hundred and twelve family members with aging parents adopted supportive relationship patterns including: accurate methods for assessing and responding to needs of the elderly, local resource networking, and widening support of family members. Individuals facing loss and significant life changes developed resource management and human development skills to anticipate, prevent and/or resolve probelms associated with these changes. One hundred and sixty-four Volunteer Fi- nancial Counselors were trained to assist families experiencing difficulties. Montana.-Housing represents the largest financial commitment for most people. The growing number of elderly remaining in their homes are finding it necessary to change their housing situation. Some move into substandard and unsafe housing. Montana Extension is attacking this problem by making in-home visits to needy seniors. As a result of these visits, weatherization improvements were applied to 232 senior homes; 1,325 Indian reservation homes got repairs; 642 seniors attended home modification and safe access programs; and 1,200 elderly homeowners received home improvement resources. The Northeast Regional Center for Rural Development.-This Center has been sponsoring some work which explores retirement population growth as an alternate source of economic expansion for rural areas. This will provide information for the Revitalizing Rural America National Initiative on the issue of \"Rural communities are dependent on too few sources of income.\" Transfer payment and pension in- comes are steady sources of revenue. Early findings are that rural retirement coun- ties in the Northeast have grown four times faster than other rural counties and they have higher per capita incomes. This could prove valuable to the future of rural America, since small communities need new sources of revenue and senior citizens are in need of safe, affordable living conditions. An earlier stud partially funded by the Northeast Center showed that help with various daily tasks of life, assurance of adequate housing and maintaining good health are typically viewed as three priority requirements in the maintenance of independent living. Oklahoma.-The focus of the residential energy management program was to ad- dress the special energy-related needs of limited resource households, particularly those of the elderly. Primary emphasis was on training representatives of agencies and groups that ultimately reach elderly energy consumers. Major program activi- ties included: a satellite conference on Elderly Heat Stress, and two videotapes and five workshops on heat and cold stress. A total of 580 professionals, paraprofession-22 als and volunteers were reached, by the satellite conference and videotape dissemi-nation workshops. Followup surveys indicate that each program participant aftertraining reached an average of 30 elderly households or 17,400 individuals. Based onprevious research, this results in approximately 4,000 households saving an averageof $48 per year in household utility costs and over 15,000 increased household com-fort. Rhode Island.-Housing programs resulted in the improvement of housing for: 66low-income families and elderly, 21 female heads of households, 2 deinstitutionalizedwomen, and 154 homeless people. INTERGENERATIONAL Older retired persons and school age youth have a great deal to share with eachother. They can work together on community projects, homework assignments,engage in dialogue, learn skills, and enjoy outings together.Florida.-Accomplished women in sewing skills conducted a short-term project towork one-on-one with youths interested in learning to sew. Each youth received im-mediate help with this 4-H Clothing Construction Project.New Jersey.-Adopt-a-Grandparent programs have been initiated in Warren,Mercer, and Middlesex Counties. 4-H youth visit nursing home residents on a year-round basis providing interactive programming with older adults. The New JerseyState Department of Aging has provided \"hands-on\" learning kits for 4-H to utili-tize in conducting programs for older adults. These Bi-Folkal kits are available on aloan basis and have been utilized in several counties. Nursing home administratorshave worked cooperatively with 4-H youth to provide ongoing programs in pet ther-apy and plant therapy in six counties. Rutgers 4-H college students have providedongoing programs with over 200 elderly residents in the. New Brunswick NursingHome. Texas.-In Gray, Frio, and DeWitt counties, over 350 youth increased their aware-ness of aging through Adopt a Grandparent letter.writing programs. STRENGTHENING INTERPERSONAL SKILLS Alabama.-Eighty retirees participated in a 3-day camp titled \"School Days forRetirees.\" Personal safety, consumer fraud, medicare, and catastrophic health, hear-ing loss, and area history were some of the topics covered by lectures and work-shops. The camp is coordinated by the County Extension home economist and stafffrom the Area Agency on Aging. More and more older volunteers are serving onplanning and implementing committees for the activity.Puerto Rico.-Fifty community resource development committees were- formedand 95 elderly citizens were active members of these advisory committees.Texas.-Fifty-five programs reached 3,841 older adults with life stage manage-ment information including: retirement planning, housing choices and adaptation,driving,'elder abuse, health and disease prevention and management, (1,703), andsocial improvement and self concept in the elderly. Two hundred and eighty-sixolder widows participated in five programs on \"Your New Life Alone\" which fo-cused on grieving and developing positive coping skills. Twelve volunteers weretrained to lead \"Widow to Widow\" groups. Ten county recognition programs duringOlder Texan Month were attended by 870 older adults. Twenty-five outstanding sen-iors were recognized. Fifteen interagency coalitions on aging involved over 375 indi-viduals. Ten county programs targeted 583 older adults with information on increas-ing communication skills. ECONOMIC RESEARCH SERVICE ECONOMIC RESEARCH SERVICE CONTRIBUTION TO CONTROLLED CORRESPONDENCE REPLY TO SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING One of the research focuses of the Economic Research Service is rural develop-ment, and issues regarding older Americans are approached from that perspective.We actively participate in the Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics at theNational Institute of Health, to ensure that our research is backed by newly avail-able data and results of other current research. From this participation, our staffbecame aware of the underutilization of health care services by the rural elderlyand have begun research to determine the causes and consequences. The report isdue to be completed in the coming fiscal year.Our Senior Demographer served in a briefing capacity on issues concerning olderAmericans. He served on the advisory committee of the National Institute of Aging23 in response to Congressional inquiry into the need and feasibility of a Center for Studies of Older Rural Populations and prepared material for the committee's report on demographic aspects and trends of the older rural population. He also gave a talk in Anniston, Alabama on nonmetropolitan retirement to the Governor's Conference on Attracting Retirees to Alabama. Several research reports have been completed this year by our staff (in some cases co-authoring with university researchers) on issues concerning older Americans: Hoppe, Robert A., The Elderly and Their Sources of Income: Implications for Rural Development, forthcoming Rural Development Research Report.

USDA, FOREST SERVICE PROGRAMS SERVING THE ELDERLY SENIOR COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, in cooperation with the De- partment of Labor, sponsors the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), which is authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act, as amended. The SCSEP has three fundamental purposes: (1) Part-time income for disadvantaged persons aged 55 and over, (2) training and transition of participants to the private/ public sector labor markets; and (3) community services to the general public. This program employs economically disadvantaged persons aged 55 and older in 38 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The SCSEP seeks to improve the welfare of underprivileged, low-income elderly, and to foster a renewed sense of self- worth and community involvement among the rural elderly. Program participants are involved in projects on National Forest lands such as construction, rehabilitation, maintenance, and natural resource improvement work. Participants receive at least the minimum wage to supplement their personal in- comes. A major benefit of the SCSEP program is the opportunity to have partici- pants regain a sense of involvement with the mainstream of life through meaning- ful work. Additionally, valuable conservation projects are completed on National Forest lands. The Service's Interagency Agreement for July 1, 1988 to June 30, 1989, provided $22.2 million which employed an estimated 6,148 seniors; 23 percent were minori- ties, and 38 percent were women. Nineteen percent of the participants were later placed in nonsubsidized jobs. The Government reaped a return of $1.56 for each dollar invested in this program. VOLUNTEERS IN THE NATIONAL FORESTS The Volunteer Program offers individuals from all walks of life the opportunity to donate their services to help manage the Nation's natural resources. This program continues to grow in popularity as people realize how they can personally help carry out natural resources programs. Volunteers assist in almost all Forest Service pro- grams or activities except law enforcement and the collection of fees. They may choose to work in an office at a reception desk, operate a computer terminal, or con- duct natural history walks and auto tours. Volunteers may also be involved in out- door work such as building trails, maintaining campgrounds, and improving wildlife habitat. During fiscal year 1989, 8,392 persons aged 55 and above volunteered their serv- ices in the National Forest. FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICE, USDA NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR THE ELDERLY (NPE) Through the Food Distribution Program (FDP), the U.S. Department of Agricul- ture (USDA) donates foods and cash in lieu of foods to help met the nutritional needs of the elderly. Specifically, FDP serves elderly Americans through NPE, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). NPE is authorized under Titles m and VI the Older Americans Act of24 1965, as amended, to provide for social services and nutritious meals for elderlypeople. DHHS gives grants to State agencies on aging (SAA), which designate areaagencies on aging (AAA) to plan and coordinate the nutrition program through pro-viders of nutrition services at the local level under Title III. Title VI is administeredby Indian Tribal organizations and provides services similar to those provided underTitle III by SAAs. SAAs request USDA donated foods, cash in lieu of foods, or a combination of bothto use in providing meals to the elderly at various sites. The amount of food or cashthat USDA gives each State is based on the number of meals served in the programand the level of assistance per meal authorized by legislation and appropriations.Initially, USDA support of the program was provided in donated foods. This assistedUSDA in its price support and surplus removal activities as well as provided directsupport for the meals served in the program. However, once legislation authorizedcash in lieu of donated foods, the program increasingly became a cash transfer pro-gram. Presently, approximately 5 percent of USDA meal support is provided in do-nated foods. Nutrition services are provided in schools, community centers, churches, publichousing and other places located within walking distance of the homes of the major-ity of local elderly people. The AAAs provide nutritious, well-balanced meals atleast once a day, 5 or more days a week. The AAAs will also provide transportationto and from the sites for those who need it, when possible. Similarly, the AAAs willprovide home-delivered meals at least once a day, 5 or more days a week, when pos-sible, to older people who are homebound. Eligibility requires only that persons be 60 years of age or older to participate inthe program. Their spouses, regardless of age, may participate. In addition, whileeach provider of nutrition service suggests appropriate contributions based on localeconomic conditions, each person decides what he or she can contribute toward thecost of the meal. The meals are free to eligible persons if they are not able to makea contribution. Additionally, USDA offers food assistance to elderly people through the Food Dis-tribution Program for Charitable Institutions (e.g., soup kitchens and nursinghomes). The elderly may also receive available surplus foods through the TemporaryEmergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). These two programs do not restrictany person from participating based upon age; economic need is the only require-ment. Approximately 38 percent of TEFAP households are headed by persons age 60or older. Beginning in fiscal year 1990, the pilot project to allow AAAs to make their owncash/commodity elections independent of the State NPE elections became a perma-nent option. During fiscal year 1989, 103 AAA election sites participated in NPE; infiscal year 1990, 109 AAA election sites are participating. The AAAs must elect atleast 20 percent of their entitlement level in commodities to be eligible for participa-tion. This permanent option will allow the AAA election sites to make use ofUSDA's buying power:. Based on the cash and/or commodity elections made for fiscal year 1990, it is esti-mated the USDA assistance will be provided as follows: (1) State Title III-95 percentcash, 5 percent commodities; (2) AAA election sites-76 percent cash, 24 percentcommodities; and (3) Title VI-94 percent cash, 6 percent commodities.During fiscal year 1989, preliminary information indicates that approximately 248million meals were 'provided to the elderly under NPE. For fiscal year 1989,$141,293,000 was appropriated for NPE operations-$131,992,000 in cash assistanceand $9,301,000 in commodity assistance. For fiscal year 1990, the appropriation isestimated to be $145,531,000 for NPE operations. Amendments to the Older Ameri-cans act set the per meal reimbursement rate for NPE at $.5676 through fiscal year1991. The anticipated appropriation should be sufficient to enable USDA to reim-burse the number of meals anticipated to be served during fiscal year 1990 at thelegislated per meal level. However, the appropriation is subject to sequester under the provisions of PublicLaw 99-177 and Public Law 100-119. If the appropriation were permanently re-duced, then funds available would be lowered. THE CHILD AND ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM (CACFP) Since 1968, CACFP, formally the Child Care Food Program (CCFP), has providedcash reimbursement and donated foods to help provide.nutritious meals to childrenenrolled'in nonresidential child care centers. On November 29, 1987, Public Law100-175 amended the National School Lunch Act to allow certain adult day carecenters to be eligible for cash and commodity assistance under CACFP.25 Eligible for participation are public or private nonprofit centers which provide nonresidential adult day care to persons 60 years of age or over. Also, private for- profit adult day care centers may participate as proprietary Title XIX or proprie- tary Title XX centers if not less than 25 percent of their enrolled eligible adults are Title XIX or Title XX beneficiaries. Eligible centers provide day care to frail and elderly adults for the purpose of avoiding premature institutionalization by allowing families a respite from caregiving. Not eligible are sheltered workshops, vocational or substance abuse rehabilitation centers, social centers or other types of centers whose primary purpose or service is other than to provide day care to frail and el- derly adults. THE COMMODITY SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD PROGRAM (CSFP) The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a grant program administered by FNS that provides commodity supplemental food packages to low income women, infants, children, and persons 60 years of age and over. In some States, applicants must be determined to be at nutritional risk in order to be eligible for program par- ticipation. The packages distributed under CSFP provide foods containing the nutri- ents lacking in the diets of the target population. CSFP currently operates at 47 sites in 20 State agencies including the District of Columbia and one Indian Tribal Organization. The program is operated by State agencies, such as departments of health, social services, education, or agriculture. A local agency may be a public or private nonprofit agency that provides service to low-income persons. USDA donates commodity foods to the appropriate State agency for distribution and provides funds to State and local agencies to cover cer- tain administrative costs. USDA pays for the initial processing and packaging of the food and for transporting it to the first point of destination in the State. In accord- ance with program regulations, local agencies determine the eligibility of applicants, distribute supplemental foods, and provide nutrition education. Local agencies are also encouraged to develop health care linkages and, at a minimum, are required to advise participants of the importance of health care and where they can obtain health services. RESEARCH RELATED TO THE ELDERLY The FNS Office of Analysis and Evaluation conducted an elderly feeding study in 1989 which is expected to be issued early in 1990. The major objectives of the study were to describe the nutritional needs of the low-income elderly, identify the types of elderly being served by these nutrition assistance programs and evaluate how well the needs of the elderly are being served by USDA food assistance programs. In addition to interviewing by staff at the Federal, State, and local levels, the study included round-table discussions with 12 focus groups in three cities: Los An- geles, New Orleans, and Detroit. The focus groups were comprised of elderly partici- pants in one or more of the Federal food assistance programs, and elderly persons not participating in any or all of these programs. The focus groups involved a total of 125 persons. ELDERLY FOOD STAMP PROVISIONS Under the Food Stamp Act, there are several special provisions for the elderly. Elderly is defined as anyone 60 years of age or older. An elderly person who is unable to go to the food stamp office and be interviewed and who does not have someone who will do this for him/her may request that the office interview be waived. If the office interview is waived, the State agency will either conduct a telephone interview or make a home visit. Households in which all members are receiving Supplemental Security Income are eligible without regard to the resource and income tests, social security number requirements and residency. Households may apply for food stamps at the Social Se- curity Administration (SSA) office. Persons applying for social security benefits must be informed at the office of the availability of food stamp benefits. Social Security applicants and recipients may get a food stamp application at the SSA office, but they must then take or mail the food stamp application to the food stamp office. Most residents of institutions are ineligible. However, there are exceptions for residents of federally subsidized housing for the elderly, and disabled or blind indi- viduals who are residents of certain group living arrangements who receive Social Security or Supplemental Security Income.26 Normally all parents and children and siblings who live together are combined into one household even if they purchase and prepare meals separately. However, there are some exceptions. If the parent or sibling is elderly or disabled, he or she may be certified as a separate household if he or she purchases and prepares meals separately. Normally people who live together and purchase and prepare meals together are combined into one household. However, if a person is elderly and unable to prepare meals he or she may be a separate household if the income of the others with whom he or she lives does not exceed 165 percent of the poverty line. Elderly persons are exempt from the student disqualification criteria. Elderly persons are exempt from the work requirements. A household with at least one elderly person may have countable resources of up to $3,000. The limit for other households is $2,000. Households that contain an elderly member do not have to meet the gross income test. They only have to meet the net income test which is defined as 100 percent of the Federal income poverty level. Certain medical costs for elderly members are deducted in determining a house- hold's net income upon which the allotment is based. The deduction is allowed to the extent that the costs exceed $35 per month per household. Only nonreimbursa- ble costs for elderly or disabled members are deducted. All households are entitled to a deduction for shelter costs that exceed 50 percent of income after all other deductions have been allowed. For most, households there is a limit on the maximum amount of the shelter deduction. For households with an elderly or disabled member, there is no cap. All eligible one- and two-person house- holds are entitled to a $10 minimum allotment except in the initial month. Households with no earned income in which all members are elderly or disabled cannot be required to report household circumstances monthly, and they must be certified prospectively. SSI households in California and Wisconsin are cashed-out. That is, they receive a cash supplement to their SSI benefits instead of food stamps. There are seven other elderly cash-out demonstration projects in which eligible households receive cash instead of coupons. Other demonstration projects are authorized in other areas. These could affect SSI housholds. ITEM 2. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE JANUARY 10, 1990. DEAR MR.

The Forum en- courages cooperation among Federal agencies in the development, collection, analy- sis, and dissemination of data pertaining to the older population. Through coopera- tion and coordinated approached, The Forum extends the use of limited resources among agencies through joint problem solving, indentification of data gaps and im- provement of the statistical information bases on the older population that are used to set the priorities of the work of individual agencies. The participants are appoint- ed by the directors of the agencies and have broad policymaking authority within the agency. Senior subject-matter specialists from the agencies are also involved in the activities of The Forum. The Forum was co-chaired in 1989 by C. Louis Kincan- non, Deputy Director, Bureau of the Census, Manning Feinleib, Director, National Center for Health Statistics, and T. Franklin Williams, Director, National Institute on Aging. At the initial meeting of The Forum, held October 24, 1986, it was agreed that The Forum would work on the following activities: (1) Identify data gaps, potential research topics, and inconsistencies among agencies in the collection and presenta- tion of data related to the older population; (2) create opportunities for joint re- 26-386 0 -90 -228 searchand publications among agencies; (3) improve access to data on the older pop-ulation; (4) identify statistical and methodological problems in the collection of dataon the older population and investigate questions of data quality; and (5) work withother countries to promote consistency in definitions and presentation of data on the older population.Three standing committees were established to carry out specific activities: (1)Data Needs and Analytic Issues, chaired by Joan Van Nostrand (National Centerfor Health Statistics): (2) Methodological Issues, chaired by Richard Suzman (Nation-al Institute on Aging); and (3) Data Presentation and Dissemination, chaired by Cyn-thia Taeuber (Bureau of the Census).The work of.The Forum facilitates the exchange of information about needs at thetime new data are being developed or changes are being made in existing data sys-tems. It also works to promote communication between data producers and policym akers. .. .aAs part of The Forum's work to improve access to data on the older population,the Census Bureau has published a Forum Telephone Contact List of major agenciesand staff who work on specific aspects of aging-related statistics, the Inventory ofData on the Oldest Od, which is 'a reference document of Federal data bases on theoldest old population, and the 1988 Annual Report of the Forum, which reviews theactivities of The Forum and its member agencies during 1987 and 1988. Various sec-tions of the annual; report summarize Forum work and accomplishments, coopera-tive efforts of members, publications by member agencies, and activities planned for 1989. II. Projects Between the Census Bureau and the Administration on Aging A report titled \"Guide. to 1980 Census Data on Elderly,\" was published in 1986.This guide explains how to locate census data on the older population. The reportreviews census products, services, and explains how to obtain them. The report hastable outlines from the census publications and summary tape filesto show the spe-cific form of data available about the older population. II Projects Between the Census Bureau and the National Institute on Aging A. The Census Bureau prepared special tabulations from the 1980 census for theNational Institute on Aging. These tabulations include selected tables from Summa-ry Tape File 5 retabulated with 5-year age groups from 60 years to 85 years andover. These tabulations also include other selected tabulations from the 1980 census.The University of Michigan archives these tabulations (Barbara Zimmerman, 313- 763-5010).B. Developed an international data base on the older population. The Universityof Michigan archives this data base (Barbara Zimmerman, 313-763-5010).C. Established a joint Visiting Scholar Program to allow scholars to do research in residence at the Census Bureau.D. Study of the quality of census data on the elderly includes an evaluation ofcoverage, age misreporting, estimates, and projections of centenarians, and so forth.E. Preparation of a file .from the Survey of Income and Program Participation(SIPP) on the health, wealth, and economic status of the older population. The SIPPfile is completed and is archived at the University of Michigan (Barbara Zimmer- man, 313-763-5010).F. Programming is near completion for the annual report on the older population,Aging America: 1988, using Current Population- Survey data. Data will be-providedfor persons aged 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and over. Most data will be cross-tabulated bysex, race and Hispanic origin. Some data will be produced in confidence intervals because of small sample sizes for the aged.G. Provided The National Institute. on Aging with special tabulations on poverty of rural elderly (from 1980 Census).-H. A paper titled \"Minority Elderly: An Overview of Demographic Characteris-tics\" was prepared by Cynithia M. Taeuber and Denise I. Smith of the CensusBureau. The paper focuses on increases in the minorityelderly population,,those 65years and over. and' the differences among age, race, and ethnic groups within. theolder population. Some of the characteristics of the minority elderly population dis-cussed are marital status, living arrangements, median income and poverty status.The paper also presents an overview of the planned 1990 census questions on race and ethnicity.I. \"A Demographic Portrait of America's Oldest OOld was prepared by Cynthia M.Taeuber, Bureau of the Census, and Ira Rosenwaike, Graduate School.of SocialWork, University of Pennsylvania, for a chapter in a book. This chapter looks at the29 rapid growth of the oldest old population, those 85 years and over and the reasonsfor that growth. This chapter also: (1) compares the oldest old's demographic, social,and economic characteristics with those of the younger old; (2) describes the charac-teristics of the centenarian population; (3) examines the quality of census data onthe oldest old; and (4) discusses the implications of the growth and characteristics ofthis unique and important group. J. Reprogrammed the regularly published tabulations of the Current PopulationSurvey to include data for the population \"65 to 74 years\" and \"75 years and over\"in annual reports (see expecially P-20, Nos. 431, 433, 437, P-60, No. 166, the forth-coming report on educational attainment, and the forthcoming reports on moneyincome and poverty). IV. International Research on Aging A. Studies from the International Data Base on Aging:1. Published the first three of a series of 20 statistical briefs: \"Aging Trends-Barbados,\" Kevin Kinsella of the Census Bureau. These profiles include a con-trast of current and future numbers and proportion of older populations andcomparative data for other nations in the immediate geographical region. 2. A paper titled \"Living Arrangements of the Elderly and Social Policy: ACross-National Perspective\" was prepared by Kevin Kinsella of the CensusBureau. The paper examines family and household structure, changes overtime, and potential implications for social support and expenditures. 3. \"A Comparative Study of the Economics of the Aged,\" presented at theConference on Aged Populations and the Gray Revolution in Louvain, Belgium.Barbara Boyle Torrey and Kevin Kinsella of the Bureau of the Census and Tim-othy Smeeding of Vanderbilt University are the authors of this paper. Thepaper presents estimates of how social insurance programs for the aged havegrown as a percentage of gross domestic product in several countries partly as aresult of lowering retirement age and an increase in real benefits. It then dis-cusses how the labor force participation of the aged in these countries has uni-formly declined. Finally, it examines what contribution the Social Security ben-efit makes to the total income of the aged at present and how the averageincome of the aged compares to the average national income in each country. 4. \"The Oldest Old-International Perspectives,\" submitted as a chapter in afuture Oxford University Press publication. Barbara Boyle Torrey and KevinKinsella of the Bureau of the Census and George Myers of Duke University arethe authors of this paper. The paper focuses on three topics related to the oldestold (80-plus) in eight countries. The topics discussed are demographic trends,marital status and living arrangements, and income. The paper shows cross-country comparisons and trend data on the above topics for the period 1985 to2025. 5. Aging in the Third World has been published in International PopulationReports, Series P-95, No. 79. 6. An Aging World has been published in International Population Reports,Series P-95, No. 78. B. Completed a contract with Meyer Zitter, a consultant in Demographics, towork with other industrialized countries to produce internationally-comparable dataon the older population from the 1990 round of censuses. A report titled \"Compara-tive International Statistics available on the Older Population\" was prepared byMeyer Zitter and will be available in 1990 after review by the countries. The reportfocuses on data available from the 1980 round of censuses and what subjects will beavailable from the 1990 round of censuses. The countries also sent 1980 census tabu-lations that are somewhat comparable. Ths report will make it possible to recom-mend tabluations for 1990 that countries may wish to produce to allow internationalcomparability. V. Other A.

Worked with the Department of Housing and Urban Development'to produce tabulations from the Survey of Income and Program Participation for use in-design- ing reverse annuity mortgage programs for low-income elderly homeowners. E. A paper., titled \"How Are The Elderly Housed? New Data From the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation,\" was presented at the April 23, 1988 Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America in New Orleans, LA. The author of this paper is Arnold A. Goldstein, Population Division, Bureau of the Census. This paper serves the dual purpose of reporting on the housing characteris- tics of elderly households of various'age 'groups, and of introducing the Health- Wealth file from the 1984 Survey of Income and Program'Participation (SIPP). The paper described the prevalence of various housing types, household size, length of residence in the present housing unit, and the age of the structure itself. Level of comfort is measured in terms of extent of crowding, number of floors, type of heat- ing fuel and presence of air conditioning, and availability of various appliances. Af- fordability, and important public policy consideration, is addressed separately for owners and renters. The paper also considers the extent to which low-income older households benefit from rent and mortgage interest subsidies, and whether many of these households are on a waiting list to gain access to public housing. ITEM 3. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DECEMBER 22, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Your letter of October 11, asked for a report from the De- partment of Defense chronicling activities on behalf of older Americans. It is hoped, that the enclosed report will be of value in this important program area. Should further information be desired a point of contact on this staff is Larry Kirsch on.697-5421. Sincerely, ...* . . ~~~~~~~FRANK P. Secreteary (Civilian Personnel Policy). Enclosure: .. ' REPORT: DEVELOPMENTS IN AGING This Department continues to operate a comprehensive retirement planning for Defense Federal Service employees. Integrated into the overall personnel manage- ment process, our program is designed primarily to assist employees in their adjust- ment to retirement and-to assist management in planning for replacements'to meet future work force needs. The program encourages extensive pre-retirement counsel- ing for employees (and their spouses in many instances) on such subjects as fman- cial planning, health needs, leisure time activities, living arrangements and person- al guidance. The Military Departments and the Defense Agencies, in cooperation with commu- nity health officials, continue to provide a number of occupational health programs and services to employees, and in some cases, to former employees who have retired. Many of these programs and services are designed to address problems generally as- sociated with increasing age. Included are health guidance and counseling periodic testing for diseases and disorder, immunizations, and treatment. Within the Department of Defense, we continue to eliminate discrimination based upon age. On a continuing basis we are examining personnel policies, practices, and procedures for possible conflict with equal employment opportunity intent, includ- ing discriminatory use of age. In summary, this Department has operated a comprehensive retirement planning program for civilians, provided xtensive' health care services to employees and car- ried out a positive program to preclude discrimination based on age. These'program efforts will be continued in 1990. ITEM 4. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 29, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In accordance with your request; enclosed is the Depart- ment of Education's fiscal year 1989 report chronicling activities on behalf of older Americans. I am pleased to transmit this summary.to you for inclusion in the Committee's annual report entitled, Developments in Aging.31 If the Office of Legislation can be of further assistance, please let me know.

ADULT EDUCATION The U.S. Department of Education is authorized under the Adult Education Act, as revised by Public Law 100-297 to provide funds to the States and outlying areas for educational programs and support services benefiting all segments of the eligible adult population. The purpose of the Act, which was reauthorized in 1988 for 5 years, is to encourage the establishment of programs of adult education that will enable adults 16 years of age or older who are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance under State law: (1) To acquire the basic skills necessary for literate functioning; (2) To provide sufficient basic education to enable these adults to benefit fromtraining and to obtain productive employment; and (3) To enable adults who so desire to continue their education to at least sec-ondary level completion. Those adults who have completed the secondary level but are functioning at a lower level are eligible to participate in the program. Students seeking employabil- ity skills are also given the means to secure training that will help them to become more employable, productive, and responsible citizens. Federal funds support up to 90 percent of each State's program for the 1988 and 1989 grant years; 85 percent for 1990; 80 percent for 1991; and 75 percent of 1992 and thereafter. Federal funds also supply up to 100 percent of the program in outlying areas. At least 10 percent of each State's allotment must be used for special experimental demonstration projects and teacher training, and at least 10 percent of the States' allotment must be used for corrections education and education of other institutionalized adults. In addition to the basic State-administered program, the Act authorizes funds for workplace lit- eracy and English literacy. The Act also authorizes various National programs in- cluding a program of adult literacy volunteer training. In order to discuss the specifics of the efforts aimed at older adults, one must first be aware of the demographic changes which have a profound impact upon this group. According to the 1980 census, the median age of the population in that year was 30.1 years. By 1990, the median age is expected to rise to 33 years. This \"graying\" of the U.S. population will inevitably continue for several decades after 1990. By the year 2000, technology and the shift to the service sector will reduce the need for unskilled workers and increase the need for workers with higher skill levels. With the decline of the number of young workers, the average age of the workforce will rise significantly. Many of the emerging workforce participants, in- cluding a large number of older adults, lack the basic literacy skills necessary to meet the increased demands of rapid change and new technology. Thus, employers will have to make training and retraining a priority in order to upgrade the labor force. The education of older persons has rarely ranked high as an educational priority in the United States, although the 1970's may well be considered the decade of growth in educational gerontology. Demographics have tended to make this develop- ment inevitable. Nearly half of the 15.6 million adults 70 years old and over, and about 36 percent of the 8.6 million adults age 65 to 69, have had 8 years of schooling or less (1980 census data). Such a high rate of under-education indicates a need for emphasizing effective basic and coping skills in programs for older adults. The adult education program, which is administered by the Office of Vocational and Adult Education, is charged with addressing the needs of under-educated adults. In 1988 the total number of participants in the program was 3 million. The number of participants in the 45 to 59 year range was estimated to be 338,395 and that of the group 60 or older was 195,184. Currently, some 17.5 percent of persons in adult education programs are 45 years of age or older. According to 1982 censusdata, nearly one-third of all adult illiterates are aged 60 or over. In response to this data, the Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Initiative has focusedattention on this serious problem. The adult education program addresses the needs of older adults by emphasizing functional competency and grade level progression. States operate special projects to improve services for older persons through individualized instruction, use of media, home-based instruction, and through curricula focused on coping with daily prob- lems in maintaining health, managing money, using community resources, under- standing government and participating in civic activities.32 Equally significant is-the expanding delivery system, including radio, television, and courses by newspaper, as well as clearinghouses and satellite centers designed to overcome barriers to participation. Where needed, supportive services such as transportation and lunch are provided, as are outreach activities adapting programs to the life situations and experiences of older persons. Self-learning preferences are recognized and assisted by providing information, guidance and study materials. To reach more older persons, adult education programs operate in conjunction with senior citizens, nutrition programs, nursing homes, retirement and day care centers. In conclusion, the Federal adult education program will continue'to seek to meet the learning needs of older Americans. Increased cooperation among the organiza- tions, institutions and community groups involved in this area at national, State, and local levels should lead to increased sharing of resources and improved services. ENFORCEMENT OF THE AGE DISCRIMINATION ACT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION The Department of Education's (ED) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcement of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (Act), as it relates to discrimi- nation on the basis of age in federally funded education programs or activities. The Act contains certain exceptions which permit, under limited circumstances, contin- ued use of age distinctions or factors other than age that may have a disproportion- ate effect on the basis of age. The Department of Health and Human Services has published a general govern- ment-wide regulation. Each agency that provides Federal financial assistance must publish a final agency specific regulation. OCR is enforcing the Act under the gener- al government-wide regulation until an ED specific regulation is published. An ED specific-regulation for implementing the Act was submitted by OCR to other compo- nents in the Department for review and comment, and has been revised based on those comments. The redrafted regulation will be forwarded shortly to the Secretary of Education for submission to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and, subsequently, to the Office of Management and Budget. After their review and ap- proval, the final ED specific regulation will be published in the Federal Register. The Act gives OCR the authority to investigate programs or activities receiving Fed- eral financial assistance from ED. OCR does not have the authority to investigate employment complaints under the Act. Employment complaints either are sent to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which has jurisdiction under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) for certain types of age discrimination cases, or are closed using the procedures described below. . Under the government-wide regulation, OCR forwards complaints alleging age dis- crimination to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) for resolution through mediation. FMCS has 60 days to mediate the age-only complaints or the age portion of multiple-base complaints. For complaints alleging discrimination on the-- basis of age and another jurisdiction (i.e., Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 which prohibits discrimination on'the basis of sex; and/or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination on. the basis of physical and mental handicap), the applicable OCR case processing time- frames are tolled for 60 days (or until the complaint is re- turned from.FMCS, whichever-is earlier) to allow FMCS to process the age portion. of the case. OCR.notifies the complainant(s) of the duration of the tolling of the time frames. If FMCS is successful in mediating a complaint filed solely on the basis of age within the 60 days allowed, OCR closes the case. If the case is not resolved, OCR investigates allegations in accordance with the applicable OCR case processing time frames. If the case was filed on the basis of age and another jurisdiction (e.g., Title VI), an attempt first is made by FMCS to mediate the age portion of the case, as described above. If FMCS is successful in mediating the age portion of the case within the 60 day time'limit, OCR then processes the other allegations in the com- plaint within the applicable OCR case processing time frames. If FMCS is not suc- cessful in mediating an agreement between the complainant and the recipient on the age portion of the complaint, the case is returned to OCR, and OCR processes the complaint allegations in accordance with the applicable OCR case processing time frames. - Age complaints involving employment filed, by persons over the age of 40 are re- ferred to the appropriate EEOC regional office under the ADEA, and the OCR file is closed. EEOC does not have jurisdiction over age/employment complaints that in- volve persons under 40 years of age. If the complainant-is under 40 years of age, and the complaint filed with OCR alleges only employment discrimination, the com-33 plainant is informed that there is no jurisdiction under the ADEA, and the case is administratively closed. OCR received 113 age-only complaints in FY 1989, 51 of which were forwarded to FMCS for mediation. [Most of the complaints that OCR did not forward to FMCS were closed by OCR for lack of jurisdiction.] Two of the 51 cases were successfully mediated by FMCS. These two cases involved the issues of \"financial assistance to students\" and \"course/degree offerings.\" Fifty age-only cases that were not mediat- ed successfully by FMCS were returned to OCR in FY 1989 for processing, including 1 case referred in a previous fiscal year. Forty-six of these 50 cases were closed by OCR in FY 1989. Twenty-seven of the cases were closed after OCR's investigation found no violation of the age discrimination statute enforced by OCR; 13 were closed for lack of jurisdiction; 5 were closed with corrective action, or agreed-upon correc- tive action, by the recipient; and 1 case was withdrawn by the complainant without change. The majority of these closed cases involved the issue of \"health benefits and services coverage.\" There were 4 age-only cases pending at FMCS at the end of FY 1989. OCR closed 118 age-only complaints in FY 1989, some of which had been received in previous fiscal years. Seventy-one of the complaints were closed for lack of juris- diction (including 49 that were referred to other agencies for processing). Six of the complaints were closed for other administrative reasons (including one that was re- ferred to another agency for processing). Thirty-two of the cases were investigated by OCR and resulted in no violation findings. Nine complaints were resolved with corrective action on the part of the recipient including the 2 complaints, listed above, that were successfully mediated by FMCS. There were 8 age-only complaints pending in OCR at the end of the fiscal year (including cases not successfully medi- ated by FMCS and returned to OCR for processing). In FY 1989, OCR received 110 multiple-bases age complaints. Of those, 35 were forwarded to FMCS for processing. [Most of the complaints that OCR did not for- ward to FMCS were closed by OCR for lack of jurisdiction or for other administra- tive reasons (e.g., -the complaint was incomplete or untimely, or withdrawn by the complainant.)] One multiple-bases complaint was successfully mediated by FMCS. The issue cited in this case was \"related aids and services/auxiliary aids for stu- dents with physical and mental impairments.\" A second complaint, forwarded to FMCS in FY 1988, also was successfully mediated by FMCS in FY 1989. The issue cited in this case was \"application for admissions requirements/forms.\" One hundred ninety-three multiple-bases age cases (the majority of which had been referred in a previous fiscal year) were not resolved successfully by FMCS and were returned to OCR for processing. One hundred and eighty-two of the 193 multi- ple-bases age cases were closed by OCR in FY 1989. One hundred and two of the cases were closed with corrective action, or agreed-upon corrective action, by the re- cipient; 37 were closed for lack of jurisdiction; 36 were closed after OCR's investiga- tion found no violation of the civil rights statutes enforced by OCR, and 7 were closed for administrative reasons. The majority of these closed cases involved the issue of \"health benefits and services coverage.\" There were 6 multiple-bases age complaints pending at FMCS at the end of FY 1989. OCR closed 338 multiple-bases age complaints in FY 1989, some of which had been received in previous fiscal years. Seventy-two of the complaints were closed for lack of jurisdiction (including 19 that were referred to EEOC or other agencies for proc- essing). Twenty-seven were closed for other administrative reasons; 60 were investi- gated and no violations were found; and 179 were closed with corrective action on the part of the recipient. Of the 179 closures resulting in change, the issues cited most frequently was \"health benefits and services coverage\" (168 cases). There were 41 multiple-bases age complaints pending in OCR at the end of the fiscal year (in- cluding cases not successfully mediated by FMCS and returned to OCR for process- ing). The 223 cases with age as one or more bases of discrimination represented ap- proximately 8 percent of the total complaints received by OCR during FY 1989. Eighty-six complaints were referred to FMCS for mediation, 3 of which were mediat- ed successfully. An additional complaint, referred in a previous fiscal year, was also successfully mediated by FMCS in FY 1989. The number of age related complaints decreased from 400 in FY 1988 (56 age-only and 344 multiple-bases) to 223 (113 age- only and 110 multiple-bases) in FY 1989. OCR confined its age discrimination compliance activities to complaint investiga- tions; no compliance reviews on age discrimination issues were conducted in FY 1989.34 OmCE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION Amm REHABITATivE SERVICES REHABILITATION SERVICES ADMINITATION (RSA) Basic Vocational Rehabilitation Programs The State-Federal program of vocational rehabilitation is designed to provide a wide variety of services to adults with disabilities for the purpose of placing them into gainful employment. There are no upper or lower age limits for clients of State rehabilitation agencies. Although the mean age at referral of individuals vocational- ly rehabilitated in Fiscal Year 1986 (the latest year for which such data are avail- able) was 32.6 years, 10.6 percent of these persons were 45 to 54 years old; 6.0 per- cent were 55 to 64 years old; and 2.5 percent were 65 years old and over. Nearly one rehabilitated person in five was 45 years of age or older when referred for rehabili- tation services. The total number of individuals of all ages rehabilitated in Fiscal Year 1986 was 223,354. Age is not a barrier to eligibility for services for older per- sons with disabilities who wish to work. RSA submitted, and the topic was selected, a Fiscal Year 1990 Institute on Rehabilitation Issues (ERI) study on Aging in Amer- ica. The IRI study results will be used.for training vocational rehabilitation staff in this area. Discretionary Programs RSA also administers grants for a number of discretionary programs in which older Americans may be served, such as Special Demonstration Programs for Se- verely Disabled Individuals, Special Recreation Programs, Centers for Independent Living Projects, and Helen Keler National Center. These programs serve persons of any age, however the special projects authority is directed at vocational outcomes. Data on the actual number of older Americans.served in these programs, however, are not available. The Independent Living Services for Older Blind Individuals program is one RSA program that specifically focuses on older persons. Visual impairment is clearly as- sociated with increasing age: Final Regulations for Title VII, Part C. Independent Living Services for Older Blind Individuals were published in the Federal Register on July 15, 1988. The purpose of these projects is to provide or arrange for independent living. reha- bilitation services needed by older blind individuals in order for them to adjust to blindness by becoming more independent in caring for their individual needs. Such services will enable these persons to live more independently in their homes and communities withthe maximum degree of self- direction. The population to be assisted by projects under this program is defined by statute as individuals who are 55 years or older, whose.severe visual impairment makes gainful employment extremely difficult to attain.but for whom independent living. goals are feasible. Independent living.services are both feasible and.appropriate for. this population because these services can have a lasting and permanent impact on. increasing personal independence as well as more active or continued participation in family and community life. One successful outcome of this program would be to reduce the risk of premature or unnecessary institutionalization for participating individuals. In Fiscal Year 1989, this program funded the second year of 28 three-year projects, with an average grant award of $200,000. Total funding for this program in FY 1989 was $5.7 mil- lion. The Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults hired a, new staff member in 1989 to work exclusively on the problems of older persons with deaf-blindness. Thisstaff member is working with State offices to facilitate the es- tablishment of new service models aimed at community-based services for older per- sons who are deaf-blind. The Projects With Industry (PWI) program also addresses the needs of older indi- viduals with disabilities. The PWI program is designed to provide training and/or placement services for disabled individuals to assist them in obtaining gainful em- ploy'ment. The PWI program currently funds 114 grantees nationwide in its services delivery network. This effort spans a broad range of disability and age categories. PWI has addressed the needs of a growing older disabled work population by awarding funds to the \"Aging in America\" (AIA) project in New York. In 1980, AIA conducted a national survey which found that approximately 60 percent of the dis- abled population in the United States is 45 years of age or older. Since 1983, AIA's placement programs have resulted in over 1,900 Statewide (New York) and national placements of disabled individuals aged 45 years and older. During the first months35 of Fiscal Year 1989, AIA has placed more than 247 individuals with disabilities aged 45 and over into competitive employment. The average annual salary is over $14,000 per placement. AIA and most PWI programs are attempting to meet the increasing needs and numbers of disabled Americans 45 years of age and older. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION RESEARCH (NIDRR) The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, authorized by Title II of the Rehabilitation Act, has specific responsibilities for the provision of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to the administration of research, demon- stration projects and related activities for the rehabilitation of disabled persons, in- cluding programs designed to train persons who provide rehabilitation services and persons who conduct research. The Institute is also responsible for facilitating the distribution of information on developments in rehabilitation procedures, methods and devices to rehabilitation professionals and to disabled individuals to assist such individuals in living more independent lives. NIDRR-supported programs whichimpact on the aging population include: Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers These Centers serve as a national resource for the conduct of a full spectrum of rehabilitation research activities. Research is conducted in settings where patient/ client services, research and training are viewed as interdependent activities essen- tial to maximizing the rehabilitation of disabled individuals. The rationale for this operational approach is the belief that research cannot be isolated and still be effec-tively utilized. Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers on Aging.-In response to an in- creased public concern about the lack of rehabilitation services for the older dis- abled population, NIDRR supports three Centers which focus solely on the rehabili- tation of aging persons. Research is directed toward the identification of the reha- bilitation needs of elderly persons and the development of appropriate rehabilitation techniques. These Centers and their activities are described below: -Rancho Los Amigos Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Aging, Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center, University of Southern California, Downey, California. This Center is a collaborative effort between the Rancho Los Amigos Rehabilitation Hospital and the School of Medicine of the University of South- ern California. Research is focused on medical, functional, psychological, social, policy and service delivery issues. The Center's training activities are designed to improve knowledge and skills regarding rehabilitation and the older person, and are targeted to students and practitioners in rehabilitation and otherhealth-care disciplines. -Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Aging, University of Pennsyl- vania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This center is jointly supported by NIDRR and the National Institute on Aging. Research is addressing the rehabilitation needs of disabled persons who become elderly, with the purpose of restoring, preserving, or enhancing the older person's ability to function productively and independently. The Center's training activities include training for service de- livery providers and academic training for the university community. -Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Community Integration of El- derly Persons With Mental Retardation and Other Disabilities, University Af- filiated Cincinnati Center for Developmental Disorders, and University of Akron, Ohio. In conjunction with the University Affiliated Programs (UAP) in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, this Center is focusing on improving the community integration of elderly persons with mental retar- dation and other developmental disabilities. Rehabilitation Engineering Centers Rehabilitation Engineering Centers conduct programs of advanced research of an engineering or technical nature which can be applied toward solving problems en- countered in the rehabilitation of disabled persons. The Centers are also encouraged to develop systems for the exhange of technical and engineering information, and to improve the distribution of technological devices and equipment to disabled persons. Although there is no Center specifically devoted to the problems of elderly individ- uals, the technological advances resulting from Center research benefit this popula- tion. This technology includes research on improvements in wheelchairs for disabled persons; orthotics and prosthetics; improved mobility through the use of functional'36 'electrical. stimulation to paralized muscles; and devices to aid hearing and visually- impaired individuals. Research and Demonstration Projects This is a program encompassing discrete research and demonstration projects pri- marily directed toward discovering new knowledge and overcoming significant infor- mation gaps in the rehabilitation of severely disabled' persons. For example, NIDRR is supporting a project investigating the effects of electrical stimulation for manage- ment and prevention of ulcers' in older persons with vascular insufficiencies. Field-Initiated Research The purpose of the Field-Initiated Research program is to encourage eligible appli- cants from the field of disability to originate valuable ideas that relate to the reha- bilitation of disabled persons. These are discrete, specified projects in an area repre- senting the interests of both the investigator and the Institute. Currently supported projects include: -Family and Environment: The Effect of Low-Vision Rehabilitation of Older Per- sons; -Assessing and Training on Visual Components of Reading in Individuals With Macular 'Loss; -Orientation and Mobility for Blind Adults Over Sixty Years of Age; and -Effects of Age and Visual Impairment on Independent Outdoor Activity. OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS MEDIA SERvIcES AND CAPTIONED FILMS PROGRAM Program Prpose; Hearing impairmentsi.like blindness, are closely'associated with increasing age. The primary purpose of the Media Services and Captioned Films program, funded through OSERS' Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), is to support and im- prove captioning to enable individuals with hearing impairments, many of whom are over age 65, to participate more fully in our national life. In practice this in- cludes captioning and distribution activities to ensure- that films, television pro- grams, and other media materials become as available and useful to people with se- rious hearing impairments as to those without such disabilities. Activities ; In Fiscal Year 1989, this program provided: (1) on-going support for the 'evalua- tion, selection, captioning and distribution of captioned films for individuals who are deaf; (2) on-going support for increased access to the television medium through the closed-captioning of national and local news, movies, public information, sports, syn- dicated, and children's programs; (3) continued subsidization for the closed-captioned television decoders; and (4)-on-going support to the National Theatre of the Deaf, Inc. LIBRARY PROGRAMS .* Discretionary Program The Library Program office administers the Higher Education Act, Title UI-B pro- gram under which they recently, contracted for a study that compared library serv- ices to older adults in 1986 with such services identified in a 1971 study, also funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The National Survey of Library Services to the Aging by Dr. Betty Turock, of Rutgers University, found that there was limited progress in library services provided to the older adult, and what service there was had not kept pace with the growth in the over 65 population. The National Survey found that two-thirds of the public libraries gave such service a low priority and that less than seven percent of the nation's elderly were being reached by public library service. State Administered Program Library services to the elderly is one of the 'priorities of Title I of the Library Services and' Construction Act '(LSCA), a State-formula grant program administered by Library Programs in the U.S. Department of Education. Annual reports on37 projects conducted at local public libraries, funded in whole or in part with Federal funds under LSCA, are submitted by the State Library Administrative Agencies tothe Library Programs office. Statistics for projects completed in fiscal year 1988 (the latest year for which suchdata available), indicate that there was $1,653,771 of LSCA funds expended on li-brary projects specifically aimed at serving the elderly. This amount was matched by $1,849,870 in State funds and $19,105,203 of local funds for a total of $22,608,844expended on library services for the elderly under the LSCA program. These sup-port levels have increased since 1982, when $44,720 was spent under the LSCA pro-gram for these services. Of that total, $41,619 were Federal LSCA dollars. Theprojects showed almost no local support. In 1988, local funds were unusually highdue to a one-time, $19 million support effort in New Jersey. (See attached State-by-State totals of funding support for Fiscal Year 1988.) In 1986, when the National Survey was conducted, the support levels had reached $1,466,056, with a Federal share of $1,221,719. The major difference in the data fromthe National Survey, and the 1988 data, was that the Federal funding was almosteight times the State investment in 1986. According to the State reports for 1988,for the first time, the State support exceeded the Federal as the States responded tothe increase in the numbers of aging to be served, coupled with the recovery fromthe fiscal problems of the State budgets of the prior years, helped free funds for thisservice. The funds were used to buy special materials, such as large-print books, audio cas-settes, vision aids, and health related or other materials of \"special interest\" to the elderly. Special programs such as book talks, films, and genealogy were supportedfrequently, as were projects to combat illiteracy, and to deliver materials to seniorcitizen centers and homes. Also, finding increasing popularity is support for inter- generational library programs which frequently find both the young and the oldserving each other. POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION The Office of Postsecondary Education administers programs designed to encour-age participation in higher education by providing support services and financial as-sistance to students. In fiscal year 1989, and estimated $18.3 billion was provided to students for finan-cial aid. Data on the age of recipients of financial aid are not generally available.However, data for the Pell Grant program, the largest grant program, indicates that6.1 percent of all recipients were over age 40. The Special Programs for the Disadvantaged, commonly known as the \"TRIO\"programs, provide support services to those interested in pursuing a postsecondaryeducation, enrolled in postsecondary education, or who wish to pursue a graduate orprofessional degree. Because age is not an eligibility criteria under most of theseprograms, data on the age of participants is not available. In addition to these types of programs, the Office of Postsecondary Education hassupported innovative approaches to meeting the needs of older Americans throughthe Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE). In fiscal year1989, FIPSE supported 4 projects dealing specifically with our aging population.These projects are: Recruiting and Preparing Retired Professionals as Math and Science Teachers(National Executive Services Corps); Coordinated Student Involvement in Elder Care (Foundation for Long Term Care);Elderserve (Kansas State University); and Community Service to the Poor and Elderly (St. Vincent Medical Center).

WATKINS, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Retired).38 Enclosure. INTRODUCTION Only 15 years ago America-and all industrialized nations-were facing serious oil supply shortages, severe economic dislocation and strategic uncertainty. Rapidly rising energy prices had a negative impact on individual consumers, including mil- lions of our senior citizens. Today' oil prices are roughly half their .1980 levels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now estimates a barrel of oil will cost $28 (in 1988 dollars) in the year 2000-in marked contrast to alarming predictions of $100 per barrel oil, offered by economists only a decade ago. Much of the credit for this remarkable turnaround must be attributed to decon- trol of the petroleum market. And just as surely, the success of energy conservation measures undertaken by American businesses and millions of individual consumers, has also played an important role. 'The mission of the Department of Energy (DOE) is to design energy policies' and programs in- support of the President's broad objectives for America s future: sus- tained, non-inflationary economic growth; good stewardship of the environment; and long-term strategic security. The President has specifically directed DOE to develop a national energy strategy. To this end, the agency is working to establish a compre- hensive, credible, data base upon which we can begin to form a national consensus on energy policy; and, through a series, of public hearings in cities from coast-to- coast,. DOE.is soliciting the views and opinions of every segment of society, including senior citizens, regarding all aspects of energy supply and demand. The following provides a survey of DOE programs and activities of particular in- terest to senior citizens. ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS Weatherization Assistance Program.-The low-income elderly and the handicapped receive priority under this program which provides grants to States for the installa- tion of insulation, weatherstripping, storm windows, heating and cooling'system modifications, and other energy-saving measures. In 1989, the' Weatherization Assistance Program awarded $159,600,000 of Appro- priated Funds in grants to the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and nine Native American 'tribal organizations for the weatherization of homes of low-income fami- lies. Reports submitted from the inception of the program through September 1989, indicate that about 1,921,756 homes were weatherized and that approximately 949,000 of those dwellings were occupied by the elderly. In FY 1989, an estimated 116,000 homes were weatherized, of which 33,990 were occupied by elderly citizens. Institutional Conservation Program.-Title HI of the National Energy Conserva- tion Policy Act provided for a matching grant program to support, among other things, professional analyses of the energy conservation potential in public care fa- cilities. The effort of this program is to identify for building operators ways to con- serve energy and, thus, cut operating costs. The program also hopes to influence the capital investment decisions of an institution's management. State Energy Conservation Program/Energy Extension Service.-The State Energy Conservation Program (SECP) was created to promote efficiency and reduce the growth rate of energy demand in participating States. Under this program, States voluntarily enter into a cooperative effort with the Federal Government, under which DOE provides technical and cost-shared financial assistance, and the States develop and implement comprehensive plans for specific energy goals. At present, all States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories participate in SECP. The Energy Extension Service (EES) is a Federal/State partnership established by the National Energy Extension Service Act of 1977 to provide small-scale energy users with personalized information and technical assistance to facilitate energy conservation and the use of renewable resources. Started as a 2-year project in 10 States, the program was expanded nationwide by Congress after an evaluation dem- onstrated its effectiveness. All States, as well as U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, received cost-shared grants to help individuals, small businesses, and local governments take practical conservation steps. Senior citizens are eligible for service provided through SECP and EES (directly or indirectly). In addition, many States have developed and implemented projects specifically for this propulation section. Examples include senior weatherization and training, hands-on energy conservation workshops, low-interest loan programs, senior energy savings months, and numerous seminars addressing the varied needs39 of senior citizens. These projects are often cosponsored with agencies whose primary focus is on senior citizens. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION The Energy Information Administration collects and publishes comprehensive data on energy consumption in the residential sector through the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) and the Residential Transportation Energy Consumption Survey (RTECS). The RECS includes data collected from individual households throughout the country along with actual billing data from the house- holds' fuel suppliers for a 12-month period. The data include information on energy consumption, expenditures for energy, cost by fuel type, and related housing unit characteristics (such as size, insulation, and major energy-consuming appliances). The RTECS collects data on characteristics of household vehicles and annual miles traveled. The RECS and the RTECS contain data pertaining to the elderly. The results of these surveys are analyzed and published by the Energy Infomation Administration. The msot recent RECS was conducted for calendar year 1987. Re- sults of this survey are reported in three RECS publications: Housing Characteris- tics 1987 (published May 1989); Household Energy Consumption and Expenditures 1987 Part 1: National Data (Published October 1989); and Household Energy Con- sumption and Expenditures 1987 Part 2: Regional Data (projected publication: Feb- ruary 1990). The next RECS will be conducted in the fall of 1990. Housing Characteristics 1987 provides data categorized by age of householder on energy-related characteristics of housing including the square footage of the housing unit and types of fuels used. Household Energy Consumption and Expenditures 1987 Part 1: National Data pro- vides estimates of consumption and expenditures of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas for the elderly which indicates that in 1987, the elderly used about 10 percent more energy to heat their homes than the nonel- derly, even after adjusting for weather and size of housing unit. Overall energy ex- peditures were less for the elderly in all areas except space heating, where they spent 13 percent more for home heating. Approximately 61 percent of the elderly's total energy consumptionm was used for space heating and about 38 percent of their total energy expenditures were for heating. The most recent RTECS was conducted in 1988. Results of this survey will be pub- lished in Household Vehicles Energy Consumption 1988 (projected publication: Janu- ary 1990). This publication will present data, categorized by age of householder, on vehicle characteristics, vehicle miles traveled, gallons of motor vehicle fuel con- sumed and expenditures for motor vehicle fuels. The next RTECS will be conducted in 1991. The published reports can be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20401 and from the National Energy Information Center, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION ACTIVITIES During FY 1989, the U.S. Department of Energy remained active with the Nation- al Energy and Aging Consortium (NEAC), a network of more than 50 organizations from the public and private sectors. This organization is the only one of its kind that brings federal agencies together with national aging organizations and the pri- vate sector to discuss and implement solutions to the energy-related needs of the elderly. The Office of Consumer and Public Liaison has represented the Department in the Consortium by serving on the NEAC Steering Committee. Through participation in this group, DOE has exercised leadership in forming partnerships with a variety of organizations that have worked with elderly citizens to assist with their energy needs and concerns. In September, Secretary Watkins announced that the Department of Energy would sponsor a series of events to celebrate October as Energy Awareness Month. Scores of organizations throughout the U.S. and the Pacific Territories, including senior citizen groups, participated in Energy Awareness Month events and activi- ties. The National Energy and Aging Consortium held its quarterly meeting and luncheon in connection with Energy Awareness Month. A noted specialist in aging, Dr. Michael Creedon, spoke at the luncheon on the growing interest in the subject of \"Eldercare.\" Throughout the year, the Energy Department's staff has maintained open chan- nels of communication with Federal agencies and departments for the purpose of40 improving information exchange about energy assistance programs. This informa- tion exchange gives particular emphasis to programs that allow for special attention to the elderly. RXESARCH RELATED TO BIOLOGICALIAGING - In 1989, the Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) administered research to maximize the use of the Department of Energy's unique laboratory re- sources'in basic biological research and to understand the health effects of radiation and energy-related chemicals. The Department continues to identify and character- ize long-term, late-appearing effects induced by chronic exposure to low levels of physical agents. Health effects caused by chronic low-level exposure to energy-relat- ed toxic agents often develop over the entire lifespan. Consequently, such effects must be clearly distinguished from the normal aging processes. To make a valid dis- tinction between induced effects and spontaneously occurring changes, information on changes occurring throughout the lifespan is collected for both experimental and control groups. These data help to characterize the normal aging processes as well as the toxicity of energy-related agents over time. As in the past, lifetime studies of humans and animals constitute the major effort in ongoing research related to bio- logical aging. Research directly concerned with the aging process has been conduct- ed at several of the Department's contractor facilities. Summarized below are specif- ic research projects addressing aging that the Department sponsored in 1989. Long-Term Studies of Human Populations These studies provide valuable data on health effects and life shortening in human populations exposed to hazardous chemical and physical agents associated with energy technologies. Additional information on lifespan and aging in human populations is also collected. Since long-term studies of human populations are costly, time-consuming, and complex, they are initiated on a highly selective basis. The Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), sponsored jointly by the United States and Japan, continued work on a'lifetime follow-up of survivors of atomic bombings that occurred in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Over' 100,000 persons are under observation in this study. An important feature of this study is the acquisition of valuable quantitative data on dose-response relationships. Studies specifically concerned with age-related changes also are conducted. No evidence of radiation-induced premature aging has been obtained. After being accidentally exposed in 1954 to radioactive fallout released during the' atmospheric testing of a thermonuclear device, a group of some 200 inhabitants of the Marshall Islands has been followed clinically, along with unexposed controls, by medical specialists at the' Brookhaven National Laboratory.1 Thyroid pathology, which has responded well to medical treatment, has been prevalent in individuals heavily exposed to radioiodine. This study is currently conducted under the auspices of the Department's Office of Defense Programs. Nearly 2,000 persons exposed to radium, occupationally or for medical reasons, have been studied at the Center for Human Radiobiology, Argonne National Labora- tory. Other studies currently involving the Department include: -A Los Alamos National Laboratory epidemiologic study of plutonium workers at three Department of Energy facilities. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 workers will be followed in this retrospective mortality study. -A study of some 600,000 contractor employees at Department of Energy facili- ties who are being analyzed in an epidemiologic study to assess health effects produced by long-term exposure to'low-levels of ionizing radiation. -The U.S. Uranium/Transuranium Registry, which is operated by the Hanford Environmental Health Foundation, is collecting occupational data (work, medi- cal, and radiation exposure histories) as well as information on mortality in worker populations exposed to plutonium or other. transuranium radioelements. Lifetime Studies in Short-Lived Mammals Although human studies are preferable in assessing health impacts associated with any hazardous agent, there inherent limitations necessitate acquiring quantita- tive data from controlled lifetime studies of animal populations. Small rodents with lifespans of 2 to 3 years provide data in a minimum of time and at low cost, and they have been extensively used in large-scale studies of the effects \"induced by low doses of ionizing radiation. Studies using rodents to study chronic effects of radi-41 ation are underway at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Lawrence BerkeleyLaboratory, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Lifetime Studies with Long-Lived Mammals From some points of view, long-lived mammals represent better human surrogatesthan do their short-lived counterparts. Thus, obtaining quantitative data on re-sponses of long-lived species to hazardous agents is important-and studies are nowbeing conduicted at the Argonne National Laboratory and the Lovelace InhalationToxicology Research Institute. This research increases our knowledge of lifespan,age-related changes, morbidity, mortality, and causes of death, as well as alterationsin these characteristics that may be induced by radiation. Because of the cost andtime involved, these lifetime studies were initiated on a highly selective basis. Research Directly Concerned with Aging Interest in biological aging has continued in several of the Department of Energylaboratories and has resulted in additional research at the molecular, cellular, andorganismal levels of biological organization. Examples include: (a) Research at theLovelace Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute on effects of age on lung functionand structure of adult animals, and (b) the study and diagnosis via radiopharmaceu-ticals and new imaging devices of age-related dysfunctions of the brain and heart,including senile dementia, alzheimer's disease, stroke, and atherosclerosis. Trends and Prospects Given the need to assess long-term and late-appearing effects of hazardous agentsassociated with energy technologies, lifetime studies of animal and human popula-tions will continue. There is a particular need for lifespan data on responses to indi-vidual chemical agents, to combinations of toxic chemicals, and to combinations ofnuclear and non-nuclear chemicals as are found in hazardous waste. In future re-search, lifetime studies involving short-lived species wil be emphasized. No new life-time studies involving long-lived animals are planned. Efforts in research on molec-ular and cellular aspects of aging in mammals are expected to increase, as are stud-ies to sequence the human genome. As a result, additional information on age-relat-ed changes in both animals and humans should be forthcoming. ITEM 6. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES JANuARY 12, 1990. DEAR MR.

Sincerely, GERALD OLSON,Assistant Secretary for Legislation. Enclosures.42 HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION Lona Teri! Care The mission of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is to promote the timely delivery of appropriate, quality health care to its beneficiaries--approximately 47 million aged, disabled, and poor Americans.- Medicaid and Medicare are the principal sources of funding for long term care in the United States. The primary types of care reimbursed by these programs of HCFA are skilled nursing facilities (SNPs), intermediate care facilities (ICFs), and home health services. HCFA's Office of Research and Demonstrations (ORD) conducts research studies of a broad variety of issues relating to long term services and their users, providers, costs, and quality. ORD also conducts demonstration projects that demonstrate and evaluate optional reimbursement, coverage, eligibility, and management alternatives to the present Medicaid and Medicare programs. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Long term care research activities in ORD can be classified according to five objectives: -examining and promoting alternatives to institutional long term care: -assessing and evaluating long term care programs in term of costs, effectiveness, and quality: -examining the effect of the hospital prospective payment system (PPS) on long term care providers: -examining alternative payment systems for' long term care: and -supporting data development and analyses. Prior research in long term care has highlighted the fact that- disabled individuals prefer to remain in the community as long as possible and that they are able to do this, in large part, due to the care provided by informal caregivers, usually family. For a number of years, ORD has been funding research that has been examining the amount and types of services provided by family members. This research is continuing and includes examination of contributions from both public programs and private individuals (e.g., family members) for the support of the disabled in the community. Information is being sought about the resources nea4ed to support the informal caregiver network in its efforts to avoid unnecessary institutionalization of relatives. Because of the interest in promoting noninstitutional care, and the recent increase in the utilization of these services, ORD's research is also examining the-quality and effectiveness of the services in the home setting. These efforts include comparison of the quality, case mix, and cost of noninstitutional as compared to institutional services, as well as the examination of home care provided under different payment arrangements; e.g., fee-for-service versus capitation. As part of these efforts, groupings of patients are being developed that have similar expected outcomes. Such groupings are essential since home health care serves so many different types of patients, some of whom may fully recover and some who, even under the best of circumstances, are still expected to continue to decline. A major responsibility of ORD is assessing the effects of various Medicare and Medicaid long term care programs and policies. Among the areas where results are available are the hospice, swing bed, and home and community-based waiver program. '}i43 Since the implementation of PPS for paying hospitals, ORD hasbeen assessing the effects of this change on other parts of thehealth care system. Included in this research is the examinationof the effects of PPS on long term care case mix, utilization,costs, and quality. Changes in the supply of long term careproviders are also being studied. Major research projects areunderway to analyze the appropriateness of post-hospital care andthe course and outcomes of that care. In recent years, there hasbeen increased emphasis on examining episodes of care rather thanutilization of just one type of service. Medicare files, whichlink hospital with post-hospital care, continue to be analyzed toprovide information on trends in the utilization of post-hospitalcare since the passage of the PPS legislation. In 1989 ORD awarded a major contract to conduct researchconcerning the impact on Medicare beneficiaries and their familymembers of needing or providing long term care services, as wellas the impact of the quality of long term care services on acutecare use. Another contract was awarded to conduct studiesconcerning the quality of home care services for the elderly. DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITIES In 1989, HCFA implemented a major demonstration aimed at testingthe effectiveness of community-based and in-home services forvictims of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. This projectfocuses on the coordination and management of an appropriate mixof health and social services directed at the individual needs ofthese patients and their families. Demonstrations also are being implemented to assess the impact ofinnovative reimbursement strategies to promote cost containmentand foster quality of care. Efforts are also underway toidentify more effective long term care quality assurancetechniques and to improve the statistics and baseline informationupon which future assessment of needs, problem identification,and policy decisions will be based. Information follows on specific NCFA research and demonstrations. Medicare Hosice Benefit 1984-June 1989Funding: $ 1,295,156 Abt Associates, Inc. 55 Wheeler Street Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138Investigator: David Kidder, Ph.D. This contract addressed many of the questions raised by the TaxEquity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-248)and Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-369), Theevaluation studies were to determine whether or not thereimbursement method and benefit structure of the hospice benefitare fair and equitable and promote the most efficient provisionof hospice care. Also, recommendations for legislative changeswere to be made as appropriate. HCFA administrative data, Part Aand Part B claims, plus hospice cost report data were used as thebasis of several types of analyses. The final report addressedhow the Medicare hospice benefit has affected the US hospiceindustry; whether or not hospice care as reimbursed by Medicareis a cost effective alternative to more aggressive or lessintensive non-hospice interventions; what factors explaindifferences in hospice and non-hospice andprojections of effects of certain changes in the hospice benefit. An interim report, entitled -Medicare Hospice Benefit ProgramEvaluation,\" is available from HCFA as Publication Number 03248(September 1987). The final report, entitled 'Medicare HospiceBenefit Program Evaluation: Final Summary Report,\" (July 21,1989) has bean submitted to National Technical InformationService. In FY86 the hospice benefit payments of $20 million forabout 10,500 Medicare beneficiaries who elected the benefit wereless than 1 percent of the total Medicare Part A expenditures.Overall, the study found neither any significant increase incosts nor any significant savings to the Medicare programattributable to the Medicare hospice benefit during the 1984 -1986 period. The only unambiguous finding regarding hospice costsavings is that of the freestanding hospices, compared to netadditional costs generated in the provider-based hospices.Levels of overall savings were entirely44 due to leverage from the freestanding and Home Health Agency (HHA) based hospice beneficiaries, for whom savings wero estimated to be strongly positive. Hospital-based and SNF-based hospice beneficiaries incurred net costs. Analysis of FY85 combined Part A and B expenditures found, after adjustment, no difference between conventional care patient costs and those of hospice benefit patients. Analysis of the non-random, usable Medicare hospice cost reports submitted in 1985 and 1986 show that the certified hospices are larger than are non-certified hospices (random, stratified sample), have lower.average daily costs than non-certified hospices and considerably lower costs per discharge than non-certified hospices. The certified hospices that submitted cost reports generally experienced positive net Medicare revenues over the period under study, with 86 percent having positive net revenues from Medicare. A few hospices did suffer losses. Certified hospices were generally able to earn positive net revenues while conforming to the reimbursement and inpatient day limits of the Medicare program. A simulation suggests that the sample of non-certified hospices also would have profited under the benefit, with three-fourths expected to have earned positive net revenues had they participated in the Medicare hospice benefit. Medicaid Home and Communitv-Based Waiver Programs for Acguired Immunodeficiencv Syndrome Patients Period: August 1988-April 1989 Funding: S 54,679 Awardee: The Rand Policy Research Center 1700 Main Street Santa Monica, California 90406 Investigator: Peter Jacobson, Ph.D. Description: The purpose of this project is to develop a background paper that identifies major research questions for an evaluation of the utilization and expenditure patterns of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients in State Medicaid home and community-8ased waiver programs. The study. will identify appropriate data sources, review availableliterature on State waiver programs, and identify major research questions that should be addressed. The project will explore the reasons why States with large AIDS patient populations have not sought Medicaid home and community waivers. The project team has reviewed current, Medicaid AIDS waivers in the States of California, Hawaii, New Mexico, New Jersey, Ohio, and South Carolina. Contacts have been made with other States considering using the waiver program. The final report is near completion. Efficacy of Nursino Home Preadmission Screening Period: June 1988-September 1990 Total Funding: 5 376,898 Awardee: Brown University Division of Biology and Medicine Providence, Rhode Island 02912 Investigator: Mary E. Jackson, Ph.D. In recent years more than 30 States have adopted some form of nursing home preadmission screening as a method~of identifying target populations for receipt of community-based services that would be at risk of institutionalization in the absence of the community services. The purpose of this project is to evaluate a nursing home preadmission screening methodology being used by the State of Connecticut, to identify those persons who would be institutionalized if community-based services (under the State's Medicaid home and community-based services waiver program) were not available. The project will analyze the extent to which the screen accurately predicts the need for a nursing home level of care or an equivalent level of community care: It is anticipated that this study will result in refinements to the Connecticut instrument, thereby assisting in the placement of long term careclients in the most cost-effective setting. The project also is including several other States' preadmission screening instruments in the analysis.45 During the first year, the predictive validity of Connecticut'sPreadmission Screen decision rules was preliminary assessed byapplying them to three data sets of control group patients fromthe South Carolina Community Long Term Care Project, the GeorgiaAlternative Health Services Project, and the National Long TermCare Channeling Demonstration. During the second year of thestudy, screening and assessment data for a 6-month cohort ofaplicants to Connecticut's Community-Based Services program willbe reviewed. Subsequent analyses of these data willsignificantly impact the planned revision of Connecticut'sscreen. Impact of Home Intravenous (I.V.; Drug Benefits on BeneficiarvUtilization Of Services Period: August 1989-February 1991Funding: S 300,000 Awardee: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Pharmacy Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7360Investigator: This study will construct a longitudinal 3-year data base on homeI.V. drug usage in North Carolina and Florida. The project willidentify home infusion therapy drugs to be studied and survey North Carolina and Florida home I.V. drug providers to identifythe current volume, composition and source of payment for homeI.V. drug therapy. A stratified sample of providers will beselected and site-visited. Patient charts will be reviewed andabstracted for information on diagnosis, diagnosis related groups (DRG), patient outcomes, etc. This project is in thedevelopmental stage. Study of the costs of Case Manaaement Period: August 1988-May 1989 Total Funding: $ 33,061 Awardee: University of Minnesota 1919 University Avenue St. Paul, Minnesota 55104Investigator: Rosalie Kane D.S.W. The term -case management\" often is used in reference to avariety of approaches and settings involving coordination ofmedical and/or supportive services. This study prepared asynthesis of information on long term care case management and its costs. The report reviews case management models and datacollected by 51 case management programs. Four dimensions ofcase management were identified: the nature of servicesprovided; goals of the case management program; the reimbursementmechanism; and specific operational constraints. Using thesedimensions, five empirical models of case management wereidentified: fee-for-service; private insurance;capitated/consolidated; public-funded with purchase authority;and broker. Data on case-management costs and cost determinantsare presented. A theoretical model relating program incentives and outcomes was developed and the limitation of the data forestimating this model is discussed. Study of Inanoro riate Use of Medications by Medicare Beneficiaries Period: August 1988-April 1989 Total Funding: $ 23,279 Awardee: University of Minnesota 1919 University AvenueSt. Paul, Minnesota 55104Investigator: Roger Feldman, Ph.D. This study synthesized the existing literature on health problemsassociated with the inappropriate use of prescription medicationsby the noninstitutionalized elderly population. The studyexplored the extent of present knowledge regarding the prevalenceof such a problem, which medications are most likely to beprescribed or used improperly, and possible interventions thatmight lead to a reduction in medical problems associated with46 inappropriate medication use by the elderly. The final report of the study suggest that, although the literature does not certify the extent of inappropriate medication use by elderly Medicare beneficiaries, it does suggest that overuse of medications, adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, and non-compliance are common in the elderly. The report recommends a research agenda which includes developing improved criteria for judging the appropriateness of medication use and applying these criteria to a population-based sample of elderly Medicare beneficiaries. . Research Synthesis and Recommendations on the Oualitv of Selected Lon-Term Care Services and on the Relationship between Long Term Care services and Reduced Acute Care Exoenditures Period: October 1988-November 1989 Funding: S 234,542 Awardee: University of Colorado 1355 South Colorado Suite 706 Denver, Colorado 80222 Investigator: Robert Schlenker, Ph.D. This study conducted research in response to mandates in section 207 of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 relating to (1) the quality of long-term care services (in community-based and custodial settings), and (2) effects of the provision of long-term care services on reduction of expenditures for acute health care services. The project objectives included the development of recommendations for additional research in these areas. Two reports were prepared entitled, -Future Research on the Quality of Long Term Care Services in Community-Based and Custodial Settings\" and -State Survey of Community-Based Care Systems.\" An additional report, which identifies recommendations for further research on the relationship between long-term care services and acute care expenditures, was submitted late in 1989. Study of Home Health Care Oualitv and Cost Under Camitated and Fee-For-service Payment Systems Period: June 1987-June 1992 Funding: $ 1,683,773 Awardee: Center for Health Policy Research 1355 South Colorado Boulevard Denver, Colo. 80222 Investigator: Peter Shaughnessy, Ph.D. This project will compare the quality and cost of home health care provided under capitated and non-capitated payment systems for two groups of Medicare beneficiaries: clients admitted to home health care following a hospitalization, and those who have not been in a hospital for at least 30 days prior to the initiation of home care. Process and outcome quality measures are being developed and will be used with patient-level resource use measures to assess,cost effectiveness of care 'in the two settings. The project is currently recruiting HHAs for the data collection phase. Data gathering is scheduled to begin in mid-1990. Secondary data detailing Medicare utilization and costs are being analyzed. Development of Outcome-Based Ouality Measures for Home Health Services Period: September 1988-December 1992 Total Funding: S 1,965,389 Contractor: Center for Health Policy Research 1355 S. Colorado Boulevard Denver, Colorado 80222 Investigator: Peter Shaughnessy, Ph.D. Most efforts to evaluate home health care quality have focused on the HHA organizational structure or the process of care delivery but have neglected patient outcome measures as quality indicators. The purpose of this contract is to develop and test outcome-based measures or indicators of quality for Medicare home health services. The measures developed should be reliable and valid for use in monitoring and comparing quality of home health care across agencies recognizing possible confounding factors such as case mix. The measures that are tested will be selected47 from a broad range of possible approaches including generalhealth and functional status measures, indicators that are linkedto specific diagnostic conditions and/or services, and measuresthat are more practical and less costly to administer, Criteriathat will be used in the selection of measures to be testedinclude feasibility, reliability, validity, impact on qualityaccess, and the cost/burden of data collection to the HCFA and HHAs. During 1989, the contractor prepared syntheses of existingquality assurance approaches and of prior research into qualityof home health care and a report describing the detailed projectdesign. Data collection is scheduled to start in early 1990.During 1989, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awarded a grantto the Center for Health Policy Research that is intended tocomplement this contract study; the grant focuses on developingquality measures for adult non-Medicare home care services andpopulations and uses clinical panels to identify potentialmeasures. Develoo and nemonstrate a Method for Classifying Homs HealthPatients to Predict Resource Reauiraments and to June 1987-June 1990Total Funding: $ 968,332 Awardee: Georgetown University Georgetown School of Nursing 3700 Reservoir Road, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20007Investigator: Virginia Saba, RN, Ed.D The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to develop a methodfor classifying and assessing Medicare patients receiving care incertified HEAs that will predict resource requirements andmeasure outcomes of care. An abstract form was developed tocollect information concerning relevant indicators of resourcerequirements and outcomes. This form will be used to collectdata from the home health records of approximately 9,000 Medicarepatients recently discharged by approximately 600 HAs,stratified by size, ownership, and geographic location. The dataare being analyzed, using multivariate and statisticaltechniques, to determine which variables are most predictive ofresource requirements. The selected relevant variables will beincorporated into an assessment and case-mix classification toolthat categorizes patients according to predicted resourcerequirements. Patient responses to home health care will also beevaluated to develop a quantitative outcome measurement tool. Adata base of participating HNA and Medicare patientcharacteristics will also be produced. The collected data arebeing analyzed. A final report is expected by September 1990. Home Care Oualitv Studies Period: October 1989-March 1993Total Funding: $ 2,642,445 Contractor: University of Minnesota School of Public Health Box 197, 420 Delaware Street, S.E.Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455Investigator: Robert Kane, M.D. The purpose of this study is to carry out research in regard to:(1) The quality of long-term care services in community-based andcustodial settings, and (2) The effectiveness of (and need for)State and Federal consumer protections which assure adequateaccess to and protect the rights of Medicare beneficiaries whoare provided long-term care services (other than in a nursingfacility). The project will focus on in-hose care, examiningthose traditional home health services which are reimbursed byMedicare and Medicaid, as well as personal care and supportiveservices which have more recently been covered by Federal andState sources of funding. Key project tasks will include: (1)development of a taxonomy clarifying the various objectives/goalsascribed to home and community-based care, from the variousperspectives of consumers, payers, and care providers; (2)development and feasibility-testing of a survey design whichwould measure the extent of need for, and adequacy of, home careservices for the elderly; (3) a study of variations in laborsupply and related effect(s) on home care quality, as well asfactors that contribute to these variations; and (4)recommendations to improve the quality of home andcommunity-based services by identifying \"best practices\" andpromising quality assurance approaches.

The underlying cost structures of urban/rural HEA -will be studied as well. This study is national in scope and will utilize several Medicare data bases for analysis. Analysis of Costs. Patient Characteristics. Access and Service Use in Urban/Rural HHAs Period: September 1989-August 1990 Funding: $103,240 Awardee: University of Minnesota Research Center 420 Delaware Street, S.E., Box 729 Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455 Investigator: John Nyman, Ph.D. The purpose of this task is to study urban and rural differences in HHA costs, patient characteristics, access to care, and service utilization patterns. The study will be performed in two parts: (1) Costs, patient characteristics, and service - utilization patterns will be analyzed using home health care data from the State of Wisconsin. (2) Access to home health care services will be examined with use of patient-level Medicare data. Mathematics Policy Research, Inc., as a subcontractor for this study, will apply two of the -Hospital Aftercared guidelines (see the project described below) to Medicare plan of treatment data to develop a measure of access between urban and rural recipients of home health care. Natural Historv of Post-Acute Care for Medicare Patients Period: December 1966-September 1990 Funding: $ 3,373,670 Awardee: University of Minnesota School of Public Health 420 Delaware Street, S.E. ,Box 197 Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455 Investigator: Robert Kane, M.D. This is a study of the course and outcomes of post-acute care. It has two major components: analysis of Medicare data assess differences in patterns of care across the country and to determine the extent of substitution whete various forms of post-acute care services are more or less available, and detailed examination of clinical cases from the most common diagnostic-related groupings receiving post-acute care in a few selected locations. Measure of the complexity of the clinical cases will be developed using a modification of the medical illness severity grouping system. This project is jointly funded with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and, Evaluation. Data collection is continuing. A report of the findings from the analysis of national Medicare data will be published late in 1989. This project is analyzing preliminary data in order to address questions about the need for and the consequences of providing long-term care to post-hospital patients. Analysis of HosIital Aftercare Under Prospective Payment Period: April 1986-October 1,436,268 Contractor: Maryland 20814 Investigator: Cyrus Baghelai49 The purpose of this pilot study was to develop and field testmethods for determining the appropriateness of post-dischargeaftercare services. Study methods involved classifying patientsat the time of their discharge from the hospital according totheir post-discharge service needs and applying professionallydeveloped guidelines to project aftercare needs. Projected needwas then compared with services received based on interview data. The project methodologies and instrumentation have been completedand field tested. The final report has been submitted. Trends in Patterns of Post-Hospital Service Use and Their Impacton Outcomes Period: June 1987-May 1990Funding: $ 293,922 Awardee: Duke Demographic Studies 2117 Campus Drive Durham, North Carolina 27706Investigator: Kenneth Martin, Ph.D. This project is examining the pattern of care delivered afterhospitalization for different types of hospitalized patients, asdistinguished by diagnosis, age, sex, and other data elementscontained on the Medicare Part A bill. Post-hospital use patternsare examined in terms of types and duration of Medicare servicesreceived and the proportion of patients receiving care. Similarpatterns will then be examined for non-hospitalized Medicarebeneficiaries. The project has focused on expanding and cleaning data files usedin previous analyses. Prosoective Payment Systems and Post-Hospital Care Use Costand Market Changes Period: September 1985-September 1989Funding: $ 706,118Awardee: Georgetown University Center for Health Policy Studies 2233 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20007Investigator: Judith Feder, Ph.D. and William Scanlon, Ph.D. The purpose of the project is to determine how much the hospitalPPS shifts care from the hospital to SNF's and home healthproviders and to analyze the impact of this shift on total coststo Medicare and on changes in SNF characteristics that are likelyto cause an increase in use by Medicare beneficiaries in thefuture. Medicare claims will be analyzed to determine how PPShas affected total service use (hospital, SNF and hose health)and costs for hospital patients. In addition, SNFs will besurveyed to identify changes in nursing home patients, services,and market structure likely to affect Medicare use. The surveywill be supplemented with data from the Medicare/MedicaidAutomated Certification System (MMACS), SNF cost reports, andother sources. Major project activities include: o Completion of the nursing home survey. o Analysis of survey and MKACS data. o Initiation of claims analysis. o Completion of 1982 and 1985 Medicare claims processing forpre/post-PPS analysis. o Completion of a three-stage sampling process of studyhospitals. The final report is exoected by the end of 1989.50 Changes in the Post-Hospital Care-Utilization Among Medicare Patients Period: August 1989-July 1990 Funding: $ 102,247 Awardese The Rand Policy Research Center 1700 Main Street Santa Monica, California 90406 Investigator: Richard Reu, Ph.D. This project will create a data file linking Medicare billing records for inpatient hospital and post-hospital care during 1987 and 1988. Rand will use this file to document changes in post-hospital utilization among Medicare patients in recent years. The analyses will include an examination of SHF, BRA, and rehabilitative hospital care. This study is in the early developmental stage. Massachusetts Health Care Panel Study of Elderly -Wave IV Period: July 1984-January 1990 Funding: $ 152,408 Awardee: Harvard University/Harvard Medical School 1350 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 Investigator: This project collected the fourth wave of self-reported information from the Massachusetts Health Care Panel Study cohort, a group that was selected 10 years as a statewide probability sample of all persons 65 years of age or over. The data from the first three waves were analyzed and the results have been reported in numerous articles in professional journals. In this project, the data from all four waves are being analyzed to determine markers of functional decline during pro-death, predictors of long-term care institutionalization, and interrelationships between physical, behavioral, and social characteristics and subsequent health care and social service utilization and mortality. All of the data for this project have been gathered. Analysis of the data is underway, and a final report is expected in 1990. Cohort Analysis of Disabled Elderly Period: August 1988-January 1990 Funding: $ 89,986 Awardee: Brandeis University Research Center 415 South Street Waltham, Massachusetts 02254 (The Urban Institute -subcontractor) Investigator: Korbin Liu, Sc.D. The project applies event history analyses to nationally representative data sources to derive estimates of the transitions between various health status categories and the duration within categories for different age groups. These data sources include: Multiple years of National Health Interview Surveys, mortality records of National Long-Term Care Surveys, Longitudinal Study on Aging, and the National Nursing Home Surveys. Researchers assigned to the project will also estimate, based on the type and level of morbidity and disability categories, the risks involved and duration of specific types of acute and long-term care. To date, many of the key data sets have been formatted for analysis and initial analyses have been conducted. In the coming project year, the analysis employing grade of membership - methodology to control for population heterogeneity across the data sets will be completed. Medicaid Tave-to-Tame: Research Data and Analysis Period: March 1986-October 1990 Funding: $ 5,141,406 Contractor: Systaxetrics, 93101 Investigator: Embry Howell Ii' -51 This project continues the development and implementation ofa Medicaid person-level data set from five State MedicaidManagement Information Systems (MMIS) (California, Georgia,Michigan, New York, and Tennessee). This effort will acquiredata on enrollment, claims, and providers for 1985-8. Thesedata will be used to create uniform files, provide descriptivereports, support analysis and evaluation, and develop methodologyfor online data base management. This project will provide acontinuum of 9 years of uniform Medicaid data for the conduct ofanalysis of program management, evaluation of policyalternatives, and feedback to States in the area of Medicaidfinancing. Currently, project staff are acquiring and processingperson-level enrollment, claims, and provider data that have beenobtained from State MMIS. Project staff are also linking thedata base to other kinds of health statistics to expand the usesof the data. The project will continue to produce early returntabulations that summarize enrollment, utilization, andexpenditures data for each year and each participating State.Research is underway on a series of special topics including:capitation in Medicaid, spend down and its relationship tonursing hose entry, the chronically mentally ill, hip fracturesamong the elderly, inpatient hospital use by Medicaid children,hospital reimbursement, Medicaid drug utilization, obstetricalservices, physician volume, AIDS and Medicaid providers.

A Longitudinal Study Or Case-Mix Outcomes and Resource Use inNurhing o e Period: September 1985-November 1988Total Funding: $ 722,135Awardee: University BoX GProvidence, Rhode Island 02912Investigator: Vincent Mor, Ph.D. This study of natural histories of patient outcomes was designedto analyze the variation in outcomes for nursing home residentsand the relationship between case-mix adjusters and theseoutcomes. Using several large administrative data sets, theproject focused on quality based outcome measures such aschanges in physical function, discharge status, and changes inclinical conditions and the receipt of services. Data onresidents from the National Health Corporation, New York State,and Texas facilities were used in these analyses. The study consisted of three major areas of analyses. The firstset of analyses described probabilities of functional change anddischarge locations for a cohort of residents newly admitted tothe nursing home. Analyses of the changing risk of dischargedead, to home, and to the hospital over the first year of stay show that early in the stay, a Positive outcome is stronglyrelated to the functional abilities of the residents. Thelonger residents remain in the facility, the less likely theyare to leave. Three different data sets were then used to describe therelationship between case-mix adjusters and quality indicators.Outcomes examined include several measures of physicalfunctioning, decubitus ulcers, urinary tract infections,contractures, and the use of restraints and bladder and boweldefinitions used, and populations studied, some common patternswere identified. Changes in functional abilities were moreconsistently associated with age than with diagnosis.52 The final phase of analysis was a validation of three . multivariate models that predict 6-month outcomes. The models predict functional improvement, functional decline, and death for a-cross-section of nursing home residents. Each model was initially developed with data from Rhode Island, as part of a study funded by the National.,Center for Health Services Research. Using data from New York State and National Health.' Corporation nursing home residents, these three models were re-estimated. overall, the majority of terms in the three models were related to the outcomes as found in the Rhode Island models. There was some variation in the magnitude and significance of the relationships. However, robust associations were found for parameters that were most consistently defined and those that were less dependent on variations in practice patterns. Functional status, as measured by the eating and transfer, was the patient characteristic most consistently related to prevalence and incidence.of decubitus ulcers, urinary tract infections, contractures, and restraint use. Several papers based on this research have appeared in the literature. The final report has been received and will be submitted to NTIS. Community Care for Aizheimer's and Related Diseases Period: June 1987-December 1989 Total Funding: $ 127,970 Awardee: The Urban Institute 2100 H Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20037 Investigator: Korbin Liu, Sc.D. The awardee will analyze data from the National Long Term Care Channeling Project (1982-84) to determine'the range of services, sources, and costs of care used by community residents with cognitive impairment and to determine the risks of their entering nursing homes, as a function of physical and mental health status, and the typep and amounts of care received in the community. The study is expected to provide baseline information for the Alzheimer's disease demonstration project that is congressionally mandated in section 9342 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. Analyses of several cost centers for community care and risks of nursing home admissions currently are being carried out. In addition, HCFA has approved an additional task that permits an assessment of the feasibility of using a longitudinal data base from the Triage/Connecticut Community Care, Inc. This data base contains details on patient assessment and management systems that-may provide additional information on the costs of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Feasibility Analysis for Pathways to Lono Term $19,994 Awardee: Brandeis Street Waltham, Massachusetts 02254 Investigator: Walter Leutz, Ph.D. This study will determine the feasibility of analyzing Social/Health Maintenance Organization data on service use that tracks individuals as they make a transition from a state of health to one of severe impairment. If a sufficient amount of data is available, subsequent analysis may be approved with additional funds to determine whether definable \"pathways\" could be derived. These pathways-to long term care could assist in case management practice and provide outcome related information regarding the use of long term care services in a managed care setting. The feasibility study was completed November 30, 1989. -Based on the study, a decision will be made whether or not to fund additional activities.53 Activities of Daily Living fADL) Ph.D. and Korbin Lui, Sc.D. The study will use the National Long Term Care Survey,Channeling data and the Social Health Maintenance Organizations'Comprehensive Assessment Form data to examine issues associatedwith defining and measuring ADLs for use as eligibilitycriteria. A cost analysis will be performed and other issuesassociated with using ADL scores as eligibility criteria forMedicare services, will be discussed. Among the questions to be addressed are: o What level of ADL impairments is used to triggereligibility? o Which ADL items should be used?o Under what circumstances should assessments be performed,and by whom? The study is in the early developmental stage. Study of Adult Davoare Services Period: June 1989-January 1990Funding: $93,750Avardee: University of California at San FranciscoInvestigator: Rick Zavadski, Ph.D. Section 208 of the (now repealed) Medicare Catastrophic CoverageAct of 1988 mandated an updated survey of adult day centers.The legislation requests that this survey provide informationon: 1) who is served by adult day centers; 2) how many centersare there and where are they located; 3) what services do theyprovide; 4) what are the characteristics of operating thesecenters; 5) who now funds these centers; 6) what is the cost ofoperating these centers; 7) are there licensing, certification,and quality assurance standards governing these centers; and 8)how do these characteristics vary by State. An initial 1985 survey was performed by the National Instituteof Adult Daycare (NIAD), a constituent unit of the NationalCouncil on the Aging, with the assistance of a few adult daycenter consultants. Status: Funding for the survey was obtained from the AmericanAssociation for Retired Persons. All the known and designatedadult day centers in the United States were mailed a surveyduring February 1989. A contract was awarded to the Universityof California at San Francisco to perform the analyses of thesurvey data. Both Congressional reports are anticipated forcompletion by June 1990. Lona Term Care Studies Period: September 1989-September 1994Funding: $ 3,790,234Avardee: Health and Sciences Research IncorporatedInvestigator: David Kennell, Ph.D. This project will conduct research related to the delivery andfinancing of long term care services for Medicarebeneficiaries. The project will focus on four major areas: 1) the financial characteristics of Medirare beneficiarieswho receive or need long term care services;2) how the characteristics of Medicare beneficiariesaffect their utilization of institutional andnon-institutional long term care services;3) how relatives of Medicare beneficiaries are affectedfinancially and in other ways because the beneficiariesrequire or receive long term care services; and4) how the provision of long term care services may reduceexpenditures for acute health care services.54 Analyses will use existing long term care and other survey data bases, such as the National Long Term Care Surveys, the Longitudinal Study of Aging, the National Nursing Nome Survey, the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the National Medical Care Expenditure Survey. Medicare administrative records and other extant information will also be utilized. Three reports are required under the contract. The project was awarded on September 29, 1989. The first report is scheduled for December 1990. Goals and Strateoies for Financing Long Term Care Period: August 1989-March 1990 Funding: -$95,409 Awardee: University of Minnesota Research Center 420 Delaware Street, S.E., Box 729 Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455 Investigator Mark Pauly, Ph.D. The purpose of this project is to use concepts drawn from a number of'disciplines -economics, decision sciences, policy analysis, sociology, and demography -to develop statements of possible objectives for long term care insurance. Defining objectives will include an analysis of benefits and costs from potential changes in financing and an analysis of expected behavioral changes in response to changes in financing. The meaning of these objectives will then be illustrated by applying them to several different types of policy proposals: -Subsidization of private insurance: public insurance! and -Public provision of information on Medicare coverage and the need for insurance. I *- The study is in the early developmental stage: Lone Term Care Suoplv and Medicare Hosoital 1989-March 1990 Funding: $ 47,986 Awardee: Abt Associates, 55 Wheeler Street Cambridge, Massachusetts 02115 Robert Schmitz, Ph.D. The purpose of this project is to investigate how local variations in the availability of nursing home beds affect Medicare rates of hospitalization. Effects on the number of admissions, the number of hospital readmissions, the number of. hospital days used, and the costs per Medicare Part A enrollee are to be evaluated. Urban-rural differences will be assessed. The impact of community long term care services, Medicare risk contract Health Maintenance organization services and the Prospective Payment System upon Medicare Part A utilization are to also be evaluated. The study is in the early developmental stage. PACE (On Lok) Case Study Period: August 1989-January 1991 Funding: $ 172,138 Awardee: University of Minnesota Research Center 420 Delaware Street, S.E., Box 729 Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455 Investigator: Robert L. Kane, M.D. This study will provide a descriptive analysis of the elderly stages of the Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) demonstration. The study will examine in detail the model of delivery provided by On Lok-Senior Health Services, San Francisco, California, and the degree to which aspects of this model are successfully replicated in as many as eight sites nationwide through guided interviews, site visit observations, and review of written materials pertaining to site development and operations. The results of the study are expected to have utility as subsequentsites are developed for later implementation.. The study is in the initial design phase. Initial site visits to On Lok and PACE sites are scheduled for late 1989.55 Analysis of State Systems for Providing Intermediate Carp Facilityfor the Mentally Retarded and Other Care for the Mentally Retarded Period: June 1987-May 1989Funding: $ 88,268Awardee: Center for Residential and Community ServicesUniversity of Minnesota 150 Pillsbury Drive, S.E.Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455Investigator: Charles Lakin, Ph.D. This project updated information on the status of and changes inresidential services for the mentally retarded gathered by thisawardee for 1977 and 1982 in a previous HCFA-funded grant. Data onthe current status of the intermediate care facility for the mentallyretarded (ICF/MR) program, which were obtained through the Inventoryof Long Term Care Places, the sampling frame for the institutionalcomponent of the National Medical Expenditures Survey, were analyzedand supplemented by case studies of selected State's programs forserving the mentally retarded. This project analyzed data from the tape of the Inventory of LongTerm Care Places and conducted in-depth State studies. A finalreport was received in May 1989 and is entitled -Medicaid Servicesfor Persons with Mental Retardation and Related Conditions.\" It isavailable from the NTIS. Study results show that community-basedservices have become the primary model of care for persons withmental retardation and related conditions. Conversely, the ICF/MRprogram has shown little growth in the recent past and the numbers ofpersons served by this program have decreased in a majority ofstates. These facts, as well as the wide acceptance of the Home andCommunity-Based Services waiver, indicate the need to begin viewingthe services system for persons with mental retardation as acommunity-based, rather than an institutionally-based system. Long Term Care: Elderly Service Use and Trends Period: August 1989-August 1990Funding: $245,249 Awardee: The Brookings Institution 175 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20036-2188Investigator: This project has three objectives: (1) an analysis of the financialstatus of nursing home users; (2) an analysis of the determinants ofhome care use; and (3) projections of the numbers and level ofdisability among the elderly and their use of long term careservices. Data from the following major surveys will be used:1982 -1984 National Long Term Care Surveys: The 1984 -1986Supplement on Aging/Longitudinal Study of Aging; and the 1984 Surveyof Income and Program Participation. Data will be analyzed usingcross-tabulations and logistic and Least squares regression analysesand the Brookings/ICF simulation model (updated and revised). Theproject has just begun. Analytical data files are being developed.

Evaluation of \"tife-Continuum of Care\" Residential Centers in the United States Period: January 1985-September 1989 Funding: .832,871 Awardee: Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged 1200 Centre Street Boston, Massachusetts 02131 Investigator: Sylvia Sherwood, Ph.D. The objective of this 3-year project is to obtain information about the characteristics of continuum of care residential center (CCRC) facilities and their residents and compare them with elderly residents living in the community, with respect to quality of life and health, service costs, and utilization. Data will be gathered from 20 CCRCs in four areas: California, Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania. These sites will be stratified according to the type of contract offered (extended versus limited), the age of the facility, and the income level of those enrolled. Three types of CCRC residents will be selected from the sites for the study sample: new admissions (580), existing residents, both short- and long-stay residents (1,640), and residents who died just prior to or during the field data gathering period (660). Quality of life and service utilization data will be gathered at two points in time, at baseline and 12 months later. Three types of comparison samples will be employed: o A representative sample of elderly in their own homes or independent apartments (2,422). o A national sample of elderly living in congregate housing settings (2,350). o A representative sample of elderly who have died and for whom retrospective data are available for their last year of life (1,500). The final report is expected by the end of 1989. Financial Impact to Beneficiaries of Nursing Home Care Period: August 1988-February 1990 Funding: $ 129,888 Awardee: Brandeis University Research Center 415 South Street Waltham, Massachusetts 02254 Investigator: Korbin Liu, Sc.D. This project will use the Urban Institute's Transfer Income Model (TRIM)-2 for State estimates and the Connecticut Nursing Home Inventory data base to calculate nursing home use and payments. The TRIM-2 model is a microsimulation model, based on the 1984 Current Population Survey, used in forecasting use and payments. The Connecticut Inventory data base contains patient-specific information on all nursing home patients (private and public) from 1977 to the present. In addition, the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey will be used to analyze several dimensions of nursing home use. From the collected data, estimates will also be made for the nursing home patients' spend-down provision. A report entitled 'Changes in Duration and outcomes of Nursing Home Stays: 1977 -1985\" was completed. The report concludes that changes have occurred in the overall composition of nursing home admissions in the intervening 8 years between 1977 and 1985. The analysis of changes between 1977 and 1985 among nursing home admissions indicates that the nursing home patients had become older, more disabled, and more likely to have been admitted for terminal care. This conclusion is reflected by the57 shorter length of stay for the total cohort of nursing home admissions, the increase in mortality outcomes at discharge,particularly for persons with short stays (e.g., less than 30 days), and the disability characteristics of patients at admission. Reasons for the changes in the composition of nursing home admissions are not as clear as the occurrence of the changes themselves. One possibility is that the relatively slow growth of nursing home beds between 1977 and 1985 relative, for example, to the 8 years before 1977, has resulted in a selection process whereby the most disabled persons are being admitted. Another possible reason is the change in acute care utilizationthat occurred between 1977 and 1985. Although many changes were occurring, the most widely known was Medicare's hospital PPS, which provided strong incentives for hospitals to dischargepatients as guickly as possible. As a result, the use of nursing hones to substitute for the tail end of hospital stays was widely expected. Study findings that greater proportions ofshort-stay patients (i.e., less than 30 days) were discharged dead or to a hospital in 1985 relative to 1977 is consistent with the theory that greater use of nursing homes for post-acute care was a direct result of the hospital PPS policy. During the coming year, the project will complete: (1) Development and analysis of a synthetic cohort of nursing home admissions with data from the Connecticut nursing home inventory. (2) Estimation of spenddown rates and numbers of persons at the State level through the use of the TRIM model. Can Geriatric Nurse Practitioners Imorove Nursina Funding: $ 673,759 Awardee: The Rand Corporation 1700 Main Street Santa Monica, California 90406Investigator: Joan Buchanan, Ph.D. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the potential of the use of geriatric nurse practitioners for improving outcomes of care and containing costs in SNFs. The 30 nursing homes thatparticipated in the Mountain States Health Corporations (MSHC)geriatric nurse practitioner (GNP) demonstration project were compared with 30 nursing homes in the region that did notparticipate. Comparisons were made of: - Patient outcomes. - Process of care. - Nursing home costs. - History of certification deficiencies. Homes were matched by State, ownership, bed size, and urban, suburban, or rural location. Study findings indicated that the MSHC GNP program had a limited positive effect. If the employment market for nurses remains unchanged, the program will prove relatively inexpensive to implement, especially in larger facilities. Nor did the program adversely affect nursing home per diem costs or profits. Further it would appear that GNPs decreased hospital use for patients newly admitted to nursing homes.

Funding support for this demonstration was supplemented by theNational Institute on Aging, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Inc. The project was conducted at the Health Services Center, Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Portland, Oregon. This was a randomized study of 2,509 households with one or more Kaiser members aged 65 or over who were recruited into two groups, control and intervention.Baseline data on household environmental circumstances and fall hazards and the member's physical and psychological healthstatus were obtained during a home audit. Participants were randomized into one of the two groups. Participants in the intervention group were offered a special falls prevention program that included a self-management educational curriculum and the installation of safety equipment and minor home renovations to correct safety hazards. In addition, a retrospective medical record review will be completed for ablind control group consisting of a 5 percent sample of Kaiser members age 65 and over to measure the incidence of falls- related medical care use. The project is in its fifth year of operation. The follow-up period to assess the incidence of falls ended December 1987. The cooperative agreement was extended until December 1989 to allow completion of the evaluation of the program's effectiveness in lowering the frequency and severity of falls and to determine whether the program is cost-effective (i.e., whether the cost of the intervention is offset by the savings in medical costsassociated with the prevented falls). The final report is expected by the spring of 1990. Modifications of the Texas System of Care for the Elderly: Alternatives to the Institutionalized Aced Period: January 1980-June 1990 Total Funding: Waivers only Grantee: Texas Department of Human Resources 701 West 51st Street P.O. Box 2960 Austin, Texas 78769Investigator: Kent Gummerman, Ph.D. The purpose of this project is to reduce the growth of nursing homes in Texas and, at the same time, expand access to community care services for needy Medicaid individuals. It is being accomplished by directly changing the operating policies of theState's title XIX and title XX programs -- specifically, byeliminating the State's lowest level of institutional care, ICF-II. Existing organizations responsible for the State's title XIX and title XX programs are responsible for project implementation. Substantial progress has been made in achieving projectobjectives. In March 1980, there were 15,486 individuals in the ICF-II group. As of December 1988, there were 506 ICF-II clients remaining. From March 1980 to December 1988, the totalinstitutional population also decreased from 64,820 to 54,365clients (a reduction of 16.1 percent), while the community-carepopulation has grown from 30,792 to 46,958 -- an increase ofslightly more than 52 percent. This project was scheduled to terminate on-December 31, 1989, but a 6-month extension (through June 1990) is required by the 1989 budget reconciliationlegislation. The Medicare Alzheim r's Disease Demonstration Period: September 1989-September 1993 Funding: $1,999,812 Awardes: Institute for Health and Aging University of California San Francisco 210 Filbert Street San Francisco, California 94133Investigator: Robert Newcomer, -90 -360 Section 9342 of P.L. 99-509, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, directed the Secretary to conduct demonstration projects to determine the effectiveness, cost, and impact of providing comprehensive services to Medicare beneficiaries who are victims of Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. The legislation specified that the project shall be conducted over a period of 3 years, and that sites must be geographically diverse, located in States with a high proportion of Medicare beneficiaries, and in areas readily accessible to a significant number of beneficiaries. The legislation authorized the expenditure of up to 540 million from the Medicare Part B Trust Fund for the demonstration. HCFA was assisted in designing and implementing the demonstration during the period September 1987 through June 1989 by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., under a contract with HCFA. Two models of care are being studied under this project. Both provide case management, homemaker/personal care services, adult day care, and education and counseling for family caregivers. Case managementactivities include assessment, care planning, service arrangement, and patient monitoring. The two models vary bytheir monthly expenditure caps and the intensity of their case management. Eight demonstration sites were selected through a competitive process during 1988. The demonstration sites are: Monroe County Long Term Care Program, Inc. Rochester, New York Carle clinic Urbana, Illinois Northeast Community Mental Health Center Memphis, Tennessee Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center Portland, Oregon Cincinnati Area Senior Services, Inc.

HCFA originally was directed to approve this project by the omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. Nov Jersey did notimplement the project after the passage of the originalauthorizing legislation because of a provision that required allparticipants to be Medicaid-eligible. The project's eligibilitycriteria were later amends by the omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987 to provide authorization for the program to include anon-Medicaid population, and the program began on July 1, 1988.During its first year, respite care services were provided toover 1,000 elderly or disabled clients and their fsmilies. Theproject is scheduled to end in September 1990. In compliance with one of the requirements of the legislation,the State has arranged for an independent evaluation of theproject to be conducted by the Center for Health Policy and AgingResearch at Rutgers University. The final report is expected inearly 1991. M& Prospective Payment $ 2,839,501 Contractor: Abt Associates, Inc. 59 Wheeler Street Boston, Massachusetts 06115Investigator: Henry Goldberg The purpose of this project is to develop and test alternativemethods of paying HHAs on a prospective basis for servicesfurnished under the Medicare program. The demonstration willenable HCFA to evaluate the effects of various methods ofprospective payment on health care expenditures, quality of homehealth care, and home health agency operations. In response to section 4027 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, which directs HCFA to conduct a demonstration ofprospective payment for HHA, Abt Associates is working with HCFAto develop a project design and to assist HCFA in implementingthe demonstration. At this time, HCFA and Abt are finalizingdetails of the proposed payment methods that will be tested. Aspart of this effort, Abt is also performing analysis of HHA plansof treatment, cost reports, and Medicare claims to provide HCFAwith information about length of home health episodes and therelationship between patient characteristics and resource use. The operations phase of the demonstration is expected to begin inmid-1989. The demonstration will test two prospective payment approaches -payments per visit by type of discipline and payments per episodeof Medicare-covered home health care. Each HHA's payment rateswill be based on its own Medicare allowable costs in the 12-monthperiod prior to the HHA entering the demonstration. The studydesign calls for recruitment of 100 1HAs from five States(California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas) toparticipate voluntary in the demonstration. HHAs that agree toparticipate in the demonstration will be randomly assigned to oneof three groups -i.e., to one of the two payment methods or to acontrol group that continues to be reimbursed in accordance withthe current retrospective cost system. In order to assure thatthe incentives of prospective payment do not lead to reductions in the quality of home health care or in access to necessary andappropriate services, Peer Review Organizations in the fivedemonstration States will conduct ongoing quality assurancereviews of a sample of patient records from the participating HHAs. HCFA will award a contract in 1990 for an independentevaluation of the demonstration. Desion of a Demonstration of Medicare Payment for Community Nursing Organizations Period: August 1988-December 1989 Total Funding: $ 196,109 Awardee The People-to-People Health Foundation(Project HOPE) 2 Wisconsin Circle, Suite 500 Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815Investigator: Burton Dunlop, Ph.D.62 Section 4079 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 directs the Secretary to conduct a demonstration testing Medicare reimbursement on a capitated basis for services furnished by Community Nursing Organizations (CNOs). Project HOPE is assisting HCFA with the design of the demonstration. Tasks involved in this development effort include developing theeligibility standards for CNOs, the methodology for calculating the capitated payment rates, a research design and evaluation strategy for the demonstration, site selection criteria, quality assurance mechanisms, and marketing strategies for the sites. Development activities are still underway. Implementation of the demonstration will begin in 1990 after completion of theseactivities. Prior and Concurrent Authorization Demonstrations Period: September 1987-July 1992 Total Funding: Section 9305 of P.L. 99-509, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct demonstration projects concerning prior and concurrentauthorization for post-hospital extended care services and home health services furnished under Part A or Part B of title XVIII. This legislation responds to concerns expressed by IWAs and SNFsthat under the current system of Medicare payment they cannot adequately predict what services Medicare fiscal intermediaries (FIs) will deny as non-covered. It is hypothesized that prior authorization and concurrent authorization payment approaches will reduce the number of services denied without increasing Medicare expenditures. Under prior authorization, providers submit treatment plans to FI's for review prior to the start of care; under concurrent authorization, plans of treatment are submitted when care begins. In both approaches, the provider receives notification from the FI about how many services will be covered. This provides greater certainty about coverage and payment before most services are given. The law required an evaluation of the demonstrations that must address impacts on (1) administrative and program cost; (2) access and availability ofpost-hospital services and timeliness of hospital discharges; and (3) the accuracy and cost savings of payment determinations and rates of claims denials compared with the current system. In July 1987, HCFA implemented home health concurrent authorization pilot projects in Illinois and in all States in HCFA's Region VII (Dallas). Lewin/ICF conducted an evaluation of this pilot project; the evaluation was completed in 1989 and a report describing the results was submitted to HCFA. HCFA has prepared a draft Report to Congress based on this report. Lewin/ICF also designed and implemented a separate demonstration of prior and concurrent authorization for SHP services. This demonstration began operations in September 1989. Lewin/ICF will perform an evaluation of this project as well. Social Health Maintenance Oroanization Period: September 1985-November 1990 Total Funding: $ 3,547,934Contractor: University of California San Francisco Aging Health Policy Center San Francisco, California 94143 Investigator: Robert Newcomer, Ph.D. and Charlene Harrington, Ph.D. The social health maintenance organization (S/HMO) seeks toenroll, voluntarily, persons 65 years of age or over in an innovative prepaid program that integrates medical, social, and long term care delivery systems. The S/HMO merges the health maintenance organization concepts of capitation financing and provider risk-sharing developed by HCFA under its Medicare capitation and competition demonstrations with the case management and support services concepts underlying Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)- sponsored long term care demonstrations serving the chronically ill aged. Evaluation results will be used by HCFA and DHHS to assess whether the S/H10O concept should be63 fostered through changes in prepaid Medicare contracting regulations. This contract was awarded in September 1985. An interim report was forwarded to Congress August 15, 1988. The data collection phase has been completed. Data analysis will be completed, andthe final report written by November 1990. Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Prospective case-Mix System for Nursing Homes in Massachusetts Period: August 1986-December 1989Total Funding: $ 362,312 Awardee: Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare Medical Assistance Division 600 Washington Street Boston, Massachusetts 02116Investigator: Susan Flanagan, M.P.H. This project will design, implement, and evaluate a prospectivecase-mix system for a random sample of nursing homes inMassachusetts. This payment system will develop and testincentives for these nursing homes to admit and treat heavy-carepatients while minimizing declines in quality of care. Experimental facilities will be compared with facilities thatwill continue to be reimbursed under the present system. A minimum of 18 experimental and 16 control homes will participate. The system will modify four of seven components of the nursing home reimbursement system currently used in the State. Fordemonstration facilities, nursing services payment will becase-mix adjusted using \"management minutes.\" Incentives to admit and treat heavy-care patients will be used to further modify thenursing cost center. Various financial incentives will also beused to reduce other \"controllable\" operating costs. The cooperative agreement was awarded in August 1986. During the first 2 years, project staff finalized aspects of the proposedpayment system, assigned volunteer nursing homes to theexperimental and control groups, and improved theirquality-assurance mechanisms. Implementation of the case-mixsystem commenced on October 3, 1988 for 1 experimental year. Development of quality assurance indicators using this case-mixdata base is in progress during the implementation year.Statewide implementation will be evaluated based on thedemonstration results. The demonstration ends December 31, 1989. Evaluation of the demonstration will begin January 1990. A final report is expected in November 1990. Texas Nursino Home Case-Mix Demonstration Period: September 1987-September 1991 Total Funding: $ 371,873 Awardee: State of Texas Department of Human Services P.O. Box 2960 (MC-234-E) Austin, Texas 78769Investigator: Pam Coleman The Texas Department of Human Services will conduct a 3-yeardemonstration to implement and evaluate a prospective case-mix payment system. The payment system is based on a HCFA-sponsoredfeasibility study. The major Medicaid objectives of the projectare: to match payment rates to resident need; to promote theadmission of heavy-care patients to nursing homes; to provideincentives to improve quality of care: to improve managementpractices; and to demonstrate administrative feasibility of the new system. The objective for Medicare is the development andpilot testing of the administrative processes for implementing Medicare PPS based on a resource utilization group (RUG) system in coordination with Medicaid case-mix systems. The State will use a quasi-experimental design for the Medicarepilot test to compare the effect of introducing case-mix payment in an experimental catchment area versus continuing thecost-based system in a control catchment area. The State will usea pre-post design for the Medicaid system. The case-mix methodology is based on a review of six different methods in which the Hew York RUG's II system explained the greatestvariance of resource use. The proposed case-mix index has major64 elements of the RUG's II system and some of the system used in Minnesota. The Texas Index of Level of Effort (TILE) uses four clinical groups to form clusters and develops sub-groups using an ADL scale. The index that will be used for the classification of Medicare patients is the RUG-TIS developed by Brant Fries and Don Schneider. RUG-Ti8 uses the same clinical groups and ADL scale that are used in the New York RUGs-II system. The difference occurs in the expanded rehabilitation groups for Medicare patients. Two third-party evaluations will be used, one of data reliability and a second of the validity of their data analyses methods. During the first year, the TILE and RUG-TlS indexes have been reviewed for compatibility. The RUG-T18 classification was reviewed and operationalized to match the HCFA Medicare coverage guidelines published in 1987. Cost analysis of both national and State samples of Medicareproviders were performed to arrive at baseline costs for calculating the rates for the RUG-TlB groups. The Texas client assessment, review, and evaluation instrument has been reviewed and revised. It was pilot tested in the Austin area and achieved a high reliability score on case-mix variables. This instrument contains all the rate setting variables for both Medicare and Medicaid. The Texas utilization review process will expand to include more frequent reviews for new admissions, prior authorizations of Medicare stays, classification of individual patients into RUG-T18 groups. The Medicaid payment system became operational in April 1989 and the Medicare demonstration is scheduled to begin in April 1990. Case-Manaaed Medical Care for Nursing Home Patients Period: July 1983-March 1990 Grantee: Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare 180 Tremont Street Boston, Massachusetts 02111 Investigator: Lois Simon RClA granted Medicare and Medicaid waivers to the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare to permit fee-for-service reimbursement for the provision of medical services by physician-supervised nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NP/PA) for residents of nursing homes. This permits increased medical monitoring that is expected to generate cost savings as a result of fever hospital admissions and outpatient visits. Providers are responsible for managing and monitoring the health care and medical condition of all enrollees to assure that the primary care needs of nursing home patients are met in a timely fashion, often without resorting to the hospital emergency room. Initial physical exams, medical evaluation, and re-evaluations are being performed by the NP/PA in the nursing home. The NP/PA operates under written protocols that describe the common medical problems to be encountered and appropriate evaluation and treatment procedures. The supervising physician reviews and countersigns the HP/PA's evaluation and prescriptions. The physician is also consulted in any unusual situation or emergency. The Rand Corporation, as part of the Research Center Cooperative Agreement with HCFA, is evaluating this project, focusing on the project's impact on the use and cost of nursing home and hospital services. This evaluation relies primarily on Medicare and Medicaid claims data. The Pew Foundation has awarded a grant to the Univorsity of Minnesota to assess the project's impact on quality of care. Section 9413 of Public Law 99-509, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, mandated the continuation of this project. Section 6114 of the Ominibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 will provide Medicare coverage of this type of - service effectivive April 1990. On Ik'ks Risk-Based Community Care organization for Devendent Adults Period: November 1983-Indefinitely Grantees: on Lok Senior Health Services 1441 Powell Street San Francisco. California 94133 California Department of Health Services 714-744 P Street Sacramento, California 95814 Investigator: Marie Louise Ansak65 In response to the congressional mandate Of section 603(c)(1) and(2) of Public Law 98-21, the Social Security Amendments of 1983.HCFA granted Medicare waivers to the On Lok Senior HealthServices and Medicaid waivers to the California Department ofHealth Services. Together these waivers permit On Lok toimplement an at-risk, capitated payment demonstration in whichmore than 300 frail elderly persons, certified by the Departmentof Health Services for institutionalization in a SHF, areprovided a comprehensive array of health and health-relatedservices in the community. The current demonstration maintains OnLok's comprehensive community-based program but has modified itsfinancial base and reimbursement mechanism. All services are paidfor by a predetermined capitated rate from both Medicare andMedicaid (Medi-Cal). The Medicare rate is based on the averageper capita cost for the San Francisco County Medicare population.The Medi-Cal rate is based on the State's computation of currentcosts for similar Medi-Cal recipients using the formula forprepaid health plans. Individual participants may be required tomake copayments, spend-down income, or divest assets, based ontheir financial status and eligibility for either or both of theprograms. On Lok has accepted total risk beyond the capitatedrates of both Medicare and Medi-Cal with the exception of theMedicare payment for end stage renal disease. The demonstrationprovides service funding only under the waivers. The research anddevelopment activities are funded through private foundations. section 9220 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1985 has extended On Lok'e Risk-Based Community CareOrganization for Dependent Adults indefinitely, subject to theterms and conditions in effect as of July 1, 1985, except thatrequirements relating to data collection and evaluation do notapply. The Use of Medicaid Reimbursement Data in the Nursing HomeQuality Assurance Process Period: June 1988 -June 1990Total Funding: $132,930.00 Center for Wisconsin-Madison Room 300 Infirmary, 1300 University AvenueMadison, Wisconsin 53706Investigator: David Zimmerman, Ph.D. The purpose of this project is to assess the feasibility of usingMedicaid reimbursement data to target facilities and residents inthe nursing home quality assurance survey process. Medicaidreimbursement data appear to hold considerable promise in helpingtarget facilities for more intensive review, identifying specificcare areas where deficient care may be present, and identifyingindividual residents for more detailed review. Information onmedication use, sentinel health events, and other indicators canbe provided to surveyors in preparation for the field survey.The information can also be used to determine whether problemshave recurred after the survey and follow-up visits. The objectives of the project are: (1) to convert reimbursementdata into specific Quality of Care Indicators (QCIs),particularly with respect to drug related measures and medicaloutcomes; (2) to identify the conditions, standards, and elementsin the Federal regulations for which the use of QCIs has thegreatest potential benefit; (3) to develop and demonstrate in oneState (Wisconsin) the procedures for providing QCIs to surveystaffs; (4) to assess the potential for implementing the systemin other States; (5) to determine the implications of theproposed HCFA nursing home regulations and the 1987 OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act provisions for the use of reimbursementdata in the quality assurance process; and (6) to design anexpanded demonstration of the use of QCIs in the survey process. Fifteen preliminary QCIs have been developed and are currentlybeing reviewed by project staff and the advisory panel. The QCIshave been linked to specific conditions, standards, and elementswithin the existing Federal regulations, and proposed newregulations are being reviewed to determine their relationshipwith the OCts. Deficiencies and QCIs in Wisconsin for the periodAugust 1987-1988 are being analyzed to determine the baselinerelationmhip between the two measures. Preliminary discussions66 with survey staff have been held to develop the system for conveying gO! information to the surveyors in a systematic way. Finally, a- survey of State Medicaid reimbursement and quality assurance officials is being designed to identify which States may hold the greatest potential for the use of Medicaid data in the survey process. The Develomment of Lone Tern Care Reform Strategv for New York's Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Period: June 1988-June 1990 TotalFunding: $115,581 Awardee: NHe York State Department of Social Services Division of Medical Assistance 40 North Pearl Street Albany, New York 12243Investigator: Howard Gold The New York Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities will conduct a 2-year project to develop a comprehensive plan and waiver application that would reform the financing, regulation, and service delivery of the Mental Retardation (MR)/Developmental Disabilities system in three districts that cover eight New York counties. The State sees the demonstration as the first step toward statewide implementation. The objectives are to: 1) develop a financing system that will improve services to this population by expanding the number and types of people to be served and the types of services to be provided; 2) change the manner in which quality of care is assured; and 3) constrain growth in Federal expenditures for these services. Waivers would alter the Medicaid basis of payment, revise the State Medicaid plan requirements, change how Medicaid funds can be used, and implement revised quality assurance regulations. The demonstration will test an alternative financing approach that approximates recently formulated departmental policy directions as developed by the Department of Health and Human Services Working Groups on ICFs/MR. The project would represent a major test of reform in the delivery of services for persons who are developmentally disabled. Both National and State level advisory panels have been convened, and the development of issue papers is underway. The Multi-State Nursing Home Case-Mix and Quality Demonstration Period: June 1989 -June 1993 Funding: $1,000,000 Awardes: State Medicaid Agencies in Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, and South Dakota This project builds upon past and current initiatives with case-mix payment and quality assurance. It will be a 4-year demonstration to design, implement, and evaluate a combined Medicare and Medicaid system in five States. The purpose of the demonstration is to test a resident information system with variables for classifying residents into homogeneous RUGS for equitable payment and for quality monitoring of outcomes adjusted for case mix. The new minimum data set for resident assessment will be used for both payment classification and quality monitoring systems. This information will be computerized, audited, and submitted as part of the billing documentation. It will be used to develop case mix adjusted outcome and process norms across the demonstration States. This system also will be used to trigger early quality reviews by State staff and provide the regular survey teams with information on potential problems in nursing facilities. It will have three phases: 1) systems development and design; 2) systems implementation and monitoring; and 3) evaluation. There will be 18 months of developmental work before the Medicare/Medicaid classification and payment system will be ready for implementation in the demonstration States. The project has just started, the States have begun work on Phase I activities and will conduct their first data collection in spring 1990.67 Long Tarn Care Case NiX and Inc. 8201 Greensboro Suite 600McLean, Virginia 22102Investigator: Sob Burke, Ph.D. This 2-year contract will support the design and earlyimplementation phase of the Multi-State Nursing Home Case-Mix andQuality Demonstration. The first step will be to refine the datacollection process creating consistent, reliable, and validmeasurement of resident characteristics and staff time use acrossthe four demonstration States (Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, andSouth Dakota). The demonstration will involve approximately50,000 residents in 900 facilities at any one time. The secondstep will be to refine a resource utilization classificationsystem that will apply to both Medicare and Medicaid residents innursing facilities (SNFs and ICFs) across states. This systemmust be able to account for over 42 percent of the staff timevariance in each of the several States. It must have naturalbreaks in the groups between residents who are expected to beshort stayers vs. long stayers and between residents requiringheavy technical nursing vs. residents with less technical needs.A prospective case-mix payment system to be used across theStates for Medicare-covered stays will be developed using thecommon classification system. In addition, analyses comparingoutcomes under different circumstances will be conducted. Anational advisory group will be tasked to recommend the outcomesthat are most promising for use in a quality monitoring systemand to assist in the design of the quality monitoring system tobe used during the operation phase of the demonstration. Hew York State Intearated Ouality Assurance System forResidential Mealth Care 1990Total Funding: $ 597,695Awardee: New York State Department ofSocial Services 40 North Pearl Street Albany, New York 12243Investigator: Don Schnieder, Ph.D. The objectives of the New York State Quality Assurance System(NYQAS) are to link data from the case-mix reimbursement systemfor use in the quality assurance system and to integrate thequality assurance processes of survey/certification, inspectionof care, and utilization review. The State recently implemented acase-mix payment system for residential health care facilitiesfor which all patients are assessed at least biannually. Theresulting data on patient characteristics are audited and enteredon a client-specific data base that can be utilized to targetquality assurance activities toward facilities that: o Have staffing patterns that seem inappropriate to needs ofpatients. o Have excessive numbers of patients with clinical outcomesthat indicate possible deficiencies in the quality of care. o Have unexpected negative outcomes from one review to thenext. External outcome standards, survey and certification, inspectionof care, and utilization review activities will be integratedinto a single, patient-centered process. The use of the case-mixdata base will serve to focus reviewer energies on problemfacilities. The ability to routinely track significant orpotentially significant deteriorations in patient care willtrigger off-cycle surveys. Facilities identified as having few orno problem will be targeted for abbreviated surveys.68 The State has completed the NYQAS design has designed a training program for State surveyors on the use of the new protocols and procedures. The training began October 1988 and NYQAS was implemented in November 1988. Administrative waivers permit sampling of resident review (as opposed to 100 percent review), a survey cycle that averages 12 months (as opposed to 12 months for all homes), and the alignment of utilization review with case-mix assessment intervals. FUTlRE DIRECTIONS FOR LONG TERM CARE During 1989, HCFA devoted substantial staff resources on the further development of demonstrations to test the cost-effectiveness of prospective payment systems for nursing homes and the development of quality measures to improve the quality of care in nursing homes and HRAs. we will continue to test alternative financing schemes for long term care services, including patient-related or case-mix based prospective payment for SNF and ICF levels of care. Implementation of a demonstration of prospective payment methods for Medicare home health services will take place in 1990. We also intend to test the effectiveness of innovative State, local, and private programs to promote home care by the family or by other community support arrangements, such as in-home or other support services (adult day care, adult foster care, or shared housing), which substitute for or deter the use of institutional care for persons in need of long term care services. These efforts will include implementation of a large-scale demonstration directed at victims of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. At the same time, we will continue to develop and test new approaches to more accurately \"target\" home health and community-based care in order to identify groups for whom reconfiguration of current service models can be cost-effective. We also will develop and test outcomes of quality for nursing home and home health services and the applicability of using payment generated data to monitor quality. In this light, we will continue to develop a multi-State demonstration integrating patient assessment for a case-mix PPS for nursing homes with the quality assuranca process for these providers. Another very important area that will continue to be explored is alternative financing mechanisms for long term care. Although the majority of the elderly are covered by both Medicare and supplemental insurance, a large portion of long term care services remain uncovered. Medicaid covers long term nursing care, but only after the elderly individuals have depleted their resources. Research is continuing that will identify the sources of financing for long term care at various points throughout institutionalization. This research will further examine characteristics of individuals who come to rely upon Medicaid for payment for their care. By identifying the risks associated with nursing home use,. we hope to be able to propose improved methods of paying for this care. One alternative being studied as a solution for some of the elderly's problems in financing long term care is life care centers. Other ORD financing research continues to examine various States' reimbursement of long term care in order to assess the feasibility of recommending policy changes, e.g., prospective payment for SNF care. Essential to the development of future long term care policies is the support for data collection and data analyses from projects that gather detailed information from representative national samples or other large segments of the elderly population. Research is continuing on the estimated future acute and long term care utilization based on information from available surveys on the morbidity, disability, and mortality of different birth cohorts. Data from the 1982 and 1984 Long Term Care surveys are being analyzed and plans continue for the 1989 survey. Data on the Medicaid program continue to be available on a person-level basis for some States from the Tape-to-Tape project.69 OFFICE OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT SERVICES: ADMINISTRATION ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES On June 27, 1989, the Administration on Developmental Disabilities and the Ad-ministration on Aging signed a Memorandum of Understanding to improve the co-ordination of programs administered by the two administrations which relate to thewelfare of older persons with developmental disabilities. Under the agreement, AoA and ADD will jointly develop and implement activities to: -Promote better understanding between the National Network on Aging and theDevelopmental Disabilities Network of programs serving older persons with dis-abilities. -Improve services to older person with developmental disabilities.-Demonstrate, at the national level, a commitment between AoA and ADD toimprove services to older persons with developmental disabilities. The new agreement provides a framework for AoA and ADD to work together topromote the independence, productivity and integration of older persons with devel-opmental disabilities into the mainstream of society. AGING AND DEVELOPMENTAL DIsABuLrrls PROJECTS \"ADD-TIP\" NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT Grantee: Institute for the Study of Developmental Disabilities, Indiana Universi- ty. Project Director: Barbara Hawkins, 9/30/88-9/29/90, FY'88-$96,565, FY'89-$91,000. The \"ADD-TIP\" National Implementation Project has as its goal the immediateand long-term widespread national training of manpower across the different serv- ice sectors that serve aging persons with developmental disabilities in order to im-prove service to and planning for this population. About 300 critical service provid-ers and administrators in Indiana will be trained using a state-of-the-art trainingpackage and field-tested training methodologies. A flexible inservice training model will evolve which can be used across the aging and developmental disabilities serv- ice sectors. About twenty master trainers will receive experience in such trainingand also in the training of older trainers, resulting in an additional cadre of about 100 national trainers; this national network of trainers will be able to undertake allaspects of future training. Important databases will be established by rigorous eval-uation techniques to assess actual manpower impact due to project implementation.Promotion and dissemination of project products and findings to state, regional andnational organizations will involve numerous publications and presentations. PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIvEs FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CENTER ON AGING AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIEs Grantee: Mailman Center for Child Development, University of Miami School of Medicine. Project Directors: David Ross Dickson, The will focus on training professionals, policy makers, providers andconsumers in both the aging services network and the DD service network to im-prove coordination and quality of service delivery in these two networks. Communi-ty organizing and systemic change activities will be an integral part of the CADD's work plan. The CADD has six goals: To conduct training for both networks, tocreate and nurture a community consortium first in Dade County and then inBroward County, to build public awareness through the media, to conduct researchin needs assessment for the older DD population, to stimulate systemic changes inthe administrative, policy and program approaches affecting the aging DD popula-tion in Dade County and the State of Florida, and to stimulate innovative programsand exemplary service models for replication in both networks. Project outcomes will include training sessions designed for three distinct audi-ences (providers/professionals, policy makers/administrators, and consumers); cre-ation of at least two community consortia; a quarterly newsletter; media coverage;an annual policy workshop; a needs assessment survey of older DD residents ofDade County; a survey of training needs of providers in the aging and DD networks,and development of a resource center for students, consumers and providers.70 IMPROVING SERVICES TO ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED: TRAINING, SERVICE, AND DISSEMINATION Grantee: Shriver Center, University Affiliated Program, Waltham, MA.

Unique aspects of the project include an emphasis on the evaluation of non-medical problems such as housing needs, leisure-time use, spiritual needs, ad- justment social changes associated with aging, and legal needs. Trainee composition reflects the evaluation orientation and includes students from programs such as law, leisure studies, social work, and the ministry. Particular emphasis is being given to the development of curriculum addressing legal and ethical issues. THE UMKC INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING CENTER ON GERONTOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES Grantee: University Affiliate Program for Developmental Disabilities, University of Missouri at Kansas. Project Director: Phyllis Kultgen, Ph.D.-(816) 276-1770. Project Period: 9/30/88-9/29/90, FY'88-$77,500, FY'89-$91,000. purpose of this project is to establish an Inter-disciplinary Training Center on Gerontology and Developmental Disabilities at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. This center represents a joint effort among the UMKC University Affiliated Program (UAP), the UMKC Center on Aging Studies, selected University units, and a strong consortia of provider agencies. Significant collaboration and support from the State Division of Developmental Disabilities, the Division of Aging, and other UAPs across the country has been received. The primary outcomes of this long-term project will be: (1) An Interdisciplinary University Based Training Program. This will include infusion of knowledge on developmental disabilities and aging in courses of both the social sciences and allied health disciplines. In addition, an interdisciplinary track on aging and developmental disabilities will be provided as a 15 hour aca- demic certificate. Activities at the University level will be jointly sponsored and conducted by both the UAP staff and the Center on Aging Studies staff. (2) An Interdisciplinary Outreach Training Program. This program will be es- tablished for service providers and state agency staff. The unique aspect of this outreach training program is that it will build on the capacity and expertise within the system to jointly train providers. (3) The Establishment of Exemplary Service Sites to Facilitate Both Preserv- ice and Inservice Training. Plans have been generated to develop six exemplary service sites. These sites can be used for student placement as well as informa- tion dissemination and technical assistance activities. The new interdisciplinary Ph.D. program, recently established at UMKC, supports the efforts of the above goals and outcomes. INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING FOR PROFESSIONAL AND PARAPROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL: A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVE SERVICES FOR SENIORS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN RURAL AREAS Grantee: Montana University Affiliated Program, University of Montana. Project Witteklend, M.S.-(406) 243-5467. Project Program (MUAP) proposes to train profession- al and paraprofessional direct care providers in the areas of aging and developmen- tal disabilities with particular attention being given to the provision of services in rural/remote areas. A concurrent goal is to collaborate with developmental disabil- ities and generic aging networks throughout Montana and neighboring states to share existing resources and expertise to improve the services for seniors with de- velopmental disabilities. Objectives for this project are directed toward providing training and collaboration activities in both aging and developmental disabilities systems throughout Montana and neighboring states, relevant to improving the quality of life for seniors who are developmentally disabled: (1) Coordinate statewide training efforts with agencies providing services for seniors.71 (2) Provide preservice training in the combined areas of aging and develop- mental disabilities. (3) Provide inservice training for professional and paraprofessional direct care personnel at all levels of both aging and developmental disabilities networks. (4) Provide education for citizens to increase awareness of both aging and de- velopmental disabilities. (5) Conduct a multi-state conference to disseminate knowledge and to obtain input for training and resource development. (6) Provide consulting/training to neighboring states of Wyoming, Idaho, and North Dakota. (7) Disseminate project results and materials. TRAINING PROGRAM IN AGING AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES Grantee: University of Rochester, University Affiliated Program. Project Director: Overeynder, ACSW-4716) 275-2986. Project Period: 9/30/88-9/29/90, FY'88-$77,500, FY'89-$91,000. The Training Program in Aging and Developmental Disabilities in Western New York is a joint program of the University Affiliated Program for Developmental Dis- abilities and the Center on Aging of the University of Rochester Medical Center. It plans to expand existing and create new linkages between developmental disabil- ities, gerontology and geriatric educational systems in Rochester, Utica and Buffalo, New York, in order to offer preservice and continuing education in aging and devel- opmental disabilities. Initially, efforts will be directed at collaborative training with local service providers, to provide immediate impact on delivery of direct and sup- port services. Subsequently, short term preservice training on the undergraduate and graduate level will be delivered to impact on a broad spectrum of students. Fi- nally, for a smaller number of advanced trainees, more intensive long-term educa- tional experiences will be offered. Objectives, in addition to establishing a program management structure are to de- velop a program faculty, collect curriculum materials, develop inservice and con- tinuing education programs, develop preservice programs and sponsor regional workshops as well as an international conference. Expected outcomes include in- creased awareness, knowledge and skills for a large number of providers, policy makers, students and faculty through the establishment of a Regional Center. Spe- cifically, it is anticipated that at least 15 persons will be identified who will teach various subjects related to this topic, that about 100 persons per year will partici- pate in inservice educational series, and that about 200 students per year will re- ceive instruction through undergraduate, graduate and certificate programs on the university level. Training models, an extensive library as well as a training data base will be made available. AGING AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES: CLINICAL ASSESSMENT, TRAINING, AND SERVICE Grantee: Waisman Center UAF, University of Wisconsin. Project Ph.D.-4608) 263-5245. Project Period: 9/30/88-9/29/90, FY'88-$79,407, FY'89-$79.407. The training grant has three goals: 1) to facilitate increased collaborative work on aging and developmental disabilities among the Waisman Center, the University of Wisconsin Institute on Aging, the Wisconsin Bureau on Aging, the Developmental Disabilities Office, the Wisconsin Bureau for Long-Term Support, and community- based service providers in Wisconsin; 2) to conduct training programs for profession- als and paraprofessionals on aging and developmental disabilities; and 3) to develop the Waisman Clinic on Aging and Developmental Disabilities. The achievement of the first two of these goals will be accomplished through a series of training confer- ences and seminars for professionals, para professionals, faculty, and executives serving in the legislative, human services, or health systems and working in the fields of aging and/or developmental disabilities. During the first year of the grant, a statewide survey will be conducted of all agencies in Wisconsin that provide serv- ices to aging persons and/or persons with developmental disabilities. This survey is expected to provide a data base for training and collaboration among program plan- ners, providers, and policy analysts. The Waisman Clinic on Aging and Developmental Disabilities will be developed by the Center in conjunction with collaborating agencies. It will use a computer-as. sisted assessment approach and will develop model service protocols and cost data. Interdisciplinary training on aging and developmental disabilities will be conducted.72 A QUALITY OF LIFE/ExPREssIvE ARTs/pHYSicAL FITNESS INNOVATIVE TRAINING SERVICE PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED PERSONS IN N.E. GEORGIA SENIOR SITES\" Grantee: University of Georgia Division of Education for Exceptional Children. Project Director: Claire B. Clements, Ed.D-(404) 542-3960. Project Period: 9/30/88-9/29/90, FY'88-$87,114, FY'89-$117,735. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate that old age for developmentally dis- abled persons can be a time of fulfilling activity and creativity. The project will de- velop, implement, research, and disseminate drama, art, dance, and fitness pro- grams to improve these persons' quality of life and integration into the existing service system. OFFICE OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT SERVICES: TITLE XX SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM The major source of Federal funding for social services programs in the States is Title XX of the Social Security Act, the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) pro- gram. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35) amended Title XX to establish the SSBG program under which formula grants are made di- rectly to the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the eligible jurisdictions (Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) for use in funding a variety of social services best suited to the needs of individuals and families residing within the State. Public Law 97-35 also permits States to transfer up to 10 percent of their block grant funds to other block grant programs for support of health services, health promotion and dis- ease prevention activities, and low-income home energy assistance. Under the SSBG, Federal funds are available without a matching requirement. In fiscal year 1989, a total of $2.7 billion was allotted to States. Within the specific lim- itations in the law, each State has the flexibility to determine what services will be provided, who is eligible to receive services, and how funds are distributed among the various services within the State. State and/or local Title XX agencies (i.e., county, city, regional offices) may provide these services directly or purchase them from qualified agencies and individuals. A variety of social services directed at assisting aged persons to obtain or main- tain a maximum level of self-care and independence may be provided under the SSBG. Such services include, but are not limited to: adult day care, adult foster care, protective services, health-related services, homemaker services, chore serv- ices, housing and home maintenance services, transportation, preparation and deliv- ery of meals, senior centers, and other services that assist elderly persons to remain in their own homes or in community living situations. Services may also be offered which facilitate admission for institutional care when other forms of care are not appropriate. Under the SSBG, States are not required to submit data that indicates the number of elderly recipients or the amount of expenditures provided to support spe- cific services for the elderly. States are required, prior to the expenditure of funds under the SSBG, to prepare a report on the intended use of the funds including the information on the type of activities to be supported and the categories or character- istics of individuals to be served. States are also required to report annually on ac- tivities carried out under the SSBG. Beginning with fiscal year 1989, the annual report must include specific information on the numbers of children and adults re- ceiving services, the amount spent in providing each service, the method by which services were provided, i.e., public or private agencies, and the criteria used in de- termining eligibility for each service. Based on an analysis of pre-expenditure reports submitted by the States for fiscal year 1988, the list below indicates that number of States providing certain types of services to the aged under the SSBG. Services Number' Home-Based Services2..................... , ............................................ 45 Adult Protective and Emergency Services .34 Disabled Services .39 Health Related Services .22 Information and Referral .23 Transportation Services .30 Adult Day Care .23 Home Delivered/Congregate Meals .20 Adult Foster Care .1273 Housing Services ........... 10 Includes 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the five eligible territories and insularareas. 2Includes homemaker, chore, home health, companionship, and home maintenance services. In enabling the elderly to maintain independent living, most States provide Home-Based Services which frequently includes homemaker services, companion and/or chore services. Homemaker services may include assisting with food shop- ping, light housekeeping, and personal laundry. Companion services can be personal aid to, and/or supervision of aged persons who are unable to care for themselves without assistance. Chore services frequently involve performing home maintenance tasks and heavy housecleaning for the aged person who cannot perform these tasks. As reflected above, 34 States currently provide Adult Protective and Emergency Services to persons generally 60 years of age and over. These services may consist of the identification, receipt, and investigation of complaints and reports of adult abuse. In addition, this service may involve providing counseling and assistance to stabilize a living arrangement. If appropriate, Adult Protective and Emergency Services may also include the provision of, or arranging for, home based care, day care, meal service, legal assistance, and other activities to protect the elderly.74 Department of Health and Human Services Administration on Aging Fiscal Year 1989 TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION 1 SECTION I.

Compendium of Active Grants Under Title IV75 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ADMINISTRATION ON AGING REPORT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1989 .NTRDUCTTO This report describes the major activities of the Administrationon Aging (AoA) in Fiscal Year 1989. Title II of the OlderAmericans Act of 1965 (the Act) established the Administrationon Aging as the principal Federal agency for carrying out theprovisions of the Act. The 1987 Amendments to the Actreaffirmed the responsibilities of AoA, State Agencies, and AreaAgencies to assure that community systems serving older peopleare established, strengthened, and extended throughout thenation. Through the Amendments, Congress also reaffirmed theneed for strong partnerships and for effective coordination onbehalf of older people. Congressional action also underscoredconcern for the most vulnerable elderly and emphasized the needto assure that priority focus is continued on the establishmentand improvement of comprehensive coordinated community basedsystems of service. The Older Americans Act seeks to remove barriers to economic andpersonal independence for older persons and to assure theavailability of appropriate services for those older persons inthe greatest social or economic need. The provisions of the Actare implemented primarily through a national 'network on aging\"consisting of the Administration on Aging at the Federal level,State and Area Agencies on Aging established under Title III ofthe Act, and the agencies and organizations providing directservices at the community level. In FY 1989, Congressappropriated $ 748,196,000 to support programs and activities toimplement the provisions of the Act, which are administered byAoA. This excludes $ 188,000 available for the Federal Councilon Aging under the Older Americans Act appropriation. (SeeAppendix I for a summary of AoA's budget for FY 1989.) This report is divided into five sections. Section I describesAoA's roles and functions. It highlights various activitiesundertaken by AoA, in partnership with other Federal agenciesand private organizations, to launch new national initiativesand foster the coordination of Federal programs related to olderpersons. Section II provides an overview of the provisions ofTitle III of the Older Americans Act. It summarizes theprincipal activities of the network of State and Area Agencies on Aging in FY 1989. Section III describes the Title VI programof grants to Indian tribal organizations and the efforts of theAdministration on Aging in assessing outreach to older NativeAmericans. Section IV presents a summary of AoAts FY 1989discretionary activities under Title IV, and a description ofthe FY 1989 special activities and initiatives conducted by AoAdesigned to improve the capacity of State and local governmentsto provide quality long-term care for older persons. Section Vdescribes AoA's evaluation activities conducted during FY 1989.A series of Appendices provide additional information on thesubjects covered in the body of this report.76 SECTION I -15 AMEXNISTRATI0N ON AGING Role and Function of AoA The Administration on Aging (AoA) is located in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The agency is headed by a Commissioner on Aging, who is appointed by the President with confirmation by the Senate and who reports directly to the Secretary. In April, 1989 Joyce Berry, Ph.D., was appointed Acting Commissioner on Aging following the acceptance of the previous Commissioner's resignation. AoA programs are administered through a Central Office located in Washington, D.C. and ten Regional Offices. Title II of the Older Americans Act, as amended, describes the basic roles and functions of AoA. Chief among these are to serve as an effective and visible advocate for older persons (including American Indian, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian Aging) within the Department and-tith other agencies and organizations at the national level and to administer the programs authorized by Congress under Titles III, IV, and VI of the Act. AoA provides policy advice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in matters affecting older Americans and information to other Federal agencies and to Congress on the characteristics, circumstances and needs of older persons. The Agency also reviews and comments on departmental policies and regulations concerning services which affect the health and general well-being of older persons. During FY 1989, the Administration on Aging continued its aggressive efforts to assist vulnerable older persons and their families in finding appropriate help to maintain their independence within their own communities and to delay or prevent unnecessary institutionalization. AoA believes that these efforts can best be achieved by providing State and Area Agencies on Aging with the flexibility that allows them to strengthen existing local systems to nake them more visible, easily accessible, and responsive to the needs of older Americans, particularly the most vulnerable. The building and strengthening of coordinated community services systems for older persons and their families continued to be the overarching goal of efforts undertaken by AoA during FY 1989. AoA continues, to work with State and Area Agencies on Aging to develop ways in which all available resource groups (i.e., public, private and voluntary, as well as dedicated individuals) can effectively work together to create comprehensive and responnive community systems dedicated to maintaining the independence of older Anericans. Toward this end, efforts continue to focus on strengthening the roles of state and Area Agencies on Aging to help enhance, but not replace, individual self-sufficiency, family caregiving, and other traditional forms of community support. AoA recognizes that the Area Agency on Aging is the key organization that can forge the most effective and efficient linkages between existing systems of-services within each community. Therefore, AoA works with State and Area Agencies on Aging to strengthen efforts that will build a system of services that -pirovide a continuum of care for older persons, tailored to meet thie needs and circumstances of individual communities. Goals for Fiscal Year 1990 and Beyond While working during Fiscal Year 1989 to accomplish the annual objectives related to the enhancement of community-based systems of services for older persons nationwide, the Administration on Aging began. a developmental process for the establishment of goals for Fiscal Year 1990 and beyond. The process has been characterized by continuing dialogue with advocacy and interest groups in.the field of aging including discussions with State Directors on Aging, with Area Agency Directors, service providers, the academic community, the Federal Council on Aging and with representatives of the Leadership Council of Aging organizations.77 As a result of the process the Administration on Aging (AoA)has selected eight areas of major activity in which goals havebeen established for Fiscal Year 1990 and beyond. These areasare: (1) Public/Private Partnerships, (2) Older Persons as aResource, (3) Strengthening the Family and Generational Bonding, (4) Prevention and Alternatives to Institutional Care, (5) Promotion and Enhancement of Effective Community BasedService Systems, (6) Targetting -Strategic Resource Allocation, (7) Manpower Development and (8) Preparing for the 21st Century-Challenges and Opportunities of an Aging Society. SeeAppendix VI for full Statement of Goals for 1990 and beyond.) In the year 1990, the nation will celebrate the 25thAnniversary of the Older Americans Act of 1965. TheAdministration on Aging deems it important, as the nationapproaches the last decade of the 1990's and the SilverAnniversary of the Older Americans Act, to expand the agency'sgoal efforts and to assist the society in addressing policyissues which will undoubtedly carry over through the 1990's andbeyond, into the 21st Century. It is important that oursociety becomes focused on the need to build adequate capacityto respond to the dramatic increases in the older populationduring the next century. AoA -A Visible and Effective Advocate A major responsibility of the Administration on Aging is toprovide leadership to other Federal agencies and to the severalcomponents of the national network on aging relative to theirefforts on behalf of older persons. The Administration onAging placed major emphasis on developing collaborativerelationships with other Federal agencies to facilitate thedevelopment of methods to achieve a coordinated response to theneeds, problems and concerns of older persons. Toward this end, AoA has developed and implemented a variety of specialinitiatives aimed at improving the quality of life for olderpersons. Examples of special initiatives undertaken during FY 1989 are described below under the Promotion and Enhancement ofEffective Community-Based Service Systems Category and HealthCategory. Aging NetworX Visibility Initiative In an effort to promote network visibility, AoA continued thepublic education strategy to have public and private sectororganizations print and distribute a generic booklet, 'Where toTurn for Help for Older Persons\". This booklet is aimed atlinking middle-aged caregivers to resources and help for theirolder loved ones who live nearby or across the country. Itanswers some of the most frequently asked questions aboutfinances, health, legal and community services for theelderly. The Administration on Aging continues to receive apositive response about the booklet from public and privateorganizations, as well as the general public. Since it wasfirst published in 1986, over 448,800 copies of the booklethave been reprinted by 80 organizations and companies includingLevi Strauss, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, General Electric, UnitedAuto Workers and the House Select Committee on Aging. The Government Printing Office has sold a total of 29,020 copies tothe public. Community Achievement Award Initiative The Administration on Aging implemented an initiative known asthe Community Achievement Awards to recognize communities whichhave made significant progress in developing exemplary systemsof services for older Americans. The awards are determinedthrough a competitive process wherein each State is invited tonominate one of its communities for an award. In July 1989, AoA honored ten communities with Community Achievement Awards in a highly publicized ceremony in Washington, DC. Awards were presented to communities in78 California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Iowa, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Each State's Agency on Aging received a grant of up to $30,000 for post-award activities to encourage systems-enhancement in other communities throughout the State. These follow-up activities include developing resource brochures, producing video tapes or slides to publicize the award-winning system, and establishing Peer Counseling Teams to provide information and technical assistance to communities interested in enhancing their own systems of services for the elderly. In addition, workshops, conferences, and training programs have been planned for a variety of organizations and individuals - concerned with the elderly. The target groups include staff of Area Agencies on Aging, local elected and appointed leaders, members of professional associations, persons working with senior citizens, and seniors themselves. The FY 89 initiative has generated much publicity in the award-winning communities and States. Wide media coverage has been reported, including feature articles in newspapers and newsletters, and televised press conferences and interviews of community officials. In addition, the communities have been honored through proclamations from State Governors and have received recognition at meetings and annual conferences of organizations concerned with aging issues. AoA has developed a brochure which describes each of the award-winning communities. Copies of the brochure have been sent to each State to use in these promotional activities. The Community Achievement Awards initiative is in its second year. Low-Income Minority Elderly The 1987 Amendments to the Older Americans Act require increased emphasis on meeting the needs of low-income minority elderly persons. The Administration on Aging has a major policy goal to enhance its commitment to develop and implement new strategies to more effectively target resources and programs on the needs of the most vulnerable older persons, with special emphasis on low-income minority elderly. We are confident that all segments of the national network of services for the elderly share our conviction that substantial improvement on this mandate can and must be achieved as a priority. The Older Americans Act Amendments establish specificrequirements for Area Agencies with respect to low-incomeminority individuals. Section 306(a)(5)(A) of the Act requires Area Plans to: 1. Provide assurances that preference will be given toproviding services to older individuals with thegreatest economic or social needs, with particular attention to low-income minority individuals; 2. Provide assurances that the Area Agency will include in agreements made with service providers a requirementthat the provider will: a) specify how he intends to satisfy the service needs of low-income minority elders in the area served by the provider, and b) attempt toprovide services to low-income-minorities in at leastthe same proportion as the population of low-incomeolder persons bears to the population of older individuals in the service area; 3. Identify the number of low-income minority olderindividuals in the planning and service area; and 4. Describe the methods used to satisfy the service needsof such minority elders. States report a total of over 2 million low-income minority elders. Nearly one-third of these older persons areconcentrated in the southeastern states of Georgia, Florida,North Carolina, and Alabama. Nation-wide, the largest numbersof low-income minority elders live in New York, Georgia, Texas, Florida, and California. The smallest populations of low-income minority older persons reside in New Hampshire, North Dakota, Idaho, and Nevada.79 A wide variety of methods is used by States to satisfy theservice needs of their low-income minority individuals. A highproportion of the States is actively involved in training andinformation dissemination, sometimes in languages other thanEnglish. Many States report increasing outreach and advocacyactivities, working with national minority organizations,holding conferences, forming task forces, or altering theirfunding formulas to reach more low-income minority elders.Over half the States report targeting nutrition and seniorsites and detailing minority action steps in their State Plansas important in their attempts to satisfy the service needs ofthis low-income minority elderly population. The Administrationon Aging highlighted applications of these strategies and methodsin a memorandum to States in Fiscal Year 1989. Community and Migrant Health Centers The Administration on Aging, in collaboration with the HealthResources and Services Administration (HRSA), completed a twophase initiative designed 1) to promote older persons havinggreater access to and participation in the primary careservices of the Community and Migrant Health Centers (CMHC's)and, 2) to increase targetting of supportive services byAAA's. The approach was to forge stronger linkages between thetwo programs at all administrative and programmatic levels toensure coordinated planning, integration of resources whereverpossible, and the development of mutually supportive strategiesat the State and local levels. The Administration on Aging coordinated with the HealthResources and Services Administration in developing anevaluation of the linkages between the Community and MigrantHearth Centers and the network of aging services. The goal ofthe evaluation, funded in HRSA, is to assess the initiative'simpact, document exemplary practices of the community andmigrant health centers for purposes of replication and documentexisting barriers preventing collaboration between the twoprograms. This project has been extended to enable theresearchers to develop a set of policy and programrecommendations for future directions. Caregivin Over the past few years, the public and private sectors havebecome increasingly aware of, and involved in, issues ofcaregiving that arise as a result of families, friends andneighbors supporting and providing assistance to an elderlyindividual. AoA has been working with both the public andprivate sectors to promote knowledge of caregiving and itscorollary in the workplace, Eldercare. AoA has collaborated with the Office of Personnel Managementand the Department of Labor, among other Federal agencies toexpand the existing knowledge base regarding Eldercare issuesand caregiving in general. Extensive work is also beinginitiated with private sector organizations at both central andregional office levels. The private sector is recognizingEldercare as a benefits issue and is initiating collaborationwith local agencies operating under the auspices of the OlderAmericans Act. The Administration on Aging Regional Offices have beensuccessful in promoting strong public-private sectorinitiatives. They continue their efforts in: 1. promoting and supporting State efforts to implementcaregiving initiatives in the public and privatesectors; 2. developing options for public/private collaboration; and 3. helping to create options for business to initiate,such as accumulation of credit hours for caregiving,and banking pre-tax deductions for costs of adult daycare and medical costs. Older Volunteer Recognition Ceremony80 In celebration of Older Americans Month, AoA hosted with the American Association of Retired Persons and the May Department Stores Company, a ceremony and reception to honor older volunteers. The event, held on May 24, 1989, in the auditorium of the Wilbur J. Cohen Building, recognized one individual from each State whose dedication and service was representative of all of the older volunteers in the State. HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan presented a plaque to each State designee. Invited guests included representatives of Congressional committees and national organizations who work on issues affecting older people. There was extensive media coverage of the event. Commissioner on Agina Roundtables Many issues impact on the Older Americans Act programs. One mechanism utilized for discussion-of these important issues was the convening of Roundtables with noted experts, representatives fror national organizations, State and Area Agencies on Aging and service providers. These Roundtables provided an opportunity for dialogue, policy discussion and a mechanism for providing input into AoA policy deliberations. The first Roundtable dealt with the issue of minority participation in Older Americans Act programs. The 1987 Amendments placed increased emphasis on serving those in greatest economic or social need, with particular attention to low-income minorities. Among the issues discussed were: 1) intrastate funding formulas; 2) hiring minority staff; 3) site selection; 4) training aging network staff; and 5) minority contracting. Invited, were four minority aging organizations: the National Caucus and Center on Black Aged, the Asociacion Nacional Pro Personas Mayores, the National Asian/Pacific Resource Center on Aging and the National Indian Council on Aging. Directors of State Units on Aging, an Area Agency on Aging, an aging service provider, representatives of the National Association of State Units on Aging and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging and the National Minority Aging Resource Center were invited. A second Roundtable dealt with the important issue of eldercare. Business and corporate communities have demonstrated a growing commitment to assist employees who serve as caregivers for older relatives. In a number of instances, private sector groups have asked State and Area Agencies on Aging to provide assistance. The issues addressed at this roundtable focussed on ways in which State and Area Agencies on Aging can work with the business and corporate communities. The issues discussed ranged from statutory prohibitions to the public purpose mission of area agencies. Invited were the Illinois and Ohio State Directors on Aging, two Area Agencies on Aging Directors from Texas and Oregon and the executive directors of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging and the National Association of State Units on Aging. Housing Under the Older Americans Act, the Administration on Aging (AoA) collaborates with the Federal housing programs in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) within the Department of Agriculture. AoA activities include exploration of possible interagency agreements, mutual participation in conferences and provision-of materials, and data exchanges between the respective networks. During the past year, AoA provided assistance to HUD in identifying and recruiting housing counselors for training in the Home Equity Conversion (HEC) Demonstration Program. This HEC Demonstration Program will be explained further under the Title IV-B Research and Demonstration Projects of the Annual Report. The counterpart State and local agencies are encouraged to work together to provide opportunities for older citizens to have suitable housing alternatives which are affordable and which emphasize the need for maintaining a continuum of care for the elderly. AoA's regional office provided testimony before the U.S. Senate Budget Committee Hearing on congregate and supportive services in housing for the elderly in Atlanta, representing the Department of Health and Human Services at this Hearing. The Regional Office is currently planning a conference for February 1990 which will focus on \"Aging in Place: Relating and Linking Congregate and Supportive Services in and to Housing for the Elderly\".81 Transportation on October 24, 1986, the Secretaries of DHHS and DOT signed anagreement to facilitate effective and efficient coordination ofspecialized and human services transportation. Under thisagreement AoA co-sponsored the development of a guidebook on\"Best Practices in Specialized and Human Services TransportationCoordination\". In December 1988, AoA and the Urban MassTransportation Administration (UMTA) entered into anInteragency Agreement to support the collaborative effortsbetween DHHS and DOT. Under this agreement, AoA and UMTAprovided funds to the States of Texas and Ohio for conveningworkshops designed to further the goal of improving thecoordination of transportation service systems. The firstworkshop was held on July 26, 1989, in Austin, Texas, thesecond one was held on September 22, 1989, in Columbus, Ohio.Both workshops brought together representatives of both theaging and transportation networks to discuss methods ofimproving the coordination of transportation systems in the twoStates. The guidebook on \"Best Practices in Specialized andHuman Services Transportation Coordination\" was used at theworkshops. The products of the workshops are State \"ActionPlans\" detailing the responsibilities and steps to be taken bythe aging and transportation networks to improve thecoordination of transportation service systems. These planswill be made available to all other States for replication inkeeping with each individual State's priorities. AoA conducted a discussion based on the Bureau of LaborStatistics report, Labor Market Problems of Older Workers. Thereport examines the extent of labor market problems of oldermen and women and documents the employment outcomes of thoseolder persons who look for work following job loss or reentryinto the labor market. Institutional impediments toemployment, such as Social Security regulations, pension rulesand policies, the market for part-time jobs and agediscrimination, are also addressed. Representatives of theLeadership Council on Aging, DHHS, HDS Program Offices, and thegeneral public were in attendance. Supplemental Security Income (SSIL Food Stamp and Medicaid Outreach The 1987 Amendments to the Older Americans Act require theCommissioner on Aging to analyze, compile, and distributeinformation about outreach activities targetted to olderpersons who may be eligible for, but are not receiving, SSI,Food Stamp, and Medicaid Benefits. The 1987 Reauthorization ofthe Older Americans Act provided for an authorization of $10million for AoA to conduct outreach activities. Even thoughthese funds were not appropriated, through the efforts of theAoA Regional Offices and the network on aging, AoA has beenable to facilitate outreach activities at the State and locallevels. During FY 1988, AoA began distributing outreach materials tothe States on the Supplemental Security Income (SSI), FoodStamp, and Medicaid Programs. Continuing this effort into FY1989, arrangements were made for the Social SecurityAdministration (SSA) to send SSI outreach materials directly tothe States. oA disseminated the brochure, \"Facts About theFood Stamp Program\" published by the Department ofAgriculture's Food and Nutrition Service, and the SSA FactSheet describing two provisions of the SSI Program that wereeffective on July 1, 1988. Sharing of information andmaterials between the Health Care Financing Administration(HCFA), SSA, and AoA at the Regional, State, and local levelsis ongoing. These efforts respond to the concern of Congress and thePresident that all older people be made fully aware of thebenefits available to them under the SSI, Food Stamp, andMedicaid Programs and that eligible individuals be encouragedto apply. State Agencies on Aging were urged to review theavailable materials and to develop or strengthen effectiveoutreach programs throughout the State to increase theparticipation of the elderly in the programs. AoA RegionalProgram Directors were asked to Contact State Directors onAging to offer their assistance in organizing Statewideoutreach campaigns. AoA Regional Work Plan AccomplishmentsReports indicate that most of the States have, or will develop,new SSI outreach activities.82 collaboration. Linkages, and Systems Building: AoA. SSA. HCFA Memorandum of Understandina During FY 1989, AoA, SSA, and HCFA engaged in discussions on. how the three agencies can work collaboratively to develop and coordinate programs that are accessible to all older people and that assure special help for the most vulnerable. These discussions resulted in a draft Memorandum of Understanding between the three agencies. Under this proposed agreement, AoA, SSA, and HCFA would jointly engage in collaborative activities to achieve the goal of promoting the well-being of older persons by providing a coordinated response to the needs, problems, and concerns of older persons. Such activities would support the following objectives -(1) to improve the coordination of services funded under the program authorities of AoA, SSA, and HCFA which relate to older persons; (2) to increase public awareness of SSA and HCFA entitlement programs, the nutrition and supportive services of AoA and other programs which promote the well-being of older persons; (3) through special outreach efforts designed to increaoo participation in SSA and HCFA entitlement programs, the nutrition and supportive services programs of AoA and other programs which promote the well-being of older persons; (4) to reduce dependency on entitlement programs; and (5) to improve health care for vulnerable older people. Develoomental Disabilities Throughout FY 1989, AoA forwarded Information Memoranda to States which discussed the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1987 as they relate to older persons with developmental disabilities and shared selected examples of effective collaboration between the networks of AoA and the Administration on Developmental Disabilities. The AoA Regional Offices were provided information and resource materials to assist them in forging linkages and developing collaborative relationships with the ADD network. Memorandum of Understandina between AoA and ADD--Areas of Federal, State, and local level collaboration between the AoA and ADD networks were identified at the February 1989 meeting of the University Affiliated Programs and at a subsequent meeting with the New York State Office of Mental Retardation. These recommended areas served as the basis for the June 27, 1989, Memorandum of Understanding between AoA and ADD. The purpose of the MOU is to improve the coordination of programs administered by AoA and ADD which relate to the welfare of older persons with developmental disabilities. Under this agreement, AoA and ADD will jointly develop and implement initiatives to (1) promote a better understanding of programs serving the elderly and persons who are disabled between the AoA and ADD networks, (2) improve the coordination of prograss and services for older persons with developmental disabilities, and (3) promote the integration of these individuals into the mainstream of society. AoA and ADD will also undertake the development of other joint initiatives which promote the independence and well-being of older persons with developmental disabilities. International Conference on Aging and Developmental Disabilities--AoA and ADD provided funding for the 1990 international conference on research and practices in the area of aging and developmental disabilities. The purpose of the international conference is to assemble a group of international researchers, practitioners, and public officials to discuss state-of-the-art practices in aging and developmental disabilities. The objective of the conference is to synthesize the current practice and identify future areas of inquiry and program development. Conference participants will include individuals from Europe, Australia, and Hong Kong who are considered leaders in research or practice regarding older persons who are developmentally disabled. These individuals will interact with a selected group of national and State leaders within the United States and Canada with regard to research, practice, and public policy.83 Interagency Agreement between hA. and the National Institutefor Standards and Technology--pire Safety in Board and CareHomes--The major development in fire safety in recent years hasbeen the adoption of the Fire Safety Evaluation System forBoard and Care Homes into the Life Safety Code (Chapter 21).This system was developed by the National Bureau of Standards(now called the National Institute for Standards and Technology(NIST). In April 1989, AoA entered into an Interagencyagreement with NIST. The objective of the agreement is toassure a high level of fire safety in board and care homes andto decrease the cost of achieving such safety. Under thisagreement, AoA is participating jointly with the Department ofEducation, ADD, and the Health Care Financing Administration inthe funding of a project to evaluate the fire safety evaluationsystem in board and care homes and to foster the use of Chapter21 with an emphasis on determining the scope of its current useand the degree to which its use is achieving the desiredgoals. The project will provide information regarding whetheror not the use of the Chapter 21 model requirements provides ahigh level of safety at reasonable cost. SECTION II -TITLE III SUPPORTIVE aND NUTRITION SERVICES Introduction The Administration on Aging (AoA) is the lead component withinthe Department of Health and Human Services on all issuesconcerning Aging. It advocates for the needs of the elderly inprogram planning and policy development; provides technicalassistance; issues best practices guidelines; and initiatespolicy relative to funding the States and Territories for theprovision of services to older Americans according to Title III(Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging.) Each State Agency is required to subdivide the State intoPlanning and Service Areas (PSAs) and to designate within eachPSA an Area Agency on Aging (AaA) to be specifically responsiblefor carrying out the purposes of the Act within the PSA. Whilemost States have a statewide network of Area Agencies on Aging,fifteen States/Territories have designated their entiregeographic area as a single PSA with the State agency performingthe Area Agency functions because of their small geographicareas or population size. state Agencies on Aging The Older Americans Act provides that the State Agency on Agingshall be the leader relative to all aging issues on behalf ofall older persons in the State. This means that the StateAgency proactively carries out a wide range of functionsrelated to advocacy, planning, coordination, interagencylinkages, information sharing, brokering, monitoring andevaluation designed to develop or enhance services for olderpersons throughout the State. Fifty-nine (59) States and otherjurisdictions receive support under Title III of the Act.States may elect durations of two, three or four years forState and Area Plans. The State Agencies assure that the resources made available toArea Agencies on Aging under the Older Americans Act are usedto carry out the Area Agency mission of assisting older personsin leading independent, meaningful and dignified lives in theirown homes and communities as long as possible. State and Area Agencies on Aging work to facilitate the mosteffective use of all community resources, both public andprivate, to provide for appropriate services to older personswithin the many communities of the Planning and Service Area.To effectively accomplish this goal, there sut be acommunity-wide effort with all appropriate resources, programsand personnel carefully coordinated. State Agency Staffing In FY 1988, there were about 2,200 paid staff for the 59 StateAgencies on Aging (See Appendix III for staffing information.)84 Area Agencies on Aging In FY 1989, there were over 670 Area Agencies on Aging operating under Title III of the Act. As of the end of FY 1989, there were approximately 684 Planning and Service Areas, including the 15 Single Planning and Service Areas, previously mentioned, covering whole States and Territories. An Area Agency on Aging may be a public or private organization, an Indian Tribe or a sub-State regional body. Area Agencies on Aging have the major responsibility for the administration, at the sub-state level, of Title III funds for supportive and nutrition services. Area Agencies receive their funds from the State Agency on Aging and then award grants and contracts to local supportive and nutrition service providers under an approved area plan. Area Agencies on Aging are responsible for providing technical assistance to and monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of, their respective service providers. Through their coordination and planning activities, Area Agencies also address the concerns of older persons at the community level. Area Agencies interact with other local public and private agencies and organizations in order to coordinate their respective activities and elicit or \"leverage\" additional resources to be used on behalf of older persons. Area Aoencv Staffing In FY 1988, approximately 13,500 people were employed by Area Agencies on Aging. This personnel was augmented by approximately 99,000 volunteers throughout the nation. Fundino State and Area Agencies on Aging State Agencies on Aging received a total of $715.2 million of Title III funds during FY 1989. Funds under this Title of the Act are made available to the States on a formula basis upon approval of State Plans by AoA Regional Offices. States then allocate funds to Area Agencies based upon approved Area Plans to pay up to 85 percent of the costs of supportive services and senior centers, and nutrition services. In most cases, Area Agencies on Aging then arrange with both nonprofit and proprietary-service providers to deliver nutrition and other services described in the Area Plan. In general, funds provided to Area Agencies are used for the administration and provision of a wide range of supportive and nutrition services authorized under parts B. C and D of Title III as described in the next paragraph. Title III Services Title III activities conducted in the States during FY 1989 were based upon State plans ranging in duration from two to four years. In FY 1989 four separate allocations under Title III were made to States for: (a) supportive services and senior center operations; (b) congregate nutrition services; (c) home-delivered meals; and (d) in-home services for the frail elderly. The 1987 amendments to the Older Americans Act newly established Part D to Title III for in-home services for the frail elderly. (See Appendix II for State allotments under Title III in FY 1989). Title III-B supportive services are designed to provide assistance to all older persons, with particular attention to older persons in greatest economic or social need. Most .supportive services fall in three broad categories: access services; in-home services; and other community and neighborhood services. Access services are transportation; outreach; and information and referral. Most in-home services are either homemaker; personal care; chore; and/or visiting and telephone-reassurance. Community and neighborhood services include, legal services; residential repair; escort services; health services; physical fitness programs; pre-retirement and second career counseling; and other services.85 Data on Title III services and program operations are reflectedin Program Performance Reports which are sent to AoA each yearby the State Agencies on Aging through AoA's ten RegionalOffices. The Title III Program Performance Reports for FY 1988were analyzed during FY 1989. The national program statisticsfor FY 1988 are provided in Appendix III. These data pertainto: participation levels for Title IXI-B supportive services;service characteristics and participation under Title III-Cnutrition programs; and Title III-D in-home services for frailolder persons. Selected program data are presented in thefollowing paragraphs. The 1987 Amendments to the Older Americans Act require theAdministration on Aging to report to Congress specificinformation regarding the programs and activities under theAct. Although this information was collected by the States forFY 1989, it will not be available until FY 1990. Title III-B Supportive Services In FY 1988, the Title III-B program reached an estimated 8.2million older clients in need of access, in-home, andcommunity-based services. In FY 1988, 16 percent of allparticipants were racial and ethnic minorities and 41 percentwere low income. In the area of access services, transportationwas the most frequently provided service, followed byinformation and referral, then outreach. Of four definedin-home categories, reassurance to elderly persons throughvisiting and telephone contacts was reported most frequently,followed by homemaker, chore, and home health aide services. ofthe four services in the community and neighborhood category,health services were most frequently provided, followed bylegal, escort, and residential repair/renovation services. Title III-C. Congregate and Home Delivered Nutrition Services Congregate and Home-Delivered Nutrition Services, authorized byTitle III-C, continue to be an integral part of the systemswhich communities are developing to assist their older citizensin maintaining independence and remaining in their own homes aslong as possible. Congregate Nutrition Services Over 147 million congregate meals were served to older peopleand their spouses during FY 1988; this total represents anincrease from the FY 1987 figure of 146 million. In addition toTitle 111-C funds, these meals are also supplemented andsupported by United States Department of Agriculture funds;Social Services Block Grant program funds; and other Federal,State/local funds; and participant contributions. Over 2.7million elderly received meals at congregate sites. Home-delivered meals are also critical to the maintenance ofindependence for older persons who are unable to participate incongregate meals programs. During FY 1988, 94.6 million mealswere provided to the homebound elderly from Title. III-C andother funding sources. This number represents an increase overthe 85.9 million home-delivered meals served in FY 1987. Atotal 745,097 older persons received home-delivered meals. II-. In-Home Services for Frail Rlderly Title III-D, In-Home Services for Frail Older Persons, wasestablished by the 1987 Amendments to the Older Americans Act,and funds became available for the first time in FY 1988.Title 111-D program perforuance data for FY 1988 were optionaland less than half of the State Agencies on Aging reporteddata. In FT 1989, State Agencies were required to submit TitleIII-D data, however, this information will not be analyzeduntil FY 1990.86 Allotment Transfers Under the Older Americans Act, the State Agencies on Aging have the authority to transfer limited amounts of funds among three of the Title III allotments (parts B and C) in order to better reflect their local needs and priorities. (See Appendix III for Title III State Allotments after Transfers in FY 2989.) In FY 1989 the net transfers were as follows: Net Percent Transfers Change* Title III-B (Supportive Services) +$26,349,922 (Home-Delivered Meals) +$32,201,047 +41.0% * Transfer as percent of original allotment. Advocacy and Partnershis- In advocating for older persons, State and Area Agencies on Aging review and comment on State and community policies, programs and issues; provide testimony at public hearings; publish reports; coordinate and provide technical assistance to other public and private agencies and organizations; and leverage resources from other Federal, State and local programs, as well as private charitable and business resources. Non-federal Resources and Proaram Income The Title III program has evolved from a relatively simple program of community service projects for older persons into a complex and highly differentiated -national network on aging' currently consisting of 59 State Agencies and over 670 Area Agencies on Aging and more than 25,000 local nutrition and supportive service providers. These nutrition and supportive service providers are local public, private, or voluntary organizations. Not only do the State and Area Agencies on Aging use Title III monies to provide for services, they also are instrumental in leveraging other public and private monies in addressing the needs of older persons. Title III regulations (45 C.F.R. Part 1321) require each service provider to \"provide each older person (receiving services) with a full and free opportunity to contribute toward the cost of the service.\" Although AOA emphasizes through the aging network that this is not a fee and that contributions are entirely voluntary, these contributions have been steadily increasing, as follows: FY 1981 $ 79.0 million FY 1982 100.8 116.7 1987 163.6 million FY 1988 168.1 million FY 1989 (Data unavailable until late December) Ombudsman Programs The State Agencies are authorized by Section 308 of the Act to retain a specified portion of their Title III allocations to help defray their administrative costs. In addition, State Agencies use part of their Title III-B (Supportive Services and Senior Centers) funds and funds from other sources to establish and maintain long term care ombudsman programs at the State and sub-State levels. Through their ombudsman programs, States have addressed such issues as nursing home regulations, abuse of residents' personal funds, and restrictions on access to nursing homes. Complaint statistics and program data for the FY 1988 reporting period were analyzed during FY 1989. Some highlights of these data are as follows:87 o During FY 1988, the most recent period for which data areavailable, there were 578 sub-state programs. o Total funding for State and local ombudsman programs in FY1988 increased from approximately $20.3 million to about523.3 million. In addition to Title III-B funds, State andlocal governments used funds from other sources, includingState, county, and local revenues, grants under Titles IVand V of the Older Americans Act, and other funding sources. o Nationwide, more than 10,300 people worked in State andlocal ombudsman programs during FY 1988, includingprofessional and volunteer staff. Waivers as Related to Priority Services The Older Americans Act, as amended, requires that theAdministration on Aging collect and report special informationabout access, in-home and legal assistance services. Section 307(a)(22) requires that each State Agency include in its State Plana minimum percentage of Title III-B funds which each Area Agencymust expend on access, in-home and legal assistance servicesunless the state grants a waiver to the Area Agency. Section 306(b)(2) describes the requirements which must be met by an AreaAgency that requests a waiver from providing the required minimumamount for one or more of the priority services and by the Stateagency in granting any such waiver request. The Administration on Aging compiled a report on waivers ofpriority services as required under the Act. The followingprovides an brief overview of the report: The Act permits State Agencies to grant waivers to AreaAgencies that have not expended the mandated minimums for priorityservices. The Act also requires the State Agency to followrigorous procedures in their respective granting and review ofwaivers, Of the 663 Area Agencies on Aging in the country, only atotal of 17 waivers were granted by five States. All of thewaivers were found to be complete. Of the 17 waivers granted bythe States three were for access, nine were for in-home servicesand five were for legal assistance. The data suggest that there is a high level of compliance with theprovisions of the Act. The States have set minimum expenditurelevels for the priority services. For most Area Agencies on Agingthe States report that the actual expenditure levels have beenmet. Some exceptions reflect the expected receipt of final fiscalreports. It is clear that the States have taken the Congressional mandateseriously as well as the freedom to define appropriate proportion. SECTION III -SERVICES TO AMERICAN INDIAN, ALASKAN NATIVE. AND NATIVE HAWAIIANS TITLE VI GRANTS FOR NATIVE AMERICANS Under Title VI of the Older Americans Act, the Administrationon Aging annually awards grants to provide supportive andnutritional services for older Native Americans. In the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1987 (P.L. 100-175,signed November 29, 1987) a change was made in Title VI to addolder Native Hawaiians to the American Indians and AlaskanNatives who were already being served by Title VI. When TitleVI had first been added to the Older Americans Act in 1978, itwas named \"Grants for Indian Tribes.\" The Amendments of 1987renamed Title VI and divided it into two parts. The new nameof the title is 'Grants for Native Americans.\" The two partsare Part A, \"Indian Program,\" which includes older Indiansand Alaskan Natives, and a new Part B, \"Native HawaiianProgram,\" for older Native Hawaiians. The law stated thatTitle VI Part B would take effect only if the totalappropriation for Title VI exceeded the appropriation forFiscal Year 1985 (which had been $7,500,000). Thus at thebeginning of Fiscal Year 1989 no funds were available forNative Nawaiians, since the original appropriation had beenonly $7,410,000. The $7,410,000 was distributed effectiveApril 1, 1989 to 181 Indian tribal organizations, for anaverage grant of $40,439.88 Later in the fiscal year, however, Congress reprogrammed funds among the titles of the Older Americans Act so that a total of $10,710,000 was available under Title VI; this included $9,345,000 for the American Indians and Alaskan Natives under Title VI Part A, and $1,365,000 for Native Hawaiians under Part B. Of the $9,345,000 available under Part A, $7,410,000 had already been distributed to 181 tribal organization grantees effective April 1, 1989. Thus the amount available for late supplements for Title VI Part A grantees was $1,935,000. (See Appendix V for amounts of Fiscal Year 1989 grants, including the supplements.) The amount of $1,365,000 available for organizations serving older Native Nawaiians was awarded in September, 1989 to Alu Like, Inc., a statewide nonprofit organization in Honolulu, Hawaii. Their application described services which would be provided to older Native Hawaiians in the five major islands of the State. The plans included congregate meals, transportation, health awareness and screening, education and recreation classes, and individualized services including escort, friendly visiting, and telephone reassurance. They plan to develop service centers for older Native Hawaiians on each island, located on or near the Hawaiian Home Lands, which are areas for Native Nawaiians. ELDERS ELIGIBLE UNDER TITLE VI Persons eligible for Title VI Part A services are tribal members age 60 or over living in a Tribe's Title VI Part A service area, and members under age 60 if the Tribe has selected a younger age for -older Indian.\" The Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981 allowed Tribes to set a younger age for \"older Indian, if considered appropriate. The 181 grantees of Title VI Part A for Fiscal Year 1989 estimated that 73,068 older Indians were eligible for Title VI Part A services, including 58,409 age 60 or over, and 14,659 under age 60. (See Appendix V for the number over and under age 60 for each Tribe, and the age of \"older Indian\" selected.) For services under Title VI Part B, Native Hawaiians must be age 60. Alu Like, Inc., the grantee, estimated that 1,300 older Native Hawaiians were in the proposed Title VI Part B service areas on the five major islands and thus were eligible for Title VI services. The grantee estimated that there were a total of 10,876 older Native Hawaiians in the entire State of Hawaii. STUDY OF SERVICES fOR OLDER INDIANS The 1987 Amendments to the Older Americans Act in Section 134(e) directed the Commissioner on Aging to study the availability and quality of services under the Act to older Indians. The study was completed and forwarded to the Congress on April 21, 1989. OFFICE FOR AMERICAN INDIAN, ALASKAN NATIVE, AND NATIVE HAWAIIAN PROGRAMS (OAIANNHP) On May 19, 1989 the Commissioner on Aging established the Office for American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian Programs within AoA. This new Office was charged with the responsibility to serve as the focal point within AoA for the operation and assessment of programs authorized under Title VI of the Older Americans Act (OAA) and to provide program and policy direction to the ten Regional Offices of AoA in the execution of their Title VI responsibilities. Additional functions of the Office are to serve as the effective and visible advocate on behalf of older Native Americans, to coordinate activities with other Federal departments and agencies, to administer and evaluate grants provided under the OAA to Indian tribes and public and nonprofit private organizations serving Native Hawaiians, and to collect and disseminate information related to the problems of older Native Americans.89 INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE ON OLDER INDIANS The 1987 Amendments in Section 134(d) directed theCommissioner on Aging to establish a permanent InteragencyTask Force on Older Indians, with representatives ofdepartments and agencies of the Federal Government with aninterest in older Indians. The responsibility of the TaskForce, as stated in the 1987 Amendments, is to report to theCommissioner at 6-month intervals on their findings andrecommendations with respect to facilitating the coordinationof services and the improvement of services to older Indians.The Task Force is to be chaired by the Associate Commissioneron American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian Agingwho is to be appointed by the Commissioner. At the end of thefiscal year, plans were underway for convening the Task Force. SECTION IV -AOA DISCRlTONARY PROGRAMS TITLE TV-A EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS Sections 410 and 411 of the Older Americans Act authorize theaward of grants and contracts to assist in recruiting persons,including minorities, to enter the field of aging; to trainprofessional and paraprofessional persons employed in orpreparing for employment in fields having an impact on theaging; and to provide technical assistance and other activitiesrelated to training. Other section of Title IV authorize healthpromotion projects and projects in long term care. Several of the AoA National Goals for FY 1990 constitute theorganizing framework for describing AoA's education anddevelopment initiatives in FY 1989. These goals are: o Manpower Development o Tarpetting -- Strategic Resource Allocation o Promotion and Enhancem of Communit sed ServiceSystems o Prevention and alternatives to Institutional Care o Public Private Partnerships o Strengthening the Family and Generation Bonding Highlighted below are new and continuing education anddevelopment project activities for FY 1989 under each of thesesix (6) AoA national objectives, grouped according to specificfocus areas. 1. MANPOWER DEVH HEN The primary objective of the education and training programis to improve the quality of service and to help meetcritical shortages of adequately trained personnel forprograms in the field of aging. Specifically, activitiessupported under this program support the AoA Objective ofpromoting State and community leadership as they endeavorto meet the need for qualified individuals to assumeleadership roles in developing and implementing responsivecommunity-based systems of care for the elderly. In FY 1989, AoA awarded eighteen (18) new grants in threetraining areas. A brief description of some of the majoractivities which these projects will undertake is presentedbelow along with a description of major ongoing projectsfunded in FY 885 A. National Leadership Institute on Aging During itsfirst year the activities of the Institute focused onthe development of program philosophy, conceptualframework, curriculum and other design andimplementation tasks. These activities included thedevelopment of curriculum modules, program agenda andtraining materials, hiring of staff, selection oftraining site, faculty selections, establishment of anAdvisory Committee which was convened twice,development of participant selection procedures, anddesign and dissemination of promotional materials.90 Two 12-day residential seminars were successfully conducted in Nay and September, 1989, for approximately 65 participants. The residential seminars, the core of the program, are intended to assist aging network executives to examine and develop their leadership styles and capacities and to challenge and inspire them to seek new ways to fulfill their roles as key policy makers in our rapidly expanding aging society. The response of the participants to the training program has been overwhelmingly positive. B. Native American Leadershim Institute In FY 1988 one (1) grant was awarded to Three Feathers Associates to conduct a training program for Title VI Directors. The first Native American Leadership Institute on Aging was held August 13-23 in Alexandria, Virginia and provided comprehensive training to Title VI Directors. The training increased the competencies and leadership skills of the Title VI Directors in administering and managing multi-service aging programs for Indians and Alaskan Natives. Segments of the curriculum included legislative and administrative history of aging services, program planning and implementation, program management and gerontology issues. The Institute training encouraged networking between Title VI projects and enhanced the Title VI Director's understanding of community-based care systems development which will enable them to improve linkages with State Agencies on Aging and Area Agencies on Aging. C. Career Training for Professionals and Paraprofessionals A wide variety of professional and paraprofessional occupations significantly impact the lives of older people. To affect this population the Administration on Aging encouraged the inclusion of aging content in programs leading to certification or academic degree for persons in the field or preparing to enter these fields as an area of priority. Programs targeted to benefit from specialized gerontological or geriatric content in their career preparation include, physical therapists, counselors, occupational and recreational therapists, home economists, pharmacists, home health aids and others. ongoing Projects In September, 1988, nineteen grants were awarded in this category; four have reached their completion date and the other fifteen are due to come to a close in the first three months of 1990. Each program chose a unique and individualized method to achieve the, more or less, common objective, to include gerontological content in their curriculum in the present and as an existing part of future instruction. Examples of the types of projects funded are: (1) initiate a teaching nursing home\" and develop an assessment tool to identify at-risk community elderly and (2) improve counseling services to older persons by increasing and institutionalizing gerontological counseling concepts and courses into existing counselor preparation programs. As a part of the career preparation for professionals and paraprofessionals training priority area, Gallaudet University, Washington. D.C., was awarded a two year grant to develop a curriculum in aging and hearing impairment to train graduate level social workers in the knowledge, values, and skills necessary to work effectively with hearing impaired older persons. The project is designed to produce a sequence of courses and field instruction for a specialization in gerontology and hearing impairment and to produce a cadre of social workers who can provide direct services, participate in community planning and conduct research for the benefit of elderly persons who are hearing impaired. New projects During FY 1989 AoA awarded seven (7) new grants to institutions of higher education for gerontological training and development projects.91 These projects have focused on several key areas including faculty development in gerontology,replication of succeesful curricula in institutions where gerontology has not been taught an extensively, and development of gerontological faculty and programs in minority institutions. Examples of projects include: (1) a project to provide gerontologicaltraining to faculty of 25 American Indian colleges; (2)replication of a successful gerontological social workcurriculum in seven institutions in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands; and (3) development of gerontological programs in several Now York City institutions with high minority enrollments. D. short Term Training and Continuing Education Ongoing Projects Fourteen (14) PY 80 in-service training and continuing education grants were ongoing in 1989. These had been awarded to State Agencies on Aging, academic institutions, and national aging and professional organizations to develop and conduct training activities for persons currently employed in occupations serving the elderly. Occupational groupsrepresented in these projects include hospital discharge planners, social workers, home health and nurses aides, ministers, nursing home administrators, residential care managers, physicians, dentists and pharmacists. Examples of the types of projects funded are: 1) A project in Arizona developed and implemented a workshop training program for nurses aides working in long term care facilities in Arizona on the care of Alzheimer's Disease patients. 2) Three (3) projects developed and implemented state-wide training of 1200 discharge planners andother health professionals serving older persons over one to four day periods. The purpose of the training was to increase the effectiveness of discharge planning, improve quality of patient care and enhance appropriate utilization of resources. The projects feature a multidisciplinary approach for developing collaborative working relationships between hospital personnel and the aging services network with special emphasis on continuity of care. 3) One project conducted a training program for Clergy and Aging Network personnel in Georgia. The purpose of this projects was to establish a statewide training model for a continuing education certificate inGerontology in Religion and Aging. The training centered on gerontology and coalition building, resulting in clergy and agency staff collaboration that extends programs and services by, for and with older persons in Georgia. New projects In FY 1989, eight (8) grants were awarded to academic institutions, national professional organizations, and State Agencies on Aging to develop and conduct short-term training activities for persons working with or planning programs for the elderly. Occupational and professional groups targeted in these grants include in-home health and personal care workers, managers of elderly housing, hospital discharge planners, social service agency case managers, parole officers, and speech and hearing therapists, and academic teachers and researchers. Seven projects will develop and pilot test training curricula and materials in topical areas of specificfocus on special populations including, minorities, the frail and disabled, victims of dementia and elder abuse, older parolees, and low income housing tenants. The remaining project will place post-doctoral researchers and educators in aging and health care planning and service organizations to conduct three month planning, evaluation, and research studies guided by their host institution. 26-386 0 -90 -492 E. National Projects to IXurove Accreditation Recuirements in A.ing--Onaoina Projects Four (4) projects awarded to national professional organizations in FY 1988 to develop programs on improving the instructional content in gerontology and aging-related knowledge and skills in the fields and professions of homemaker-home health aides, physical therapists, social workers, nurses and counselors made substantial progress towards completion of their objectives. A common feature of these grants is the involvement of nationally known experts in these fields as members of working advisory boards, staff or consultants. They are helping to refine the competency standards of persons who work with the elderly in their field. Competencies are defined as the ability to demonstrate and apply specific skills, knowledge, and attitudes which are used in working with older peroono or in the conduct of work which has a substantial impact on the life of older persons. When consensus is reached, competencies are directly translated into professional and paraprofessional preparation, certification examination, and employment standards. F. Minority Manacement Traineeshin Proaram Onaoing Projects In FY 1988 The Administration on Aging awarded ten (10) grants in the area of Minority Training and Development. This priority area is designed to stimulate opportunities for training and the employment of minorities for management positions in the aging network. Five (5) of these grants were awarded to academic institutions, including two (2) Historically Black Colleges and Universities, two (2) to National Hispanic Aging organizations, one (1) to a State Office on Aging, one (1) to a City Office on Aging and one (1) to a State Association of Councils on Aging. This represents a total of 101 trainees to be placed in State and Area Agencies on Aging and social agencies serving.the elderly for administrative and managerial training. At the completion of the training period the trainee is expected to be hired in an administrative or managerial position by the host agency. If employment is not available in the host agency, the trainee will be assisted by the host agency and the grantee in locating employment in the aging network. Now irects In FY-1989 AoA awarded three (3) new awards for Minority Management Traineeship projects. Each of the grantees are national minority aging organizations which will conduct nationwide traineehip programs in a variety of organizational settings leading to management and administrative positions. 2. TARGETTING -- STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION HBCU INITIATIVE -- HEALTH PROMOTION AMONG MINORITIES Ten (10) projects were awarded under the FY 1989 AoA Historically Black Colleges and Universities Initiative (HBCU). The initiative is designed to meet the health promotion needs of older minority people. Louis W. Sullivan, M.D., U. S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that 'too many Americans, especially among minority populations, are not getting help or information about preventing disease.\" Research has indicated that, often, minority elderly are disproportionately impacted by negative variables that influence their health and that they are more likely to be disabled and see themselves as being in poor health than elderly white people. Evidence indicates that there is an urgent need to provide information about, encourage and motivate older minority people to adopt good physical and mental health practices. In addressing the issue, AoA responded to Presidential Executive Order 12677 which asks Federal agencies to support HBCUs and to enlist their participation in agency efforts to meet their mandates. -93 3. PROMOTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE SYSTEMS A. National Aaina Resource Centers on Long Term CareOngoing Projects Six national Aging Resource Centers on Long Term Carewere established in FY 88 for a three year period toprovide training and technical information to State andArea Agencies on Aging to assist them in working withcommunities, public and private agencies, professionalsand the public in implementing and coordinatingprograms and activities in a variety of topical areas.All six Centers were refunded during FY 1989. Each Center has a specific expertise in a field of longterm care. These include case management andassessment, quality assurance, data collection andanalysis, long term car management of Alzheimer'sDisease Patients, Medicaid coordination, supply andtraining of home care personnel, and supportiveservices and arrangements in adult housing. Centerscollect information and research results, produceissue synthesis papers, and provide consultations,training and technical assistance to State and AreaAgencies in their chosen areas of emphasis. The Centers and the Administration on Aging workjointly to develop work plans under the Centerscooperative agreements. During their initial year,each Center developed a national advisory committeewhich included representation of State and AreaAgencies on Aging and experts in long term care. AllCenters conducted a needs assessment of State and AreaAgencies to establish and priorities needs withinCenter topical areas. The results of this assessmentwere used to develop both the first year and future year work plans for each Center. Following are briefdescriptions of Centers which include their descriptionof their mission, core topics within this mission, andproducts which were worked on or completed in 1989. The NationalL Aging Resource Center on Long Term Care -Planning and Management of Community-Based Care at theBigel Institute for Health Policy Brandeis University,utilizes faculty and staff to assist State Agencies onAging in strengthening their policy-making, programplanning and program implementation capacities in thedelivery of coordinated, community-based long term careservices. During Year 1 the Center's topical moduleswere: (1) integration of health and long term carefinancing and service delivery systems, and (2)exploring best practices for recruitment and retentionof in-home workers with effective monitoring. Issuepapers on home care personnel, the Medicare catastrophiccoverage act, long term care financing and delivery,and developing private markets in long term care werepublished. The Center conducts numerous major trainingevents and responds to individual requests fortechnical assistance. The National Aging Resource Center on Lona Term Care -Decisions by Older Persons. Families and Providers(DEISTONSIE at the Schools Of Public Health and PublicAdministration, University of Minnesota, utilizesfaculty and staff to assist State and Area Agencyadministrators, planners, and policy makers in planningand implementing long term care service systems,including case management, which incorporate decisionmaking by older persons, their families andprofessionals care givers. During its first year ofoperation, the Center synthesized existing functionalassessment instruments covering physical, mental,cognitive, social interaction, and social supportswhich are in use or have been tested by health care andsocial service agencies and organization. The Centerpublishes a newsletter, conducts periodic conferencesin Minnesota and selective national professionalassociation meetings, and responds to individualrequests from State and Area Agencies on Aging forconsultation.94 The National Aaina Resource Canter on Long Term Care - Linkaaes between Aping Network. Nosnit and ORsidenti=VLXFAclitieis at the University of California at Los Angeles in collaboration with tho Universityof Southern California, utilizos faculty and otaff to promote better health-care partnerships among State and Area Agencies on Aging, hospitals and long term care facilities, decrease fragmentation and encourage more appropriate utilization by providers and consumers of the full range of options available to older persons to remain independent. The Center provides training and technical assistance to State Agencies in the areas of discharge planning, respite care, geriatric assessment programs, supportive housing and home modifications. Publications include a newsletter and materials on housing and home modification, respite care, emergency medical services and the Prospective Payment System. The National Aaina Resource Center on Lona Term Care - State Management of Community-Based Care Systems at the National Association of State Units on Aging, provides assistance to State Agencies on Aging that are integrating major community care components into cohesive service delivery systems. Major emphasis is placed upon development of new approaches for quality assurance and strengthening linkages among acute, primary and institutional care systems. During its first year of operation, the Center conducted teleconferences on State legislation and case management, with published proceedings, produced a Medicaid Orientation Guide, reports on minority elderly needs and quality assurance issues, and is developing a Case Management Policy Manual and Compendium of Training Materials. The Center disseminates a newsletter and information packets addressing emerging long term care issues, conducts periodic training conferences at regional and national association meetings, and responds to State Agency requests for on-site and telephone technical assistance. The National Agina Resource Center on Lana Term Care - Alzheimers Disease and other Dementias at the Suncoast Gerontology Center, University of South Florida is designed to respond to the needs and priorities identified by State Agencies on Aging as they plan, develop and implement programs and services for Alzheimer's Disease victims and their family caregivers. The Center provides State Agencies with information, national and regional training sessions, and technical assistance in establishing effective, comprehensive and coordinated statewide service systems and programs to recognize, diagnose, and provide short term treatment and long term management to Alzheimer's Disease patients, and meet the needs of their family caregivers. Center publications include a newsletter and applied research products, including best practice guides for educating minority caregivers, providing respite care, and evaluating day care centers. The Heartland Center on Aaina Disability and Lona Term Care at the National Center for Senior Living and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University at Indianapolis, utilizes faculty and staff resources from the multi-campus Indiana University systems, the University of Notre Dame and Purdue University Indian University, to provide technical assistance that meets the data needs and practices of State and Area Agencies on Aging in long term care planning and data analysis. The Center trains planners through workshops at national meetings, through site visits, and through a practitioner fellowship program. Information about selected data-based studies on special populations, such a minorities, low income, rural elders and disabled are disseminated through special reports and a national newsletter. Two special reports under development during the first year were a resource guide on use of national long term care data bases and a best practice guide on assessing needs of older persons.95 B. Community Focal Points Recognizing the important role which community focalpoints can play in community based systems, in FY 1989AoA awarded two projects to encourage the developmentof senior centers as community focal points for olderpersons. One is a contract to provide technicalassistance and training to the States and will focus onaccess and responsiveness of services. Trainingattendees will include representatives from StateAgencies on Aging and Area Agencies on Aging and AoARegional Offices. Products will include a brochure anda technical handbook. The second project is a two year grant to the develop amodel rural focal point system in Nebraska. It willdevelop, evaluate, and disseminate a methodology forthe development of community focal points in ruralareas. It will also create a resource manual adaptedto suit a rural environment and develop models forstate and community resource councils. A videotraining package for workshops will also be produced. C. center for State Lon Term Care Ombudsman Resources. This Center is operated by the National Association ofState Units on Aging in cooperation with the NationalCitizens Coalition for Nursing Home Reform. TheCenter's primary focus is on building Statewide systemsof ombudsman services to address the issues facingolder residents in long term care facilities. TheCenter initiated a number of activities during itsfirst year of a State OmbudsmanResource Manual; forinformation sharing with and among Conference for ombudsman and State staff; twotraining modules for States to use in training localombudsman; a simplified guide to OBRA legislation; anda bi-monthly Center newsletter called the -OmbudsmanReporter\". In addition to the Resource Center'sresponsibilities for technical assistance and trainingfor states, the Center is conducting a study ofombudsman services to residents of board and carefacilities. One section of this study is devoted touse of volunteers. 4. PREVENTION AND ALTERNATIVES TO INSTITUTIONA CARE During 1989 AoA carried out a wide range of activitiesaddressing the theme of prevention of dependency. Many ofthese centered on health promotion and diseaseprevention--both through funded projects and throughspecial initiatives and interagency activities. Thissection will describe the 1989 activities in this area. A. HEALTH PROMOTION -- Funded Projects NATIONAL RESOURCE CENTER ON HEALTH PROM AND AGING In FY 1988 AoA awarded a three year cooperativeagreement to the American Association of RetiredPersons (AARP) to establish a National Resource Centeron Health Promotion and Aging. The principal missionof the Center is to serve the State Units on Aging byproviding training and technical assistance as well asproviding information and other resources to agenciesand organizations who are interested in healthpromotion and older adults. In 1989, the Resource Center conducted a comprehensiveneeds assessment of the 59 State Units on Aging todetermine the extent of health promotion activities andneeds throughout the country. In addition, the Centercontinued to expand its activities with presentationsto Directors of State Units on Aging at three RegionalOffices of ArA and visited several other States. TheCenter disseminated thousands of copies of brochuresabout the Center and a quarterly health promotionnewsletter; is developing a video on health promotionfor minorities; and is providing intensive technicalassistance to State Units on Aging.96 AoA refunded the Center in FY 1989 for a second year of operation during which the Center will continue and expand its training and technical assistance to the States and will also focus on minority issues and will develop an extensive resource library. The Center is assisting in collaboration with National Council on Patient Information and Education in disseminating resource materials on patient education in support of 'Talk About Prescription Month' in October. Prototvye Health Promotion Projects -- SECTION 422(ai2 Ongoina Projects Nine (9) projects were awarded under the Fiscal Year 1988 priority area -Education for Self Care.\" All were awarded to public and private institutions of higher education. The purpose of this priority area was to solicit proposals for the design and development of prototype health education and promotion programs that could be adopted by States and their Area Agencies on Aging. Section 422(a)(2), authorizes AoA to support these activities at public or private institutions of higher education with graduate programs that have capability in the areas of public health; medical science; or gerontology. Prevention of Fire and Smoke Related Injuries and Death Four (4) projects were funded in FY 1988 which focused on two aspects of improving in-home fire safety for older persons: (1) public education and (2) programs to assist older persons to make necessary modifications to their living environment to minimize the risk of fires. Products thusfar developed have proven to be excellent. These include a 30-minute video, Public Service Announcements, brochures, training manuals, a research paper, and items to be used at meal sites including placemats, bill stuffers and posters. Additional, many hours of successful training of older persons, firefighters, family members, caregivers and service providers have been accomplished. lGcholiSU As part of both the Secretary's Initiative on Indian Alcoholism and the Departmental Initiative on Alcoholism, AoA continued its health promotion efforts in this area. The three projects awarded to Indian Reservations in 1988 to assist in developing alcoholism prevention and education programs for older persons and their caregivers continued their activities and will conclude in 1990. Four additional projects were in funded in 1989, also in response to the recommendations on Alcohol Use and Abuse from the 1988 Surgeon General's Workshop on Health Promotion and Aging. Two (2) projects are studying study alcohol abuse and alcoholism among the aged. Two (2) additional projects are developing model educational programs for older persons, their families, and formal and informal caregivers to recognize and seek help for problems related to alcohol use and abuse. American Association of Dental Schools (AADS) In FY 1987, a grant was awarded to the American Association of Dental Schools (AADS) to expand and improve the predoctoral curriculum in geriatrics in U.S. dental schools. The completed product, Thm Geriatric Dentiqtrv Curriculum Resource Rook, has proven to be an outstanding publication which is currently being widely disseminated. Additionally, AADS was funded in FY 1988 to improve the geriatric education provided by the U.S. Dental Hygiene schools. AADS will establish guidelines in dental hygiene, produce a resource book similar to the one described above, and present resource material to faculty during a two-day workshop.97 New Proiects The FY 1989 AoA Discretionary FundsProgram Announcement, in keeping with Section422(a)(2) of the 1987 Amendments of the OlderAmericans Act, encouraged institutions of highereducation to submit applications for prototype healtheducation and promotion programs. Nine (9) newprojects were funded and will focus on the followinghealth promotion topics: nutrition education forNative Americans; impairment; physical fitness and exercise; andalcoholism. Most of theses projects include thedevelopment and testing of prototype or model healtheducation and health promotion programs which can beadapted or replicated by a State or in other States.The discretionary grants funded this year, as well asthose funded in the last two years, will continue tohelp support AoA's substantial health promotion efforts. Another health related project was funded in FY 1989as a field initiated demonstration project. Thisproject will involve educating pharmacists throughoutFlorida about the cause, prevention and treatment ofDiabetic Retinopathy, as well as how to provideeffective patient and community education. In turn, the pharmacists will provide widespread education tovarious groups including Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and those of low or fixed incomes. B. HEALTH PROMOTION -- Snecial Initiatives andInteragency Activities NATIONAL HEALTH PROMOTION INITIATIVE The National Health Promotion Initiative for OlderPersons is a joint activity sponsored by theAdministration on Aging and the U.S. Public Healthservice. This multiyear activity was officially launched in 1984 with the signing of the first ofseveral Memoranda of Understanding between the twoagencies. The Initiative is designed to improve thehealth status of older persons and improve the quality of life of their later years. The Initiative has three major goals: (1) maximizingthe opportunities for older persons to liveindependently through improvement of their health status; (2) focusing attention on health promotion anddisease prevention through improved nutrition; physical fitness; smoking cessation; mental health;dental health; adult immunization; of smoke related accidents and injuries; and driverand pedestrian safety; and (3) curtailing healthexpenditures caused by preventable conditions. Somespecific activities conducted during FY 1989 to attainthese goals are discussed below. Administration on Aging/U.S. Public Health Service Memorandum of Understanding In 1989, AoA and PHS renewed their joint agreement onthe health promotion initiative, which has been ineffect since 1984. The revised Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is a collaborative effort with thevarious agencies which participate in the Health Promotion Initiative, including AoA and the following PHS agencies: the Office of the Surgeon General; theNational Institute on Aging; the Office of DiseasePrevention and Health Promotion; the Health Resources and Services Administration; the Food and DrugAdministration; the Centers for Disease Control; andthe National Institute of Mental Health. The Memorandum of Understanding will serve an the workingagenda for the health promotion initiative for thenext two years. Special emphasis will be onrevitalizing Statewide health promotion coalitions.Priority areas for 1989 are: alcoholism, smokingcessation, nutrition, injury prevention, and exercise. For 1990, the priorities are: diabetes,depression and hearing impairments.98 smoking Cessation The Administration on Aging, in conjunction with the Office of Smoking and Health, the Office of Disease Prevention, and the American Association of Retired Persons, began the development of an initiative to encourage older persons that 'It's Never Too Late to Quit Smoking.a The initiative, which is a follow-up to the recommendations of the 1988 Surgeon General's Workshop on Health Promotion and Aging, will include a public education and awareness campaign on the possibilities for stopping smoking at any age and will encourage older persons and their families and caregivers to seek the necessary resources to assist them in this effort. Othr Health Promotion Activities. The Administration on Aging supported the development and distribution of the fourth annual Health Promotion Calendar for Older Persons. Owing to the success of the prior calendars, the 1989 calendar was a joint effort between AoA, the National Council on the Aging and a private sector sponsor. The Administration on Aging again collaborated with the National Osteoporosis Foundation to produce a poster and materials in support of National Osteoporosis Month. This activity is-designed to raise national awareness of the prevalence of this disease among older persons and the possibilities which exist for prevention through modification of lifestyles. C. TXCNWGY MM AGING Another area in which AoA promoted alternatives to institutional care is in through the use of technology to help meat the needs of older people. In 1985, AoA entered into an agreement with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the Veterans Administration (VA), and the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (HIDRR). The purpose of this agreement is to collaborate on using NASA aerospace technology and scientific knowledge about aging to develop, produce and market devices to assist the elderly. As a result of this agreement, a prototype device to notify caregivers of wandering behavior by impaired older persons is being developed through a contract with Cortrex Electronics, Inc. The next step in this project will be clinical trials of the device. In addition, the agencies convened a roundtable of experts in December, 1988, on the seating and mobility needs of the elderly. A report was developed on the findings of the roundtable regarding the status of current technology and specific needs for further research and development. Small Business Innovation Research Proara' During TY 1989, five Phase II contracts were awarded under the Small Business Innovations Research Program (SBIR) to projects originally funded in PY 1988. These contracts address the issue of the application of technology to help meet the needs of older persons. Under the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219) DUBS and other federal agencies Get aside a specified portion of their research and development funds for an SBIR Program. The legislation is designed to stimulate technological innovation; use small business to meet federal research and development needs; increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal research and development; and foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation.99 SBIR is a three phase program. The Phase I contracts awarded in FY 1988 concluded in November 1988. In FY 1989, five Phase I contractors competed successfullyfor Phase II awards. Three contracts are for development of simple, low cost products that could enable older people to perform the tasks of dailyliving. TVo contracts are for the development and i plementation of a service delivery model that combines the use of low technology devices and traditional supportive services to effect greater independence by frail but mentally alert older persons. 5 PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS A. corporate Eldercars Increasing numbers of individuals have dual responsibilities as employees and as caregivers for older relatives. This has brought the issue of caregiving into the workplace. Corporations are beginning to recognize that the stress resulting from the uncertainties and responsibilities of caring for an older relative takes its toll in the workplace through lower morale, absenteeism and decreased productivity. This project provided intensive training in caregiving and aging issues to corporate human resource and employee assistance professionals in 12 cities across the country through teleconferencing technology. The AoA funded teleconference was developed and produced by the University of Bridgeport and the National Council on the Aging. It was supported in part by the American Association of Retired Persons and hosted by a corporate sponsor at each site. The project also focused on developing linkages between the employee assistance professionals and the State Agency on Aging through direct participation of State Directors on Aging at teleconference sites and through aging network involvement in the development of resource materials. B. Other Partnershins with Business washinaton Business Group on Health (WBGHV. WBGH is anational membership organization representing over 200 local business/health coalitions. This project has focused on the development of 12 model partnerships between business/health coalitions and the aging network. Four of these have been devoted exclusively to issues facing employed caregivers of older relatives. The remaining eight 'mini-grants\" are devoted to aging program development in a variety of areas including work and retirement, health promotion and health education. The project is producing an excellent bimonthly newsletter entitled \"Together in Aging\". Also, the project is nearing completion of a background paper and policy report for employers on the issue of caregiving as well as training materials for Area Agencies on Aging on encouraging corporate involvement in caregiving programs. In addition, project activities have been highlighted in a number of public foru s Some of these include a Congressional forum on public/private partnerships ineldercare co-sponsored with Olympia Snowe and John Glenn (November, 1955) and conferences co-sponsored with the National Association of Manufacturers (January, 1988) and the American Society on Aging (March, 1989). C. National Enerav and Aping Consortium. The Consortium is a coalition of national public and private sector organize- tions concerned about the energy related needs of the elderly. Energy related needs involve a broad spectrum of issues such as housing, assistive devices in the home, low income energy assistance and others. AoA takes an active role in the Consortium and100 serves as a member of the Steering Committee. A major focus of the Consortium is the development of State energy and aging consortia. To date, 14 such consortia have been established. During 1989 the Consortium's primary activity was to plan and convene a major national conference entitled 'Building Better Partnerships: Energy and the Elderly in the 1990's\" in Tulsa, Oklahoma in collaboration with the Oklahoma Energy and Aging Consortium. 6. STRENGTHENING THE FAMILY AND GENERATIONAL BONDING Intergenerational programming has emerged as a creative way of maximizing resources and meeting the needs of young and old. It is the caregiving system which helps the elderly person remain in the community setting, and it is the breakdown of this system which contributes to institutional placement. In an effort to provide respite care to families caring for physically and mentally disabled elders, project 'Time Out' -an intergenerational approach to respite care -was conducted by Temple University. This project demonstrated that an intergenerational approach to providing respite services is viable. Families who received services found the program very helpful. When supported by appropriate services, the families can nurture and care for their elders within the community. Information and materials for replication developed by this project include: (a) a 7-12 minute slide/tape show, (b) The Respite Worker's Handbook, (c) The Trainer's Manual, (d) Time Out brochures and posters and (e) A Program Development Manual. Title IV-6: Research and Demonstration Proiects Title IV-B of the Older Americans Act authorizes funding for research and demonstration projects to identify, assess and demonstrate new approaches and methods to improve the well-being and independence of older persons. The primary objective of AoA-supported research and demonstration projects is to assist in establishing, in every community of the nation, a comprehensive system of community services that responds to the talents and needs of older persons. To that end, AoA-supported research is aimed at developing new knowledge that will increase the capacity of State and local agencies, in both the public and private sectors, to assist older persons in achieving and maintaining ecomomic and personal independence. AoA-funded demonstration projects seek to test new models, systems and approaches for planning and organizing effective, comprehensive services delivery systems. Several of the AoA National Goals for FY 1990 constitute the organizing framework for describing AoA's research and demonstration initiatives in FY 1989. These goals are: o Older Persons as a Resource o Stren thenino the Family and Interasnerational Bondina o Prevention and Alternatives to Institutional Care o Promotion and Enhancement of Effective Community Based Service Systems o Taroettina -Strategic Resource Allocation New and continuing research and demonstration project activities carried out in FY 1989 are highlighted below. They are arrayed under each of the five (5) AoA national goals and grouped according to specific focus areas. 1. OLDER PERSONS AS A RESOURCE A. Emnlovment/Income Generation Projects Onaoina Project Activities: Activities continue on a project that focuses on sensitizing management and labor to the various methods that exist to increase employment and retention opportunities for older workers. The grantee is also looking at the different retirement planning services available at up to ten (10) corporations participating in the project.101 An award for continued funding of a project was made byAoA to a national organization to support activities aimed at transferring innovative, international, incomegenerating services to the United States. A majorpublication is being written synthesizingstate-of-the-art information, models and strategiesrelated to small enterprise development and the special needs of older workers. Additional efforts are being made to disseminate information about income-generating enterprises for the elderly. 2. STRENGTHENING THE FAMILY AND INTERGENERATIOAL BONDING A. Alzheimer's Disease Proaram Activities Onaoina Proiect Activities: During FY 1989 work continuedon a conference program jointly undertaken by AoA and theNational Institute on Aging (NIA). Thesestate-of-the-art conferences provide training andinformation about current practices in caregiving supportfor families of Alzheimer's Disease patients Theprogram, funded by AoA, supports eight (8) NIA-sponsoredAlzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRC's) to develop and implement fourteen (14) conferences that are targetedto State and Area Agencies on Aging, aging services providers, primary care and geriatric physicians, researchers, nurses, social workers, case managers, planners, and policy makers. AoA, in collaboration with the Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation (RWJF) and the Alzheimer's Association, Inc., (AAI) are jointly sponsoring the Dementia Care andRespite Services Program. This national undertaking isdesigned to demonstrate that non-profit day centers canprovide financially viable day programs and other respiteand health-related services needed by people with dementiaand their caregivers. The program consists of nineteen (19) RWJF funded projects, nine (9) of which are co-funded with AoA and nine(9) that are co-funded with AAI. Increasing State Agency on Aoing Leadership Caoacitv toAssist Alzheimer's Disease Victims and Their Families Onooina Project Activities: Continuing their AoA projectactivities, four (4) State Agencies on Aging are increasing their leadership capacity for making technicalsupport and expert training available to organizations inthe State that serve Alzheimer's Disease victims andtheir families. 3. PREVENTION AND ALTERNATIyLS TO CARE A. Housina and Sugoortive Services Ongoina Proiect Activities: Third and final yearcontinuation awards were made to four (4) projects funded in conjunction with the Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation. These projects are designed to assistlow-income elderly residents of public housing topurchase supportive services. Each project continued toprovide supportive services and develop mechanisms fororganizing and financing these services so they caneventually become self-supporting. C. Oualitv Assurance for In-Home Supoortive Services ongoing Project Activities: There has been a rapid increase in the need for and use of home care servicesby our aging society. The recent proliferation of providers, however, has heightened concern about the quality of care and the well-being and safety of older persons. To demonstrate ways of assuring higher standards of quality of in-home supportive services forolder people AoA has made continuation awards to ten(10) State Agencies on Aging to develop and demonstrate model quality assurance systems. Some salient elements of these models are: intermediate sanctions to addresssubstandard providers; consumer education and consumerfeedback; regulatory requirements, licensure/sanctions;focus on prevention; use of long term care ombudsmen;use of volunteers as mediators; and self-advocacy.102 4. PROMOTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE SYSTEMS A. Community Systems Develonment Efforts New Prolect Activities: Four (4) grant awards were made to State Agencies on Aging to encourage and support efforts to build responsive community based systems for older persons. Each State agency is focusing on one or more unmet service needs particularly critical to the older population of the State. The effort at both the State and local levels focuses on collaboration with other State and local agencies. One State is developing models for community focal points in rural areas while another is initiating programs to recruit, train, and retain long term care workers. A third project is focusing on the development of a community based adult day care program where currently no such program exists in the State. A fourth grantee is looking at solutions to the problem of broadening access to health care in a rural State. I B. Field initiated Research And Demonstrations On communitv FRaed Systems of Care New Proiect Activities: Under the FY 1989 Discretionary Funds Program AoA made two (2) awards to promote more effective community based care to older persons. One project will determine the efficacy of using rural hospitals as community focal organizations working in conjunction with AAA's and senior centers to coordinate health and social services to older persons. The second project will demonstrate the efficacy of a state-wide health promotion campaign to prevent and treat diabetic retinopathy, particularly among high risk older. populations. Onaoina Proiect Activities: In FY 1989 AoA made six (6) continuation awards to projects that are developing an information and knowledge base on community based .service systems. These research projects are analyzing current examples of planning and decision-making to determine those models which have been effective in developing comprehensive and coordinated systems of services for older persons. As a result, aging agencies at both the State and community levels should better understand what resources and abilities are required to exercise their leadership responsibilities. Three (3) projects are employing different approaches and looking at different communities in assessing models for organizing and implementing community based systems of care. A fourth project is comparing and contrasting alternative methods of staffing and providing services to victims of elder abuse. Another project is examining models of State level long term care insurance programs, including a determination of whether it is feasible to include coverage for home and community care services. The sixth project is using site visits, interviews, and case study analyses to develop a guidebook that will identify and discuss the critical stages of development of community based systems of care for use by States and localities. B. State Agencv on Aning Leadership Roles for Elderly Housing Onooina Project Activities: Three State Agencies on Aging received a second year continuation grant to continue efforts to demonstrate effective models for State agency leadership in the housing area. State agencies are working at the State level to influence State actions. At the local level they are assisting their Area Agencies on Aging to develop comprehensive community based housing plans in several communities across the State.103 C. Leal Assistance For Older Persons Ongoing Proiect Activities: Legal assistance is an important means whereby older persons gain access to the range of opportunities and benefits available through their community service systems. AoA made continuation awards to six (6) organizations to provide national support to State and Area Agencies on Aging, legal services developers, and legal assistance providers for older persons. These projects are designed to make legal assistance more available to older persons, especially those with the greatest economic and social needs, and to coordinate legal assistance programs with the supportive services provided under Title III of the Older Americans Act. The grantees provide substantive case consultation and training in areas of the law of special importance to older persons. By funding these national legal assistance support projects, AoA helps to ensure that lawyers, paralegals, and others have the resources available to provide effective, high quality legal assistance to older persons in need. Four State Agencies on Aging received awards to continue project activities concerned with the expansion or improvement of the delivery of legal assistance to older individuals. Two projects demonstrate the use of less restrictive alternatives in guardianship cases. The third project tests the feasibility of delivering legal assistance to homebound, rural older persons through a network of volunteer seniors and pro bono attorneys. The fourth project employs a needs assessment to improve its statewide system of using lay advocates in each county aging unit to provide legal assistance to older persons. 5. TARGETTING -STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION A. Alternatives To Guardianshin New Proiect Activities* In FY 1989 AoA made grant awards to three (3) now projects that are designed to encourage further development of alternatives to guardianship. One project will demonstrate a model of early intervention services for older persons in three (3) communities. This model will include: representee payee services; bill payer services; and the development of self-help materials on money management. A second project is developing a national training module on guardianship alternatives and support services for the aging network, including providers of aging, legal, social, and adult protective services. This module is being tested in three (3) States. The third project is developing a knowledge base about guardianship systems through a national survey of State practices in such areas as assignment and provision of guardianship services and the characteristics of adults affected by guardianship. B. Developing Minority Elderly Aaendas in National organizatiofns New Project Activities: In FY 1989 AoA made five (5) awards to national organizations to develop or enhance their own knowledge of minority aging issues and to broaden their capacity to deal with the concerns of low income minority elderly on an on-going basis. In addition, these organizations are conducting the following activities: (1) creating a national network of Hispanic community-based groups committed to serving the elderly; (2) undertaking collaborative efforts between two national organizations, one of which serves the Black elderly, to develop local programs for the Black elderly using the resources of both organizations; (3) developing support, on a national level, to expand research initiatives focused on issues concerning minority elderly; (4) supporting State Minority Task Forces through training and technical assistance; (5) encouraging national organizations representing104 components of State governments to address minority elderly issues and; (6) training minority professionals to become leaders in the field of aging. An additional award was made to a national organization to support its efforts to be responsive to the needs of elderly Pacific/Asians. Onaoina Proiect Activities: Three (3) national minority organizations addressing the interests of the Hispanic, Black, and Native American communities continued their AoA project activities in FY 1989. A significant part of these activities are focused on mobilizing community.. resources to provide a continuum of care for vulnerable older persons and to help them live as independently as possible. C. studies on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Axona the Aaed New Project activities* In FY 1989 AoA funded two (2) new projects to develop a knowledge base about the incidence and prevalence of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems among older people. Research activities include collection of data on such factors as drinking patterns, psychosocial behaviors, family relationships, life satisfactions, home environments, health, financial issues, and personal values. Outcomes of these projects will help State and local governments plan future programs focused on prevention, detection, and treatment of alcoholism among their older citizens. In addition, one of the projects is developing a computerized data base so that researchers will be able to investigate various issues related to alcohol-related problems among the Black elderly. D. Research On Native American Aping Ongoing Project Activities! Five (5) grantees continue their project activities designed to develop a knowledge base that will give AoA, and other appropriate organizations, a clearer understanding of the needs of older Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. These activities will also provide insight into how resources can be better targeted to these minority aging populations. Data are being collected on such factors as demographics; health, housing, and socio-economic conditions; and the availability and accessability of supportive services. E. National Aaina Resource Center on Elder Abuse Ongoing Project Activities: The National Aging Resource Center on Elder Abuse (NARCEA) is led by the American Public Welfare Association working in collaboration with the University of Delaware and the National Association of State Units on Aging. Established in FY 1989, NARCEA serves as a resource of information, data, and technical expertise on elder abuse to State and local aging and adult protective service personnel, to other professionals and practitioners concerned with elder abuse, and to the public. During its first year, HARCEA conducted informational and technical assistance workshops at nine conferences involving professional groups, aging and protective service agencies, and organizations representing service providers working in the field of elder abuse. The Center organized teleconferences in which eighty State Aging and Adult Protective Services personnel, representing thirty-three States, participated to identify training and technical assistance needs and existing resources. As a result, NARCEA published a report of the ten priority training and technical assistance needs identified thru the teleconferences and followed up with four Technical Assistance Memoranda to State Aging and Adult Protective Services Offices. In addition, the Center has developed a file which identifies, by State, resources such as training curricula, research findings, videos, and persons recognized to be experts in specific aspects of elder abuse research, training, and services.I105 NARCEA's principal mechanisms for informationdissemination are MACEA EXCHANGE, a quarterlynewsletter, and the Clearinghouse on Abuse and Neglectof the Elderly (CANE). Three issues of NMARCEA EXCHANGE were disseminated free of charge to 2,600 personslocated in all fifty States, the District of Columbia,and the U.S. territories. CANE generated customizedannotated bibliographies and filled requests forpublications. NARCEA concentrated its first year research efforts ondeveloping a report which analyzes State elder abuseincidence data for the years 1986 thru to 1988. F. National Resource Center on Minority Aging Populations Onaoing Project Activities: The National Resource Center on Minority Aging Populations was established in FY 1989as a collaborative effort between San Diego StateUniversity and the University of Southern California. The Center was established to serve as a national focalpoint for techical assistance, training, informationdissemination, and short-term research. Its efforts aresupporting States, communities, educational institutions,professionals in the field, and the public inunderstanding and responding to issues affecting minority elderly. During FY 1989, the Center queried all States for theirtechnidal assistance and training needs and presented numerous workshops on a variety of minority aging issues. It developed a registry of resources for minority aging populations and created a computerized clearinghouse onminority aging. The Center began publication of abimonthly newletter, The Minority Agina Exchange. It published a Mini-Report on Targeting in the OlderAmerican Act and revised a previously written manual,\"Enhancing Services to Minority Elderly TrainingManual\". The Center is responding to ad hoc technicalassistance requests from State Agencies on Aging on avariety of issues related to minority elderly. G. National Resource Center for Rural Elderly Ongoing Project Activit: The National Resource Canterfor Rural Elderly was established in FY 1989 at theUniversity of Missouri at Kansas City. Its technicalassistance, training, information dissemination, andshort-term research efforts are supporting States,communities, educational institutions, professionals inthe field, and the public in understanding andresponding to issues affecting the rural elderly. The Center is serving as a national focal point for theidentification of best-practice programs and servicesfor the rural elderly in three primary focus areas(access/transportation, health/care coordination,andhousing/assisted living alternatives). The Centerconducted workshops in the areas of access/transportationand needs assessments and also developed manuals inthese areas for dissemination early in FY 199o. The Center is publishing a bimonthly newsletter anddeveloped and disseminated a -Rural ElderlyBibliography.\" The Center is responding to ad hoctechnical assistance requests from State Agencies onAging on a variety of issues related to the ruralelderly.106 SECOTON V -RVALmATION Section 206 of the Older Americans Act authorizes evaluation of the impact of programs funded under the Act, including their effectiveness in achieving stated goalo. AoA's evaluation program in FY 1989 included the finalization of one project. This evaluation, entitled OA Short Term Evaluation of the Visibility of Aging Services Systens at the Local lsvel', studied the strategies for increasing the visibility of aging services at the local level. The overall purpose of this study was to identify successful efforts that have been undertaken to increase public awareness, knowledge, and understanding of aging services at the local level. The project also examined how these efforts have been implemented, characteristics of State and Area Agencies conducting these activities, State and Area Agencies' efforts to strengthen ties among services for older persons, and the impact of increased public awareness on the system of aging services within the community. The results of this evaluation are being considered by AoA as it develops initiatives in fulfilling AoA's goals and objectives.

In the 1987 Amendments to the Older Americans Act, the Administrationon Aging was directed to annually publish goals for the coming fiscal year, beginning inFiscal Year 1989. It is altogether fitting and appropriate that, as we approach the lastdecade of the 1990's and the Silver Anniversary of the Older Americans Act, we begin toexpand our goal efforts and begin preparing our society to address policy issues which willcertainly carry over through the 1990's and beyond, into the 21st Century. It is importantthat our society becomes focused on the need to build adequate capacity to respond tothe dramatic increases in the older population during the next century. It is our intent to expand that effort; to respond more substantively and relevantly to theneeds, not only of older persons, but also of the nation-wide aging network which wasestablished to assure their needs are met. These efforts will be specifically directed towardFY 1990 and beyond, into the 21st Century. Following a developmental process which has been characterized by continuing dialoguewith advocacy and interest groups in the field of aging including discussions with StateDirectors on Aging, with Area Agency Directors, service providers, the academiccommunity, the Federal Council on Aging and with representatives of the LeadershipCouncil of Aging Organizations the Administration on Aging (AoA) has selected eight areas of major activity in whichgoals have been established for Fiscal Year 1990 and beyond. Older Americans Act. Goals for 1990 and Beyond 1. PubllciPrivate Partnershlops -Increase awareness within both the public and privatesectors of the challenge of the changing demographics, and stimulate the expansionof serviepsqd resources for older persons by promoting public/private sectorpartnerships. 2. Older Persona as l R esource -Promote the recognition of older persons as aresource to themselves, to their community, and to the nation. 3. Strenethenris the Fam'ly and Generational Bondl. -Increase understanding ofthe societal implications of aging, with particular attention to the developmentand implementation of strategies for strengthening the family and theinterdependence of generations. 4. Prevention and Alternatives to InstiutIn l Care -Promote the recognition of theimportance, and the development, of preventive, in-home and community-basedsupportive services as vital components of the continuum of care. 5. Promotion and Enhancement of Effective Community Based Service Systems -Promote and support the continued strengthening of comprehensive and coordinatedcommunity service systems to insure that such services are available, accessible, andacceptable to older persons. 6. Targettine -Strateaic Resour Allocation -Develop and implement new strategiesfor more effectively targetting resources and programs on the needs of the mostvulnerable older persons, with special emphasis on low-income minority elderly. 7. Manpower Develonment -Increase awareness of, and promote action to relieve,the critical manpower needs in the field of aging, with particular attention to theneed for an adequate supply of trained personnel to care for older persons athome, in the community and in nursing homes.120 8. Preparins for the 21st Century -Challenges and Ommwrtunlties of an Asint Society -Promote public information and technical assistance to targetted groups for better decisions which need to be made now to insure that public, voluntary and private sector organizations are responsive to the resources and needs presented by the increasing numbers of older persona during the first decades of the 21st century. Conclusion The Administration on Aging recognizes that, even beyond the many specific actions which are required to achieve the eight goals outlined above, more needs to be done in the areas of policy decisions and program activities to assure the well-being of the nation's older persons during the last decade of this century and the initial decades of the next century. Nevertheless, we believe that the agenda which these eight goals establish comprises a realistic projection of what, working together, the Administration on Aging and the field of aging can begin to accomplish, given the resources which will be available as the decade of the 1\u00b090's begins. Our overall mission remains what it has be,,R4 along -to make life better for the millions of older persons whom we serve. We-are committed and dedicated to making a difference on behalf of older persons.

The basic idea of thecash benefits program is that, while they are working, employees and their employ-ers pay earmarked Social Security taxes; the self-employed also are taxed on theirnet earnings. Then, when earnings stop, or are reduced because of retirement in old-age, death, or disability, cash benefits are paid to partially replace the earnings thatwere lost. Traditionally, current taxes have largely been paid out in current bene-fits. Social Security taxes are deposited to the Social Security trust funds and areused only to pay Social Security benefits and administrative expenses of the pro-gram. Amounts not currently needed for these purposes are invested in interestbearing obligations of the United States. Thus current workers help to pay currentbenefits and, at the same time, build rights to future benefits.SSA also administers the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for needyaged, blind, and disabled people (title XVI of the Social Security Act). SSI provides afederally financed floor of income for eligible individuals with limited income and resources. SSI benefits are financed from general revenues. In about 60 percent of the cases, SSI is reduced due to individuals having countable income from othersources, including Social Security benefits. SSA shares responsibility for the black lung program with the Department ofLabor. SSA is responsible, under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, forpayment of black lung benefits to coal miners and their families who applied forthose benefits prior to July 1973, and for payment of black lung benefits to certainsurvivors of miners. Local Social Security offices process applications for entitlement to the MedicareProgram and assist individuals in filing claims for Medicare benefits. Overall Feder-al administrative responsibility for the Medicare Program rests with the HealthCare Financing Administration, HHS.Following is a summary of beneficiary data, selected administrative activities, pre-cedential court decisions, and Social Security-related legislation enacted in fiscalyear 1989. I. OASDI BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIEs At the beginning of 1989, about 95 percent of all jobs were covered under theSocial Security program. It is expected that, under the present law, 96 percent of the jobs will be covered by the end of the century.At the end of September 1989, 39 million people were receiving monthly SocialSecurity cash benefits, compared to 38.5 million in September 1988. Of these benefi-ciaries, 24.2 million were retired workers, 3.5 million were dependents of retiredworkers, 4.1 million were disabled workers and their dependents, 7.1 million weresurvivors of deceased workers and about 11,000 were persons receiving special bene-fits for uninsured individuals who reached age 72 some years ago (\"Prouty pay-ments\").'I The monthly amount of benefits paid for September 1989 was $19 billion, com- pared to $17.9 billion for September 1988. Of this amount, $14.1 billion was paid toretired workers and their dependents, $1.7 billion was paid to disabled workers and their dependents, $3.3 billion ws paid to survivors, and $1.7 million was paid to un-insured persons who reached age 72 in the past. IRetired workers received an average benefit for September 1989 of $540 (up from$516 in September 1988), and disabled workers received an average benefit of $530.Retired workers newly awarded Social Security benefits for September 1989 aver-aged $510, while disabled workers received an average initial benefit of $541.During the 12 months ending September 1989, $227 billion in Social Security cash benefits were paid, compared to $214 billion for the same period last year. Of thattotal, retired workers and their dependents received $157.7 billion, disabled workersand their dependents received $22.5 billion, survivors received $46.7 billion, and un-insured beneficiaries over age 72 received $23 million. I ' The cost of these special benefits for aged uninsured persons are financed from general reve- nues, not from the Social Security trust funds.270 Monthly Social Security benefits were increased by 4 percent for December 1988 (payable beginning January 1989) to reflect a corresponding increase in the Con- sumer Price Index (CPI). Monthly Social Security benefits were increased by 4.7 per- cent for December 1989 (payable beginning January 1990) to reflect a corresponding increase in the CPI. II. SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES In January 1989, SSI payment levels (like Social Security benefit amounts) were automatically adjusted to reflect a 4 percent increase in the CPI. From January through December 1989, the maximum monthly Federal SSI payment level for an individual was $368. The maximum monthly benefit for a married couple, both of whom were eligible for SSI, was $553. In January 1990, these monthly rates were increased to $386 for an individual and $579 for a couple to reflect a 4.7 percent increase in the CPI. As of June 1989, 4.5 million aged, blind, or disabled people received Federal SSI or federally administered State supplementary payments. Of the 4.5 million recipients on the rolls during June 1989, about 2 million were aged 65 or older. Of the recipi- ents aged 65 or older, about 557,000 were eligible to receive benefits based on blind- ness or disability. About 2.5 million recipients were blind or disabled and under age 65. During June 1989, Federal SSI benefits and federally administered State supple- mentary payments totaling a little over $1.2 billion were paid. For fiscal year 1989, $14.3 billion in benefits (consisting of $11.4 billion in Federal funds and $2.9 billion in federally administered State supplementary payments) were paid. Ill. BLACK LUNG BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES Although responsibility for new black lung miner claims shifted to the Depart- ment of Labor (DOL) in July 1973; SSA continues to pay black lung benefits to a significant, but gradually declining, number of miners and survivors. (While DOL administers new claims under part C of the Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health Act, SSA is still responsible for administering part B of the Act.): During September 1989, about 229,000 individuals (165,000 age 65 or older) re- ceived $73 million in black lung benefits which were administered by the Social Se- curity Administration. These benefits are financed from general revenues. Of these individuals, 52,000 miners received $19 million, 124,000 widows received $45 million, and 53,000 dependents and survivors received $9 million. During fiscal year 1989 SSA administered black lung payments in the amount of $889 million; about 48,000 miners and 117,000 widows and wives were age 65 or older. Black lung benefits increased by 4.1 percent effective January 1989 due to an automatic general benefit increase adjustment under the law. The monthly payment to a coal miner disabled by black lung disease increased from $344.80 to $358.90. The monthly benefit for a miner or widow with one dependent increased from $517.20 to $538.40 and with two dependents from $603.40 to $628.10. The maximum monthly benefit payable when there are three or more dependents increased from $689.50 to $717.80. IV. COMMUNICATION AND SERVICES Information Activities Throughout 1989, the Social Security Administration's public information activi- ties emphasized educating the public about how the program works and the value of the Social Security program to Americans of all ages. Special emphasis was also given to promoting the services available from SSA, and efforts were made to counter misleading advertising. Public information messages and materials targeted to workers and beneficiaries were designed to assure them that the program is fi- nancially sound. SSA also continued efforts to inform the public about the services offered by the agency., One of these services is the \"Personal Earnings and Benefits Estimate Statement\" (PEBES), which is designed to help today's workers plan their financial futures. By completing a simple PEBES request from, today's workers can get an estimate of their future Social Security retirement benefits, along with an estimate of their disability and survivors benefits. As an added convenience to the public, the PEBES forms are also available from the Consumer Information Center in Pueblo, Colorado. Some PEBES forms were distributed by the Internal Revenue Service with supplemental tax packages requested by taxpayers.271 Additional services available free of charge from SSA were also publicized. These include options such as having benefit checks deposited directly into a bank ac- c .The expanded availability of Social Security s toll-free telephone number (1- salso emphasized. SSA also publicized the fact that the public now has the option of making an appointment for service. Appointments help cut down on the amount of time an individual must wait for assistance and help field offices balance workloads. Working through field offices, SSA issued media materials to alert the public about a law that requires a Social Security number for children age 2 and older who are listed as dependents on tax returns. Also, through posters, brochures, and othermaterials, SSA communicated the Enumeration at Birth service, with the theme, \"What else does baby need?\" This service allows parents to request a Social Securi-ty number for their newborn baby while still in the hospital. SSA continued its monthly newsletter, \"Information Items,\" which is now sent to more than 5,000 groups and organizations, all SSA field offices, and many congres- sional offices. A Spanish version of \"Information Items\" is produced quarterly andsent to nearly 300 outside groups and organizations. In addition, SSA conducted its usual public information activities to support field administration of its programs. About 50 million English and Spanish copies of pub- lications explaining Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicare were produced in 1989. SSA also produced public service announcements for radio and television, exhibits, and a variety of other information materials for field office use in explaining the Social Security programs to older workers and the public ingeneral. SSI Outreach In 1989, SSA continued efforts to reach people who would be eligible for SSI if they would apply for it. SSA also explored new ways to reach potential SSI recipi-ents. In June 1989, SSA convened an outreach symposium which was attended by rep- resentatives of about 50 groups and organizations that provide services to people 65and over and to adults and children who have disabilities. Gwendolyn S. King, Com- missioner of Social Security, indentified SSI outreach as one of her key priorities immediately upon taking office. She established a task force, which developed an extensive \"action plan\" of both short- and long-range activities designed to increaseparticipation in the SSI program, by: -providing information about and promoting understanding of the SSI program; -reaching out to individuals who are aware of the program but are reluctant toapply and working toward a more positive public perception of the program; and -making the process of applying for SSI benefits easier. SSA also continued to provide public information materials, as well as other sup- port, to organizations which have contact with potential SSI eligibles. For example, following a successful outreach demonstration in El Paso, Oklahoma City and Pitts- burgh in 1988, the American Association of Retired Persons expanded its outreachproject to 10 cities in 1989. SSA co-sponsored one of the demonstration sites, and cooperated with the other projects. SSA provided training and public information materials to local outreach workers as well as the application and award dataneeded to evaluate the demonstrations. Also, SSA has continued its coverage of the SSI program in the monthly newslet-ter, \"Information Items.\" As a part of its larger outreach strategy, SSA began development of new efforts to serve all potential populations, including disabled and blind children, including test-ing methods to reach them-e.g., targeted mailings. v. PRECEDENT-SErrING COURT DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE ELDERLY MADE DURING FISCAL YEAR 1989 Sullivan v. Everhart, et al.-Netting \"Overpayments and Underpayments\" On November 27, 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in this case. In Everhart the Secretary is defending the policy of determining OASDI and SSI recipients' retroactive payment amounts by netting, or crediting, any \"under-payments\" due for a retroactive period against any \"overpayments\" that were madeduring the same period. The Secretary sought Supreme Court review of the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, by which the Court of Appeals affirmed the Everhart district court's ruling that netting violates the Social Security272 Act's waiver of recovery of overpayment provisions. The Tenth Circuit issued its de- cision in October 1988. VI. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATION ENACTED DURING FISCAL YEAR 1989 THAT AFFECTS SSA Public Law 101-41,(HR. 932), Puyallu Tribe of Indians Settlement Act of 1989, Signed June 21, 1989 Provides for various benefits for the Puyallup tribe as a whole and a one-time payment. Further provides that nothing in the settlement agreement shall affect the eligibility of the tribe or any of its members for any Federal benefits. Public Law 101-56 (H.R. 2848), Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act Amendments of 1989, Signed July 19, 1989 This Act amends P.L. 100-53 (Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988) to delay its effective date until January 1, 1990, for matching programs in op- eration prior to June 1, 1989. Additionally, it required a report by each agency, before August 1, 1989, to the appropriate congressional committees and the Office of Management and Budget which identified the matching programs subject to the de- layed effective date and provided a schedule for expected compliance with the re- quirements of P.L. 100-503. Public Law 101-136 (H.R. 2989), Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1990, Signed November 3, 1989 This Act contains a Social Security-related provision, effective October 1, 1990, and thereafter, that requires the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service to be fully and directly reimbursed from the Social Security Trust Funds for the costs incurred in the issuance of Social Security benefit payments. Currently, the Social Security Trust Funds reimburse the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury for these costs. Public Law 101-166 (H.R. 3566), Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990, Signed November 21, 1989 Appropriates $5.275 million for FY 1990 for SSA research and demonstration ac- tivity. The conference report states that $3.5 million of the research and demonstra- tion appropriation is to be used for new SSI outreach activities aimed at potential elderly recipients of SSI benefits. The conferees instruct SSA to carry out this SSI outreach effort in cooperation with organizations such as the existing network of area agencies on aging and the Administration on Aging. Both the House and Senate Committees, in their reports accompanying the FY 1990 appropriations bills, urged that the Social Security Administration be more aware of chronic fatigue syndrome in handling disability claims and that SSA take into account in its quidelines the clinical definition of chronic fatigue syndrome that the Centers for Disease Control has developed. While committee report language does not have the effect of law, it does reflect a strong congressional concern in this area. Public Law 101-201 (S. 892), Agent Orange Settlement Payment Exclusion, Signed December 6, 1989 Excludes payments from the Agent Orange product liability settlement from income and resources in determining eligibility for the amount of benefits under any Federal or federally assisted program. (This provision differs in wording from the provision in Public Law 101-239, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, on Agent Orange in that it refers generally to Federal and federally assisted programs rather than listing specified programs.) Public Law 101-219 (H.J. Res. 175), Palau Compact of Free Association Implementation Act, Signed December 12, 1989 Provides Palau with self-governing authority in all matters other than those af- fecting military security if the compact is approved by at least 75 percent of the Palauan voters. The compact does not extend any Federal or federally assisted means-tested programs to Palau. However, it does provide that services and pro- grams of the United States could be extended to Palau in the future under agree- ment between the governments of Palau and the United States.273 Also provides funding for Puerto Rican political parties for their use in the 1991referendum for Puerto Rican political status-extended commonwealth, statehood,or independence. Public Law 101-284 (H.R. 3607), Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989,Signed December 13, 1989 Repeals many of the provisions of the Medicare Catastrophic Act of 1988 (PublicLaw 100-360) effective January 1, 1990. Among other changes, the legislation elimi-nates the monthly catastrophic coverage premium. Public Law 101-289 (H.R. 3299), Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, SignedDecember 19, 1989 This Act contains the following Social Security-related provisions: A. Social Security Provisions -Eliminate the special dependency tests for child's insurance benefits in the caseof children who are adopted before age 18 by retired or disabled beneficiaries.-Extend for 1 additional year (through 1990) the present temporary provisionthat allows persons who appeal a cessation decision following a continuationdisability review (CDR) to continue to receive benefits through the reconsider-ation and, if applicable, the Administrative Law Judge decision.-Extend, for 3 years, through June 10, 1993, the authority (first enacted in sec-tion 505 of the 1980 disability amendments) to waive compliance with Social Se-curity and Medicare benefit requirements to conduct work incentive demonstra-tion projects.-Authorize the correction of earnings records at any time if an amount of wagesreported by an employer is less than the correct amount.-Provide an exemption from Social Security coverage and taxes for employeeswho are members of religious sect opposed to coverage if the employer is eithera partnership and each partner is also a sect member of a church-controlled or-ganization which elected to be exempt from FICA taxes.-Prohibit termination of coverage of U.S. citizens and residents employed abroadby a foreign affiliate of an American employer.-Eliminate the \"carryover\" reduction in retirement and disability benefits due toreceipt of reduced widow(er)s benefits prior to age 62.-When fully effective (1999), require that annual earnings and benefit state-ments be sent to all contributors. For persons under age 50 a description of ben-efits could be sent, rather than an individualized benefit estimate.-Increase the contribution and benefit base for 1990 to $51,300-2 percent morethan estimated under present law-to take account of the rise in average wagesthat has occurred to certian \"deferred compensation\" (e.g., income tax deferredcontributions to certain retirement plans under 401(k) of the Internal RevenueCode). Although deferred compensation was covered for Social Security pur-poses beginning in 1984, it has not been included in the average wage indexused to adjust various program amounts.Under the proposal, special transitional provisions apply for including deferredcompensation in average wages for computing the contribution and benefit base for1991 and 1992. Afte199992, deferred compensation will be included in calculating theautomatic adjustments of the base and of the various benefit provisions that arekept up to date with average wage levels. -P.L. 101-239 also includes a number of tax-related changes with relativelyminor impact on the Social Security programs. B. Provisions Applicable to Both Social Security and SSI -In making specified determinations of good cause, fault, and good faith forSocial Security purposes, require the Secretary to take into account any physi-cal, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations that the individual has.-Require that notices be available in various forms (e.g., telephone call, certifiedmail) for blind Social Security applicants and beneficiaries (as already providedin the SSI program). Also, require the Secretary to report, by January 1, 1991,on the Social Security Administration's procedures for issuing notices in lan-guages other than English and options for expanding this practice.-Require the Secretary to maintain an up-to-date electronic record, accessible toSSA field offices through the agency's computer system, of the identities oflegal representatives of all Social Security and SSI claimants. In addition, re-274 quire the Secretary to include in benefit denial notices information on options for obtaining attorneys to represent the individual's interests before the agency. -When an individual can demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that he or she failed to file for Social Security benefits as a result of misinformation con- cerning eligibility provided by SSA after December 1982, deem the individual to have applied on the later of (1) the date the incorrect information was provided, or (2) the date the individual met all the requirements for entitlement. The amendment applies with respect to Social Security benefits for months after De- cember 1982. A similar provision applies to the SSI program but is restricted to cases of misinformation provided on or after December 19, 1989 (the date of en- actment) and for benefits for month after December 1989 (the month of enact- ment). -When an individual who visits an office in response to a time-limited notice for action sent by SSA or because his or her Social Security or SSI check was lost, stolen, or not received, require the Secretary to assure that the individual re- ceives a face-to-face interview with an SSA employee before the close of the business day.'

SSI Provisions -Direct SSA to conduct an ongoing program of outreach to children potentially eligible for SSI on the basis of. disability or blindness.. -Permit disabled children who would be ineligible for SSI because of deemed pa- rental income or resources but who receive Medicaid coverage -under 'State home care plans to receive the $30 monthly personal needs allowance that would be payable if the children were institutionalized, without regard to their parents' incomes and resources. -Continue SSI eligibility for children of U.S. Armed Forces' personnel who are U.S. citizens and who- live with their parents who are. on permanent duty as- signments outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and the territories and pos- sessions of the United States:. -Exclude the value of tickets for domestic travel from income if the tickets are used and not converted to cash. -Exclude from income and resources for SSI purposes, interest and accruals on the value of agreements to purchase burial spaces that are excluded from re- sources. -A married couple would be treated as separated for SSI purposes beginning with the first month after the month of separation, rather than after the sixth month as under present law. -Bar the Secretary from establishing limits (such as -the regulatory $6,000/6-per- cent rule) on the value of property used in a trade or business or as an employ- ee (including the tools of a tradesperson and the machinery and livestock of a farmer) which is excludable as property essential to self-support. -Exclude payments from a trust fund set up, pursuant to the Agent Orange prod- uct liability settlement, by manufacturers of the chemical defoliant used by the U.S. military in Vietnam from income and resources, for SSI, AFDC, Medicaid, and other specified Federal and federally' assisted means-tested programs. D. Provisions Related to SSA Programs -Provide the option to purchase Medicare coverage during specified enrollment periods to individuals under age 65 who are no longer entitled to Social Security disability benefits and Medicare coverage because their earnings exceeded the substantial gainful activity level, but who continue to be disabled. The amount of the monthly premium will be the same as the premiums charged for Medi- care's hospital insurance benefits for uninsured individuals. The provision is ef- fective upon enactment, but provides for coverage under the hospital insurance program only for months after June 1990. -Require the State Medicaid programs to pay, on a sliding scale, the Medicare Part A premiums for disabled individuals (1) who are eligible to purchase Medi- care protection under the above provisions, (2) whose income, as determined under the SSI program, does not exceed 200 percent of the official poverty line, and (3) whose resources, as determined under the SSI rules, do not exceed twice the SSI resource limits.275 OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL INTRODUCIION The mission of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) is to prevent and detectfraud, waste and abuse in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)programs and to promote efficiency and economy in its operations. It is the Inspec-tor General's responsibility to report to the Secretary and the Congress any deficien-Qles or problems relating to IHS programs and to recommend corrective action,where appropriate. As a result of a Congressional oversight initiative into disclosures of fraud andwaste in Federal/State Medicaid and welfare programs, Public Law 94-505 waspassed, creating the statutory Inspector General in HHS. Enacted in 1976, the lawplaced equal emphasis on the Inspector General's obligation to detect wrong doingand to make recommendations for changes and improvements in HHS programs.The OIG works in a coordinated, cooperative way with other departmental compo-nents to accomplish its mission, except when the Inspector General believes thatsuch a relationship would compromise the integrity and independence of the office.Close working relationships are established with the Social Security Administration(SSA), the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the Office of Human De-velopment Services (HDS) and the Public Health Service (PHS) and other entitieswith other major Federal agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ) and theGovernment Accounting Office (GAO) to maximize resources devoted to commonproblems. Government wide problems are addressed with other government agen-cies through the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE).The OIG is divided into three components: the Office of Audit, the Office of Inves-tigations, and the Office of Analysis and Inspections. The Office of Audit (OA) isresponsible for conducting audit services for HHS and overseeing audit work doneby others. The Office of Audit also examines the performance of HHS programsand/or its grantees and contractors in carrying out their respective responsibilities.The Office of Investigations (01) reviews and investigates all allegations of a po-tentially criminal, civil or administrative nature, involving HHS programs or bene-ficiaries. In addition, 01 is responsible for imposing administrative sanctions, includ-ing civil monetary penalties on health care providers participating in the Medicareand Medicaid programs. Further, 01 monitors the State Medicaid Fraud ControlUnit program (SMFCU), which are created to improve detection and eliminate fraudin the State run Medicaid programs. The Office of Analysis and Inspections (OAI) conducts evaluation and inspectionsof Department programs and operations. These are usually short-term studies de-signed to focus on issues of current interest to Department officials or Members ofCongress which highlight a program's efficiency or effectiveness. The ImmediateOffice of the Inspector General is responsible for setting OIG policy and direction,handling budgetary and administrative functions, reviewing and developing legisla-tive and regulatory proposals and carrying out public affairs and Congressional liai-son responsibilities. These audit, inspection and investigative activities focus on:-Seeking ways to improve fiscal controls in benefit payment processes;-Seeking ways to enhance trust fund financial management and accounting op-erations;-Identifying more efficient and economical improvements in programs, procure-ment and service delivery, including reviews of the appropriateness of Federalpayments of services provided and for the quality of care received; and-Reducing the incidence of fraud, waste, and abuse in the Department's pro-grams and to the Department's beneficiaries. ACrVIrrIS Over the past 5 years the OIG has obtained over $26.9 billion in settlements,fines, restitutions, receivables and savings from its activities and implementation ofits recommendations. In FY 1989, alone, these types of savings exceeded $5.6 billion.In addition, a total of 1,278 individuals and entities were convicted for engaging incrimes against HHS programs or beneficiaries and 846 health care providers andsuppliers or their employees were administratively sanctioned.In addition to our audit and investigative work, the 01G, reviewed 95 Departmen-tal draft regulations, commented on 194 legislative proposals and testified on 14 oc-casions before Congressional committees.The following are examples of OIG reviews conducted in FY 1989 that have sub-stantial impact upon the elderly:276 -Health Care.-Financed by the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, FY 1989 expenditures for Medicare Part A are estimated to be in excess of $58 billion to provide health care coverage for an estimated 32.6 million individuals in FY 1989, Part A (hospital insurance) provides, through direct payment for specific use, hospital insurance protection for covered services to persons 65 or older and to certain disabled persons. Medicare Part B (supplementary medical insurance provides, through direct payments for specific use, insurance protection against most of the costs of health care to persons 65 and older and certain disabled persons who elect this coverage. The services covered are medically necessary physician services, out- patient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology services, and certain other medical and health services. Financed by participants and general revenues, FY 1989 expenditures for Part B are expected to exceed $37 billion. The financial impact of the prospective payment system on hospitals, the in- creases in Part B expenditures the development and implementation of cata- strophic health care policy, and the cost implications of changes in health care technology are and will continue to be of particular interest to the OIG. Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act.-Although repealed in November, 1989 the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA) represented the most sweeping change in Medicare. since 1965. Under the MCCA, HHS was responsi- ble for establishing a Medicare Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program to iden- -tify inappropriate prescribing, dispensing and use of drugs. The OIG undertook a study which examined approaches for developing a high quality DUR system. We found a widespread problem of mismedication among the older adult popu- lation due to a series of systemic weaknesses in drug prescribing and prescrip- tion filling practices. In proportion to the general population, the elderly have a significantly higher ratio of illness and death due- to adverse drug reactions then the nonelderly. Our report urged HCFA to plan for the phasing in of a comprehensive DUR program. Further, we recommended that HCFA and PHS develop DUR criteria that would serve as a national standard as well as make specific recommenda- tions regarding the expansion of pharmacology and geriatrics curriculum in the U.S. medical schools. Finally, we recommend that the FDA expedite publication of final regulations governing approval of drugs to be marketed for the elderly. Although MCCA was repealed our study findings and recommendations are serving a catalyst for improvements in drug prescribing and prescription freez- ing practices as they relate to the elderly. 6 Physician Financial Arrangements.-New trends in the way health care is de- livered have created a market and impetus for investment in for-profit health care. As physicians have become investors or financial partners in health care entities for which they also generate business through referrals, public exami- nation of the potential conflicts of such arrangements has increased. In 1988, Congress directed the OIG to report on physician ownership and com- pensation. The OIG found that many physicians have financial relationships with health care businesses to which they refer patients and that many health care entities are owned by referring physicians. In particular, OIG also found that patients of physicians laboratory owners received significantly more serv- ices than all Medicare patients in general. The increased utilization of clinical laboratory services alone by patients of physician-owners cost the Medicare pro- gram $28 million nationally in 1987. The OIG recommended that HCFA pursue the necessary legislative and regu- latory changes to require entities billing Medicare to disclose the names of these physician-owners and investors to the program, and to require claims sub- mitted by these entities to contain the name and provider number of the refer- ring physician. The HFCA concurred with-this recommendation and has taken administrative action to require -that claims contain the name and provider number of the ordering or. referring physician. Further, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989 provides that referrals to clinical laborato- ries with which a referring physician has a financial relationship will be prohib- ited, effective January 1, 1992. Ophthalmology/Optometry Relationships.-At the HFCA's request, the OIG conducted a study to determine the extent to which ophthalmologists delegate post operative care to optometrists and the incidence of optometrists being re- imbursed for post operative care already billed by the opthalmologist as part of a global fee.277 The OIG found that a number of a post-operative days encompassed by theglobal fee varies by carrier, as does the percentage of the global fee allocated tosurgery versus post-operative case. As a result, in some cases Medicare ismaking additional payments for post-operative care which would be included inthe global fee by other carriers. The report also noted that opthalmologists whorefer cataract surgery patients to optometrists for post-operative care receive ahigher percentage of their surgical referrals from optometrists than do thosewho do all post-operative care themselves.The OIG recommended that HCFA develop national guidelines covering thenumber of post-operative days, which may be included in a global fee and thepercentage allocation of a global fee to surgery and post-operative case. TheHCFA plans to address the issue of carrier variances in the structure and pay-ment of global packages. Sanction Support.-In recent years the Congress has vastly expanded theOIG's enforcement responsibilities. Recent authorities tend to be substantiallymore complicated and pertain to more sensitive issues, such as quality of care,which require highly specialized human resources.Enactment of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program ProtectionAct (Public Law 100-93) incorporated a wide range of authorities to exclude in-dividuals and entities from the Medicare, Medicaid, Maternal and Child Healthand Block Grants to States for Social Services programs. Exclusions can now bemade for conviction of fraud against a private health insurer, obstruction of aninvestigation and controlled substances abuse, as well as for revocation or sur-render of a health care license as a result of convictions. These authorities arein addition to the mandatory exclusion authorities for those convicted of pro-gram-related crimes or patient abuse.During FY 1989 the OIG successfully imposed 846 sanctions, in the form ofexclusions or monetary penalties, or individuals and entities for engaging infraud or abuse of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and/or their benefici-aries. Seat Lift Chairs.-For some time, the rapidly increasing number of Medicareclaims for Seat Lift Chairs (SLCs), the aggressive marketing techniques used bysuppliers and the incidence of related fraud, have been a source of concern tothe OIG. Projects investigating fraud in the industry have resulted in recoveriesand savings of more than $25 million over the past three years. One case aloneresulted in recoveries of more than $1.78 million. An OIG inspection and auditraised basic questions about whether SLCs should be covered by Medicare at all,and if so, under what circumstances. The OIG recommended that HCFA recon-sider whether SLCs meet the definition of durable medical equipment and takeactions to assure more effective evaluation of current SLC claims. HCFA hasdeveloped a proposed rule which would withdraw Medicare coverage for SLC.Social Security.-Fifty-four years ago, the Social Security Act established anational insurance system that would be financed through payroll taxes onworkers and employers and would pay benefits to workers in their old age. TheNational Retirement, Survivors and Disability Insurance (RSDI) program, popu-larly called Social Security, is the largest of the Social Security Administration(SSA) programs. In FY 1989, SSA will pay almost $227 billion in these benefitsto 38.9 million beneficiaries. The program is financed almost entirely throughpayroll taxes paid by employees, their employers and the self-employed. Bene-fits are distributed to retired and disabled workers, spouses, certain divorcedspouses, children and disabled children of retired and disabled workers. Benefitsare also provided to widows and widowers, certain surviving divorced spouses,children and dependent parents of deceased worker beneficiaries.The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a federally administeredmeans tested assistance program that provides a nationally uniform, federallyfunded floor of income for the aged, blind and disabled. Beginning January1974, SSI replaced State and county run assistance programs for the aged, blindand disabled that were funded by a mix of Federal and State money. Federaliza-tion of assistance for these categories permitted the establishment of uniformeligibility criteria. In FY 1989, SSA will pay SSI benefits totaling $11.4 billion.Value Lost.-An OIG inspection found that SSA will lose more than $470 mil-lion in interest to the trust funds by not having its outstanding debt of $94 mil-lion to invest until debtors become re-entitled to benefits. Moreover, the trustfunds will lose over $1 billion in value during the next 20 years due to the addi-tion of an estimated $625 million in delinquent debts from 1988 through 1997.When an overpayment of Social Security benefits is detected, SSA requestsrepayment or offsets it against any current benefits. If eligibility for monthly278 benefits has ceased, however, and collection efforts prove to be unproductive, SSA terminates recovery action. If the debtor becomes re-entitled to monthly benefits, the overpayment will be recovered from those payments. The OIG study determined that older debtors form a small part of the over- payment rolls, and the majority of younger debtors have the resources to repay their debts, the average of which was under $400. Deceased Beneficiaries.-Benefits may continue to be sent to a deceased bene- ficiary because the person's death goes unreported to SSA or because relatives or friends deliberately conceal it from SSA. Deliberate concealment of death to gain use of such benefits constitutes fraud against SSA programs. Since the suc- cess of OIG's first computer matching project \"Specter\" in the early 1980s, matches of State death records against SSA beneficiary rolls have become a re- quired mechanism for detecting this kind of fraud. These matches result in a continuing investigative workload for OIG. During the last year, the OIG completed a joint project with the U.S. Secret Service in following up on 22 cases in which SSA and other Federal benefits payments to deceased beneficiaries were being converted to illegal use. This endeavor result- ed in 23 convictions and a total of $589,000 court ordered fines and restitutions. OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL AcTivrrmEs OF THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL IN AGING, FY 1989 In FY 1989, the Office of the Surgeon General has continued the activities that were begun by the March 1988 Surgeon General's Workshop on Health Promotion and Aging. We routinely receive and fill requests for the two publications that were generated by the Workshop. Staff members made several presentations at profes- sional and aging meetings and participated in other activities that promote healthy aging in the continuing effort to implement the recommendations that came out of the Workshop. In order to assess the success in implementing the Workshop recommendations, the Office contacted all professional groups, agencies and others who had indicated that they had planned to be involved and provided them with the report of the cur- rent status. This report was also sent to all the Workshop participants. Through the Office of the Surgeon General, the Public Health Service (PHS) con- tinued its work with the Administration on Aging (AoA) under the Memorandum of Understanding. Joint efforts between the PHS and the AoA strengthened the initia- tives of both agencies to encourage health promotion within the elderly population. FAMILY SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION Low. INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is one of six block grant programs administered within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). LIHEAP is administered by the Office of Community Services (OCS) in the Family Support Administration. LIHEAP helps low income households meet the cost of home energy. The program is authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, as amended by the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986. In fiscal year 1989 Congress appropri- ated $1,3832 billion for the program. Congress has appropriated $1.393 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal year 1990. Block grants are made to States, territories, and eligible applicant Indian tribes. Grantees may provide heating assistance, cooling assistance, energy crisis interven- tion and low-cost residential weatherization or other energy-related home repair to eligible households. Grantees can make payments to households with incomes not exceeding the greater of 150 percent of the poverty level, or 60 percent of the State's median income.'l Most households in which one or more persons are receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Supplemental Security Income, Food Stamps, or need-tested veterans' benefits may be regarded as categorically eligible for LIHEAP. Low income elderly households are a major target group for.energy assistance. They spend, on average, a greater portion of their income for -heating costs than other low income households. Grantees are required to target outreach activities to elderly or handicapped households eligible for energy assistance. In their crisis I Beginning with fiscal year 1986, States are prohibited from setting income eligibility levels lower than 110 percent of the poverty level.279 intervention programs, grantees must provide physically infirm individuals themeans to apply for assistance without leaving their homes, or the means to travel tosites where applications are accepted.In fiscal year 1988, about 39 percent of households receiving assistance with heat-ing costs included at least one person age 60 or over, as estimated by the March1988 Current Population Survey. OCS is a member of the National Energy and Aging Consortium, which focuses onhelping older Americans cope with the impact of high energy costs and relatedenergy concerns. No major program and policy changes for the elderly occurred in 1989. No newinitiatives commenced in 1989 or are planned for 1990 that would impact on thestatus of older Americans. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT (csBG) AND THE ELDERLY I. The Community Services Block Grant Act (Subtitle B, P.L. 97-35) authorizes theOffice of Community Services (OCS) in the Department of Health and Human Serv-ices, to make grants to States and Indian tribes or tribal organizations. States andtribes have the authority and the flexibility to make decisions about the kinds oflocal projects to be supported by the State or tribe, using CSBG funds. The purposesof the 9BG program are: \"(A) to provide a range of services and activities having a measurable and po-tentially major impact on causes of poverty in the community or those areas ofthe community where poverty is a particularly acute problem;(B) to provide activities designed to assist low-income participants includingthe elderly poor- (i) to secure and retain meaningful employment;(ii) to attain an adequate education; (iii) to make better use of available income;(iv) to obtain and maintain adequate housing and a suitable living envi-ronment; (v) to obtain emergency assistance through loans or grants to meet imme-diate and urgent individual and family needs, including the need for healthservices, nutritious food, housing, and employment-related assistance;(vi) to remove obstacles and solve problems which block the achievementof self-sufficiency; (vii) to achieve greater participation in the affairs of the community; and(viii) to make more effective use of other programs related to the pur-poses of this subtitle; (C) to provide on an emergency basis for the provision of such supplies andservices, nutritious foodstuffs and related services, as may be necessary to coun-teract conditions of starvation and malnutrition among the poor;(D) to coordinate and establish linkages between governmental and othersocial services programs to assure the effective delivery of such services to lowincome individuals; and (E) to encourage the use of entities in the private sector of the community inefforts to ameliorate poverty in the community;\" (Reference Section 675(cX1) ofP.L. 97-35). It should be noted that although there is a specific reference to \"elderly poor\" in(B) above, there is no requirement that the States or tribes place special emphasison the elderly or set aside funds to be specifically targeted on the elderly. Neitherthe statute nor implementing regulations include a requirement that grant recipi-ents report on the kinds of activities paid for from CSBG funds or the types of indi-gent clients served. Hence, it is not possible for OCS to provide complete informa-tion on the amount of CSBG funds spent on the elderly, or the numbers of elderly,or the numbers of elderly persons served.II. Major Activities or Research Projects Related to Older Citizens in 1989 and1990.-The Office of Community Services made no major changes in program orpolicy related to the CSBG program in 1999. No research projects were conducted in1989. The Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986 (which authorized CSBG) con-tained the following language: \"each such evaluation shall include identifying theimpact that assistance ...has on ... the elderly poor.\"The collection of impact data activity that the Office of Community Services winconduct in fiscal year 1990.m. Funding levels under the CSBG program for States and Indian Tribes or tribalorganizations amounted to $318.63 million in fiscal year 1989. In fiscal year 1990,$323.63 million was appropriated.280 OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR PLANNING AND EVALUATION The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) serve as the principal advisor to the Secretary on policy development and/or management decisions for all population groups served by the Department, including the elderly. The long-range goal of policy research in this office is to provide factual information for use by departmental decisionmakers in the development of new policies and the modification of existing programs. This office is responsible for legislative develop- ment, planning, policy analysis, and research and evaluation oversight. ASPE is involved in a broad range of activities related to aging policies and pro- grams. Specific grants and contracts which include the elderly as'a major focus are listed individually in this report. In addition, there are a number of research, eval- uation and coordination activities which integrate aging concerns with those of other population groups. For example, the elderly are included in studies of health care delivery, poverty, State-Federal relations and public and private social service programs. ASPE also maintains a national clearinghouse which includes aging research and evaluation materials. The ASPE Policy Information Center (PIC) provides a centa- lized source of information on evaluative research relevant to the Department's pro- grams and policies. On-going and compelted HHS evaluations are tracked, compiled and retrieved. In addition, the PIC database includes ASPE policy research, the In- spector General's program inspections and reports from the General Accounting Office, Congressional Budget Office, and Office of Technology Assessment of rel- evance to the Department. Research studies of a short-term evaluative nature con- ducted by the Department were recently added. Copies of final reports of the stuides described in this statement are available upon completion from PIC. During 1989, staff of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Eval- uation undertook or participated in the following analytic and research activities which had a major focus on the elderly: 1. POLICY DEvELOPMENT LONG-TERM CARE AND THE UNINSURED ASPE plays a major role in analyzing long-term care issues which cut across the major divisions of the Department. In 1989 ASPE provided key staff support to the Under Secretary's Task Froce on Access to Care. The Under Secretary has been charged with conducting a thorough review of present policies on long-term care and health care for the uninsured and underinsured, how well these policies are working on behalf of persons and health care for the uninsured and underinsured, how well these policies are working on behalf of persons who need care, and how well they may serve us in the future. The review will evaluate potential participa- tion and costs under a broad range of financing options and is intended to contrib- ute to the development of a set of basic goals for health care reform as well as spe- cific policy proposal. A report is due in October 1990. AGING Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease As a member of the DHHS Council on Alzheimer's Disease, ASPE assisted in preparation of the annual report to the Congress on selected aspects of caring for persons with Alzheimer's disease. The report focused on the Department's current and planned services research initiatives on Alzheimer's Disease. Federal Interagency Forum On Aging-Related Statistics ASPE is a member of the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics (The Forum). The Forum was established to encourage the development, collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on the older population. The Forum seeks to extend the use of limited resources among agencies through joint problems solving, identification of data gaps and improvement of the statistical information bases on the older population that is used to set the priorities of the work of individual agen- cies.281 Departmental Coordinating Group on Aging Data ASPE is the lead agency for the Coordinating Group whose primary responsibilityis to evaluate departmental needs for data on the aging population and to developprocess and policies that will guide the collection of data relevant to the aging popu-lation throughout the decade of the 1990's the data sets of interest are those fundedby DHHS, those that are ongoing or likely to be included in future budgets, andthose that provide information on persons 55 years of age and older. Long-Term Care Microsimulation Model During 1989 ASPE made extensive use of the Long-Term Financing Model devel-oped by ICF, Inc., and the Brookings Institute. The model simulates the utilizationand financing of nursing home and home care services by a nationally representa-tive sample of elderly persons for the period 1986 to 2020. It gives the Departmentthe capacity to simulate the effects of various financing and organizational reformoptions on future public and private expenditures for nursing home and home careservices. Work has now begun on making the model available to the general re-search community. 2. RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS DISABILITY PROFILES AND POLICY ANALYSES Mathematics Policy Research (Contractor) and SysteMetrics/McGraw-Hill, Inc. (Sub-contractor)-Patricia Doyle and Brian Burwell, Principal Investigators Three principal policy issues affecting the disabled will be analyzed: (1) Participa-tion in Federal programs; (2) Federal program interaction; and (3) recipient workeffort. The focus will be on four major HHS programs affecting the disabled-SocialSecurity Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicare,and Medicaid. The primary source of data will be the 1983/84 panel of the Survey ofIncome and Program Participation (SIPP). The SIPP data will be supplemented,when necessary, with information from populations either not included in SIPP (theinstitutionalized) or underrepresented (disabled children).The project will produce a series of reports on policy issues: a general descriptionof the disabled population using differing definitions of disability; a history and de-scription of Federal programs targeted on the disabled; program participation ratesunder varying eligibility scenarios; the effect of interlocking program rules; a com-parison of differences between disabled persons who work and those who do not; ananalysis of several special topics, such as program turnover, disability of children, orthe effect of Medicaid buy-in and cost sharing mandated by the Medicare Cata-strophic Coverage Act of 1988; and a final report synthesizing the findings.Funding: Fiscal year 1988- $335,000; fiscal year 1989-$39,768.End Date: March 1990. AN ANALYSIS OF ASSISTANCE TO THE ELDERLY POOR UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURrrY INCOME PROGRAM Lewin/ICF-David Kennell, Burt Barnow, and John Shiels, Principal InvestigatorsThis project will provide: (1) An empirical description of the population aged 65and older eligible for SSI, and those participating in the program, over a series ofyears dating back to the program's inception and projections of those populations upto 2020; (2) a conceptual model that explains the pattern of participation, along withan analysis of the factors that affect participation; (3) an examination of the interac-tion of USI with other Government programs that serve the elderly to determine thetotal level of income support provided to SSI recipients when other program benefitsare included; and (4) an evaluation of the adequacy of survey and program dataavailable, and recommendations on additional statistics and research needed toevaluate Federal and State policies in the SSI area.Funding: $128,960. End Date: December 1989. THE RETIREMENT EARNINGS TEST AND RETIREMENT INCENTIvES Lewin/ICF-Alan Gustman, Principal Investigator The Social Security Retirement Earnings Test (RET) results in the reduction of aretired individual's benefit by 50 cents for every dollar above $8,400 in 1988. Thisstudy will provide econometric estimates of how the labor supply (hours) and theretirement decision of the individuals aged 65-69 would be affected by changes in282 the RET. The project will also provide: (1) An analysis of the incentives for retire- ment implicit in various pension plans and the effects of these incentives and Social Security provisions on labor supply and the retirement.decision; (2) simulation esti- mates of the aggregate effects of full or partial removal of the earnings test on labor supply and labor market earnings; and (3) estimates of the implicit and explicit taxes on the income of elderly and estimates of the effects of taxation, especially taxation on benefits, on the timing of acceptance of Social Security benefits. Funding $127,290. End Date: December 1989. PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research-James N. Morgan, Greg J. Duncan, and Martha S. Hill, Principal Investigators Through an interagency consortium coordinated by the National Science Founda- tion (NSF contributes approximately $1.5 million per year), ASPE assists in the funding of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). This is an ongoing national- ly representative longitudinal survey that began in 1968 under the auspices of the Of fice of Economic Opportunity. The PSI) has gathered information on family com- position, attitudes, employment, sources of income, housing, mobility, and a host of other subjects every year since then on a sample of approximately 5,000 families and has followed all original sample members that have left home. The current sample size is over 7,000 families. The data files have been disseminated widely and are used by hundreds of researchers both within this country and in numerous for- eign countries to get an accurate picture of changes in the well-being of different demographic groups including the elderly. Funding: ASPE (and HHS precursors)-fiscal year 1967 through fiscal year 1979- $10,559,498; fiscal year 1980-$698,952; fiscal year 1981-$600,000; fiscal year 1982- $200,000; fiscal year 1983-$250,999; fiscal year 1984-$550,000; fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year 1987-$250,000; fiscal year-1988\\ $250,000; fiscal year 1989-$250,000. 1 SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES University of Michigan, Survey Research Center-Richard Curtin, Principal Investi-, gator The Survey of Consumer Finances interviewed a representative sample of U.S. families in the Spring of 1983 gathering a detailed accounting of family assets and liabilities; questioning also covered financial behavior and attitudes, work status, job history, and expected benefits from pensions and Social Security. A supplemental instrument gathered information on the pension entitlement of individuals in the sample. Detailed descriptions of pension plans are being linked to household files. Data from the survey are expected to be widely used for investigation of the dis- tribution of holdings of various assets and liabilities, of net worth, and of entitle- ment to pension and Social Security benefits. In addition, these data will support research on financial behavior of individuals and on the effect of Social Security and pensions on the holdings of other assets. The survey was jointly sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Re- serve System, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Trade Com- mission, and the Department of Labor. The Survey Research Center completed the second wave of the survey. Follow-up telephone interviews with respondents from the first survey were conducted updat- ing basic information from the original wave and adding new areas of questioning. Data from this wave will be available Winter 1988. A third in-person wave will be conducted in 1989 to obtain another household balance sheet for those in the origi- nal sample, supplemented by an additional sample of households. THE EFFECT OF ECONOMIC STATUS ON THE FAMILY; THE EFFECT OF THE FAMILY ON ECONOMIC STATUS Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin-Sheldon Danziger and Eugene Smolensky, Principal Investigators A research agenda of diverse but interrelated 2-year studies concerned with the relationships between poverty and family structure, labor force behavior, and wel- fare dependence.

RESEARCH TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF LONG-TERM FORECASTS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE TRUST FUNDS Unicon Research Corporation-Finis Welch and Kevin Murphy, principal investiga- tors The research consists of two related projects. The first will estimate historical real wage growth using household data for the Current Population Survey for the period 1964 and 1987 and forecast future growth. The goal is to decompose past wage growth into growth in the wages of workers with fixed characteristics and changes in aggregate wage levels generated by changes in the composition of hours worked. The project will also forecast the future distribution of workers across groups (dis- tinguished by sex, race, age, education and labor force status) which will be com- bined with estimated relative wage patterns to forecast the composition component of future wage growth. The second project extends the analysis to evaluate the impact of changes in the relative earnings of husbands and wives on the solvency of the Social Security system. The goal is to provide estimates of the tax contributions and benefit pay- ments of women eligible for both primary and spouse benefits. Although prelimi- nary work indicates that increases in earnings and labor force participation of women will contribute to the solvency of the Social Security trust fund, the magni- tude depends on how the increased earnings are distributed among those already working and previous non-participants. Funding: Fiscal year 1989-$87,600. End Date: June 1990. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, EXPERT JUDGMENT, AND LEVEL OF AGGREGATION IN DEMOGRAPHIC FORECASTS. University of Illinois-Juha M. Alho, principal investigator The primary objective of the research is to show how probabilistic methods can be used to calculate interval forecasts of population. The research will show how ap- proximations to the distribution of future population vectors can be derived, and will analyze how much weight has been given to expert opinion relative to statisti- cal analysis in the past and how it has influenced forecasting accuracy. The project will consider the level of aggregation that has been used in trust fund forecasting to see whether alternative choices would have led to different forecasts in the past. Funding: Fiscal year 1989-$42,000. Due Date: June 1990. SKIL1, AGE, GENDER, AND SOURCE-COUNTRY OF U.S. IMMIGRANTS University of Colorado-Michael J. Greenwood and John M. McDowell Changes in the number and composition of the immigrant population have impor-tant implications for immigrant earnings and thus the Social Security trust fund forecast. The proposed research has two objectives: (1) To specify and test models that relate to the source-country, skill, gender and age of U.S. immigrants, and (2) 26-386 0 -90 -10284 to use the resulting information in the Social Security trust fund forecasts. Themodels are designed so that simulations can be performed to assess the conse-quences of changed economic and/or political circumstances in source countries, aswell as changed U.S. immigration policy.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELDERLY LONG-TERM CARE POPULATION AND ITS SERVICE USE Duke University, Center for Demographic Studies-Ken Manton, Principal Investi- gatorThe project is organized into two phases. In the first year there will be an analy-sis of the 1982-84 National Long-Term Care Survey and the National Long-TermCare Channeling Demonstrating data sets. The focus will be on. functional transi-tions at advanced ages and the impacts of long-term care services on these transi-tions. In the second phase, additional national data bases like the Longitudinal Sup-plemental on Aging will be examined to refine and extend the understanding ofhealth and functional status changes among the impaired elderly as well as trends in service use.Funding: Fiscal year 1987-$56,933. End Date: September 1990. 1988 NATIONAL LONG-TERM CARE SURvEY-ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES Duke University, Center for Demographic Studies-Ken Manton, Principal Investi- gatorUnder a grant from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), Duke University(through the Census Bureau) is conducting the 1988 National Long-Term CareSurvey. Duke will produce a data file consisting of the 1982, 1984 and 1988 surveyslinked to Medicare bill records. An additional grant jointly administered by NIAand the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation will supportthree supplementary activities: (a) A survey of informal caregivers (b) a follow-backsurvey of institutionalized persons and (c) an analysis of the effects of supply factors on respondent use of services. Funding: Fiscal year 1987-$300,000. End Date: September 1990. PREMIUM PRICING OF PROTOTYPE PRIvATE LONGTERM CARE INSURANCE POLICIES Brookings Institute-Joshua Weiner, Principal Investigator This project will make estimates of the benefits, costs and premiums for prototypelong-term care policies. It will examine the sensitivity of insurance premiums to dif-ferent assumptions about age of purchase, amount of coverage, inflation, and groupversus individual policies. Knowing the price of various prototype insurance policieswill enable public policymakers to better assess the potential market for such insur- ance.Funding: Fiscal year 1988-$100,000. End Date: December 1989. THE USE, COST, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN OF NURSING HOME CARE IN 1985 University of North Carolina-William Weissert, Principal Investigator This project will compare the determinants of institutionalization for two time pe-riods, 1977 and 1985, based on the National Nursing Home Surveys and will exam-ine policy, supply and other variables associated with perceived differences. A prod-uct of the project will be a kit that practitioners can use to assess the probable riskof institutionalization of their clients and applicants. Funding: Fiscal year 1988-$47,250. End Date: January 1990. CAREGIVER BURDEN AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION, HOSPITAL USE AND STABILITY OF CARE University of Illinois, Baila Miller, Principal Investigator Using the 1982 and 1984 National Long-Term Care Surveys (including the 1982Informal Caregiver Survey component), the project will focus on the impact of care-giver burden. The study should yield policy relevant information on the relationshipof different types of caregiver burdens to institutionalization. It will help focus theneed for caregiver support services in the community as well as other community- based services.285 Funding: Fiscal year 1988-$58,401. End Date: December 1989. AN ANALYSIS OF SPEND DOWN DYNAMICS IN NURSING HOMES Connecticut Department of Health Services, Center for Health Policy and Communi- ty Relations-Christine Pattee, Principal Investigator This project addresses in detail the issue of Medicaid spend-down, using the Con-necticut Nursing Home Patient Registry, an 8-year longitudinal data file. Eachrecord in the file contains the dates of all patient admissions and discharges, alongwith demographic, diagnostic and functioning level data. By using this file, it will be possible to follow the career of individual patients from first admission to a nursinghome, through subsequent discharges and readmissions, until date of final dis-charge. In addition to focusing on spend down, the study will analyze demograghic, utili-zation and outcome patterns in the patient population and changes in these pat-terns over time. Funding: Fiscal year-$130,154. End Date: February 1990. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A BREAKDOWN IN CAREGIVING AMONG INFORMAL CAREGIVERS TO THE FUNCTIONALLY AND COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED ELDERLY POPULATION Johns Hopkins University-Donna Helm, Principal Investigator This project will examine factors associated with the breakdown of informal care-giving to functionally and cognitively impaired persons. The National Long-Term Care Survey, Informal Caregivers Survey (1982), will be used to develop a profile of caregivers and to examine the differences in caregiver burden experienced by those who provide for the cognitively impaired versus the functionally impaired. Further,the factors contributing to a breakdown in caregiving will be identified and ana- lyzed. Funding: Fiscal year 1988-$50,000. End Date: December 1989. COMMUNITY PROGRAM SIZE AND QUALITY Temple University, Developmental Disabilities Center-James Conroy, Principal In-vestigator This project focuses on the relationship between community residential setting size and quality of care for persons with developmental disabilities. It will develop information that will help state planners understand the advantages and disadvan-tages of residential settings of various bed capacities. The Pennhurst Longitudinaldata base will be analyzed using the size issue as the central problem to be investi- gated. Funding: Fiscal year 1988-$25,324.00. End Date: March 1990. PROSPECTIVE OUTCOMES OF INFORMAL AND FORMAL HOME CARE: TIME TO INSTITUTIONALIZATION OR MORTALITY People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc. (Project Hope), Center for Health Affairs-Gail Wilensky, Principal Investigator This project is designed to determine what combinations of caregivers (e.g., paidand unpaid) are more efficacious in preventing or delaying mortality or institution- alization. The study will examine the outcomes separately for Blacks, Hispanics,and other races. If some caregiving arrangements rather than others result in im- proved outcomes, policymakers will be better able to target resources for home- based care where those more effective arrangements exist or can be created.Funding: Fiscal year 1988-$48,521.00. End Date: May 1990. ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF STATE BOARD AND CARE REGULATIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF CARE IN BOARD AND CARE HOMES Research Triangle Institute-Catherine Hawes, Principal Investigator As the nation's long-term care system evolves, more emphasis is being placed onhome and community-based care as an alternative to institutional care. Community- based living arrangements for dependent populations (disabled elderly, mentally ill,persons with mental retardation/developmental disabilities) play a major role in the286 continuum of long-term care and disability-related services. Prominent among these arrangements are board and care homes. There is a widespread perception in the Congress and elsewhere that too often board and care home residents are the victims of unsafe and unsanitary living con- ditions, abuse and neglect by operators, and fraud. There is also the perception that an increasing number of board and care residents are so disabled that they require a level of care greater than board and care operators are able to provide. This project will analyze the impact of State regulations on the quality of care in board and care homes and document characteristics of board and care facilities, their owners and operators, and collect information on the health status, level of dependency, program participation and service needs of residents. Funding: Fiscal year 1989-$350,000; Fiscal year 1990-$300,000. End Date: September 1991. INCLUSION OF LICENSED BOARD AND CARE HOMES IN THE 1991 NATIONAL HEALTH PROVIDER INVENTORY Lewin-ICF, Inc.-Jade Gong, Principal Investigator Community-based living arrangements for dependent populations (disabled elder- ly, mentally ill and mentally disabled/developmentally disabled) play major role in the continuum of long-term care and disability-related services. For policy development, information is needed on the number and characteristics of board and care homes, the characteristics of their owners/operators and the char- acteristics, service use patterns and costs of their residents. A critical first step is to establish a comprehensive file of these homes. Such a file can provide basic informa- tion and also service as a sampling frame for future surveys of the board and care industry. The purpose of this project is to develop an unduplicated listing of licensed board and care homes in all 50 States and for merging this listing into the National Health Provider Inventory which will be conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in 1991. Funding: Fiscal year 1989-$85,000. End Date: May 1990. POST-ACUTE CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS University of Minnesota-Robert Kane, Principal Investigator The primary objective of this study is to describe the \"natural history\" of care received by patients with five different impairments (identified by DRG) in three post-acute care modalities. These modalities include home health care, skilled nurs- ing care, and rehabilitation. This study will not only provide a history of what care was delivered in which settings, but will also assess and compare outcomes and costs of care across settings and impairments. In addition, the study will determine the factors that influence hospital discharge decision making This study's findings may then be used to construct a revised payment method for post-acute care in the Medi- care program. Two sets of data will be collected. The first set will contain information from hos- pital discharge records and pre and post discharge client interviews in three U.S. cities. The second set will include a 20 percent national sample of Medicare acute care discharges to be linked with the utilization files of Medicare covered services provided in post-acute care settings. Data collection has been completed, and the analysis phase is currently udnerway. Funding: Fiscal year 1987-$500,000; Fiscal year 1988-$727,000; Fiscal year 1989-$695,335. End Date: September 1990. ANALYSIS OF LINKED CARRIER AND INTERMEDIARY DATA BASES The Circle, Inc.-Peter McMiniman, Principle Investigator The purpose of this contract is to modify an on-going contract initiated in 1987 which is developing linked A-B Medicare data in six States for the period 1983-85. The modification will add linked 1986-88 A-B data in the same States to the previ- ously developed data base. Funding: Fiscal year 1989-$50,000. End Date: December 1989.287 EXPANSION OF ON-GOING ANALYSIS OF PHYSICIAN VOLUME ISSUES Center For Health Economics Research-Janet Mitchell, Principle Investigator A ten State data base of claims for 1985 through 1988 is currently being analyzed by HCFA to explore the growth in volume and intensity in Medicare Part B duringthe period and to examine selected other issues in physician payment (e.g., geo- graphic variation). This project will provide the additional resources necessary toexpand and strengthen the basic analysis by adding to it a second set of data for sixadditional States, including the State of Pennsylvania. Because Pennsylvania is thelargest and most urbanized State in the whole set, its inclusion will serve to sub-stantially strengthen the data's utility. Funding: Fiscal year 1989-$250,000. End Date: February 1990. REPLICATION OF THE 1982 STUDY OF RESOURCE COSTS IN 25 HOSPITALS Center for Health Policy Studies-Henry Miller In 1982, ASPE conducted a study of the resource cost required to deliver clinicand emergency room services to Medicare patients in 25 large urban hospital out-patient departments. The resources required to produce such services were found tobe greater than claimed by the hospitals on their Medicare cost reports. After theimplementation of PPS, hospitals had an incentive to shift costs to the outpatientside. Replicating the 1982 study (initiated with 1988 funds) will allow examination ofthe degree to which hospitals have acted on this incentive. In addition, the replica-tive study is being expanded to examine the resources required to deliver ambulato-ry surgical services and to compare these with the resource costs required to deliversimilar services through ambulatory surgical centers in the same cities. Funding: Fiscal year 1988-$270,000; Fiscal year 1989-$50,000. End Date: February 1990. EVALUATION OF AN APPROACH TO MAINTAINING THE MEDICAL CURRENCY OF RURAL PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS Texas Tech-A. Bryan Spives, MD OBRA 1987 required the Department to explore and to test the feasibility of \"re-quiring instructions and oversight of rural physicians ...through use of video com-munications between rural hospitals and teaching hospitals to maintain and im-prove the quality of delivered medical care, with special emphasis on Medicarebeneficiaries.\" This activity is to be supported jointly by HCFA and PHS, withASPE responsible for support of necessary evaluation activities. This project willsupport the evaluation component. A two-part, three year effort, totalling $350 thousand in evaluation, is envisioned.The first component, internal evaluation, will be supported through partial fundingof the OBRA 1987-required project(s). The second component, external evaluation,will be supported through consortium funding by PHS, HCFA, and ASPE of an in-dependent evaluation contract. Funding: Fiscal year 1988-$150,000; fiscal year 1989-$100,000; fiscal year 1990- $50,000. End Date: September 1990. MEDICARE OUTPATIENT DRUG BENEFIT: AN EVALUATION OF THE POSSIsILITY OF COVERING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS USED FOR TREATMENT James Bell Associates, James Bell, Project Manager The purpose of this study is to develop information for a report to Congress asmandated by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-60). TheCongressional report will evaluate the possibility of covering certain nonapproveddrugs and biological products under the outpatient portion of the Medicare pro-gram. The report will inform policy debate by providing: definitions of terms; analy-sis of past and current policy issues in investigational drug research, approval ofadministration and coverage, and a presentation and analysis of policy options. Inaddition, the report will identify a set of baseline data and the conceptual frame-work needed to evaluate such a benefit. Funding: Fiscal year 1989-$135,000. End Date: January 1990.288 PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE: CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL In 1989, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) initiated activities benefiting older Americans in several areas and continued ongoing activities in numerous other areas affecting the elderly as part of our efforts to prevent disease, disability and premature death and improve the quality of life. CDC also conducted research in- volving unsafe unhealthy worksite exposures, many of which cause chronic diseases or conditions in older Americans. CENTER FOR CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION The Combined Health Information Database (CHID)-a Public Health Service in- formation resource-added three new subfiles during FY 1989 that pertain to aging. These subfiles include health promotion and education information on eye diseases and disorders, blood donation and transfusion, and Alzheimer's disease. CHID also contains health information on arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases, diabetes, cho- lesterol, high blood pressure, digestive diseases, injury prevention, and kidney and urologic diseases. Because of the nature of the subject areas, CHID is a valuable re- source for health providers working with the elderly. CHID can be accessed through most library and information services. Persons who wish to access the database di- rectly can obtain a password from MAXWELL Online, BRS Division, Latham, NY, 1-800-345-4BRS. The Planned Approach to Community Health (PATCH) program continues to pro- vide technical assistance to State and local health agencies. The program provides an epidemiologic framework for diagnosis community needs and implementing tar- geted interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from the leading causes of death and disability. The program provides for the targeting of specific risk factors and developing interventions that are specific. At the present time, 21 communities are conducting interventions that could impact older Americans. These interven- tions varied from walking programs in Gage County, Nebraska, to cholesterol screening and education projects in Doddridge County, West Virginia. Through the Association of Schools of Public Health, CDC and Yale University conducted a pilot study entitled \"Modifiable Behavioral Determinants of Physical Activity in Healthy Elderly Persons.\" This is the first study to attempt to examine factors predictive of regular physical activity participation in healthy older persons. Products have included the development and validation of a current and lifetime physical activity survey for use exclusively among an older Population-the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS). Sections of the YPAS have already been employed in the Yale Health and Aging Project, in order to seek associations between physical activity and selected health outcomes in the older audit and to explore the modifi- able behavioral determinants of physical activity in the older adult. The results of this study will aid the development of appropriate exercise interventions for the am- bulatory elderly. CDC has collaborated with the National Institute of Public Health and Environ- mental Protection of the Netherlands on the statistical analysis on the association of physical activity with coronary heart disease risk factors in elderly men, using data from the Zutphen cohort of the Seven Countries Study (SCS). Additional analy- ses will study the association of physical activity with health status and nutritional practices. Follow-up of that cohort in 1990 will focus on the association of physical activity with physical function and morbid and mortal endpoints, 5-year activity trends, and comparisons with other cohorts of the SCS. A variety of programs that address the health problems of elderly Americans are being conducted by the CDC-funded Prevention Center in the School of Public Health at the University of Washington. The University of Washington Prevention Center is focusing on the health of older Americans and has as its theme \"Keeping Older People Healthy.\" One of its major projects is a health promotion pro- gram for the elderly designed to reduce their need for health care and their days of restricted activity. The project's goals are to increase physical activity, reduce exces- sive use of prescription drugs and alcohol, and detect and correct visual and hearing deficits. Another goal of this center is to reduce incidences of disabling falls and hip fractures by 25 percent in the elderly. Through case study, this center has learned that loss of cognitive functions (dementia) may play an important, previously unrec- ognized role. Due to the concern for the health of older adults, the Washington Pre- vention Center has also researched the effects of smoking cessation in people older than 55 years of age. The results of this study, published in The New England Jour- nal of Medicine in November 1988, documents the benefits of smoking cessation in later years and shows that this dramatically reduces the risk of heart attack or death.289 A large trial was recently funded to target the prevention of falls and other inju-ries in the elderly. Issues related to the behavorial and environmental determinantsof falls in the elderly have been studied with appropriate interventions being imple-mented. CDC consulted with the State of Georgia in developing and conducting trainingworkshops for recreation department personnel on exercise and physical activitypromotion for the elderly. CDC participated in the Surgeon General's Workshop on Health Promotion andAging and has written and published a summary of the proceedings for the Morbidi-ty and Mortality Weekly Report. Although the incidence of cervical cancer has declined, 6,000 deaths due to thisdisease occur each year, many of which could be prevented. Data from the NationalHealth Interview Survey of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in 1985 indi-cate that 73 percent of women had had a Pap smear in the previous 3 years. Howev-er, only 50 percent of women over 65 years of age had a Pap smear in the previous 3years; 15 percent of women over 65 years of age had never had Pap smears. CDChas cooperative agreements with Kentucky, Illinois, and Georgia to identify barriers to Pap smear screening and to reduce the mortality due to cervical cancer. Interven-tions designated by these cooperative agreements will be targeted to older women toimprove the proportion who receive regular Pap smear screening. CDC has a cooper-ative agreement with Oklahoma and with the Navajo Indian Health Service Area toimprove a Pap smear surveillance system to design interventions based on a reviewof cervical cancer deaths. Breast cancer is the major cause of cancer deaths in women and has been increas-ing one percent per year from 1975 to 1984. Incidence of breast cancer begins to riseat age 30 and rises dramatically with age, reaching the highest rates in women over 65 years of age. The current American Cancer Society recommendation for early de-tection of breast cancer is a baseline mammogram for women 35-39 years of age,screening mammograms every 1-2 years for women 40-49, and screening mammo-grams annually for women 50 and older. The American Cancer Society conducted asurvey in 1983 that demonstrated only 41 percent of women 60 years of age and older have ever had a mammagram; only 15 percent of women have them annually. CDC has a cooperative agreement with (1) Rhode Island to evaluate their breastcancer screening program, which promotes low-cost screening mammograms for women over 40 years of age, (2) Maine to develop a comprehensive screening pro-gram that includes quality assurance and education for women and medical careproviders, and (3) Colorado to develop a computerized system to ensure women's re-ceiving regular screening mammograms and prompt diagnosis and treatment afterabnormal mammograms. These programs will target older women who have thehighest incidence and mortality from breast cancer. Musculoskeletal diseases are the most prevalent chronic diseases, affecting ap-proximately 37 million persons in the United States. From the first National Healthand Nutrition Examination Survey, 40 percent of persons 65 years and older havesymptomatic musculoskeletal diseases and 60 percent have clinical evidence of dis- ease. CDC has a variety of projects in this area. Medicare hospitalization data wereused to describe an unexpected north-to-south gradient in hip fracture hospitaliza-tion rates. An investigation of connective tissue diseases in south Georgia yieldedpreliminary evidence of an association with hair dyes. A 5-year follow-up study ofserum predictors for early onset postmenopausal osteoporosis has been started in 300 perimenopausal women. Swedish data have been analyzed to describe trends inhip fracture hospitalization rates from 1965-83 and to determine hip fracture ratesas a measure of osteoporosis in women with breast cancer (Estrogen-dependent can-cers may reduce osteoporosis.) Chronic neurological diseases, conditions common among the elderly, rank high inmeasures of morbidity, disability, family stress, and economic burden. For example,the costs exclusively due to dementias alone were estimated at $24 to $48 billion in1985, and will increase as the population ages. However, the epidemiology of these conditions is poorly understood, so CDC has begun analyzing existing data sets andexploring the value of gathering new data on these problems. National Center forHealth Statistics multiple cause-of-death data have been used to estimate the re-ported prevalence at death and describe the epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease,Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis from 1968- 85. Medicare hospitalization data were examined for information on dementing ill-nesses, but found to be a poor source of data for these conditions. Through the Community Chronic Disease Prevention Program, CDC has providedassistance to three State health departments to build their capacity for designing,290 organizing, implementing, and evaluating behavior-based intervention activities in specific communities. Diabetes is also a major contributor to morbidity and mortality among persons over 65. It affects 8 percent of persons over 65, 60 percent of those individuals are hospitalized every year. One quarter of all patients initiating costly end-stage renal disease treatment have diabetes, and 20 percent are over 65. Half of all amputations occur in people with diabetes, and 60 percent of those are over 65 years old. Almost half of the persons with diabetes who become blind are over 65. During 1989, CDC focused its efforts on the prevention of three major complications of diabetes which affect people over 65: blindness, amputations, and hypertension. Twenty-nine States and one territory were provided funding to address these complications. Increased emphasis on these conditions will continue in Fiscal Year 1990. Attention to the major contributions of cardiovascular disease, which accounts for 75 percent of all deaths among persons with diabetes over 65, will expand in 1990. The program con- tinues to build consensus on effect control strategies and translating effective tech- niques into community practice. CENTER FOR ENVIRoNMENTAL HEALTH AND INJURY CONTROL Several CDC Injury Research and Demonstration Grants funded in 1986 and 1989 have focused on injury prevention in the elderly. In 1986, CDC began funding a 3- year 'project at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine to study the associa- tion between psychotropic and hypotensive drugs and the risk of fall-related frac- tures among Tennessee Medicare enrollees. The investigators have identified poten- tial interventions for fall-related fractures by changing patterns of medication use. In 1989, CDC funded a study aimed at identifying therapeutic interventions for im- proving outcomes in elderly burn patients and a study that will provide a model for assessing medication-associated crash risk in the elderly. The results of projects funded in 1989 will be available over the next 2 to 3 years. In August 1989, a multidisciplinary conference addressing the needs of the older driver was hosted by the National Institute on Aging, the Federal Highway Admin- istration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and CDC. The con- ference brought together 170 specialists in such diverse areas as ophthalmology, epi- demiology, gerontology, pharmacology, human factors, and highway vehicle safety and design to present and review the latest research findings in functional areas related to driving abilities and to identify researchable issues that apply specifically to the needs of the older driver. CDC is currently helping to organize and develop documents that will summarize the proceedings and recommendations from the con- ference. Other collaboration has been initiated with the Center for Chronic Disease Pre- vention and Health Promotion to determine the impact of glycemia control on motor vehicle-associated injury in persons with insulin-dependent diabetes. An intramural research effort is underway that involves analyzing mortality data on suicides among United States residents over age 65. Data are being analyzed to identify high-risk groups according to demographic factors such as marital status, sex, and race. Other specific projects funded by CDC include: -The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitation Services, as a part of their statewide Injury Control Program, will be examining the impact and pre- vention of falls in the elderly. Injuries from falls in Florida claim a dispropor- tionate number of lives; this can be directly correlated to the large elderly popu- lation in Florida (third highest in the nation). -An Injury Prevention and Control Program in Baltimore County is focusing on the prevention of falls in the elderly. -A New York City program will address pedestrian injuries among the elderly in a collaborative effort with the Department of Transportation's Safety Unit and the Department of Aging. -In New York State, as an intervention strategy for local health units, a pro- gram has been funded to develop prevention packets addressing, among other issues, home safety for the elderly. Packets will be a management tool plus health promotional resource. New York State currently is conducting an inter- vention project on falls in-the elderly. -: -In North Carolina, a program will support a Driver Medical Evaluation Pro- gram to keep medically impaired persons from driving. A high percentage of this population will be people over 65 years of age. Other collaborative projects have been initiated with both the Philadelphia Health Department and the Indian Health Service to target injuries among inner-291 city Blacks and Native Americans. The special needs and risks of the elderly among these high-risk populations are being addressed by these programs. CENTER FOR INFEmOUs DISEASES In efforts directed towards facilities, CDC is working to define risk factors for the prevention and control of institutionally acquired infections in skilled nursing facili- ties (SNFs). Through a cooperative agreement, data collection for infections and in- fection control programs in SNFs in Connecticut was completed. The purpose of the study was to improve the prevention of nosocomial infections in SNFs by identifying infections in skilled nursing homes, associated risk factors and characterizing infec- tion control programs in these facilities. Analysis has been completed and two manuscripts have been accepted for publication in the American Journal of Infec- tion Control: \"Infection Control Practitioners and Committees in Connecticut Skilled Nursing Facilities\" and \"Infection Control Practices in Connecticut's Skilled Nursing Facilities.\" This study demonstrated that among Connecticut SNFs, infec- tion control practitioners increased in number and devote more time to infection control than in previous years. Almost all SNFs (97 percent) had an infection con- trol manual, up from 69 percent in 1979. All facilities surveyed conducted prospec- tive surveillance for infections. Most (82 percent) SNFs had programs to prevent de- cubitus ulcers. However, less than one-half of SNFs reported that 90 percent or more of their patients received influenza vaccine-numerous outbreaks were report- ed. This seems to be an area to target for improvement. CENTER FOR PREVENTION SERVIcES CDC is continuing its efforts to make adults aware of the need to be immunized against the vaccine preventable diseases of pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, tet- anus, diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles and rubella. CDC, through a contract, devel- oped and evaluated an intervention system that included audiovisual materials and a handbook aimed at assisting local and State health departments to promote im- munization of adults in the community. In addition, in collaboration with State and local health agencies, CDC distributed approximately 20,000 copies of a manual de- scribing ways to improve the administration of influenza vaccination programs in nursing homes. CDC featured the adult immunization theme as part of the 22nd National Immu- nization Conference held in San Antonio, Texas in June 1988. A number of presen- tations and workshops were held and over 450 participants attended. The proceed- ings and workshop findings will be published and distributed in 1989. A cooperative agreement continues in effect with a health maintenance organiza- tion (HMO) trade organization to measure vaccine use and develop procedures to increase acceptance of adult vaccines by HMO subscribers. CDC is continuing its participation with a coalition of over 50 public and private organizations to promote National Adult Immunization Awareness Week during the last week of October each year. The National Coalition for Adult Immunization (NCAI) was formed during 1988 and includes the American Academy of Family Phy- sicians, the American College of Physicians, the American Hospital Association, the American Lung Association, the American Public Health Association, the Associa- tion of State and Territorial Health Officials, the Centers for Disease Control, the Health Insurance Association of America, the National Foundation of Infectious Diseases, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association as a Steering Commit- tee. Three Actions Groups have been formed to target physician and other providers for information and education messages and activities: Influenza/Pneumococcal; Measles, Mumps, Rubella; and Hepatitis B. CDC is assisting State and local health systems in expanding immunization pro- gram coverage of adult populations through the promotion of Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) of Adult Immunization. CDC and the Health Care Financing Administration are jointly conducting a dem- onstration project to determine if it is cost-effective for Medicare to cover the use of influenza vaccine. This project involves the provision and administration of influen- za vaccine to Medicare part B recipients in nine sites. In 1989, the demonstration project was primarily involved in the recruitment of medicare providers to adminis- ter influenza vaccine and the development of surveillance systems to detect the presence of influenza in communities. It is anticipated that in the second year of the demonstration project, more than 50 percent of Medicare part B eligibles will be vaccinated in the nine sites. The demonstration project will last between 2 and 4 years. If the project successfully demonstrates cost-effectiveness, the coverage will become a routine covered expense under the Medicare part B program.292 CDC continues to be involved in the planning and implementation of the National Vaccine Program, and has included adult immunization as one of the major compo- nents of this program. Efforts continue to be made to measure the cost and effects of adult immunization in selected target populations and these efforts will be con- tinued in 1989. Tuberculosis (TB) among the elderly is an important problem. During 1988, 6,092 TB cases were reported among persons age 65 and older. TB case rates among the elderly are higher than in any other age group. In 1988, the case rate for persons of all ages was 9.1 per 100,000 population while the rate for those persons age 65 and older was 20.1. Elderly residents of nursing homes are at even higher risk for developing TB than elderly persons living in the community. According to a CDC-sponsored survey of 15,379 reported TB cases in 29 States, the incidence of TB among elderly nursing home residents was 39.2 per 100,000 person-years while the incidence of TB among elderly persons living in the community was 21.5 per 100,000 person-years. Dr. Wil- liam Stead, of Arkansas, and other investigators have reported TB outbreaks in nursing homes in which transmission of tuberculous infection to residents and staff was documented. During 1989 the HHS Advisory Committee for Elimination of Tuberculosis assist- ed CDC with development of specific recommendations for controlling TB among nursing home residents and employees. The recommendations, which are scheduled for publication during 1990, call for TB screeing of nursing home residents and em- ployees at admission or upon employment, annual rescreening for employees, atten- tion to timely casefinding among symptomatic elderly persons, and the use of appro- priate precautions to prevent the spread of TB in facilities providing residential care for elderly persons. Over the past several years, CDC has focused increased effort on determining the oral health needs of older adults within States, and on planning a national initiative to emphasize the value of oral health among older Americans. With other units of the Public Health Service (including the National Institute of Dental Research) and dental professional organizations, CDC has enegaged in early planning for this initi- ative. For each of the past two years, CDC has been selected to receive assistance from a Postdoctoral Fellow in Applied Gerontology by the Gerontological Society of Amer- ica. One fellow developed survey instruments that health agencies can use in con- ducting needs assessments; the validated intruments permit collection of standard comparable information from older adults regarding their oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, as well as perceived benefits of- dental disease preventive measures. This past summer, a second fellow determined the current status of oral health programs for older adults within States, including factors that have fostered or impeded program development, then offered recommendations regarding future directions for such programs. f NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the Federal Government's principal health statistics agency, became a Center within the Centers for Disease Control in 1987. The NCHS data systems address the full spectrum of concerns in the health field from birth to death, including overall health status, life style, the onset and diagnosis of illness and disability, and the use of health care. The Center maintains over a dozen surveys that collect health information through personal interviews; physical examination and laboratory testing; review of hospital, nursing home, and physician records; and other means. These data sys- tems, and the analysis and reports that follow, are designed to provide information useful to a variety of policymakers and researchers. NCHS frequently responds to requests for special analysis of date that have already been collected and solicits broad input from the health community in the design and development of its sur- veys..Since most of the data systems maintained by NCHS encompass all age groups in the population, a broad range of data on the aging of the population and the result- ing impact on health status and the use of health care produced. For example, NCHS data have documented the continuing rise in life expectancy and trends in mortality that are essential to making population projections. Data are collected on the extent and nature of disability and impairment, limitations on functional abili- ty, and the use of special aids. Surveys currently examine the use of hospitals, nurs- ing homes and physicians' offices and are being expanded to cover hospital emergen- cy rooms, surgi-centers and home health care.293 In addition to NCHS surveys of the overall population that produce information about the health of older Americans, a number of activities provide special empha- sis on the aging. A FOCAL POINT FOR DATA ON AGING In 1989, NCHS established a focal point for data on aging by creating a position of Coordinator of Data on Aging. Joan F. Van Nostrand is the Coordinator. This focal point cuts across the Center's data systems to coordinate: -The collection, analysis and dissemination of health data on older Americans; -International research in data on aging; and -Measurement research in aging in such areas as development of a uniform data set for long-term care and assessment of disability. The Coordinator provides information to the general public about NCHS activities and data on aging Americans. HEALTH OF AN AGING AMERICA: 1989 BIBLIOGRAPHY NCHS has published a guide to its reports on the health of older Americans. The 1989 bibliography is a guide by subject to recent NCHS reports about various as- pects of aging and the health of America's older citizens. It focuses on NCHS reports that provide indepth data on aging, whether or not they deal exclusively with older persons. Subject areas include health status, functioning, long-term care, health policy and mortality. The Bibliography is the first in a yearly series of guides to NCHS data about aging. Copies are available free of charge from the NCHS Coordi- nator of Data on Aging. PROPOSED SURVEY OF THE DYNAMICS OF AGING In response to the growing interest in longitudinal data, the NCHS has developed a proposal for a Survey of the Dynamics of Aging (SODA). SODA's intent is to produce longitudinal data on older Americans to analyze health, economic well- being and critical life events in terms of their dynamic interrelationships. SODA has a dual focus-on disability and on aging successfully. Special attention is given to health promotion issues by conducting a mini-physical examination. Specifics con- cerning content and methodology vis-a-vis policy and epidemiologic issues are under development in 1990. INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ON MEASURING THE HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE OF THE AGING NCHS launched the International Collaborative Effort on Measuring the Health and Health Care of the Aging (abbreviated as the ICE on Aging) in 1988. The pur- pose of the ICE on Aging is to join with international experts in conducting re- search to improve the measurement of health and health care of the aging. Re- search results will be applied to the Center's programs to strengthen the collection, analyses and dissemination of data on older persons. The international emphasis of the research permits the exchange of multiple perspectives, approaches and insights among nations facing similar situations and challenges. Results of this collaborative effort can provide greater opportunities for comparisons and linkages of health data on aging among nations. Results will be disseminated widely to encourage their international application. An International Symposium on Data on Aging was held in late 1988 to develop proposals for research in selected areas. In early 1989, the following research projects were approved for implementation: -Comparative Analysis of Health Statistics for Selected Diseases Common In Older Persons: USA and Hong Kong; -Measuring Outcomes of Nursing Home Care: USA, Australia, Canada; -The Measurement of Vitality In Older Persons: USA and Italy; -Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Among the Aged: USA and The Netherlands; and -Functional Ability: USA, Canada, Hungary, Israel. Other international collaborators need to be identified. An international Symposi- um for presentation of interim results is tentatively scheduled for 1991. In 1989, NCHS issued the first Information Update for the ICE on Aging. It de- scribes the project in depth. To obtain a copy and be placed on the mailing list for future updates, contact the NCHS Coordinator of Data on Aging.294 STATISTICS FOR HEALTH POLICY NCHS has taken a leading role in a jointly-sponsored project conducted by the Committee on National Statistics of the National Academy of Science. The project examined the adequacy of current statistics and identified activities to increase the relevance of health statistics for policy analysis of issues related to an aging society. A final report, The Aging Population in the Twenty-First Century: Statistics for Health Policy, was published in 1988. As background for the report, a dozen papers on various topics were commissioned. The background papers were published in 1989 in: Health of An Aging America: Issues on Data for Policy Analysis, Vital and Health Statistics, Series 4, No. 25. DHHS Pub. No. (PHS) 89-1488. These papers pro- vide a fuller treatment of some of the issues addressed by the 1988 report. FEDERAL FORUM ON AGING-RELATED STATISTICS The NCHS, in conjuction with the National Institute on Aging and the Bureau of the Census, co-chairs the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics. The Forum encourages communication and cooperation among Federal agencies in the collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on the older population. The Forum consists of over twenty Federal agencies that produce or analyze data on the aging population. The Forum has three standing committees: (1) Data Needs and Analytic Issues: (2) Methodological Issues; and (3) Data Presentation and Dissemina- tion. The NCHS provides the staff support for the Standing Committee on Data Needs and Analytic Issues. In 1989, a major focus of the Forum was on measurement of activities of daily living (ADL's). The Forum established a Work Group, co-chaired by the Executive Secretariat and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evalua- tion, to determine why estimates of ADL's differed from survey to survey. In late 1989, the Forum issued a report on this subject: Measuring the ADL's Among the Elderly: A Guide to National Surveys. It analyzes reasons for different ADL esti- mates in 11 national surveys and presents estimates when a standard definition of disability is applied across surveys. Also, in 1989 the Forum: -Released Annual Report, 1988 detailing activities since it was convened in 1987; and -Supported the development of Data Resources in Gerontology: A Directory of Se- lected Information Vendors, Databases, and Archives by the Gerontological Soci- ety of America. Copies of these three reports are available from the NCHS Coordinator of Data on Aging. NATIONAL MORTALITY FOLLOWBACK SURVEY During 1986, data collection began for the National Mortality Followback Survey, the first such survey in 18 years. The followback survey broadens the information available on the characteristics of mortality among the population of the United States from the routine vital statistics system by making inquiry of the next of kin of a sample of decedents. Because two-thirds of all deaths in the Nation in a year occur at age 65 or older, the 1986 survey focuses on the study of health and social care provided to older decedents in the last year of life. This is a period of great concern for the individual, the family and community agencies. It is also a period of large expenditures. Agency program planning and national policy development on such issues as hospice care and home care can be enlightened by the data from the Survey. A public use data tape from the next-of-kin questionnaire was released in 1988. A second tape, combining data from the next-of-kin and hospitals and other health facilities, will be available in 1990. Several summary reports were released in 1989. The reports, which focused on the aging, were about persons dying of diseases of the heart and of cerebrovascular disease. Additional reports will be released in 1990. NATIONAL NURSING HOME SURVEY During 1985, NCHS conducted the national Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) to pro- vide valuable information about older persons in nursing homes. The NNHS was first conducted in 1973-74 and again in 1977. Preliminary data from the 1985 survey were published in 1987 and 1988 about nursing home characteristics, utilization, discharges and registered nurses. A sum- mary report, which integrated final data from the various components of the survey, was published in January 1989. Also published in 1989 were two analytical reports, one on diagnostic related groups and one on utilization. Other analytical295 reports on various topics will be published during 1990 and 1991. Public-use comput- er tapes are available through the National Technical Information Service. NATIONAL NURSING HOME SURVEY FOLLOWUP The National Nursing Home Survey Followup (NNHSF) is a longitudinal study which follows the cohort of current residents and discharged residents sampled from the 1985 NNHS described above. The NNHSF builds on the data collected for the 1985 NNHS by extending the period of observation by approximately 3 years. Two waves of data collection have been completed. Wave I was conducted from August through November 1987. Wave II was conducted in the fall of 1988. Public-use data tapes for Waves I and II will be available in 1990. Wave III will begin in January of 1990. The study is a collaborative project between NCHS, HHS and the National Institute on Aging (NIA). The Followup was funded primarily by NIA and was de- veloped and conducted by NCHS. The NNHSF interviews were conducted using a computer-assisted telephone interview system. Questions concerning vital status, nursing home and hospital uti- lization since the last contact, current living arrangements, Medicare number, and source of payment were asked. Respondents included subjects, proxies, and staff of nursing homes. The NNHSF will provide data on the flow of persons in and out of long-term care facilities and hospitals. These utilization profiles will also be examined in relation to information on the resident, the nursing home and the community. LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON AGING In 1984 a large supplement, the Supplement on Aging, was added to the National Health Interview Survey. The Supplement on Aging was used to obtain information about 16,148 people age 55 and over living in the community. The focus was on housing, including barriers and ownership; support, including number and nearness of living children and recent contacts in the community; retirement, including rea- sons for retirement and sources of retirement income; and measures of disability, including activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and ability to perform work-related activities. The 1984 Supplement on Aging was designed to be the basis of prospective stud- ies. The first of these is the Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA), a collaborative project of the National Institute on Aging and the NCHS. The first version of the public-use data file was released in July 1987. This file contains information for 1984 from the National Health Interview Survey basic questionnaire, the Supple- ment on Aging, and the Health Insurance Supplement; information from the 1986 re-interview; and the National Death Index (NDI) match information for 1984 and 1985. It also contains a description of the study and the questionnaires. It is avail- able from the Division of Health Interview Statistics and the National Archives of Computerized Data on Aging. Version 2 of the LSOA file was released in 1988. All data on version 1 of the person file (the 1987 release) are retained without change. Additional data on the person file included results of the 1986 NDI match, results of the decedent follow- back survey, coding of the reasons for moves and whether moves were across State lines, and indicators for matches with HCFA files. Two additional files have been added in the 1988 release. One is the Medicare Part A match. There is one record for each hospitalization from 1984 through 1987. The other is the Medicare Part A and B match for non-hospital use. It contains indi- cators for each year on whether the individual has used one of four out-of-hospital services. The participants in the 1984 survey who were age 70 and over in 1984 were inter- viewed again in 1988 using computer-assisted telephone interviewing and mail fol- lowup. Data from this interview and from the matches with Medicare and NDI files will be on the Version 3 release in 1990. The third reinterview will be conducted in 1990. DATA FOR ANALYSIS OF SECULAR TRENDS From 1969 through 1981, the procedures and questions for the basic questionnaire of the National Health Interview Survey remained relatively constant. The Nation- al Institute on Aging and NCHS have taken advantage of this long series of repeat- ed questions to develop a historical file for the analysis of secular trends. This public-use file is a unique resource for looking at secular change or investigating the health status of older persons when they were younger. It is available through the296 Division of Health Interview Statistics and the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging. The descriptions of the procedures and the questionnaires have been published by the National Center for Health Statistics in Vital and Health Statistics Series 1 No. 18 (Health Interview Survey Design, 1973-84, and Procedures 1975-1983). Question- naires and basic data have also been published in Vital and Health Statistics Series 10 (Current Estimates). NATIONAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION EXAMINATION SURVEY Hl The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides val- uable information available only through direct physical examinations of a probabil- ity sample of the population. The third cycle of this survey, NHANES m, went into the field in 1988. NHANES m will provide a unique data base for older persons, as a number of important methodologic changes have been made in the survey struc- ture. There is no upper age limit (previous surveys had an age limit of 74 years), and the sample will be selected to include approximately 1,300 persons aged 80 or older. The focus of the survey includes many of the major chronic diseases of aging which cause morbidity and mortality including cardiovascular disease, osteoarthri- tis, osteoporosis, pulmonary disease, dental disease, and diabetes. In addition to the focus on nutrition, information on social, cognitive, and physical function is incorporated into the survey. A home examination will be available for those unable or unwilling to come to the central examination site, the Mobile Exam- ination Center. It is planned that longitudinal followup of persons in the survey will be accomplished (including links to administrative records such as Medicare infor- mation and the National Death Index) and a specimen bank will be established. The major activity in 1989 was the fielding of the survey. A conference is planned for 1990 on approaches to analysis of the survey's nutrition data on the elderly. NHANES I EPIDEMIOLOGIC POLLOWUP SURVEY The first NHANES (NHANES I) was conducted in the period 1971-75. The NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Survey, conducted by NCHS over the last sever- al years, tracks and reinterviews the more than 14,000 persons examined as part of the NHANES I study. The main objective of the followup is to relate baseline char- acteristics to subsequent morbidity and mortality. While persons examined in NHANES I were all under age 75, by 1986. more than 2,000 of these individuals were over 75, providing a valuable study group to examine the aging process. Per- sons age 55 and over at baseline were interviewed in 1986 and the entire surviving cohort was recontacted in 1987 to further study mortality, institutionalization, health status, and functioning. And additional wave of followup is scheduled for 1991. Future plans include monitoring the deaths in this population. IMPROVING QUESTIONS ON FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS The National Laboratory for Collaborative Research in Cognitive and Survey Measurement of NCHS is currently condicting cognitive interviews with old (65-74), very old (75-84), and oldest (85+) respondents. The objective is to test the adequacy of existing survey questions for collecting information on functional limitations (e.g., limitations on bathing, dressing, transferring, etc.). Pending funding, a field experi- ment is anticipated in 1990 to test the \"functional limitation\" survey questions for the \"oldest\" respondents. OFFICE OF DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) was established by Public Law 94-317, the National Consumer Health Information and Health Pro- motion Act of 1976, and functions under the provisions of Title XVII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. Located within the Office of the Assistant Secre- tary for Health, at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the mission of ODPHP is to help promote health and prevent disease among Americans. The Office undertakes this mandate by developing prevention policy; coordinating and facilitating the prevention activities of the five principal agencies of the PHS; and helping to stimulate and foster the involvement of non-Federal groups in dis- ease prevention and health promotion activities. At the turn of the century, infectious diseases were the leading killers. Now, nearly half of all diseases and premature deaths can be traced to lifestyle factors such as smoking, improper diet, and lack of exercise. Identifying which behaviors, practices and habits enhance or threaten health, and encouraging the adoption of297 healthy behaviors, carries great potential for preventing disease and disability in all age groups, including the elderly. Between 1950 and 1985 (provisional data), there was an 18 percent drop in the age-adjusted mortality rate for older adults. Much of this decrease is a result of the decline in death rates for two of the three leading causes of death for this agegroup-a 39 percent decline between 1950 and 1985 for stroke, and a 24 percent de- cline for diseases of the heart. In 1950, diseases of the heart accounted for 45.6 per- cent of the deaths of older Americans; in 1985, the percentage was 42.5. Stroke in 1950 accounted for 14.7 percent of older adult deaths; in 1985, the percentage was 9. Cancer has increased from 13.7 percent of deaths for this age group in 1950 to 20.2percent in 1985. Cancer death rates have steadily increased since 1950, in part re- flecting an increase in lung cancer among women, which in turn is associated withthe increased prevalence of cigarette smoking among women. The leading chronic health problems afflicting older adults-arthritis, hyperten- sion, hearing loss, visual loss, and heart problems-also are conditions with the po- tential, in many cases, to respond to exercise, healthy diet, and early care. Improving the quality of life for older Americans is a major goal of prevention programs that target the 65 and older population. ODPHP activities which addresshealth promotion and disease prevention for older adults are as follows: HEALTH OBJEcTIVES FOR AN AGING NATION ODPHP is responsible for monitoring progress toward meeting the 226 disease prevention and health promotion objectives for the year 1990, adopted in 1980, andestablishing a new set of objectives for the year 2000. Beginning with a series of public hearings held nationwide in 1987-88, ODPHP has been engaged in the devel-opment of national objectives that represent a consensus among public and private agencies and organizations about the priority prevention issues which need to be ad- dressed over the next decade. One of the special populations being targeted for improvements in health status over the next decade is the older population. Recognizing that it is not enough to simply extend life, a major goal will be to maintain health and improve the quality of later life. A public draft of the new objectives was disseminated in November 1989, and the release of the final set of objectives is scheduled for September 1990. ODPHP has awarded a cooperative agreement to the American Association of Re-tired Persons to stimulate activitives that will help us achieve those objectives aimed at older adults. GUIDE TO CLINICAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, another activity coordinated by ODPHP,released recommendations in March on the effectiveness of over 100 clinical inter- ventions for the prevention of 60 diseases and conditions. The Guide to Clinical Pre- ventive Services was the result of a 5-year effort by a 20 member, non-Federal panel appointed by the Assistant Secretary for Health in 1984. The charge of the Task Force was to develop age and risk factor-specific recommendations for the deliveryof preventive services in the clinical setting. Specific recommendations are made for people age 65 and older. Four types of interventions are identified as appropriate inthe clinical setting: screenings, counseling, immunizations, and chemoprophylaxis. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION As the percentage of elderly in the Nation's population continues to increase the Food and Drug Administation (FDA) has been giving increasing attention to the el- derly in the programs developed and implemented by the Agency. FDA has been focusing on several areas for the elderly that fall under its responsibility in the reg- ulation of foods, drugs and medical devices. Efforts in education, labeling, drug test- ing, drug utilization, and adverse reactions have been of primary interest. Close re- lationships have been established with both the National Institute on Aging and the Administration on Aging of the Department of Health and Human Services to fur-ther strengthen programs that will assist the elderly in their medical care. Some ofthe major initiatives that are underway are described below. PATIENT EDUCATION To further the goals established by the joint Public Health Service/Administra- tion on Aging Committee on Health Promotion for the Elderly, during the last 8 years FDA has coordinated the development and implementation of significant pa-tient education programs with the National Council on Patient Information and298 Education (NCPIE) and many private sector organizations. NCPIE is a nongovern- mental group consisting of medical pharmacy, consumer, and pharmaceutical orga- nizations whose goal is to stimulate patient education program development. Special emphasis has been placed on the elderly, who use more prescription drugs per capita than the rest of population. The \"Get the Answers' campaign is the primary program urging patients to ask their health professionals questions about their prescriptions. The major component of the campaign is a medical data wallet card that lists the five questions patients should ask when they get a prescription. These questions are: -What is the name of the drug and what is it supposed to do? -How and when do I take it-and for how long? -What foods, drinks, other medicines, or activities should I avoid while taking this drug?-Are there any side effects, and what do I do if they occur? -Is there any written information available about the drug? The \"Get the Answers\" message has been widely disseminated to consumers through news releases advice columns, and other media. -In October 1986 FDA and NCPIE joined in a press conference to launch the first national \"Talk About Prescriptions\" month. The purpose of the month was to stim- ulate activity to motivate health professionals to give-and consumers to seek-the information needed for safe and effective medication use. The campaign theme- \"The Other Drug Problem\"-resulted in extensive media coverage. Numerous orga- nizations across the country conducted educational activities in support of the cam- paign. The \"Talk About Prescriptions\" month campaign was so successful that NCPIE decided to make it an annual event. The second \"Talk About Prescriptions\" month held in October 1987, emphasized the problem of improper medication use among the elderly. At the press conference to kick off the month, NCPIE officially released their report on improper medica- tion use among older people and announced a new public education campaign to im- prove communications between'health professionals and the elderly. The public education campaign consisted of: a 30-second TV public service an- nouncement (PSA), a 30-second radio PSA, a four-color brochure and print ads for consumer and professional publications. The campaign focused on effective commu- nication between the older patient and the health care professional as the way to reduce medication misuse. Media materials-using the slogan \"Before You Take It, Talk About It\"-urged older consumers to talk with doctors, pharmacists, and nurses about the medicines prescribed for them. NCPIE has received a 20 percent reply rate on bounceback cards from television stations reporting how often they used the spots and commenting on the quality of the ad. A professional analysis of these bounceback card responses indicated the spots were well-received by a great majority of respondents. The bounceback cards NCPIE received in response to the radio PSAs indicated a high degree of satisfac- tion and that some radio stations preferred to have their radio personnel read PSAs. As a result, in 1988 NCPIE mailed scripts to 1,000 radio stations and to the major radio networks. - The third \"Talk About Prescriptions\" month occurred in October 1988. The cam- paign newsletter included an article entitled \"Meeting Older Patients' Medication Needs at Home\" and information on obtaining resource material designed for older consumer. FDA distributed the \"Talk About Prescriptions\" month campaign news- letter to its newsletter editor network and several thousand consumers and multipli- er organizations asking that they conduct educational campaigns. As an outgrowth of the \"Talk About Prescriptions\" month program, the District of Columbia launched a city-wide campaign in October 1988 to educate older people and health providers about the safe use of medicine. The campaign ran for 6 months and targeted over 80,000 senior citizens living in the District who were reached through direct mail, community workshops, and media activities. Material for the 1989 \"Talk About Prescriptions\" month campaign included arti- cles entitled \"Medicine Misuse Among Older People: New Evidence of a Significant Problem\" and \"Working With Older Patients to Improve Medicine Use.\" It also in- cluded a clip and copy page entitled \"Helping Your Independent Older Parents Use Medicines Safely\" as well as a section on resources available \"especially for the older consumer. FDA issued an FY 1989 assignment to the field Consumer Affairs Officers to con- duct Patient Education Forums to discuss the problems of prescription medication misuse and to plan the October 1989 \"Talk About Prescriptions\" month campaign. One of the main target audiences for these forums is organizations that work with the elderly.299 Concurrent with the activities aimed at patients, FDA, NCPIE and many privatesector organizations are conducting a major campaign to encourage health profes-sionals to provide drug information to their patients. Urging consumers to \"Get theAnswers\" and health professionals to \"Give the Answers' is vital to bridge the com-munications gap-to get both sides to talk to each other about medications.In addition to patient education initiatives FDA and NCPIE are continuing toevaluate the effectiveness of patient education programs and are monitoring the at-titudes and behavior of consumers and health professionals about patient drug in-formation. FDA is encouraged by the number and quality of patient education acti-vites undertaken by the various sectors. FDA will continue to provide leadership tofoster the patient education initiative. PREMARKrr TESTING GuIDELINEs A specific guideline for the premarket testing of drugs likely to be used in theelderly is currently being reviewed by FDA. The guideline will address issues suchas the extent to which drug trials should include elderly patients to help identify dosage regimens and other factors that need to be considered. Although use of aguideline is not a legal requirement, a person may be assured that in following aguideline the recommended procedures and standards will be acceptable to FDA.FDA expects its new guideline on \"Use of Drugs in the Elderly\" will be published inthe new future. In addition, in October 1988, FDA published a Guideline for theFormat and Content of the Clinical and Statistical Sections of a New Drug Applica-tion which emphasizes the need to analyze data to search for differences in effec-tiveness and adverse effects between younger and older patients and to evaluate ef-fects of altered kidney or liver function, other drugs, and other illnesses, all highlypertinent to the elderly. FDA's efforts to ensure that premarket testing adequately considers the needs ofolder people also include educational activities for Institutional Review Boards (IRB)through workshops and the dissemination of information sheets on a variety oftopics of interest to IRBs. An IRB governs the review and conduct of all human re-search at a particular institution involving products regulated by FDA. This aspectof drug testing and research is particularly important to institutional patients, acategory comprised of a large number of elderly persons, to ensure adequate protec-tion with regard to informed consent. FDA continues to work closely with the Na-tional Institutes of Health to develop and distribute information sheets to clinicalinvestigators and members of the IRB community. PorTMARKETING SURVEILLANCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY In the area of postmarketing surveillance and epidemiology, the Office of Epide-miology and Biostatistics has introduced a section of the annual adverse drug reac-tion report focusing on adverse reaction reports for individuals over the age of 60.Of the approximately 50,000 adverse reaction reports FDA received in 1988 about 20,508 had age and sex reported. Of these reports 35 percent were associated withindividuals 60 years of age or over. In addition to annual review ADR reports associ-ated with the elderly, we have also examined drug use patterns using informationobtained from IMS America, Ltd. and Pharmaceutical Data Services. In 1988, thefive most frequently dispensed drugs to hospitalized patients age 65 years or olderwere acetaminophen, potassium chloride furosemide, digoxin and calcium The top five ranked drugs as writ-ten by physicians in a nonhospital setting for patients age 65 or over were LasixR,Lanoxin\", aspirin, potassium, and Dyazide . GERIATRIc LABELING From March through May of 1988, FDA's Drug Labeling, Research and EducationBranch (DLREB) conducted a survey of the professional labeling of some 425 select-ed drugs for geriatric information. The survey drugs were chosen from data basessuch as the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI) which list agents com-monly used in the elderly. Half (212) of the products surveyed contained geriatricinformation. The drug classes with the greatest number of agents with geriatric in-formation included the central nervous system agents (89 percent), gastrointestinal/genitourinary agents (79 percent), antiarthritic agents (77 percent), hypoglycemicdrugs (75 percent), and respiratory agents (70 percent). The classes with the leastamount of geriatric labeling were the glaucoma agents (15 percent) antihistamine/ cold products (25 percent), cardiovascular agents (26 percent) and anticiotics (31 per-cent). Final analysis of the data will be completed by December 1989 and a first300 draft should be completed by March 1990. After allowing sufficient time for internal review, submission to a journal is expected. To ensure that all prescription drugs contain useful information about drug use in the elderly, FDA is developing a proposal to require that labeling for prescription drugs describe all available information on geriatric drug use. This information would be based on results from controlled clinical studies and also on other perti- nent premarketing or postmarketinq studies or experience. Such information would be identified in a new 'geriatric use' section and described under other appropriate sections of physician labeling. It should be noted that the proposed rule would not require manufacturers to conduct new studies of products in the elderly. AcrxvmEs WITH THE AARP PHARMACY SERVICES DIVISION MEDICATION INFORMATION LEAFLETS (MILS) FOR SENIORS The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Pharmacy Services Divi- sion, in conjunction with FDA's Drug Labeling, Research and Education Branch (DLREB), publish MILs-educational leaflets about drugs written for use through the AARP prescription drug mail order program. This past year MILs were written for the following classes of drugs: nonsteroidal drugs, The leaflets provide the patient with: -a description of the contents. -a list of the diseases for which the drug is used as a treatment. -information the patient should tell the physician before taking the medication. -dosage information-how the medication should be taken. -instructions on what to do if a dose is missed. -possible interactions with other medications. -possible serious and non-serious side effects. HYPERTENSION SURVEY The FDA is designing a survey to assess information needs and motivations of subgroups of older individuals with hypertension who subscribe to the AARP Phar- macy Service. Analyses will identify targeted sub-audiences who would be expected to respond differentially to varying health promotion message strategies. The study design instrument development and pretest are to be completed by March 1990. The data collection should be completed by August 1990. Data analysis should be com- pleted and manuscript development should be initiated by November 1990. PRESCRIPTION DRUG HANDBOOK The FDA will be assisting in the revising and editing of the. AARP Pharmacy Service Prescription Drug Handbook. The FDA's role in revising and editing the handbook should be completed by December 1989. AARP expects to take the hand- book to press by December 1990. DRUG INTERACTION BROCHURE In conjunction with the National Consumer's League (NCL), and other pharmacy- related private organizations, the FDA is writing a brochure about drug interactions aimed mainly at the elderly consumer. This brochure will explain to elderly con- sumers what drug interactions are, how to recognize them, and how to avoid them. The brochure is expected to be in final form by February 1990, and NCL expects to publish the brochure by July 1990. GENERIC DRUGS The elderly in our population, as users of more medications than any other group, benefit greatly from the wide availability of generic drugs that generally cost much less than their brand name counterparts. Landmark legislation, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, established an abbreviated procedure for FDA's review of marketing applications for a new class of generic drugs that exempts them from expensive re- testing for safety and effectiveness. This testing was conducted originally for the brand-name drug and is thus not re- garded as necessary for the generic copy. By lifting this testing requirement, the301 1984 Act removed a major roadblock to the development of generics. Since enact-ment of the 1984 law, FDA has approved about 2,500 applications for generic drugs.During the past 12 months, approximately 299 abbreviated new drug applications have been approved. By comparison, before the 1984 law, the average annual rate ofapprovals was about 350 generic products. According to trade groups, generic drug sales are expanding about 14 percent a year. FDA will continue to examine theimpact of advertising, labeling, and education efforts on the elderly as more genericdrug products are made available in the marketplace. In September 1986 the Commissioner of FDA chaired a public workshop to reviewvarious topics associated with designing and conducting studies that are used todemonstrate that generic drugs are equivalent to performance to brand-name drugs.The purpose of the meeting was to determine whether FDA's testing regulationsneed updating in light of any new findings, in the scientific area that is relativelynew and evolving. Maintaining a state-of-the-art capability in this area is regarded by FDA as critical to ensuring that generic drugs work as they are supposed to and provide the elderly and others with an effective lower cost alternative to brand- name medicines. A Bioequivalence Task Force was formed by FDA to study theissues posed at the workshop. The report of the Task Force was released in Febru-ary 1988 and many of its recommendations have already been implemented. In 1989, FDA has made extensive efforts to resolve all uncertainties that mayhave been associated with the production of generic drugs and the manner in whichthey are approved. The Agency has revamped the management of its generic drug operations and put in place stricter controls on the way generic drug applicationsare processed. FDA is also conducting an extensive and vigorous investigation of theleading drug companies that manufacture generic products in an effort to assurethe public of both the safety and efficacy ofthe generic drug supply in the UnitedStates. The Agency is reexamining many of the original drug applications, auditingsamples of leading generic products to affirm that they meet specifications for mar- keting, and negotiating product recalls or application withdrawals where there hasbeen any reason to be concerned that products on the market were not supported byvalid data. The Agency has issued an interim report finding that in spite of the con- cerns, there has been no evidence that the generic drug products on the markethave been compromised, and the public can continue to us these products with con- fidence. APPROVED DRUG PRODUCTS WITH THERAPEUTIC EQUIVALENCE EVALUATIONS In order to contain drug costs, virtually all States have adopted laws that encour-age or mandate the substitution of less expensive therapeutically equivalent genericdrug products for prescribed brand-name drugs. These State laws generally requirethat substitution be limited to drugs on a specific list or that it be permitted for alldrugs except those prohibited by a particular list. In response to requests from theStates for FDA's assistance in preparing drug lists that would enable them to imple-ment their substitution laws, FDA published and continually updates the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations list. This list identifiescurrently marketed drug products approved on the basis of safety and effectiveness by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and provides information on all generic drugs that FDA had determined to be therapeutically equivalent to brand-name drugs. FDA believes that products considered to be therapeuticallyequivalent can be substituted with the full expectation that the substituted product will produce the same therapeutic effect as the prescribed product. The UnitedStates Pharmacopeia (USP) has distributed FDA's Approved Drug Products WithTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluation as a third volume to their USP Drug Informa-tion publications. This cooperative venture with the USP will greatly enhance theavailability of this FDA publication. HEALTH FRAUD Health fraud the promotion of false or unproven products or therapies for profit is big business. These fraudulent practices can be serious and often expensive problem for the elderly. In addition to economic loss, health fraud can also pose direct andindirect health hazards to those who are misled by the promise of quick and easycures and unrealistic physical transformations. In order to combat health fraud FDA uses a combination of enforcement and edu-cation. In each case, the Agency's decision on appropriate enforcement action isbased on considerations such as the health hazard potential of the violative product,the extent of the product's distribution the nature of any mislabeling that has oc-curred, and the jurisdiction of other agencies.302 FDA has developed a priority system of regulatory action based on three general categories of health fraud: direct health hazards indirect hazards, and economic frauds. When a direct health hazard is involved, FDA takes immediate action-sei- zure, injunction, or recall. When the fraud does not pose a direct health hazard, the FDA may choose to concentrate more on education and information efforts to alert the public. Both education and enforcement are enhanced by coalition building and cooperative efforts between Government and private agencies at the national State, and local levels. Also, evaluation efforts help ensure that our enforcement and edu- cation initiatives are correctly focused. The health fraud problem is too big and complex for any one organization to effec- tively combat by itself. Therefore, FDA is working closely with many other groups to build national and local coalitions to combat health fraud. By sharing and coordi- nating resources, the overall impact of our efforts to minimize health fraud will be significantly greater. FDA and other organizations have worked together to provide consumers with in- formation to help avoid health fraud. FDA and the Pharmaceutical Advertising Council (PAC) developed a public service campaign that uses all media to provide the public with information about how to recognize, avoid, and help stop health fraud. The public awareness campaign was so well received that FDA and PAC de- veloped another public service campaign which was distributed during 1988. In 1986 FDA worked with the National Association of Consumer Agency Adminis- trations (NACAA) to establish the ongoing project called the NACAA Health Prod- ucts and Promotions Information Exchange Network. Information from FDA, the Federal Trade Commi sion (FTC), the U.S. Postal Service (USPA) and State and local offices is provided to NACAA periodically for inclusion in the Information Ex- change Network. This system provides information on health products and promo- tions, consumer education materials for use in print and broadcast programs, and the names of individuals in each contributing agency to contact for additional infor- mation. In order to obtain better information on the nature of the health fraud problem, FDA worked with the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Plan- ning and Evaluation which contracted with Louis Harris and Associates to conduct a national health fraud survey in 1986. The survey provides the information to ef- fectively target and focus public and private sector activities developed to combat health fraud and is a reliable measure of the reasons why consumers have used varous fraudulent products. It also explores attitudes and beliefs with regard to these products. A report of the survey results became available in 1988. In September 1985, FDA, FTC, and USPS cosponsored a National Health Fraud Conference in Washington, DC. During 1986, as a follow-up to the national confer- ence, FDA held regional health fraud conferences in cities across the country. There were large audiences at most meetings, and the feedback was extremely positive. These local conferences served as the impetus to develop new and expand ongoing health fraud activities and form coalitions with State and local officials, community groups, and professional organizations. On March 13-15, 1988, FDA and St. Mary's Hospital of Kansas City, MO, cospon- sored a second National Health Fraud Conference in Kansas City. This conference was designed to provide practical instruction and guidance on how to combat health fraud at the national, State, and local levels. Through keynote speeches and focused workshops, attendees received information and materials that provide numerous in- sights on protecting consumers from false claims and promises. One of the more popular workshops was entitled, \"The Elderly as Targets of Health Fraud.\" In 1988 Consumer Affairs Officers (CAOs) again began conducting regional health fraud conferences. Conferences have been held in Wilkes-Barre, PA; Louisville, KY; Detroit, MI; Albany, NY; Jacksonville, Angeles, CA; Indianapolis, IN; and Chicago, IL. CAOs conducted other health fraud initiatives directed to elderly consumers, in- cluding presentations to groups of senior citizens, meetings, and exhibits. The fol- lowing are examples of these activities: the Los Angeles CAO helped screen exhibit applications for, and participated in, a \"Time of Your Life\" exposition attended by over 50,000 senior citizens: CA~a made presentations to groups of elderly in Puerto Rico, Michigan, Georgia, Florida, Indiana, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Missouri. The first event in FDA's campaign to combat health fraud in the Hispanic popula- tion was the 1989 National Health Fraud Conference of Puerto Rico held in San Juan on April 4-5, 1989. A workshop entitled \"Why Consumers Become Victims of Health Fraud; The Elderly As Victims of Health Fraud\" provided helpful insights into working with the elderly to reduce their risk of becoming victims of quackery.303 Members of the planning board, who included representatives of Senior CitizensHealth Promotion and Maintenance Program; Gerontology Program, School ofPublic Health-University of Puerto Rico; Governor's Office of Aging, and AARP,served as an advisory body for regional and local meetings held throughout PuertoRico. AuxnjARY TO THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION PROGRAM In 1984, 8 percent of the U.S. population 65 years and older were Black. Althoughdata on the health of the elderly population for race groups is very limited the datasuggests that, overall, the health of elderly Blacks is poorer than for elderly Whites.In general health care delivery to older people is fraught with a wide variety ofproblems: -poor communication between older patients and health professionals;-use of multiple drugs;-multiple providers; -altered drug action and response with advancing age;-inability to take the medication as prescribed; and-deliberate noncompliance. To focus attention on these intertwined problems, the Food and Drug Administra-tion and the Auxiliary to the National Medical Association (ANMA) are continuingwith a joint public awareness program which focuses on community-based patienteducation initiatives from a family perspective. Begun in fiscal year 1989, the program has the following goals:-develop a patient education and information program about prescription drugsespecially targeted to the Black community, with emphasis on the elderly;-train a cadre of volunteers as trainers at the national level to ultimately resultin a national network of volunteers; and-demonstrate the education information programs through tailored workshops inselect geographical locations among the leading 100 cities with highest concen-trations of Blacks, particularly the Black elderly.Recognizing the importance of not only enlightening senior citizens, but also es-tablishing support networks which ensure institutionalization at the communitylevel, FDA and ANMA chose the community based diffusion model of outreach tooptimize the chance for successful and lasting results. The planned outreach activi-ties for this program will when appropriate, involve other agencies, such as the Ad-ministration on Aging, which regularly interact with this population. 1987 OSTEOPOROSIS CONFERENCE On October 30, 1987, FDA's Office of Consumer Affairs sponsored a Special TopicConference on Osteoporosis. This conference was the first of a series of nationalevents to follow-up the 1986 National Conference on Women's Health where osteo-porosis was recognized as a serious public health problem with a particularly signifi-cant impact on women's health. According to statistics compiled by the National Osteoporosis Foundation, ap-proximately 20 million Americans-many of them older women-are affected bythis debilitating condition. While the cost of osteoporosis in terms of the quality oflife is immeasurable the cost in terms of health care and lost productivity rangesbetween $7 to $10 billion annually. For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration decided to examine the subjectmore comprehensively by sponsoring a national conference. The goals of the 1987Special Topic Conference were two-fold:-To focus national attention on the known risk factors associated with osteoporo-sis and the critical interventions that can be taken at difference phases of awomen's life to prevent or minimize the tragic impact of osteoporosis.-To assist health care providers, health educators, and the media to better dis-cern the knowns, unkowns, and unresolved issues related to the prevention, di-agnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. Building upon the scientific base established at the National Institutes of HealthResearch Workshop held earlier in the year the conference brought together recog-nized experts to translate the baseline of scientific findings into practical messagesfor the clinical management of patients, as well as for the education of women atvarious life stages. The conference was attended by 630 registrants representing diverse sectors of thepublic health community, including health care providers and public health educa-tors, consumers, industry, Federal and State government and women themselves304 from all parts of the country. The conference proceedings are expected to be avail- able in the spring of 1990. AcTiIvrrBs OF CONSUMERS AFFAIsRS OFIcERs Mammography, an x-ray examination of the breast used as a screening tool in the detection of breast cancer, is the best method currently available for detecting tumors in their early stages, offering women their best chance for survival. A variety of organizations such as the National Cancer Institute (NCI) have issued recommendations concerning when women should undergo mammography. All these organizations agree that all older women-over the age of 50-should be screened annually, but they differ concerning the age when women should be screening. To inform women and health care providers about mammography and the early detection of breast cancer the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Consumer Affairs and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health initiated an education campaign which focused on the need to select a quality mammography facility. Initially, directed to a mailing list of over 14,000 organizations and individuals representing the interests of women across the country, including Canada, a \"Dear Consumer\" letter and information package was mailed on April 14, 1988. Subse- quent to the mailing, feature articles on the topic of mammography appeared in a variety of lay and trade media that referred their readers to the FDA for more in- formation. Additional publicity and information dissemination was conducted by FDA's Con- sumer Affairs Officers, the Agency's educational arm in the field offices across the country. Thirty-four CAOs gave further outreach to these important health mes- sages by working with local and regional constituencies. Another endeavor which was conducted by Consumer Affairs Officers in the Southeastern Region of the country examined the impact of chronic diseases-a prevalent problem among older Americans-on low income and minority women. On January 29, 1988, FDA and the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service and Center for Continuing Education cosponsored a videoteleconference titled \"Women and Chronic Diseases: Reducing the Risk Factors.\" The teleconfer- ence focused on specific health problems that may increase illness and premature death in women, such as obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular heart disease, diabe- tes, and cancer. Originating in Athens, GA, the teleconference was satellite-broad- cast to approximately 60 sites around the Southeastern United States, reaching over 2,000 community leaders health care providers and educators who serve low income and minority women. A key component of the conference was to challenge the regis- trants to tailor the education messages to their constituents and implement pro- grams at the community level. In 1989, CAOs continued their efforts to reach consumers on issues important to the aging population by working through multiplier groups such as the Tennessee Commission on Aging, the California Hispanic Women's Health Society and the Na- tional Network of Hispanic Women. The Newark District Office co-sponsored a 2- day National Conference with the Gerontology Institute of New Jersey at Princeton, NH, addressing \"Nutritional Needs for the Elderly\" and \"Drug Abuse and Mismedi- cation in the Elderly.\" Medication use has been a concern in every region. The Cali- fornia Medication Coalition, Stanford University, and FDA sponsored a 1-day con- ference on \"Traditional and Non-Traditional Medication Use Among Ethnic Elders\" for over 300 geriatric educators and health care providers. Major health problems for the elderly such as the disturbing data on the potential danger of Enkaid and Tambocor for non-life-threatening arrhythmias were handled nationally through press releases and hotline calls and regionally through media appearances by CAOs and conference and personal contacts with multiplier groups. A story on hearing aid information placed by a CAO in a Florida newspaper generated over 1,000 requests for additional information. FOOD PROGRAMS FOR THE ELDERLY FDA has been involved in cooperative programs with the Health Care Financing Administration and the Administration on Aging (AoA) to help open lines of com- munication and training between personnel involved in food service programs for the elderly and State and local food officials. In addition to providing food handling training and seminars. FDA has participated in management training and certifica- tion in food protection sanitation. The Agency routinely makes available copies of its regulations and guidelines for use in the seminars.305 FOOD LABELING Nutrition information is of particular value to older persons many of whom are advised by their physicians to reduce consumption of salt/sodium and other food components. Thus, FDA's sodium initiatives program is especially useful to the el- derly population. FDA regulations concerning the declaration of sodium content andlabel claims for sodium content became effective July 1, 1986. These regulations have already resulted in greater availability of sodium information to those medical- ly advised to reduce sodium intake as well as to those voluntarily seeking to reduce or moderate sodium consumption. The regulations define terms such as \"low sodium,\" specifying the maximum levels of sodium that a serving of food may contain when the terms are used on product labels. These rules also require the declaration of the sodium content on food labels which contain nutrition information. Nutrition information is required if a processor adds nutrients to a product or makes nutritional claims about it. In ad-dition, the regulations provide for the voluntary inclusion of potassium content in- formation in nutrition labeling because people with kidney and some other diseases who must control their sodium intake must also control their potassium intake. Also, people with high blood pressure and other related health problems often usepotassium in place of sodium. Many major food manufacturers have voluntarily included sodium information on food labels since FDA sodium initiatives were begun in 1981. Sodium labeling has increased markedly; it is estimated that over half of the products regulated by FDA now carry sodium labeling. Older persons also are frequently medically advised to reduce their fat and choles-terol intake. A proposed regulation, published in the Federal Register of November 25, 1986, would define terms for the cholesterol content of foods and establish re- quirements for the inclusion of cholesterol as part of nutrition labeling when claimsare made relative to cholesterol content or fat content of a food. This proposal de- fines the term \"cholesterol free\" as applicable for any food containing less than 2mg cholesterol per serving \"low cholesterol\" for foods containing less than 20 mg cholesterol per serving and \"reduced cholesterol\" for a 75 percent reduction in cho-lesterol per serving. The Agency is also advising supermarket chains on appropriate fat and cholesterol shelf labeling initiatives and cooperating with the National Cho-lesterol Education Program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The older as well as younger population has strong interest in possible relation-ships between diet and health. Most consumers, but especially the elderly, are vul- nerable to misleading health claims about foods. FDA currently is considering waysto permit appropriate health claims on food labels that will not be misleading to consumers. A proposed regulation published in the Federal Register of August 4, 1987, describes the Agency's current position on this issue and requests commentsfrom all interested parties. Based on the growing body of evidence that diet has a major impact on the devel-opment of certain chronic diseases and interest on the part of the food industry, consumers, health professionals, and State and Federal legislative groups, FDA hasdetermined it is timely to consider revising food label requirements. Accordingly, an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on August 8 1989, requesting comments on whether to revise the requirements for nu-trition and ingredient labeling, whether to change the nutrition label format, andwhether to formally define commonly used food descriptors and/or reconsider theuse of standards of identity for foods. Four public hearings have also been held on these issues in which many older persons testified on the particular problems theyhave with current food labeling. ToTAL D=hr STUDIEs The Total Diet Study, as part of FDA's ongoing food surveillance system provides a means of identifying potential public health problems with regard to diet for theelderly and other age groups. Through the Total Diet Study, FDA is able to measure the levels of pesticide residues, industrial chemicals, toxic elements, and nutritional elements in selected foods of the U.S. food supply and to estimate the levels of thesesubstances in the diets of eight age-sex groups (6- to infants, 2-year-oldchildren, to 30-year-old females, 25- to 30-year-old males, 60- to 65-year old females, and 60- to 65-year-old males). Because the Total Diet Study is conducted yearly it also allows for the determina-tion of trends and changes in the levels of substances in the food supply and in daily diets.306 The Total Diet Study is being modified to reflect the lastest food consumption in- formation from the 1987-88 US. Department of Agriculture Nationwide Food Con- sumption Survey. The revision will also add about 15 more foods and will include data to calculate dietary exposures for men and women aged 70 and older. PO5TMARKET SURVEILLANCE OF FOODS AND FOOD ADDrrivEs The FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition receives and evaluates approximately 1,500 reports of adverse reactions to foods and food additives each year. Of the complainants who reported their age 12 percent were individuals over age 60. PROJECr ON CALORIC RESMICTION FDA is participating in research which could lead to significant insight into the relationship between dietary habits and life-span. The Project on Caloric Restriction (PCR) is a collaborative effort of FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA). It is designed to study whether a diet that is calorically restricted will add to the longevity and health of laboratory rats and mice. An increasing interest in the role of caloric restriction in aging cou- pled with the potential economic impact associated with health care was the impe- tus for the creation of the PCR. The extraordinary interest displayed by research groups across the country and the NCTR's commitment to the PCR project have produced a scientific environment conductive to the interchange of ideas and the formulation of new approaches to research in aging and toxicity. To effectively coordinate research being conducted in the diverse scientific disciplines, NCTR has developed a matrix which identifies areas of ongoing research, identifies additional research areas that need to be ad- dressed and helps to avoid duplication of research effort. Preliminary information suggests that calorically-restricted animals are living longer than animals on unrestricted diets and are exhibiting a reduced incidence of all forms of spontaneous toxicity. In other words, caloric restriction may dramatical- ly influence cancer development toxic response, and biological processes usually as- sociated with aging. MEDICAL DEVICES OF PARTIcULAR BENEFrr TO THE ELDERLY INTRAOCULAR LENSES Data on intraocular lenses (OLa) continue to demonstrate that a high proportion (85 to 95 percent) of the patients will be able to acheive 20/40 or better vision with the implanted lenses and that few (3 to 5 percent) will experience poor visual acuity (20/200 or worse). The data also demonstrate that the risks of experiencing a signifi: cant post-operative complication are not great. Furthermore many of the complica- tions result during the early post-operative period and are associated with cataract surgery; the incidence of these complications is generally not affected by TOL im- plantation. Approved lenses have a significant impact on the health of elderly pa- tients having surgery to remove cataracts. The 1OLa because they are safe and effec- tive aid elderly patients by increasing the options available to maintain their sight and thus their ability to drive and otherwise lead normal lives. The cost of IOL im- plantation is competitive with other available options, particularly when the con- tinuing cost of contact lens care accessories, such as cleaning and storage solutions, disinfection solutions, or heat disinfection units are considered. FDA continues to monitor several hundred investigational IOL models and has to date, approved over 900 models as having demonstrated safety and effectiveness. At the same time, FDA scientists are testing the optical quality of 1OLa being marketed as investigational devices. FDA studies will include measurements of focal length, resolving power, astigmatism, and image quality. This information will pro- vide a useful data base that can be factual in making decisions about optical quality of new IOL designs. Early test results show that the overall optical quality of cur- rently marketed IOLs is good. Due to.the large number of IOLa now available the situation that originally prompted concern from Congress and resulted in large adjunct investigations, no longer exists and the studies are in the process of being phased out over a 3-year period. An adjunct study is a clinical investigation peculiar to IOLs, which permits unlimited lOLa to be implanted under conditions requiring collection of adverse re- action data only. FDA permitted adjunct studies of IOLU in order to comply with provisions in the Medical Device Amendments created to ensure that lOLs would307 continue to be made \"reasonably available\" to physicians while data to support their safety and effectiveness were being collected. While the adjunct provisions have permitted widespread and immediate availability of new 1OLa, they have pro- vided little benefit from a safety monitoring of data collection perspective. In tact, the availability of large numbers of IOLU through the adjunct study has provided a disincentive to firms to collect, analyze, and submit data to FDA in support of a premarket approval application. FDA is now in the third year of the 3-year transition to terminate these studies which have outlived their usefulness. Appropriate precautions are being taken not to disrupt normal ophthalmic are in the process. PACEMAKERS Dysfunction of the electrophysiology of the heart can develop with age, be caused by disease or result from surgery. People with this condition can suffer from faint- ing, dizziness, lethargy, heart flutter and a variety of similar discomforts or ills. Even more serious life-threatening conditions such as congestive heart failure or fi- brillation can occur. The modern pacemaker is designed to supply stimulating electrical pulses when needed to the upper or lower chambers of the heart or with some newer models, both. It has corrected many pathological symptoms for a large number of people. Approximately half a million elderly persons have pacemakers. At present, an es- timated 125,000 pacemakers are implanted annually, 30 percent being replacements. An estimated 75 percent of these are for persons 65 years of age or older. Without pacemakers, some of these people would not have survived. Others are protected from life-threatening situations and, or most, the quality of life has been improved. FDA, in carrying out its responsibilities of ensuring the safety and efficacy of car- diac pacemakers, has classified the pacemaker as a Class III medical device. Devices in Class m must undergo stringent testing requirements and FDA review before ap- proval is granted for marketing. In addition, FDA in conjunction with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) of the Department of Health and Human Services has instituted a national registry of cardiac pacemaker devices and leads. HCFA and FDA have developed an operational registry with a data base of approximately 500,000 pacemaker and lead entries to date. Physicians and providers of health care services must submit information to a na- tional cardiac pacemaker registry if they request Medicare payment for implanting, removing, or replacing permanent pacemakers and pacemaker leads. The final rule implementing the national registry was published by FDA and HCFA in the July 23, 1987, Federal Register and became effective on September 21, 1987. Under this new rule, physicians and providers of services must supply specified information for the pacemaker registry each time they implant, remove, or replace a pacemaker or pacemaker lead in a Medicare patient; HCFA may deny Medicare payment to those who fail to submit the required data. The information is submit- ted to HCFA's fiscal intermediaries at the same time as the bill for services and HCFA relays the data to FDA. Health care providers may obtain forms for submit- ting the information from the fiscal intermediaries. FDA plans to use the data from the registry to monitor the long-term clinical per- formance of pacemakers and leads. FDA will use the registry data, along with infor- mation received under the Medical Device Reporting regulation to track failures or defects in certain models of pacemakers and leads and notify HCFA so they may stop Medicare payments for those products. The required information includes: -The name of the manufacturer, the model and serial number of the pacemaker or pacemaker lead, and the warranty expiration date. -The patient's name and health insurance claim number, the provider number, and the date of the procedure. -The names and identification numbers of the physicians ordering and perform- ing the surgery. When a pacemaker or lead is removed or replaced, the physician or provider must also submit the date of initial implantation (if known), and indicate whether the device that was replaced was left in the body and, if not, whether the device was returned to the manufacturer. HEMODIALYSIS End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients are totally dependent upon dialysis treatment for survival until they receive a transplant, or if that is not possible, for308 the remainder of their lives. Moreover, ESRD is a disease of the elderly. Recent data released by the Renal Data System indicated that the median age adjusted for age and sex for new ESRD patients in 1987 was 60, with 38.2 percent over 64. Because of the nature of the treatment, patients are vulnerable to a number of possible hazards during dialysis. Many of the hazards arise from failure to properly maintain and use the equipment, or from insufficient attention to the safety of the dialysis system components. Educational programs are being conducted in several areas to alleviate these problems. Following the success of the educational video on human factors in hemodialysis described in last year's report, FDA in conjunction with organizations such as the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA), the Renal Physicians Associa- tion (RPA), and the American Nephrology Nurses' Association (ANNA), have been active in -developing several additional videos and manuals. In addition, FDA has issued a safety alert after an incident in which several patients became ill in a facil- ity due to the contamination of the water supply used to prepare dialysate. The safety alert was issued to all dialysis centers in the country and warned per- sonnel and water service contractors of the potential for serious injury to patients if dialysis water treatment filters preserved with sodium azide are not rinsed through- ly before use. The alert emphasized that all newly installed filters in a dialysis must be ade- quately rinsed before use since other preservatives used in manufacturing the filters (such as formaldehyde and sodium bisulfite) are also toxic. Studies have consistently shown that water used in dialysis facilities to prepare dialysate has not always been adequately treated. Because of the concern that the level of known or suspected toxins is increasing due to the increasing pollution,.and that the increasing level of contaminants can affect patient well-being. FDA initiat- ed a contract with the Regional Kidney Disease Program (RKDP) of the Minneapolis Medical Research Foundation to develop a manual describing optimal treatment procedures for water used in dialysis. The manual which has been published dis- cusses each component of the water treatment system, including its purpose, faults and advantages over other methods, the contaminants removed and the conse- quences of improperly treated water. It also contains information that hemodialysis facilities can use in their interactions with water treatment vendors. A complimen- tary copy of the manual is being distributed to all dialysis facilities in the country. As companion to the water treatment manual an educational video on water treatment was also completed this year. The video entitled, \"Water Treatment in Hemodialysis\" discusses the problems that could be experienced by patients with in- adequate treatment of water used to prepare dialysate and how proper water treat- ment equipment, properly maintained, can prevent untoward reactions in ESRD pa- tients especially in the elderly who may be more sensitive to the chemical and bio- logical contamination of the water supply. This video has been distributed to all di- alysis facilities in the country and has gotten many favorable comments from the dialysis community. A second video completed this year is entitled, \"Infection Control in Hemodialy- sis.\" The video emphasizes universal precautions as they relate to prevention of blood-borne infection transmission in the dialysis setting. The video alerts the health care providers and patients to infection control protocols and techniques, par- ticularly with respect to hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The video takes a common sense approach to the infection control issues of most concern to people involved in dialysis. The video has been completed and should be distributed to every dialysis facility in the country early in 1990. The FDA in conjunction with RPA and other concerned groups is working on an additional video on the reuse of hemodialyzers. The video will follow the protocols detailed in the Association for -the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation's (AAMI) Recommended Practice for the Reuse of Hemodialyzers which have been adopted by the Health Care Financing Administration (HFCA) as a condition of cov- erage to ESRD providers that practice reuse. It is expected that the video will be completed early in 1990 and distributed to all dialysis centers by the summer. A multi-State study conducted for the FDA in 1987 indicated that dialysis facili- ties appeared to be deficient in Quality Assurance (QA) techniques used in water treatment, dialysate concentrate handling and dilution and the reuse of disposables. The study concluded that the incorporation of effective QA programs in dialysis fa- cilities could help to control the incidence of infection among patients and staff as well as improved patient outcome through improved quality of care. To meet this need, FDA initiated a contract to develop guidelines that can be used by dialysis personnel in establishing QA programs. The project has been funded for FY 1989309 and FY 1990. The contract is expected to be completed at the end of calendar year1990 or early 1991. BLOOD GLUCOSE MONORS Recent publications estimae the number of diagnosed diabetics in the UnitedStates to be 5 million and increasing at a rate of 600,000 per year. Over 65 percentof diabetics are 55 years older and, of course many must monitor their blood glu-cose. Since the implementation of Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations in De-cember 1984, approximately 2,200 reports were submitted to the FDA regarding per-formance problems encountered by users of self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG)systems. As a result of these findings, a project was initiated to study and providesolutions to the problems with use of these devices. The study is being conducted infour phases: (1) information/data analysis, including labeling, instructional andtraining materials; (2) identification of problems and contributing factors, includingthe use of data obtained by survey, contract, scientific literature, laboratory testingand MDR submissions; (3) develoment of a strategy for corrective action(s); and (4)implementation of corrective actions that could include assistance and collaborationwith interested organizations. An SMBG Task Force consistin of CDRH staff mem-bers who have had prior experience or are currently involv in matters pertinentto this important health care issue, is responsible for implementing this taskA team of six CDRH staff reviewed 45 pieces of SMBG labeling (user manuals,summary instructions, and package inserts for reagent strips, lancing devices cali-bration and control materials) that accompany blood glucose devices sold over thecounter for use by diabetics. The review focused on (1) whether step-by-step instruc-tions and other information are presented in a way the facilitates understanding; (2)if illustrations are used and are accurate, clear, and well formatted; (3) if importantinformation such as key tasks to be performed and cautionary statements are ade-quately emphasized using highlighting techniques; (4) the adequacy of print sizeused; and (5) if grade reading levels at which the information is written (based onapplication of the SMBG Grading Formula) are adequate for users.Currently in process is the Human Factors Analysis of Blood Glucose Monitorscontract. The study will: -determine if operation and instructional materials of blood glucose meters iscompatible with users' abilities-determine if the features of blood glucose meters contribute to user error; and-determined the quality and quantity of instructional material available tometer users for learning proper meter operation. Certainly, the limitations of the elderly, e.g., slowed response time, deficientvision, etc. are important considerations in properly using gluscose meters. Thestudy will be looking at all of these issues. HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) provides leadershipand direction to programs and activities designed to improve health services and re-sources for people in the United States, particularly those who are underserved. Aspart of the Public Health Service, HRSA has leadership responsibility for generalhealth service and resource issues relating to access, equity, quality and cost of care.These responsibilities are carried out by the Bureau of Health Professions, Bureauof Health Care Delivery and Assistance, Bureau of Maternal and Child Health andResources Development, and components of the Office of the Administrator.HRSA pursues its objectives by supporting States and communities in their effortsto plan, organize and deliver health care, especially to underserved area residentsmigrant workers, mothers and children, the elderly, and other groups with specialneeds; participating in the campaign against AIDS; providing leadership in address-ing the issues and unique problems related to health care services in rural areas;providing leadership in improving the supply, quality, education, distribution andutlization of health professionals; increasing the number of minorities in the healthprofessions; administering the organ transplant program; providing direct personalhealth services for Hansen's Disease patients and other designated beneficiaries;monitoring developments affecting health facilities and ensuring that previouslyaided institutions honor their commitments to provide uncompensated care; assur-ing that employee and workplace health factors that increase the Federal Govern-ment's productivity and decrease its liability are raised to the highest practicallevel; and developing working relationships with the private sector which will en-hance and extend program efforts.310 HRSA is concerned about training our Nation's professionals to provide care for today's older individuals and individuals who will be old in the future. The Agency provides services to underserved older Americans, such as those who live in rural areas and those with low incomes. One-third of older Americans live in rural areas. One out of four elderly Americans, or 7.4 million, are poor or near poor. Several HRSA components significantly influence programs and activities that benefit older Americans, while the HRSA Committee on Aging-Related Issues serves as the focal point within the Agency. HRSA CoMMrrFEE ON AGING-RELATED IssuEs The rapidly expanding population is of particular importance to HRSA because of the implications concerning general health service and resource issues as they relate to access, equity, quality, and cost of care. The Committee, established in De- cember 1987 by the Administrator, has representatives from all Bureaus and compo- nents of the Office of the Administrator. It is charged with broad-based responsibil- ities, including providing advice to the Administrator, improving the awareness of all HRSA employees concerning aging-related issues, providing a forum within the Agency for sharing information, and developing a plan to increase the relevance and accessibility of HRSA programs to aging Americans. The Committee assumes responsibility for the annual celebration of Older Ameri- cans Month. In 1989 the celebration included a Colloquium presentation on health promotion and aging. The Committee developed \"A Profile of HRSA Programs That Benefit Older Americans.\" It responded to over 100 requests for this publication. The Committee coordinates the implementation of the Memorandum of Under- standing between AoA and HRSA, which has five major objectives: (1) Supporting States and communities in the development of improved health care systems for serving older adults; (2) promoting expanded education and training opportunities for health care personnel; (3) collaborating with the private sector to improve health and health care for the elderly; (4) promoting the maintenance, improvement, and expansion of health services for older persons in rural areas; and (5) supporting model programs for older AoA and HRSA employees and for employees providing care to older family members. Progress for objectives 1-4 appear in subsequent sec- tions. For objective 5, HRSA management is implementing a comprehensive plan to assist employees caregivers. It was publicized in The HRSA Chronicle: Special Issue on Eldercare, which was distributed to all employees. Included are dissemination of the findings of the HRSA Survey of Caregiving Responsibilities (e.g., approximately one-half of respondents are caregivers, one-half provide care to an individual living at a distance, three-fourths are in managerial/professional positions, two-thirds are women); distribution of the Inventory of The HRSA Older Adult Resource Center, listing over 100 items on health promotion and caregiving; information on flexitime and other leave opportunities helpful to caregivings; and a description of services provided through the Employee Assistance Program. Members of the Committee work closely with other Federal agencies and the pri- vate sector. They are engaged in a variety of interagency activities, such as the Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, Ad Hoc Interagency Committee on Research on Aging and DHHS Council on Alzheimers Disease. They were involved in the devel- opment of health promotion objectives for the Year 2000 and the implementation of the recommendations of the Surgeon General's Workshop on Aging. BUREAU OF HEALTH CARE DELIvERY AND AssisTANcE The Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance (BHCDA) helps assure that primary helath care services are provided to persons living in medically under- served areas and to persons with special health care needs. It also assists States and communities in arranging for the placement of health professionals to provide care in health personnel shortages areas. The Bureau provides services to older Ameri- cans primarily through Community and Migrant Health Centers (C/MHCs or Cen- ters), the National Health Service Corps, the Home Health Demonstration Program, and The Health Care for the Homeless Program. -In fiscal year 1989, a total of 550 C/MHCs, located in medically underserved areas, provided a range of family-oriented, preventive, primary case managed care services to those who would otherwise lack access to care, particularly the poor and minorities. Approximately 5 million people were served, of which over 9 percent (or about 470,000) were age 65 or older. The cooperative program between the Bureau and the Administration on Aging (AoA) is near completion. The purpose of the collaborative project is to311 improve the delivery of primary health care to older persons by establishinglinkages among area agencies on aging (AAAs), community and migrant healthcenters, and other types of health care agencies. Training was given to AoA andPrimary Care Association (PCA) staff to assist them in developing statewideplans for health services to the elderly. An evaluation of the training thatbegan in fiscal year 1989, will be completed in the Spring, 1990. The HRSA and AoA have conducted an evaluation of the activities under thecollaborative project. The evaluation produced case studies on the development of linkages between the PCAs and the AAAs and statewide planning efforts.Findings of the case studies showed that financial barriers, particularly obtain-ing third party reimbursements from Medicare, were the major impediments toincreasing elderly participation in C/MHCs. With respect to Medicare, theseCenters indicated serveral barriers, such as the following: the level ofreimbursement is not enough to cover costs of care, the cost of procesing is toohigh relative to reimbursement, and administrators, in some instances, are notfully knowledgeable about processing for reimbursement. The evaluation also indicated the desirability and acceptability of the link- ages by the state, local and federal agencies. Most of the AAAs and PCAs in-volved in the case studies have adopted agreements to improve the acceptabilityof services to the elderly by more thoroughly refining and marketing the serv- ices. The revised final report will include both an analysis of collaboration ef-forts, and a manual on enhancing Medicare reimbursement to community andmigrant health centers. These documents will be useful to C/MHCs, AoA andothers interested in collaborating on enhanced services for the elderly.-The National Health Service Corps places physicians, dentists, nurse practic-tioners and other health professionals in health personnel shortage areas. OlderAmericans with special health needs and reduced mobility need primary careproviders close at hand. The Corps works closely with C/MHCs, the IndianHealth Service, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and other Federal agencies toprovide assistance in recruiting and retaining health personnel for populationsin need. Physical therapy, high blood pressure screening, stroke prevention andnutrition counseling are among the services provided to the elderly. -In fiscal year 1989, through the Health Care for the Homeless Program, pri-mary health care, outreach, substance abuse, mental health and case manage-ment services were provided to 231,000 homeless individuals, of which 3 percentwere aged. -The Health Care in the Home Demonstration Program is targeted for low- income, highly vulnerable individuals who can avoid lengthy stays in hospitaisand other institutions. The Bureau has awarded $2.47 million in second funding for this 3-year demonstration program. A multidisciplinary team approach is acentral feature of the five-State program. The following is a detailed descriptionof the project. Project.-Health Care Services in the Home Demonstration 10/1/88-9/30/91 The Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance awarded $2.47 million in thesecond year of continuation funding under the Health Care in the Home ServicesAct. This amount totals $7.2 million for a 2 year total. The project is continuing to demonstrate that those low-income, uninsured indi-viduals at high risk for multiple hospitalizations or institutionalization can best bemedically served in the home. The project has awarded funds to five State granteeagencies (Hawaii, Utah, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Mississippi) to demon-strate and evaluate the Program. The grantees have identified eligible recipients toparticipate in the program. At least 25 percent of those who will receive care will be65 years or older. The demonstration program is oriented toward case management and service de-livery. The multidisciplinary team approach remains as the primary focus of theprogram. It involves a comprehensive continuum of efficient, effective, and qualita-tive home care provided by a team of health professionals appropriate for each pa-tient case. In the first year of funding, the grantees emphasized the design of their specificprogram. Primary focus had been on formalization and start-up costs associatedwith a new program. The second year of funding will primarily entail the imple-mentation of services. The grantees have contracted to area home health agencies toprovide skilled medical services or related health services. A contract for the Demonstration program valuation over the entire 3 years hasbeen awarded. The evaluator is responsible for data collection and analysis topermit a comparative review of the program. A second year technical assistance312 contract to provide assistance to the grantees for program development and imple- mentation will be awarded by early 1990. Two of the grantees are working with their State Council on Aging to develop case management, which focuses on the interdisciplinary approach to needs assess- ment, care planning, service delivery and evaluation. This collaborative effort will also identify clients with risk factors for program eligibility. The coordination of services by case management will insure integration of services to meet the total needs of the patient. Additionally, the grantees have developed specific quality as- surance plans and controls for efficiency and cost-effectiveness of their programs. The Health Care in the Home Services Act program is demonstrating a State-ad- ministered centrally financed and locally operated public and private system of pro- viding, coordinating, monitoring, and evaluating a service delivery for in-home health and long-term care services. BUREAU OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS The Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr) provides national leadership to improve the training, distribution, utilization, and quality of personnel required to staff the Nation's health care delivery system. BHPr assesses the supply of and requirements for the Nation's health professionals and develops and administers programs to meet those requirements. It also collects and analyzes data and disseminates infor- mation on the characteristics and capacities of health professions production sys- tems. The Bureau develops, tests, and demonstrates new and improved approaches to the development and utilization of health personnel within various patterns of health care delivery and financing systems. BHPr provides financial support to in- stitutions and individuals for health professional education programs, administers Federal grant programs for targeted health personnel development and utilization, and provides technical assistance to national, State, and local agencies, organiza- tions, and institutions for the development, production, utilization, and evaluation of health personnel. These activities are carried out under the legislative authorities of Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. Fiscal year 1989 program activities contributing to the development of profession- al personnel to provide health care to the aged included: (1) Activities under training authorities targeted specifically for geriatric and gerontological education; (2) Activities under training authorities for primary care, nursing, and other health professionals where geriatric training may be provided as part of a broader educational emphasis; and (3) Data collection, studies and other activities aimed at assessing and enhanc- ing the qualifications of future health care providers to respond to the needs of the aged. TARGETED SUPPORT FOR GERIATRICS Thirty-eight Geriatric Education Centers (GECs) received grants under section 789(a) and Section 301 of the PHS Act, an authority which specifically authorizes geriatric training. Many centers are consortia or other organizational arrangements involving several academic institutions, a broad range of health professions schools, and a variety of clinical facilities. The Centers are based at the following institutions: University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY; University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR; Hunter Col- lege Jointly with Research Foundation of CUNY, New York, NY; Temple Universi- ty, Philadelphia, PA; University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Virginia Com- monwealth University, Richmond, VA; University of Alabama at Birmingham, Bir- mingham, AL; University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS; University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY; University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; University of South Florida, Tampa, FL; Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC; Duke University, Durham, NC; University of Miami, Miami, FL; Case Western Re- serve University, Cleveland, OH; Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI; Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine, Chicago, IL; Michigan State University, East Lan- sing, MI; University of Illinois, Chicago, IL; University of Minneapolis, MN; Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX; Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA; University of Oklaho- ma, Oklahoma City, OK; University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM; University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA; Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE; Uni- versity of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND; Stanford University, Stanford, CA; University of Southern California, Los Angeles,313 CA; University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI; University of California, Los An- geles, CA; University of California, LaJolla, CA; University of Washington, Seattle, WA; and Oregon Health Science Center, Portland, OR. Awards for these 38 GECs totaled $10.6 million for fiscal year 1989. Funding for fiscal year 1990 under Section 789(a) is expected to be approximately $10 million. These Centers are educational resources providing multidisciplinary geriatric train- ing for health professions faculty, students, and professionals in allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, occupational and physical ther- apy, podiatric medicine, optometry, social work and related allied and public or com- munity health disciplines. They provide comprehensive services to the health profes- sions educational community within designated geographic areas. Activities includefaculty training and continuing education for practitioners in the disciplines listed above. The Centers also provide technical assistance in the development of geriatriceducation programs and serve as resources for educational materials and consulta- tion. Awards were made in FY 1989 for the second year in the grant program entitled, \"Faculty Training Projects in Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry,\" authorized under Section 789(b). There were 23 continuation awards totaling $3.1 million. These awards provided geriatric faculty training experiences for 38 physician participantsand 26 dental participants through 1-year or 2-year fellowship programs and/or 1- year retraining projects. The training content included teaching skills, administra-tive and research skills as well as clinical geriatrics. GERIATRIC AcTWvITIEs SUPPORTED UNDER BROADER TRAINING AUTHoRrITsS The Bureau's Division of Associated and Dental Health Professions funds educa-tion projects for a wide array of health providers. The General Dentistry traininggrant program currently supports 28 postdoctoral residency and advanced education programs in dentistry, which include training opportunities to provide dental care to the elderly. In awarding those grants, a funding priority was given to applicants who proposed to further expand and improve the geriatric training components oftheir postdoctoral programs. Eighty-four percent of the approved general dentistryapplicants addressed the special geriatric training priority. A working group of practicing and academic health professionals was convened toaddress issues concerning geriatric training as it relates to public health profession- als. The group developed a short-term intensive curriculum which is to be pre-tested and then implemented for use by public health personnel. The intent of this project is to develop a prototype curriculum which will serve providers responsible for serv- ices to future geriatric populations. Copies of the curriculum module will be madeavailable to schools and health agencies during the coming fiscal year. The grant program of Interdisciplinary Training for Health Care for Rural Areas has as its goal improving access to health care for the residents of rural communi-ties. A funding priority for this grant program wil be given to applicants who in- clude curriculum elements that address the uniqueness of health conditions and theethnic/cultural characteristics of the populations within the rural areas wheretraining/service is occurring. This provision includes the health of older Americans. Another new grant program, Special Project Grant Program to Schools of PublicHealth, has identified geriatric training and education issues as an area for special consideration. Under section 788(b), The Model Education Projects programs are intended to pro- vide for the development and implementation of model projects in areas such as fac-ulty and curriculum development and the development of new clinical training sites. This program proposes incorporation of programs sensitive to the needs of spe-cial populations, including the chronically ill and the aged. Funding priority is pro- posed for applications that plan to develop educational models pertaining to health care of minority elderly. Allied Health Special Project Grants under section 796 have several purposes re- lated to the aged: number 2-\"to improve and expand enrollment in professions with greatest demand and most needed by elderly\"; number 3-\"interdisciplinarytraining programs that promote allied health in geriatrics and rehabilitation of el- derly\"; number 5-\"adding and strengthening allied health curriculums in preven- tion and health promotion, geriatrics, long-term care, home health and hospice care, and ethics.\" FISCAL YEAR 1989 DIVISION OF MEDICINE GERIATRIC AcIVITIFS The Division of Medicine continues to support a significant number of grantees for their educational and training program activities in geriatrics. A total of314 $5,734,230 was awarded specifically for these efforts, which are estimated to impact the training of 3,335 individuals and a population of approximately 298,164. Twenty-seven predoctoral grantees and 113 graduate program grantees under sec- tion 876(a)-Family Medicine Training-indicated that they are actively involved in the development, implementation and evaluation of their geriatrics curriculum and training. Twenty-three of the residency program grantees received funds totaling $1,481,819 specifically for developing and enhancing geriatrics curriculum and train- ing. These awards ranged between $13,150 and $135,090, the largest going to the University of Connecticut for expansion of the training in geriatric medicine. In ad- dition, 33 faculty development programs reported that they provided geriatrics training. Eight of the section 780 Family Medicine Departments program grantees have established a geriatrics component, and $403,025 was awarded specifically for this purpose. Under section 784, the General Internal Medicine and General Pediatrics Residen- cy Training programs reported 30 grantees who provided geriatric medicine training to approximately 186 residents. A total of $136,140 was awarded to five of the pro- grams for their efforts. In addition to graduate training, 2 grantees under the facul- ty development program indicated that their geriatric emphasis would impact about 38 faculty, but no specific funds were received for these activities. The Area Health Education Center (AHEC) program (section 781) awarded a total of $661,305 to the 13 AHECs which indicated emphasis in geriatric education. These educational and training activities will benefit an estimated population of 298,164 (including trainees). Five of the awards were for special initiatives which included developing geriatric personnel certification programs and training in health promo- tion/disease prevention in older individuals. All 37 Physician Assistant Training program grantees have instituted training ac- tivities in geriatrics. Funds in the amount of $106,291 were awarded among 11 of the grantees specifically for their efforts in this area. An estimated 1,774 trainees will be impacted. Nine grantees receiving support for Podiatric Primary Care Residency Training under the new section 788(e) authority have included curricular emphasis in geriat- ric health which will benefit an estimated 72 residents. These grantees received a total of $145,650 for this purpose. Under the program for Faculty Training Projects in Geriatric Medicine and Den- tistry (section 789(b)), 23 grantees received a total of $3,100,000 to provide geriatric faculty training experiences for 38 physician participants and 26 dental partici- pants. DIVISION OF NURSING The Division of Nursing administers grants awarded through four programs:. (1) Advanced Nurse Education, (2) Nurse Practitioner and Nurse-Midwifery, and (3) Special Projects. The fourth program provides traineeship funds to schools which al- locate these funds to individual full-time master's and postmaster's nursing students who are preparing to be administators, educators, researchers, nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists, or other type of nurse specialist. Activities relating to the aging in each of the first three programs during FY 1989 include the following. Advanced Nurse Education Programs -The Advanced Nurse Education authority supported 10 grants totaling $1,554,004 for gerontological and geriatric nursing concentrations in programs leading to a master's or doctoral degree in nursing. Nurse Practitioner and Nurse-Midwifery Program -Thirteen master's or postmaster's gerontological nurse practitioner programs received grant support totaling $1,460,069. -Twenty-three family nurse practitioner master's programs which contain con- tent related to care of older persons, were funded through grants in the amount of $3,676,727. -Two OB/GYN and one women's health nurse practitioner master's programs, which contain content related to care of women from young adult through old age, received grant support totaling $307,654.315 Special Projects Program The Special Project grant program supported 21 projects, amounting to $2,312,811, which were related to gerontological nursing. Additionally, through an interagency agreement with the National Institute on Aging $100,000 were provided to assist in carrying out a project which is identifying health care behaviors practiced by com- munity-based elderly. In FY 1989, $2,412,811 was spent on projects with a primary geriatric focus. The Nursing Shortage Reduction and Education Extension Act of 1988 requires that 20 percent of program funds ($2,370,800 in FY 1989) be utilized for projects dealing with geriatric nursing. The grants are supporting efforts in the community as well as institutions. Three of the activities target minority groups including rural black elderly females, a Navajo patient/family teaching program, and a project to teach Indian nursing home personnel. Several projects address continuing education for registered nurses and other nursing personnel while others combine clinical experience with elderly in rural settings. OTHER AcTIVITIs HRSE and AoA developed a plan to jointly disseminate gerontological curriculum materials to universities and other training institutions. A letter signed by HRSA and AoA officials accompanies disseminated materials. Lists of AoA National Resource Centers and active AoA grants were distributed to the HRSA GECs. Materials about the GECs were sent to the AoA Resource Cen- ters. OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH PoLIcY The Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) serves as the focal point within the De- partment for coordinating nationwide efforts to strengthen and improve the deliv- ery of health services to populations in rural areas. In particular, the Office advises the Secretary on the effects that the Medicare and Medicaid programs have on access to health care by rural populations, especially with regard to financial viabil- ity of small rural hospitals and the recruitment and retention of health profession- als; coordinates rural health activities within the Department and with other Feder- al agencies, States, national organizations, private associations and foundations; ad- ministers a national grant program that establishes rural health research centers; provides staff assistance to the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health; and ensures that the Department invests adequate resources into research projects on rural health issues. Aging-related issues are of particular importance to the Office of Rural Health Policy. One-third of the Nation's elderly live in rural areas and rural countries have, on the average, a higher percentage of their population over 65 years of age than their urban counterparts. These demographics create a situation in which rural hospitals, because they are increasingly dependent upon admissions of the el- derly (i.e., Medicare beneficiaries), are especially vulnerable to the PPS payment for- mula. Activities and initiatives of the ORHP which affect the rural elderly include: -providing an impact analysis to the Health Care Financing Administration on proposed and final regulations which are expected to have a significant impact on small rural hospitals and the rural elderly that they serve; -coordinating activities with the Bureau of Health Professions and the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance relating to the development and utiliza- tion of rural health professionals. -meeting with personnel in other Federal agencies (e.g., the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Agency) to work on issues which affect the health and health care access of rural elderly; and -apprising interest groups, such as the National Council on the Aging and the American Association of Retired Persons, about ORHP and its activities. The Subcommittee on Health Services of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health designated the needs of the rural elderly as one of three priority areas at its first meeting. In 1989 the Office awarded grants to five rural health research centers to conduct applied research, case studies and analyses focusing on the delivery, financing, orga- nization, and management of rural health and care services. The Centers will pro- vide data and policy research capabilities on a wide range of rural health concerns, 26-386 0 -90 -11316 including areas relevant to the elderly. The Office is also responsible for developinga rural health clearinghouse for the collection and distribution of rural health infor-mation. The clearinghouse will be implemented in 1990.The grants were awarded to: Rural Health office of the Arizona Health EducationCenter, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson; Health Services Re-search Center University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Center for Rural HealthServices, Policy and Research, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks; WAMIRural Health Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle; and MarshfieldMedical Research Foundation, Marshfield, Wisconsin. Awards for these five ruralhealth research centers totaled $1.186 million for fiscal year 1989.317 ACTIVE CONTRACTS UNDER TITLE VII AND VIII OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT Project Funding rY 1989 240-89-005 University of California, Los Angeles 405 Hilgard Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90024-1406 \"'Study of the Adequacy of the Supply of Geriatric Faculty at all Level-. ,f Medical Education\" Brenda Selser (301) 443-6785 12/29/88-12/29/89 S169,568 This study will compile and analyze information on the adequacy of the current and future supply of geriatric faculty at all levels of medical education, i.e., undergraduate, residency, fellowship and continuing medical education, needed to prepare practitioners to meet the essential health care needs of the elderly.

INTRODUCrION Aging research is entering an era of unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Because no single process explains the multiple and interacting changes that occur with age, the Federal Government, through the National Institute on Aging (NIA), implements a dynamic research program that identifies promising clues to many of the biomedical, social, and behavioral changes associated with age. Simultaneously, the Institute supports applied research efforts leading to interventions that have the potential to ameliorate the consequences of such common problems as falls and uri- nary incontinence. Of equal importance, the Institute recognizes its role as a leader in aging research by supporting an active training and career development effort. NIA has a major interest in the diagnosis, treatment, and cure of Alzheimer's dis- ease, as well as in investigations into the basic mechanisms of aging; reducing frac- tures in frail older people; researching health and effective functioning in old age; improving long-term care; fostering an increased understanding of aging needs for special populations; and improving career development training opportunities in geriatrics and aging research. Other NIH institutes also support research on aging or aging-related concerns. Principal among these are the National Cancer Institute (NCI); the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI); the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR); the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS); the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID); the National Eye Institute (NEI); the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease (NIAMS); the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD); the Division of Research Resources (DRR); the National Center for Nursing Research (NCNR); and the Office of the Director (OD). II. CuRRENT RESEARCH AND PRIORITES A. ALzHEEMER'S DISEASE Since the mid 1970's, research on Alzheimer's disease has become a high priority for the Nation. As it has become increasingly apparent that \"senility\" is not a normal part of aging, investigators from many fields of science have begun to study what causes this disease, and how it can be diagnosed, treated, and perhaps some- day, cured. The search for the cause of Alzheimer's disease has focused on the role of genes, toxins, infectious agents, head trauma, stress, and changes in the immune system, the endocrine system, and normal metabolic processes. Scientists are looking at each of these as possible leads to what causes Alzheimer's disease, either alone or in combination. Others are exploring the possibility that the risk of Alzheimer's dis- ease might be increased by age-related changes in a healthy brain. The purpose of this report is to review current research on the prevalence of Alz- heimer's disease, the mechanisms of the disease, and therapies and strategies that have been proposed for patients and their families. In reporting on the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease we will demonstrate that this is a growing public health prob- lem with worldwide impact. In focusing on the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, we hope to turn the power of the microscope up and examine the fundamental ques- tions that scientists are struggling with in their research on the aging brain. In looking at therapies, we will review some of the latest experimental drugs. The highlights presented here represent only a sample of the NIH research on Alzheimer's disease that is supported or conducted by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the National Lstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the National In- stitute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the Division of Research Resources (DRR), and the National Center for Nursing Research (NCNR). Within the Federal Govern- ment, research on Alzheimer's disease is also supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Administration on Aging, the Health Care Financing Adminis- tration, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Veterans Administration.323 1. AMA Research Advances Scientists Revise Estimates on Prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease Although the exact numbers are not known, studies done in the mid 1970's esti- mated that 2.5 million older Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Now, NIA- supported scientists in East Boston, MA have given us reason to believe that the current number may be closer to 4 million, and that this figure may double or triple in the next century if more is not done to cure or prevent the disease. Beginning in 1982, Dr. Denis Evans and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School conducted a census of 32,000 people living in East Boston, a well-defined, stable, working-class community. More than 80 percent of the 4,485 residents over age 65 then participated in the first stage of examination by responding to a questionnaire concerning medical and social problems, and by taking a brief memory test. Of these, 467 were selected for more extensive evaluation to rule out the presence of conditions other than Alzheimer's disease. The evaluation included a neurological examination, a brief psychiatric evaluation, laboratory tests, a brief review of medi- cal history, and review of current medications. What Dr. Evans and his colleagues found was that more than 10 percent of the people over age 65 had probable Alzheimer's disease, and the prevalence of the dis- ease rose more rapidly with age than previously suspected. Of those people between the ages of 65 and 74 years, 3 percent had probable Alzheimer's disease, as com- pared to 18.7 percent in the age 75 to 84 year group and a striking 47.2 percent over age 85. This translates to some 4 million people who might currently suffer from Alzhei- mer's disease in this country. According to Dr. Evans, given Census Bureau projec- tions for the numbers of people 85 and older, there could be a seven-fold increase in the numbers of oldest victims of Alzheimer's disease contributing to a total of be- tween 10 and 14 million people over 65 with Alzheimer's disease by the middle of the next century. The East Boston study is unique in several respects. First of all, the investigators did not look for Alzheimer patients in institutions, but rather focused their atten- tion on people living in the community, where some four-fifths of all dementia vic- tims may live. East Boston is a particularly interesting community in this regard, since a large proportion of disabled people are cared for at home. Second, given the makeup of the East Boston community, they were able to study much larger num- bers of very old people than have been included in previous studies. Finally, they examined people who performed well on the initial screening test, as well as those who performed poorly. As a result, Dr. Evans thinks that these estimates have al- lowed him to develop the most accurate picture of Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. population to date. Remarkably, Dr. Evans and his colleagues believe that even these estimates may be too conservative, in part because of assumptions that the Census Bureau has made about future numbers of older people. In making their estimates, Dr. Evans and his colleagues used the middle range of estimates provided by the Census Bureau for the 21st century. If, as some scientists have speculated, medical advances and other factors result in a greater proportion of people living to extreme old age, then the numbers of Alzheimer patients in the next century would be much higher. Conservative or not, these figures signal the growing magnitude of Alzheimer's disease as a major public health problem over the next several decades. Studies in China Show Surprising Differences in Dementia Rates The future impact of Alzheimer's disease is as important an issue in many other countries around the world as it is in the United States. With worldwide increases in average life expectancy, both industrialized and developing nations are beginning to look at the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and how it will affect their future. A recent study of more than 5,000 older residents of Shanghai, China found that Chinese people are just as likely to suffer from severe dementia as Americans. This contradicts previous research that suggested remarkably low numbers of Chinese suffering from Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, or other serious demen- tias. A research team including Dr. Robert Katzman, director of the NIA-supported Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, San Diego, re- cently found that rates for severe dementia in one area of China are nearly identi- cal to those found in the United States, with one exception: The rate of severe cogni- tive impairment is nearly three times higher for Chinese women over age 65 than for their American counterparts.324 According to the investigators, this may in part be due to the very high illiteracy rates, particularly among the women, in the population they studied. It has long been known that level of education has a significant impact on ability to learn, reason, remember, and perform on tests of mental ability. It is unclear what impactthis might have had on the study results. Since this study looked at the overall prevalence of dementia, future research will focus on the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease as well as other specific causes of cognitive impairment in China, and on gender differences. It may be that such stud- ies of Alzheimer's disease in different cultures will provide a more accurate assess- ment of worldwide prevalence, and might also reveal some clues.to the cause or causes of the disease. How Common Is Dementia in Black Populations? A study of older white and black community residents of a five-county region of North Carolina has suggested that the prevalence of dementia among blacks may be distinctly greater than among whites, and that black women are particularly affect- ed. NIA-supported scientists Drs. Albert Heyman, Gerda G. Fillenbaum and col- leagues at the Duke University Medical Center also found that while the rate of dementia among white men and women was basically equal in this study, more than twice as many black women as black men showed signs of dementia. This is not the first time that research has shown blacks to be adversely affected by dementia. Nonetheless, the investigators caution that these are preliminary datathat require further study. Future research will focus on how much of dementia among blacks is actually due to Alzheimer's disease and how much is related to hy- pertension and cerebrovascular disease. Scientists Study How and Why Brain Cells Die In recent years, it has become evident that the key questions in the study of Alz- heimer's disease are those that address what causes nerve cells to dysfunction and why specific groups of brain cells die. For years we have known that neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques are classic markers of Alzheimer's disease. With no way to diagnose the disease in living patients, physicians have depended upon the number and density of these le- sions to diagnose the disease at autopsy. Recently, there has been a debate in the scientific community about whether these markers, particularly the neuritic plaques, signify the debris left by dying cells, or whether they mark the onset of the disease. Neuritic plaques are dense, insoluble deposits of amyloid protein. Some scientists, such as Dr. Donald Price, director of the NIA Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at The Johns Hopkins University, think that amyloid deposits are an end stage event in the disease process. (See NINDS section of this report.) On the other side of the debate, are NIA grantees Dr. Carl Cotman at the Univer- sity of California -at Irvine, Dr. Dennis Selkoe at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA, and Dr. Rachael Neve and her col- leagues at Children's Hospital in Boston. Earlier this year, Drs. Cotman and Selkoe announced that they had found that a fragment of the protein in neuritic plaques may possess the ability to regulategrowth of nerve cells in the healthy human brain. Until now, scientists have not known what role amyloid protein plays, if any, in healthy brain tissue or why an increasing number of large amyloid clusters appear in the brains of Alzheimer pa- tients. Earlier NIA-supported studies revealed that the abnormal amyloid protein is made up of fragments of a larger protein that is normally spread across nerve cell membranes. Scientists also have discovered the approximate location of the gene forthe fragment, called the amyloid precursor protein, and have identified the building block amino acids that constitute it. In their recent investigations, Drs. Cotman and Selkoe synthesized the first 28 amino acids of the amyloid protein and tested the effects on this synthetic peptide on nerve cells grown in tissue culture. Nerve cells grown in tissue culture do not survive long, but in the presence of the synthetic peptide, the cells stayed alive for longer periods of time. These results demonstrated that amyloid has a trophic, or growth enhancing, effect on nerve cells. On the basis of these experiments, Drs. Cotman and Selkoe speculate that plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease may signal the nerve cells' attempt to mount a de- fense against the degenerative process and to compensate for the damage that oc- cures as the disease progresses. While Drs. Cotman and Selkoe have focused attention on the possible growth en- hancing capabilities of amyloid, Dr. Rachael Neve is looking at a different charac-325 teristic. She and her colleagues have found that a portion of the amino acid chain that makes up the amyloid precursor protein might be toxic to nerve cells. Dr. Neve and her colleagues genetically altered a group of tumor cells so that they contained portions of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein. She then treated the cells with nerve growth factor which under normal circumstances, would cause the cells to differentiate. Instead, a majority of the altered cells degen- erated and died. In a second experiment, they added the transfected cells to cells taken from rat hippocampus. The hippocampus is an area of the brain that is essen- tial for learning and memory and that is severely affected in people with Alzhei- mer's disease. This time, within 3 days, all of the brain cells had died. Dr. Neve speculates that the amyloid precursor protein is only toxic when a por- tion of the peptide-the first 105 amino acids including the 28 amino acids exam- ined by Drs. Cotman and Selkoe-is present. This work suggests that altered proc- essing of the amyloid precursor protein may activate this neurotoxic peptide. If, as these investigators speculate, the production of an abnormal, malfunctioning axnyloid protein is among the first in a series of events that take place as brain cells begin to die, then we might be one step closer to finding out what causes the disease and how to cure or prevent it. More immediately, the study of amyloid may pave the way to a diagnostic test for patients who complain of serious memory loss. Marker for Alzheimer's Disease Found in Skin What happens when an older person begins to show signs of memory loss and con- fusion? With luck, someone-perhaps a relative-will realize the importance of going to a physician to find out what is causing the problem, if it is curable and, if it is not, what can be done to help. The patient's first contact with a health professional is likely to be an internist, a geriatrician, or a family practitioner. Because of the variety of conditions that can mimic Alzheimer's disease-and also because of the wide range of symptoms-the patient might be examined by a neurologist or a psy- chiatrist. Before the process has been completed, the patient might be subjected to a complete medical examination with blood tests, laboratory test, tests of mental status, and other specialized tests such as computed tomography or other brain scans. In the end, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease will be made by excluding other possible conditions. The accurate diagnosis of the disease clearly represents a challenge for physicians and an emotional and financial crisis for older people and their families. Building upon his research in the area of amyloid, Dr. Dennis Selko this year an- nounced that a simple, reliable diagnostic test may be on the horizon. Dr. Selko and his colleagues have found diffuse deposits of amyloid protein in the skin, the tissues just beneath the skin, and in the intestines of patients with autopsy-confirmed diag- noses of Alzheimer's disease. The investigators examined tissue samples taken at autopsy from 11 people who had Alzheimer's disease and 26 who did not. Ten of the 11 Alzheimer cases showed some signs of amyloid outside of the brain, as compared to only 3 of the 26 people who had died of other causes. Those 3 were all older than 77 years old when they died. It has long been known that all of the hallmarks of Aixheimer's disease are seen to a lesser degree in normal aging. In addition to this work with autopsy samples, Dr. Selko and his colleagues also examined tiny pieces of fresh skin taken from the forearms of an 85-year-old Alz- heimer patient and a 64-year-old healthy subject. The Alzheimer tissue contained amyloid; the other did not. According to Dr. Selkoe, the next step might be to look for signs of amyloid circu- lating in the bloodstream. This could indicate how amyloid collects in the brain of Alzheimer patients and also lead to the development of a blood test to diagnose the disease. Scientists don't yet know if a test of this sort would be reliable in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, Dr. Selkoe's research supports speculation that Alzheimer's disease is not limited to the brain, as well as the theory that an abnor- mal form of amyloid is implicated early in the disease process. If this work is cor- roborated and expanded, it could be the key to diagnosing and, eventually, prevent- ing Alzheimer's disease. A Unifying Hypothesis for Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Even if amyloid begins to accumulate early in the course of Alzheimer's disease, something happens to trigger the event. NIA scientist Dr. Zaven Khachaturian heads a group of experts on brain aging who have offered one possible explanation. In the quest for a common mechansim to explain what happens to the brain in healthy aging and disease, Khachaturian and others are turning their attention to an element that is essential to all plant and animal life-calcium. All cells, and neu-326 rons (nerve cells) in particular, depend on calcium to carry out their activities. Cal-cium not only serves as a signal that initiates such cellular activity as neurotrans-mitter (chemical messenger release, it is needed for neuronal growth and repair, en-ables cells to de-code genetic messages, and regulates proteins involved in removingcellular debris. An association between normal brain aging and Alzheimer's disease has beennoted for some time. As noted above, the same pathology (plaques and tangled nervecell fibers) that characterizes the disease is also seen, to a lesser extent, in normalaged brain. Some would go so far as to suggest that most, if not all, people have apre-clinical form of Alzheimer's disease and would develop the condition were theyto live long enough. Whether or not this is the case, it points to the possibility of acommon mechanism at the root of brain aging and dementia. That mechanism may involve the regulation of calcium within cells. Normally,the amount of calcium inside excitable cells such as muscle or nerve cells is verylow compared to that outside the cell. Nerve cells have several mechanisms formaintaining low levels of calcium within the cell. These mechanisms include chan-* nels inside cell membranes that allow calcium to be transported to and from the cell. Other calcium regulators include energy-driven chemical pumps that expel ex-cessive calcium, storage or sequestration systems that act as sponges, soaking up excess calcium, and special proteins that bind to calcium, thus preventing its activi-ty in the cell. There is growing evidence that suggests the aging process affects the efficiency of many of these calcium regulatory systems. It appears that in Alzhei-mer's disease these systems are affected to such a degree that the normal operationof cells may be disrupted. It has been known for some time that sudden large in-creases in calcium levels inside a nerve cell could lead to cell death. Now, investiga-tors have begun to speculate that even small, but sustained, disruptions of calciumbalance (homeostasis) within the cell could be responsible for many of the changesthat occur in normal brain aging and in Alzheimer's disease. It is for this reasonthat many scientists are becoming interested in the problem of why and how calci-um regulation changes in aging. Numerous investigations are underway to identify calcium channels within cellmembranes and see whether they behave differently with age. These membranesare composed of two layers of a fatty substance called lipids. Sandwiched inside thislipid bilayer are proteins that transport calcium to and from the cell. Last year'sreport highlighted Dr. Jay Pettegrew s research on irregularities in the phospholisidmakeup of cell membranes in Alzheimer's disease. Now it has been shown in experi-mental artificial membranes, that changes in the make-up of membrane phospholi-pids affect the efficiency of membrane-imbedded proteins. Membrane irregularities may explain the changes in membrane transport func-tion that have been observed by another investigator. Dr. Mary L. Michaelis and co-workers at the University of Kansas in Kansas City have shown that membranetransport systems clearly become less efficient with age in health laboratory rats.Two different systems are involved in transporting calcium across the membrane innerve endings or terminals. One system depends on sodium and the other works viaan enzyme protein complex called magnesium-ATPase. Both require cellular energyand both need calcium to initiate transport activity. Using healthy aged rats, Dr.Michaelis finds that these systems are compromised in their ability to transport cal-cium. Previous researchers have found age-related impairment of calcium transportactivity in cells outside the central nervous system (CNS). However, Dr. Michaelis isthe first to report decreased activity in the membranes of CNS neurons.It is unknown whether impaired calcium channel functioning is caused bychanges in the membrane's lipid environment or by altered transport proteinswithin it. What scientists do know is that deficits in membrane transport function-ing could lead to prolonged, and detrimental, elevation of calcium inside the cell.There is evidence that defects occur in calcium-regulating systems other thanthose involved in membrane transport. Studies carried out at the University of Colo-rado at Boulder suggest calcium may be elevated in the brain cells of older subjectsbecause of an impaired ability to store excess calcium. Using electron microscopy,NIA-supported scientist Dr. Eva Fifkova has demonstrated that in aged laboratoryanimals greater amounts of calcium are found in the cytoplasm or fluid within den-drites, the fine nerve endings where cell-to-cell communication takes place. One ofthe most important sites where calcium is stored is the smooth endoplasmic reticu-lum (SER), specialized compartments within dendrites. Dr. Fifkova reports that thenumber of these SER compartments decreases with age while the amount of calci-um within the cytoplasm increases. This increase of calcium occurs in cells in thehippocampus, which could eventually lead to degeneration of dendrites, and ulti-mately cell death, as occurs in Alzheimer's disease.327 Electrophysiological studies suggest that calcium clearance may be slower with age. Dr. Dean 0. Smith at the University of Wisconsin draws this conclusion from studies of neurotransmitters released at the junction of neurons and muscles in rats. This NIA-supported study was spurred by the knowledge that neurotransmitter re- lease requires calcium to be released from the cell and is, therefore, an indication of how much calcium is inside the cell. Because neurotransmitters cannot be measured directly, Dr. Smith used special techniques to record the electrical activity generat- ed by such transmitters. The electrical recordings were prolonged in the older ani- mals, suggesting that an overabundance of calcium is being released from the cells. Additional evidence that calcium is elevated in aged neurons comes from NIA- supported investigations carried out at Wake Forest University's Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem NC. After studying nerve impulses in labora- tory rats for over 10 years, Dr. Philip W. Landfield may have discovered the physi- cal basis of memory impairment. Using hippocampal cells from young and old rats, Dr. Landfield measured the electrical potential of neurons after activation. After sending nerve impulses cells normally return to a state called \"afterhyperpolariza- tion\" (AHP), during which time they cannot generate another impulse. In aged cells, the AHP time is prolonged. Because AHP depends on calcium, Landfield and colleagues suspected that excess calcium inside the cell was the culprit. To test this hypothesis, the Wake Forest team bathed the cells in a solution high in calcium. AHP was prolonged, as expected. However, to ensure that calcium was indeed the cause of the prolonged AHP state, the researchers exposed the cells to solutions either high or low in calcium. The results confirmed the calcium link, with AHP prolonged only in cells exposed to high levels of calcium. Dr. Landfield has also studied the aging neuron's ability to receive signals known as \"potentiation.\" This ability is impaired in aged rat hippocampal cells. Knowing that magnesium effectively blocks calcium activity in tissue culture, Dr. Landfield decided to test the effects of magnesium in living animals. The research team com- pared a control group of rats to one fed a diet rich in magnesium. The animals were then anesthetized, and using electrodes to measure the cells' electrical activity, they found potentiation enhanced in the treated group. Of even greater practical impor- tance, behavioral task performance improved dramatically. These results were noted in both young and aged animals. Dr. Landfield continues to explore these age- related phenomena in hopes of finding the mechanism responsible for increased cal- cium influx in aged neurons. The evidence from these four studies on defective calcium regulation provide an interesting, albeit still speculative, explanation that may tie together many of the hitherto unrelated pieces of the Alzheimer puzzle. A plausible reason for the disruption of calcium homeostasis was presented earli- er this year at a 3-day symposium jointly sponsored by NIA and several pharmaceu- tical firms with an interest in neuronal plasticity. (Plasticity is the cell s ability to sprout new dendrites.) Dr. Robert M. Sapolsky from Stanford University presented the results of his research on the effect of glucocorticoids in the brain of aged rats. Glucocorticoids or GCs are a type of stress hormone produced in the adrenal gland and that circulate in the blood. Prolonged exposure to elevated levels of GCs results in a disruption of glucose which provides energy to cells. This energy depletion can in turn affect calcium activity. Dr. Sapolsky explains that cells in the hippocampus have a large number of GC receptors which makes them particularly susceptible to damage from prolonged exposure to these steroid hormones. While Dr. Sapolsky finds only a 30 percent reduction in glucose transport, he speculates that this may be enough to render a cell vulnerable to injury from a variety of neurotoxins or other environmental insults. The energy disruption seen by Sapolsky is corroborated by evidence of reduced glucose utilization in areas of the brain affected by Alzhei- mer's disease. While agreement on the calcium hypothesis is far from unanimous, the idea that there may be a common pathway to the changes seen in aging and dementia is gain- ing increasing acceptance in scientific circles. Extending research on cellular mech- anisms of calcium regulation will yield important answers about the role of this es- sential element in health and disease. Growth Factors: Augmenting a Cell's Natural Ability to Repair Itself At the same time that some scientists are studying the mechanisms of Alzhei- mer's disease, others are looking for ways to halt or reverse the disease process. An exciting area of inquiry has opened up in the area of neuroplasticity as it is mediated by nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is one of a number of growth factors, or specialized proteins, that promote cell growth and repair. Extending previously reported work supported by a grant from NIA, Dr. Fred H. Gage of the University328 of California, San Diego, has successfully transplanted tissue into damaged brains of mice, resulting in increased cell survival. The transplanted tissue was derived from connective tissue cells called fibroblasts which were genetically modified to secrete NGF. The grafts prevented the degeneration of cholinergic neurons, the same type of neurons affected in Alzheimer's disease. It is too early to tell how the treatment affects functioning, and important questions remain concerning the optimal meth- ods for tissue grafting. Meanwhile, researchers at the Johns Hopkins University Alzheimer's Disease Re- search Center are evaluating the usefulness of NGF in animal models more closely related to humans. Drs. Vassilis E. Koliatsos and Linda C. Cork are attempting to deliver NGF to the brains of nonhuman primates (monkeys) with impaired choliner- gic function. They hope to establish the effectiveness of this treatment in restoring cell function and reversing associated memory deficits. These studies pave the way for future therapies which may one day restore the cell's ability to reconstruct neural pathways in the brain damaged by injury or disease. THA Study Continues In mid-July, NIA grantee Dr. Kenneth Davis at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City announced that analysis of early results from the study of the effects of THA in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease were not clear-cut enough to halt the trail, but were encouraging enough to warrant continuation of the study. THA-or tetrahydroaminoacridine-is one of several drugs being tested as a possi- ble means to control memory loss in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The announcement followed examination of data on the first 100 patients by a small executive committee and presentation of the committee's recommendations to the NIA. The 16-site trial, which began in August 1987 and was designed to test the drug in 300 people, is being coordinated by Mount Sinai in cooperation with the Warner Lambert Co. and the Alzheimer's Association. According to Dr. Davis, the results of the interim analysis of the first 100 patients didn't answer the question of whether the drug would be effective in the general population of Alzheimer patients. As the study approaches its conclusion, perhaps sometime in 1990, the investigators hope to determine the value of THA as a treat- ment for memory problems in Alzheimer patients. Compound Enhances Memory in Rats: Clinical Trials Underway While Dr. Davis and his colleagues continue their work on THA, other investiga- tors are looking for ways to slow or reverse the more serious symptoms of Alzhei- mer's disease. A naturally occurring compound found in many regions of the brain may enhance certain memory functions known to deteriorate with age. NIA grantee Dr. Carol A. Barnes at the University of Colorado at Boulder has reported some improvement in memory of aged rates after administering acetyl-l-carnitine a derivative of carnitine (also known as Alcar). The study was a cooperative effort including the NIA Geron- tology Research Center and the Johns Hopkins University, both located in Balti- more, MD. Dr. Barnes and her associates noted improvement in the rats' performance on tasks that involved long-term memory processes. Autopsy studies indicated that chronic administration of Alcar reduced the loss of cells in the hippocampus. Carni- tine mimics the action of acetylcholine, a chemical which is necessary for nerve cell communication and which is depleted in Alzheimer's disease. Using techniques to measure electrical activity of brain cells in rodents, Dr. Barnes has shown that there is an age-related decay in spatial memory, the ability to remember physical orientation of a person or object. These are the types of tasks in which the Alcar- treated rats improved, leading to the notion that the compound may improve think- ing, learning, and memory by preserving connections at the junctures between nerve cells. Because of the improvement seen in rats and its apparent lack of toxicity, clinical trials of Alcar are now being carried out in the United States and several other countries to determine the drug's ability to alleviate the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. In this country, a limited number of patients will be treated with the com- pound in a four-site study sponsored by an Italian pharmaceutical company and di- rected by Dr. Richard Mayeux at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. The outcome of this study will help determine the future utility of Alcar for treating Alzheimer's disease specifically, and whether it might be a useful means to reduce age-related memory loss in general.329 New Technique May Improve Efficiency of Drug Trials Scientists conducting clinical trials with Alzheimer patients are plagued by sever- al problems. First of all, there is no definitive diagnostic test for Alzheimer's dis- ease. Invariably, then, the research population includes people with conditions that mimic the disease. Second, the symptoms and course of Alzheimer's disease vary considerably among patients. This means that large numbers of patients are needed in drug trials to determine whether or not the drug has any effect. To address this latter problem, NIA intramural scientist Dr. James Haxby has developed a method to predict an individual patient's rate of decline. Following patients for 3 to 5 years, Dr. Haxby noticed that some patients go through an early plateau phase that may last as long as 3Y2 years. The only appar- ent symptom in these mildly demented patients is memory loss; other intellectual abilities remain unchanged. Using a global test of intelligence known as the WAIS- IQ test, Dr. Haxby found a remarkably steady rate of decline following the initial plateau phase of the disease. Thereafter, patients begin to have problems processing complex information, understanding abstract reasoning, and planning. The test also shows a steady rate of decline in those patients with more advanced symptoms. It seems that while different patients can have markedly different rates of decline, the rate of decline for individual patients varies little from year to year. Consequently, a patient's future performance can be predicted based on an established pattern. Dr. Haxby's approach might be valuable not only in evaluating the effectiveness of experimental therapies, but could help physicians and caregivers plan for the care and treatment of individual Alzheimer patients by providing more accurate prognostic information. Helping Families Manage Alzheimer's Patients at Home Most Alzheimer patients live at home where they receive care and assistance from friends and relatives. As the disease progresses, a patient's need for continuous care places a great deal of stress on the caregiver. In order to determine how best to assist families and reduce the burden of care, NIA-supported scientists are studying the most important causes of stress among caregivers. While most research in this area focuses on the caregiver-patient relationship, one investigator has shifted his attention to stress-inducing factors beyond the care- giving situation. Dr. David A. Chiriboga and co-workers at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston have compared various stressors that affect caregiver wellbeing. They find that what happens at work, having a problem child in the household, and other social or family conflict, often contribute more to caregiver stress than the day-to-day responsibilities of providing care. These findings suggest that any test of the burden of care needs to consider the broad context of life in the family and at work. They also indicate that any program designed to reduce the stress of caregiving needs to involve strategies tailored to in- dividual circumstances. At the same time that investigators are exploring ways to identify and alleviate caregiver stress, others are looking at the health consequences of patient-caregiver interactions for both caregivers and patients. At the University of Washington in Seattle, Dr. Peter P. Vitaliano and colleagues are examining the health impact of caregiver personality and coping styles on Alz- heimer patients as well as on caregivers themselves. The investigators looked at the relationship between patients and their caregivers over an 18-month period and found an association between caregivers who express negative emotions and care- giver health. Using psychological tests and personal interviews, the Washington team found that caregiving spouses who are prone to criticize patients, who express hostility toward them, or become overinvolved with them, tend to perceive that their burden is greater than caregivers who are not so prone. This perception of increased burden was especinlly evident in caregivers of patients least able to care for themselves. Ac- cording to Dr. Vitalinno, Alzheimer patients with over-critical caregivers may func- tion below their capabilities which may further exacerbate the caregiver's height- ened emotional response. Dr. Vitaliano finds that this pattern of negative behavior and poor patient func- tioning is also associated with a lifetime of poor health in the caregiving spouse. Specifically, he finds that spouses who express high levels of emotion are almost three times more likely to have a history of cancer or cardiovascular disease than spouses with low levels of expressed emotion. In sum, this study of husband-wife pairs suggests that caregiver reactions may be related to patient functioning as well as to poor health in the caregiver. The re- searchers believe strongly that anger is a major risk factor for distress in caregivers.330 Therefore, they advise health professionals to be alert to signs of anger in caregivers and consider referring these caregivers to support groups or individual therapy to help them cope with the frustrations of their responsibilities. 2. Research Advances Supported and Conducted by Other NIH Institutes NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE As the principal supporter of neurological research in the United States, the Na- tional Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is committed to the study of the brain in Alzheimer's disease. NINDS-supported scientists are pursuing basic studies of brain abnormalities associated with this illness, and clinicians are working with patients to improve methods of predicting and diagnosing the disease. Studying the Brain In Alzheimer's disease, cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain frequently un- dergo selective degeneration. In studying adult rats with experimental brain lesions, NINDS grantee Dr. Franz Hefti of the University of Southern California in Los An- geles has observed that long term treatment with nerve growth factor prevents loss of cholinergic cells. The treatments were equally effective in young and old rats. While various growth factors can promote cell function, NGF has the benefit of acting selectively on the relevant cholinergic cells. Meanwhile, NINDS-supported scientists at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine have been accumulating evidence that aging monkeys experience the same kind of biological and behavioral deterioration as humans. The nonhuman pri- mates therefore may provide a model for studying the progression and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The team, led by Dr. Donald Price, found that as macaques lose their ability to remember, they develop neuritic plaques similar to those often found in aging humans. Dr. Price further found tangled nerve fibers in the brain of a monkey that had perfomed poorly on various tests. This is the first sign that these tangles, a hall- mark of Alzheimer's, are also found in monkeys. These studies have suggested one possible order in which Alzheimer's brain ab- normalities evolve. In these investigations, fiber abnormalities would appear to de- velop first, leading to abnormal neurons and finally the deposition of amyloid pro- tein in plaques. Another NINDS grantee at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Joseph Coyle, has been studying the mechanisms that regulate production of acetylcholine. Low levels of this brain chemical have been linked to memory loss, learning difficulties, and other cognitive impairments typical of Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Coyle found that the drug galantha- mine, which inhibits an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, improves the abili- ty of mice to remember how to solve a maze. This suggests that galanthamine might help reverse cognitive deficits. Predicting and Diagnosing Disease It is difficult to differentiate early Alzheimer's disease from other maladies such as depression, yet the ability to do so is critical in ensuring proper diagnosis and eventually treatment. Scientists therefore are searching for better methods of dis- ease prediction and diagnosis. A team of NINDS grantees, led by Dr. Miriam Aronson at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in New York City, has found that memory testing is a promising tool for predicting developent of dementia. By analyzing memory tests given 1I years before diagnosis, the scientists can improve prediction of the condition's onset over the present rates. Although these continuing studies are pre- liminary in nature, they suggest that memory testing may be useful in facilitating preclinical detection of dementia. The Aronson study, which has followed 488 people over the age of 75 for 9 years, also has substantiated preliminary evidence that women are more susceptible than men to developing dementia, particularly the progressive type associated with Alz- heimer's disease. It also appears that women with a history of actual or silent (de- tected only by electrocardiogram) myocardial infarction are especially vulnerable. Other scientists have been looking for changes in cerebral physiology that may signify early Alzheimer's disease, as distinct from other forms of dementia. Using a brain imaging technique called positron emission tomography (PET), investigators make images of the brain after a subject has been injected with a tracer chemical, which acts as a radioactive tag for glucose. The images reveal rates of glucose me- tabolism in different areas of the brain.331 A team of NINDS grantees, led by Dr. David Kuhl at the NIA-supported Universi-ty of Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in Ann Arbor, previously hadfound that metabolic rates are distinctively abnormal in people with probable Alz-heimer's disease as well as in symptomatic patients who do not yet meet diagnosticcriteria for the disease. More recently, the team has found an exceptional tracerchemical, TRB, for determining the nature and distribution of brain acetylcholinereceptors. TRB, which the scientists plan to use in human studies, is easier to makethan previous tracers and achieves better distribution in the brain. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES Little evidence implicates an infectious agent as the cause of Alzheimer's disease.Nonetheless, NJAID is interested in Alzheimer's disease because several similaritiesbetween it and known viral diseases exist. Overlapping interest include studies ofhow virus growth is regulated in the brain as well as investigations into scrapie, aneurodegenerative viral disease of sheep and goats. In scrapie, a fibrous protein ac-cumulates in plaques and tangles of nerves in the brain, creating lesions similar tothe protein-laden plaques and tangles seen in the brains of Alzheimer patients. Clue to How Modified Protein Might Evolve in Alzheimer's Disease As noted in the NIA section of this report, the brain lesions that characterize Alz-heimer's disease are made up of a modified form of amyloid protein. How this pro-tein becomes modified has long intrigued Alzheimer's disease researchers because itmay be important for understanding how the disease develops.NIAID grantee Dr. Timothy Wong and colleagues at the University of Washing-ton in Seattle study a rare brain disorder, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis(SSPE), linked to the measles virus. Their work may provide clues to how modifiedproteins could evolve in the central nervous system.In studying strains of measles virus isolated from brains of these patients, theyhave found that part of the genetic material of the measles virus is highly suscepti-ble to specific mutations when grown in brain cells as compared with cells fromother parts of the body. Once the changes are induced, they are passed on to newvirus particles, which then spread slowly to other cells, perpetuating the modifica-tion. Brain cells infected with the modified virus tend to accumulate components ofthe modified virus, or proteins, rather than release fully formed viruses.Specific mutations in the genetic material coding for one protein of the measlesvirus a ppear to produce the chronic, nonproductive measles virus infection of thebrain that characterizes SSPE. If similar, nonrandom changes can occur to cellularmaterials, this could explain how modified cellular proteins could be produced thatmight accumulate in the host brain. This poses an intriguing question, whethermodified proteins involved in degenerative central nervous system diseases, such asthe amyloid protein in Alzheimer's disease, might be derived by this mechanism. Laboratory System Developed To Help Understand Scrapie Many studies indicate that a modified form of a normal brain protein, prion pro-tein (PrP), is also associated with scrapie. Last year at NIAID's Rocky MountainLaboratories in Hamilton, Montana, intramural scientists Drs. Bruce Chesebro,Byron Caughey, and Richard Race developed an artificial laboratory system inwhich to study PrP and the scrapie agent. The system comprises mouse brain tumorcell clones containing a high percentage of scrapie-infected cells.Now able to carry out experiments more efficiently, the investigators recentlyused the laboratory system to determine how PrP is normally made and whetherscrapie infection alters this process in any way. They found no evidence that scrapieinfection modifies PrP biosynthesis in these cells.Some scientists believe that modified PrP is a necessary component of the infec-tious scrapie agent, but these experiments did not verify this hypothesis. The modi-fied form of PrP may instead arise as a byproduct of the disease process in a waythat scientists cannot duplicate in the laboratory. The intramural scientists havenow begun carefully analyzing the process by which PrP is made to determine whatelse might influence the modification of PrP to the scrapie protein. Division of Research Resources DRR supports and conducts research into Alzheimer's disease at research facili-ties across the United States. The DRR Biomedical Research Support (BRS) Pro-gram provides a pool of flexible funds to institutions heavily engaged in PublicHealth Service-funded research aimed at meeting particular research-related needsnot usually covered by other grants. In addition, the awards may complement orsupplement regular Public Health Service research grants. Also supported by BRS332 is the Shared Instrumentation Grant Program, which provides sophisticated re- search equipment to be shared among NIH-supported investigators. This year, for example, the work of Dr. Dennis Selkoe highlighted in the NIA section of this report utilized equipment provided by the BRS Program. Other DRR-supported studies are looking at computed tomography (CT) as a means of identifying Alzheimer patients. According to DRR grantee Dr. Godfrey Pearlson at The Johns Hopkins University General Clinical Research Center (GCRC), CT scans indicate significant decrease in the amount of brain tissue over the course of just one year. GCRC's provide the research infrastructure for multidisciplinary studies on both children and adults. Specifically, they provide patient research facilities, computer- ized data management and analysis, as well as support for research nursers, dieti- cians, biostatisticians, and specialized laboratories for the translation of basic and clinical research into medical practice. Dr. Pearlson and other GCRC grantees examined 24 patients with early probable Alzheimer's disease and 20 age-matched healthy subjects. The patients were scanned at yearly intervals; the normal subjects were rescanned after 4 years. Re- gional volumes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-the fluid that is secreted by specialized cells into the brain ventricles-were calculated. The grantees reasoned that the greater the volume of CSF, the larger the ventricles. If no conditions other than Alz- heimer's disease are acting on the subjects, ventricles can expand only with the at- rophy of brain tissue. Therefore, expanding volumes of CSF indicate increasing atro- phy of brain tissue. Dr. Pearlson found that CSF volumes were significantly larger after just 1 year in patients with Alzheimer's disease. So significant was the atrophy, in fact, that these patients, as a group, showed a percent increase in CSF volumes after 1 year that was greater than the percent increase seen after 4 years in the healthy group.: According to Dr. Pearlson, future studies are planned to determine if this tech- nique is effective in rapidly identifying early cases of Alzheimer's disease. NATIONAL CENTER FOR NURSING RESEARCH NCNR-supported research on Alzheimer's disease focuses on developing and test- ing nursing techniques to improve home care as well as institutional care of Alz- heimer patients. Studies also are aimed at developing better ways to educate and assist family caregivers. Scientists Look for Successful Behavior Management Methods to Facilitate Home Care for Alzheimer Patients Caring for Alzheimer patients can be difficult because patients are often confused and anxious and display inappropriate behavior, such as wandering, ignoring per- sonal hygiene or being combative. Family members who care for these patients at home often report high stress, depression, poor health, and low life satisfaction. Providing family members with information about successful home care methods can help them cope better with a routine that can be complicated and exhausting. NCNR grantee Dr. Mary Stewart-Dedmon of the University of Iowa College of Nurs- ing in Iowa City, is interviewing family members who provide home care for Alz- heimer patients. She is collecting information from 40 families about the most fre- quent memory and behavior problems they observe in patients, how the families manage these behaviors, and the usefulness of various behavior management tech- niques. The investigators plan to incorporate information about successful care methods in an Alzheimer's education model for health teams to use in helping fami- lies manage the needs and demands of people with Alzheimer's disease. Researchers Evaluate Special Long-Term Care Unit for Alzheimer Patients The progressive mental and functional impairments of Alzheimer patients pose many difficult problems for nursing care and management in long-term care facili- ties. Although long-term care units especially designed and equipped to treat pa- tients with Alzheimer's disease do exist, there have been no systematic studies of their effectiveness. With grant support from NCNR and NIA, Dr. Meridean L. Maas of the University of Iowa College of Nursing is assessing the effects of a special unit for the care of Alzheimer patients on patient functioning, family attitudes toward care, and staff morale, as well as on costs of care. The unit, located at the Iowa Veterans Home and administered by nurses, is designed to be environmentally safe, to have built-in cues to improve patient orientation and help avoid confusion, and to facilitate ease of care for health care workers.333 Dr. Maas and her colleagues are comparing the efficacy of the special unit to thatof traditional units that include Alzheimer patients with other residents. The inves-tigators are comparing rates of decline in patients' mental functional abilities, de-grees of agitation, use of medication, safety and exent of participation in social andrecreational activities. They also are measuring family perceptions of patient care.In addition, the researchers are looking at the level of knowledge, amount of stress,degree of job satisfaction and rate of absenteeism among staff members.Determining the usefulness of a special Alzheimer unit can help long-term careadministrators, clinical staff and families of patients with this disease plan the mosteffective and least costly means of care. S. Outlook In 1989, the Department of Health and Human Services took a major step in sup-port of Alzheimer's disease research with the publication of the report of the Advi-sory Panel on Alzheimer's Disease. The report called for increased funding in theareas of biomedical research, as well as research related to services for Alzheimerpatients and financing programs to pay for them.In addition, the NIA announced the establishment of three new Alzheimer's Dis-ease Research Centers. This brings the number of such centers to 15 in a nationwideprogram designed to enhance research and care by establishing a network for col-laborative efforts. Also in 1989, the NIA and the Administration on Aging hosted a series of confer-ences focusing on issues faced by caregivers of Alzheimer patients. The 14 confer-ences, held in 9 different States, provided training and information about currentpractices in caregiving support for families of AD patients.In the area of international research, the World Health Organization Special pro-gram for Research on Aging, based at the NIH campus to draw upon NIA resourcesand scientific expertise, moved forward in its plans for a comparative populationstudy on age-associated dementias. This year, WHO announced that the projectwould be coordinated by the Studio Multicentrico Italiano Sulla Demenza in Flor-ence, Italy, with Canada, Chile, Malta, Nigeria, and Spain participating in thestudy. New research initiatives for the coming year include increased efforts to directattention toward developing and testing behavioral, social, and environmental inter-ventions for reducing the burdens of care, and evaluating the utility of special Alz-heimer units and day care and long-term care settings.As we begin 1990, which has been designated by Congress as the \"Decade of theBrain,\" it is incumbent upon the research institutes of NIH to aim for a better un-derstanding of the basic nature and causes of Alzheimer's disease and to find a wayto diagnose, treat, and care for the 4 million people who suffer from it. B. UNDERSTANDING AGING Because poor health is not an inevitable consequence of old age, researchers arestriving to separate normal developmental processes from disease and in the processstudying the different ways certain diseases and conditions behave in older people. Multiple Chronic Conditions Create Special Problems for Older People As they age, people suffer from an increasing number of chronic conditions whichcan interfere with their ability to care for themselves. MIA intramural scientists Dr.Jack Guralnik, Dr. Andrea LaCroix, and Denald Everett in collaboration with Dr.Mary Grace Kovar at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) analyzeddata from interviews with more than 13,000 community-dwelling people 60 years ofage and older. Their analyses of this nationally representative database show thatfor both women and men in three age groups, there was a clear association betweennumber of chronic conditions and prevalence of disability.People who care for older persons have long felt that multiple chronic conditions(or comorbidity) play an important role in an individual's overall health and abilityto function. Prior to this study little research had been done to assess the preva-lence of comorbidity among older people or to determine how chronic conditionsaffect a person's ability to perform specific activities necessary for independentliving. The NIA scientists studied responses to a survey which asked participants if theyhad any of nine chronic conditions prevalent among older people. They found thatfor woman age 60-90; 70-79; and 80-plus, the prevalence of have having two or morechronic conditions was 45 percent, 61 percent, and 71 percent, respectively. Preva-334 lence rates for men in these same age groups were 35 percent, 47 percent, and 53 percent, respectively. The researchers then looked at the effect these conditions had on the participant's ability to perform tasks such as bathing, dressing, eating, and getting in and out of bed. Dr. Guralnik and his colleagues found that as the number of chronic conditions increased the ability to accomplish these activities decreased. For example, 80 per- cent of women 80 years of age and over with five or more chronic conditions, who were not institutionalized, had difficulty or needed help with activities of daily living. The correlation of multiple chronic conditions with need for assistance supports the impression that as more people reach older ages there will be an increased need for support services, medical services, and long term care. Consequently, research to improve the treatment or prevention of common disabling conditions could play an important role in reducing the need for medical and long-term care services for older persons. Investigators Examine Active Life Expectancy The U.S. Bureau of the Census estimates that by the year 2000 there will be 4.9 million people in this country who will be at least 85 years of age, a number which will increase to as many as 25.6 million in the year 2060. This projection is based on present population figures as well as on conservative assumptions about declining mortality rates for very old people. However, a growing body of scientists feel that this prediction could be vastly understated and that the number of people in this age group may actually become more than 200 percent higher than the Census Bu- reau s highest projections. One such scientist is NIA grantee Dr. Kenneth G. Manton at Duke University in Durham, NC. Dr. Manton developed a computer model that simulates the effects of longevity of certain behavioral changes. For example, a man at age 30 could con-. ceivably add 15 years to his life by eliminating risks such as smoking and high blood pressure. Therefore, Dr. Manton concludes that many more people could live to join the oldest old age group (those 85 years of age and older) than estimated in conven- tional projections. Given the rapidly growing number of very old people in the United States, NIA scientists are investigating the quality of those lives. Will people be active and au- tonomous, or dependent and in need of care? Dr. Manton used the special assump- tions built into his computer model to forecast the number of years very old people can reasonably expect to live without disabling conditions (active life expectancy). His analysis shows that, though life expectancy for men at age 85 is 5.15 years, only 2.63 of those years will be active. For women in this age group active life expectancy is 2.3 of their remaining 6.44 years. Dr. Manton projects that older women will spend more of their remaining days receiving institutionalized care than will men- 1.88 years for women as opposed to 0.9 years for men. This study also assessed the influence of chronic conditions on active life expect- ancy. Dr. Manton estimated that the elimination of dementia, for example, would increase active life expectancy among this age group by 11.4 percent for men and by 26.1 percent for women. He demonstrated that smoking cessation and control of high blood pressure could reduce an individual's future disability. Dr. Manton observes that ignoring the likelihood of a much larger population of oldest-old is unwise. He suggests that possibly the only practical response is to maxi- mize the health and functioning of the oldest-old by motivating changes in un- healthy habits. In another analysis of independent versus dependent aging, NIA grantees Drs. Andrei Rogers and Richard Rogers at the University of Colorado at Boulder and their colleagues linked life expectancy of the oldest old with level of independence. Four activities of daily living were used to classify an individual's ability to func- tion independently: The ability to eat, bathe and dress oneself, and the ability to move from bed to chair unassisted. The researchers used Katz and coworkers' data from Waves One and Two of the Massachusetts Health Care Panel Study to esti- mate active life expectancy. Wave One consisted of interviews with over 1,600 non- institutionalized people age 65 or older. Wave Two consisted of interviews with 1,500 people, some of whom were institutionalized (approximately 89 percent of them from the original Wave One group). The investigators found a dramatic correlation between age and active life expect- ancy. For example, at 65 people could expect about 14.7 years of active life expectan- cy, at 80 people could expect less than half that or 5.6 years, and those people who were 85 could expect about 3.8 years of active life expectancy. Stated another way, the percentage of remaining years that could be lived independently dropped from335 about 90 percent for age 65 to 67 percent for those 85 years of age. People at anyage who were independent could expect to live a majority of their remaining yearsindependently. The study also looked at active life expectancy for 65-year-old people who weredependent on others at the initiation of the study. The researchers concluded thateven these individuals could expect to live 72 percent of their remaining 15.5 yearsindependently. This conclusion was based on the probability of some individuals re-covering from whatever condition caused their initial dependency. However, as thepopulation ages, the estimated percentage of years spent independent of others doesdecrease. These studies document the increasingly large number of people who can live tocelebrate an active 85th birthday. This information can help health care profession-als and policymakers plan for the challenges of providing quality care for people intheir last years life and for developing opportunities for active older people. Sientists Explore Mechanism for Resetting the Human Biological Clock Insomnia and other problems getting a good night's sleep are common complaintsamong older people. Now, scientists supported by an NIA grant have found thatcarefully timed exposure to bright lights might prove a quick and effective treat-ment for certain sleep disorders. Drs. Charles Czeisler, Richard Kronauer, and their colleagues at Brigham andWomen's Hospital and Harvard University report that the body's internal clock ismore sensitive to light than previously thought and can be \"set' by scheduled expo-sure to light over a relatively short period of time. Located in the brain's hypothalamus, this internal clock, or circadian pacemaker,controls when we sleep and when we wake, as well as a variety of other bodily ac-tivities that influence the way we think, feel, and function. Each day, the pacemak-er-which runs on a cycle of about 25 hours-is reset to fit the 24-hour cycle of thecalendar day. Dr. Czeisler and his colleagues have found that light may be thesingle most important factor in resetting the clock and that the timing of light expo-sure determines the extent and direction of the change.As part of their research, the investigators conducted a total of 45 trials in 14healthy young men. For an average 8-day trial, each participant lived in a laborato-ry environment devoid of all external time cues. For the first 2 days of the trial, theparticipants were kept awake while the investigators performed tests of body tem-perature, kidney function, alertness, and performance to determine the normal set-ting of their pacemakers. They then experienced 3 days of alternating light (16hours) and darkness (8 hours). For 5 hours during each light cycle the volunteers satfacing a bank of specially designed fluorescent lamps with an intensity comparableto sunlight just after dawn. As a result, the investigators found that the human circadian pacemaker can bereset to any desired phase by scheduled exposure to light for 2 to 3 days. More im-portantly, they found that the same exposure at different times can have signifi-cantly different effects. For example, exposure at one time in the cycle resets theclock to an earlier hour (i.e., an eastward time shift), while exposure at a differenttime resets the clock to a later hour (i.e., a westward time shift). Exposure at certaintimes causes very little effect. As part of his work on this project, Dr. Kronauer hasdeveloped a mathematical model to predict the body's response to any light expo-sure. It has been known for some time that the internal clocks of animals and lowerorganisms are set by daily cycles of light and darkness. Scientists have long felt thatin humans, social contacts and other environmental cues play a more significantrole than light-dark cycles. In 1986, Dr. Czeisler and his colleagues reported the first evidence that daily expo-sure to sunlight might be the key to resetting the biological clock. As part of anexperiment designed to adjust slight abnormalities in circadian function, the investi-gators found a dramatic light-induced shift in the biological clock of a 66-year-oldwoman who was having difficulties with her sleep.The recent findings indicate that a schedule of alternating light and darkness canbe designed so that a person can be alert whenever she/he needs to be. This re-search has broad implications for people suffering from jet-lag (some of whom re-quire more than a week to adjust to a new schedule), for those who do rotating-shiftwork, and for those who suffer from insomnia. The research also has implications for older people. According to Dr. Czeisler andhis colleagues, the circadian pacemaker gradually speeds up as a person ages. Overtime this could lead to early morning awakenings and other sleep complaints re-ported by some older people. The NIA-supported scientists have already begun to336 apply their findings to treat some common sleep-related complaints of older patients and are encouraged by their preliminary results. Heat Shock Response Decreases in Older Animals -NIA intramural researchers Drs. Joseph Fargnoli, Nikki Holbrook, and their col- leagues at the Gerontology Research Center (GRC) in Baltimore, MD report that the heat shock response, a selective expression of specific genes in response to heat or other types of physiologic stress, is altered in older animals. This finding could even- tually help explain why older people are more susceptible to environmental stresses such as cold and hot temperatures. The researchers studied the in vitro response of young and old rodents by compar- ing their expression of the HSP 70 gene family. HSP 70 is induced when animals are subjected to heat stress. The heat shock response is a universal response found in all organisms ranging from plants to animals. It involves the selective expression of a unique set of genes that protect cells against a variety of toxic and stressful conditions. Dr. Fargnoli and his colleagues took lung cells from both young and old rodents, grew the cells in a culture, and then applied elevated temperature. Results showed that the young animals produced a higher number of cultures giving a good HSP 70 protein response than did the old rodents. These results suggest a defect in the ability of cells from old animals to mount an adequate heat stress response, when exposed to high temperatures. Further investi- gations may help determine whether a defect in heat shock gene expressions plays a role in an individual's physiological response to heat and environmental stress. CHANGES IN AGING CELIs As they age, cells lose their ability to reproduce. In addition, a variety of structur- al and metabolic changes occur in aging cells. Researchers supported by NIA are studying age-related changes in the duplication of DNA necessary for cell reproduc- tion (DNA replication) and the \"turning on\" of genes (gene-expression) to learn what causes cells to age and eventually die and to identify interventions to retard the human aging process. Immortalized Cells Offer Clues to Cellular Aging When grown in tissue culture, many types of normal cells, such as fibroblasts, divide only a certain number of times and then stop. In order to understand aging more fully, scientists must discover what actually halts DNA replication in cells that age and die, cells which are also referred to by scientists as mortal cells. By comparing mortal cells with immortal cells, researchers hope to learn what controls cellular aging. Immortal cells are cells which have been genetically altered so they proliferate without stopping; that is, they do not age. NIA grantee Dr. Olivia M. Pereira-Smith of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX, has been studying what happens when mortal and immortal cells are fused with each other. She found that hybrids formed by fusing immortal cells with agingcells have limited division potential. Thus, these hybrids behave more like mortal cells than immortal ones. One theory to explain this behavior is that aging results from a program which includes the expression of a gene whose product in- hibits DNA synthesis. Immortal cells may not age because they lose their ability to respond to this gene; thus, they escape the genetic program for aging. It seems likely that this is what happens in certain cancers. Further research involving im- mortalized cells should provide additional information about how programmed aging is controlled and whether this process can be reversed. Gene Expression May Control Aging Cells'Biological Clock Understanding how DNA replication is halted in aging cells is only part of the story. Scientists also must explain their observation that normal cells appear to pos- sess a biological memory, or clock, which determines their average lifespan. Some researchers believe that this clock may be triggered by an event that occurs within the cell. NIA grantee Dr. Eugenia Wang of the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Re- search and McGill University in Montreal, Canada, has identified one such possible event. She has found that proliferating cells produce a protein known as cyclin, but they lack the protein statin. In contrast, aging cells contain statin but not cyclin. The structure of statin suggests that it may interfere with protein synthesis. Dr. Wang observed that these protein changes also occur during cell differentia- tion, the series of biochemical and structural changes that cells undergo in order to form a specialized tissue. These proteins appear to mark the transition' from a pro-337 liferating to a nonproliferating, or quiescent, state. Statin is a marker for quiescencein a number of different types of organisms and a possible \"marker of aging.\" DIABETES AND AGING Noninsulin-dependent diabetes is more common in older people than in any otherage group. Thus, NIA supports research on this illness as it pertains to aging proc-esses. Two recent NIA findings are based on studies of rodents fed low calorie dietswhich retard aging and diseases. Evidence Supports the Glycation Hypothesis of Aging NIA grantee Dr. Edward J. Masoro and colleagues at the University of TexasHealth Science Center in San Antonio have been testing the glycation hypothesis ofaging, which states that glucose (sugar) may be a mediator of aging processesthrough its alteration of protein and DNA structure and functions. Glycation is believed to be significant in the development of complications relat-ing to diabetes because glucose can alter proteins and nucleic acids, leading to cross-linking in tissues such as collagen (connective tissues), blood vessels, eye lens, bloodcells, and peripheral nerves. Cross-linking is a process that increases in both ani-mals and humans as a function of age. Thus, scientists believe cross-linking-andincreased glucose levels-may be responsible for some physical changes that occurin older people who have diabetes. Dr. Masoro's group found that blood glucose levels in rats fed low calorie dietswere significantly lower than in rats whose diet was unrestricted. Also, in the ratson the low calorie diet there was less linking of glucose to the hemoglobin molecule.Thus, the reduced glucose levels observed in rats fed low calorie diets and the factthat these rats have an extended lifespan with a slowing of their aging processessupports the glycation hypothesis of aging. Glycation reactions are also believed tohave a significant role in the development of diabetic complications. The Effect of a Low Calorie Diet on the Pancreas Another NIA grantee conducting studies on a caloric restriction in rodents is Dr.Roy L. Walford at the University of California at Los Angeles. One of Dr. Walford'srecent studies on mice showed that the restriction of calories results in lower glu-cose levels and an altered structure of the pancreas. Two groups of mice were studied following weaning at 4 weeks. One group was feda normal diet while the other group was fed a diet restricted in calories. Bothgroups received equal amounts of minerals, proteins, fats, and vitamins-a diet thatwas sufficient to satisfy nutritional requirements. Only carbohydrates fed to the twogroups were adjusted to provide the difference in calories. Eleven months later the investigators examined the pancreases of the mice. Inthe mice fed the low calorie diet the volume of the islets of Langerhans (cells foundin the pancreas which secrete insulin) was significantly smaller. These results indi-cate that consuming a low calorie diet reduces the organism's need for insulin,which eases the burden on the process of metabolizing foods. AGING AND DIGESTIVE DISEASES The NIA supports a number of studies on digestive diseases and disorders-one ofthe primary causes of hospital admissions for older people. The Institute has devel-oped a research focus on nutrition that includes a study on the way aging affectsthe intestine's ability to absorb nutrients. Age-Related Changes in Absorption of Nutrients According to a study using animal models of aging, conducted by Dr. Peter R.Holt at Columbia University and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, in New YorkCity, certain age-related changes take place in the intestine that may make it diffi-cult to adequately absorb various nutrients. The investigators studied two groups ofrats, looking at the small intestines of old rats (27 to 28 months old) and young rats (4 to 5 months old) under normal dietary conditions and after starvation and refeed-ing. They found sharply reduced levels of enzyme activity in the intestine of olderrats, both under normal conditions and especially after starvation, when comparedto the younger rats. Intestinal enzymes play a vital role in ensuring nutrients areabsorbed efficiently. In addition, the small intestine and colon of older rats showcellular changes with the stress of starvation and refeeding that resemble well-es-tablished, pre-malignant colonic conditions.338 Changes in intestinal absorption may increase the risk for some diseases or ill- nesses. Weight loss and malnutrition often occur after an illness or surgery and nu- trients must be restored to return the body to normal health. The intestine of the older patient may not respond adequately to ensure such nutrient restoration. Osteoporosis, one of the most common disorders associated with aging, may be ex- acerbated by a decline in calcium absorption, associated with nutrient malabsorp- tion. Pernicious anemia, a condition marked by a deficiency of vitamin B12 can also result. Hypochlorhydria, another syndrome the rates of which appear to increase with age, is also characterized by a decreased absorption of vitamin B12. The researchers recommend increased research on digestive diseases in older people and cite the need to develop a noninvasive test to measure intestinal absorp- tion and malabsorption of a variety of substances. c. STRATEGIES FOR PROMOTING HEALTH AND EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING One of the primary goals of aging research is to find new knowledge that can be applied to enrich the lives of older people and the futures of those who will someday be old. Researchers hope to prolong the healthy, productive middle years, and to have more people enjoy an energetic and independent old age. Older Patients. Often Experience Discriminatory Health Care Practices It seems obvious that by eliminating specific risks a person can prevent, or modify, certain illnesses and prolong health. In fact, it is increasingly acknowledged that lifestyle changes at any age can improve a person's quality of life. How well has that knowledge filtered down to health care providers and the public? Do older patients receive the same guidance about their health as do younger patients? In a study conducted by NIA grantees Dr. Rosalie F. Young at Wayne State Uni- versity in Detroit, MI, and Dr. Eva Kahana at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH, the overwhelming conclusing is that older patients often are denied access to information and recommendations that would lessen their risk of future illness. Further, this problem occurs because physicians generally are not trained to communicate effectively with older people and may lack the knowledge that preven- tive measures are beneficial for even the oldest people. Dr. Young and her colleagues administered a questionnaire to 246 cardiac pa- tients following their discharge from several Detroit hospitals. All respondents spoke English and had no evidence of severe cognitive impairment. Questions con- cerned personal helath, use of health care facilities, and general well-being. Addi- tionally, respondents answered questions about their knowledge of heart disease and ways to reduce the risk of future cardiac problems. In analyzing the results, the in- vestigators divided participants into an older group (age 60 and above) and younger group (age 40-59). They found major differences in the information and instructions given to the two groups by their physicians. The study found that people in the older age group reported receiving less infor- mation and instruction than people in the younger age group. With respect to physi- cian-generated information, 38 percent of the older group received no information about heart attacks compared to 21 percent of the younger group. The investigators found that older people were less informed than younger people about weight, diet, exercise, reduction or cessation of smoking, reduction of stress, and enrollment in rehabilitation programs. For example, nearly half of the younger group were told to stop smoking, while only about one-quarter of the older group were given the same guidance. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are extremely beneficial to recuperating heart patients at any age, regardless of the extent of the patient's disease or his/her gen- eral health. Yet, only 28 percent of the older age group were advised by their physi- cian to participate in such a program, compared to 52 percent of the younger group. Heart disease is the number one killer of older people. Reliable information about preventive measures can reduce the risk of future cardiac problems. Unfortunately, some physicians may unwittingly place their older patient's lives in jeopardy, or contribute to a diminished quality of life, by withholding valuable information. Another example of how older people are generally less apt to receive state-of-the- art health care than younger people, is found in the work by NIA grantee Dr. Jeanie Kayser-Jones at the University of California, San Francisco who related the professional and personal environments in nursing homes to the quality of care the patients received. In an in-depth interview of 100 physicians between the ages of 29 and 79, Dr. Kayser-Jones found that 53 percent do not believe that older patients should receive maximum evaluation and treatment for acute illnesses. As a result, Dr. Kayser-339 Jones found that patients over 80 years of age often receive less agressive care thantheir younger counterparts. Dr. Kayser-Jones studied how physicians make treatment decisions for their oldernursing home patients with acute illnesses. She found that several factors act as de-terrents to aggressive treatment. Examples include a fear by many physicians ofmalpractice suits should treatment fail, a distrust of reports from nursing homestaffs, and an uncertainty as to Medicare reimbursement.Interpretation of data from three nursing home facilities in California over a 3-year period found the nursing home environment lackluster, with few professionalcaregivers, a noticeable absence of physicians, and high turnover of professional andnonprofessional staffs. Dr. Kayser-Jones also found that 48 percent of older nursinghome residents were transferred to hospitals not for clinical reasons, but becausenursing homes were poorly staffed with inadequately trained nurses, nurse-physi-cian communication was ineffective, and family members wanted a better level ofcare than the nursing home provided. Investigators encountered other problems in the nursing home setting. Nursesoften diagnosed a patient's complaint to the physician by phone, a system whichrelies heavily on the verbal and assessment skills of the person filing the report.Many nursing homes were ill-equipped to handle severe illness and, therefore, staffroutinely urged physicians to transfer patients to acute care hospitals. Physiciansreport reluctance to perform tests that may require followup treatment.Dr. Kayser-Jones compares the care given sickly newborns with the care givenolder people. This care is swift and aggressive. On the other hand, nursing homepatients who suffer serious illness are often viewed as burdens from the time of ad-mission. As a result, nursing home care tends to be \"defensive\" rather than thera-peutic, with the primary goal being to protect the institution and health care profes-sionals from negative results. The authors point out that while many nursing homes are of high quality, prob-lems in others must be addressed. Dr. Kayser-Jones suggests encouraging rapid andskillful health assessment, monitoring subtle patient changes, coordinating nursinghome staff and shifts, following through on diagnostic tests, evaluating results aftertreatment, and formulating comprehensive treatment plans.In a third example of age discrimination, NIA grantees Drs. Gaylene Becker andSharon Kaufman at the University of California, San Francisco examined data fromvarious studies related to the availability of rehabilitation therapy for older patientsand initiated their own research on stroke rehabilitation. They conclude thatthough rehabilitation is beneficial for many older persons, it is not routinely of-fered. The decision to introduce rehabilitation therapy after a stroke depends uponthe patient's recovery potential, yet chronological age is generally assumed-with-out scientific base-to affect recovery. Historically, rehabilitation has been thought of in terms of returning to a voca-tion and therefore not relevant for people no longer in the work force. Additionally,the widespread association of age with frailty and illness influences many healthcare professionals to mistakenly decide that loss of function is normal in advancedage. The result is that the American health care system encourages the younger pa-tient to regain function, but not the older patient. However, research shows thatgeriatric rehabilitation can be beneficial for older people who are physically dis-abled. In fact, it may be especially beneficial for patients over 85.Of all illnesses occurring later in life, stroke is the most physically debilitating.Stroke patients comprise the largest single group of older patients in physical reha-bilitation settings. Investigators found that rehabilitation facilities, however, arevery selective when admitting patients over age 80. Only those who demonstrate thegreatest potential for progress are selected so that therapists can be assured of atleast some success. As a result, persons chosen for rehabilitation are most oftenunder 80 years of age, thus perpetuating faulty perceptions regarding age.Drs. Kaufman and Becker found that older stroke patients who have multiple ill-nesses or cognitive impairment generally are not aware of the purpose of their ther-apy. A stroke patient's attention may focus on physical losses rather than on waysto overcome them. In response, health care professionals may develop a sense of fu-tility about therapy for older persons. The investigators speculate that the potentialconflict between patient goals and professional goals may significantly reduce accessto rehabilitation. These studies demonstrate that negative values about old age continue to infil-trate health care choices, even among health care professionals. However, ageshould never be the determining factor in selecting the best possible care for all pa-tients.340 Falls in Older People Have Many Causes Falling is a major cause of disability among older people. Each year, falls occur-in approximately one-third of all persons age 65 and older who live at home. About 50 percent of those who fall do so repeatedly. A common accident among older Ameri- cans, falls cause more than 200,000 hip fractures annually. They are also the lead- ing cause of accidental death in men and women over 85. Research supported by the NIA focuses on determining the extent to which physi- cal frailty and risk of injury can be reduced in older people. To learn which older individuals were at greatest risk of falling, NIA grantee Dr. Mary Tinetti at the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, CT, studied more than 300 people 75 years of age and older who were living in the community. At the beginning of Dr. Tinetti's study, the participants underwent a thorough evaluation, including standardized measures of their physical and mental health, strength, reflexes, balance, and gait. Participants recorded their falls in a diary and were called every other month to discuss the number of falls and the circumstances surrounding their occurrence. During the year the study was conducted, 32 percent of the participants fell at least once. Of those who fell, 24 percent were seriously injured, including 6 percent who suffered fractures. Twenty-six percent of those who fell reported that they had curtailed shopping, housecleaning, or other activities because of their fear of falling. Although some falls have a single, obvious cause, Dr. Tinetti found that most are due to a combination of risk factors. She observed that use of sedatives, changes in mental status, lower extremity disability, foot problems, and balance and gait abnor- malities were significant risks for falling. Other risk factors included changes in vision, hearing, muscle strength, and reflexes. In addition, environmental hazards contributed to the risk of falling. Dr. Tinetti also discovered that the tendency to fall increased with the actual number of risk factors present, from 8 percent for individuals with no risks to 78 percent for those with 4 or more risk factors. Her research suggests that it may be possible to prevent falls by modifying even a few of these risk factors. Dr. Tinetti and others have found that most older people fall during their usual daily activities, such as walking or changing position (for example, rising from a sit- ting to a standing position). A minority of falls-about 5 percent-occur during clearly hazardous activities, such as climbing on chairs or ladders or participating in sports. About 10 percent of falls occur on stairs, with descent more hazardous than ascent. Even those falls that do not result in injury may have serious psychological conse- quences. An older person who has fallen once tends to reduce his or her activity because of a fear of falling again. In addition, in an effort to prevent falls, family members and health care providers may discourage physical activity. This decrease in physical activity is particularly hazardous because inactivity itself leads to an in- creased risk of falling. Falls and fraility are mentioned as a contributing factor in about 40 percent of nursing home admissions. Now that researchers have identified the factors that increase the risk of falling, falls can no longer be considered'random, unpredictable events. The first step in preventing falls is identifying the disabilities and other risk factors that predispose older people to fall. Studies are underway to identify interventions that will mini- mize the risk of falling without compromising an older person's independence. Risk of Heart Disease May Be Greater for Hostile Individuals Individuals who are hostile, especially if they are arrogant, argumentative, surly, and rude, appear to increase their chance of having coronary heart disease (CHD). That's the finding of researchers at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County (UMBC) and the GRC. It has long been suspected, but not fully confirmed, that individuals displaying type A personality characteristics such as hostility, competitiveness, impatience, and a heightened sense of time urgency, are more likely to develop cardiac disease. One research project, the Western Collaborative Group Study, showed that type A behavior doubled the CHD risk. However, another study, the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trials (MRFIT), showed little or no association between type A traits and death from heart disease or nonfatal heart attacks. Dr. Theodore Dembroski at the UMBC, NIA intramural scientist Dr. Paul T. Costa, and their colleagues looked at one personality trait commonly found in type A people-\"potential for hostility.\" They examined the relationship between hostile behavior and an increased risk for coronary death and nonfatal heart attacks341 among nearly 600 participants in the MRFIT. The participants ranged in age from35 to 75 years old. IThe investigators measured three interrelated components of hostility, as well asoverall type A behavior, as possible predictors of sudden death and nonfatal heartattack. After adjusting for known coronary risk factors such as high blood cholester-ol, smoking, and hypertension, they found that \"potential for hostility\" was positive-ly linked to an increased risk for heart disease, especially in younger participants.In and of itself, however, type A behavior was not found to be an independent riskfactor for CHD. These findings suggest that hostility may be unhealthy enough to jeopardize one'shealth. Future health risk profiles may be devised with this behavior trait in mind. Depression's Debilitating Effects Depression can be defined in two ways. The first is a medical orientation thatrefers to a prolonged psychiatric disorder. The second is a lay term which encom-passes a general feeling of sadness. A new study finds that both types of depression can be as debilitating as a seriousheart condition. In fact, it is more disabling than most chronic physical conditions.People with traditional symptoms of depression report more days in bed and per-ceive more physical pain than patients experiencing back, lung, or gastrointestinalproblems, angina, or diabetes. Of these conditions, only serious heart conditions cancause more days in bed and only arthritis can be more painful.These findings come from the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS), supported in partby NIA, and conducted by the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, CA. The MOS isthe largest and most comprehensive patient-oriented observational study to comparemedical, psychological, and social outcomes of patients treated at various healthcare facilities. Investigators included Dr. John Ware at the New England MedicalCenter in Boston, MA, Dr. Kenneth Wells at the University of California at Los An-geles' Neuropsychiatric Institute and Hospital and Dr. Alvin Tarlov at the Henry J.Kaiser Family Foundation, Menlo Park, CA.In the MOS, investigators surveyed 22,462 patients and 523 physicians at HMOs,large group practices, and individual practices in Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles.Participants ranged in age from 18 to 103 years old. The study focused, not on ill-ness per se, but on how the patient actually functions and feels. A cross-section ofthe total sample participated in tests evaluating physical and social functioning,mental health, health perceptions, and bodily pain. A key finding from this study is that depression is as disabling as chronic medicalconditions in performing routine, daily activities such as walking, dressing, and vis-iting friends. Moreover, depression in combination with a chronic medical conditiongreatly compounds the dysfunction that may be associated with the medical prob-lem alone. Performance of everyday activities is particularly difficult for patientssuffering both depression and a chronic medical condition. For example, patientssuffering from depression and coronary artery disease were twice as likely to haveproblems with social relationships as patients with only one of these conditions.In addition, the MOS uncovered significant findings about the effects of physicalillnesses. The study found that most chronic conditions make it difficult for a personto conduct everyday activities and maintain a positive attitude. Health perceptionswere most negative for patients with congestive heart failure or gastrointestinal dis-orders and most positive for those with hypertension or back problems. Daily func-tioning was easiest for hypertensives and most difficult for those with heart dis-eases. In summary, this study demonstrates that depression can cause disability assevere as other major chronic conditions. Further, a patient's physical symptomsmay mask the depression. It is essential for physicians to be aware of the influencedepression can have on the course of an illness, to make accurate diagnoses, andoffer proper care for people who complain even when the complaints are nonspe-cific. According to the investigators, the method they have used to evaluate illnessmight prove valuable in assessing the overall progress of ongoing treatment becauseit considers the patient's concerns and monitors for more than one condition.Further analysis of data will include age-specific differences in the sample popula-tion. Researchers Investigate Depression and Increased Risk of Cancer In addition to examining the influence depression has on the course of a diseasescientists are also looking at the influence depression has on the cause of a disease.For some time, researchers have debated the relationship between emotions and dis-ease. Emotional distress has been implicated as a risk factor for a variety of medical342 conditions, including heart disease, allergies, and cancer. One theory suggests that depression lowers immune function, making persons who are depressed more likely to develop disease. Several research projects are investigating the connection be- tween disease and depression-one such study focuses on cancer. Intramural researchers at the GRC have found that people who are depressed do not have an increased risk of developing cancer, as some experts previously be- lieved. Drs. Alan Zonderman, Paul T. Costa, Jr., and Robert R. McCrae, examined data from a followup study of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I (NHANES I) to learn whether those people who were depressed at the time of the initial survey were more likely to develop cancer than those who were not depressed. Between 1971 and 1975, NHANES I collected medical and psychological data from more than 6,900 men and women across the United States who were between 25 and 75 years of age. As part of the study, all participants took a psychological test which measured the symptoms of chronic depression. To confirm this diagnosis, about one- third of the participants took a second psychological test that also measured depres- sion. In 1981, a followup study gathered data on the NHANES I participants who could be traced. To determine what had happened to participants since the NHANES I study, researchers collected medical information from hospital records and from death certificates for those people who had died since the initial survey. They were able to account for 93 percent of the original participants. Dr. Zonderman and his colleagues analyzed this followup data and found no sig- nificant differences in cancer deaths associated with depression. Adjustments for the effects of common risk factors for cancer-such as sex, age, smoking history, and family history of cancer-did not change the results of the study. Beginning in 1986, the NIA researchers retraced participants who were 55 years. or older at the time of the NHANES I study to examine the health changes that occurred in this older age group. In this second followup study, information was col- lected on 96 percent of the 3,980 participants who were 55 years or older at the time of NHANES I and who participated in the first followup study. In this study, as in the first followup, there were no significant associations between death from cancer and symptoms of depression for either test of depression. Study results were un- changed when analyzed separately for men and women. The results supported the earlier followup study. This finding confirms the results of two separate studies but contrasts with re- sults from an earlier, smaller investigation into the question of the cause and effect relationship between depression and cancer. The NIA findings are strengthened be- cause the researchers used two widely accepted tests for depression and because they studied a nationally representative group of people. Moreover, the results were not biased by participant selection because no one was eliminated from the study for health reasons. This study does not support the theory that depressive symptoms are a risk factor for cancer. Smoking and Body Fat Studied GRC researchers have discovered yet another reason to quit smoking. Results of a large-scale study show that cigarette smoking produces a redistribution of body fat which is associated with coronary heart disease. Smokers who quit often gain weight around the hips, a relatively benign region in terms of health effects. This link between smoking and body fat proved true for the younger and older partici- pants. Hundreds of worldwide studies provide convincing evidence of the harmful effects of cigarette smoking which takes a major toll on the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and other organ systems. According to the U.S. Surgeon General's Office, male cigarette smokers are at 22 times the risk for lung cancer and more than one of every six deaths in the Nation can be traced to cigarettes. Although about 1.3 million people \"kick the habit\" each year, some 30 percent of the adult population continue to smoke. Approximately 1 million people start smok- ing each year. One reason some smokers refuse to quit is weight control. Evidence shows that many smokers do gain weight after quitting. It comes as little surprise then, that smokers as a group, are relatively lean. This latest research, conducted by GRC scientists, Dr. Hiroshi Shimokata, Denis C. Muller, and NIA's clinical director, Dr. Reubin Andres, involved an in-depth analysis of the smoking histories and body measurements on 1,122 men, aged 19 to 102 years, all volunteers in the Institute s Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging343 (BLSA). Participants visited the GRC regularly to undergo a battery of physiologicaland behavioral tests. The GRC investigators used waist and hip circumferences and the waist-hip ratio(WHR) as parameters to assess body fat. All measurements were taken in a stand-ing position. To adjust for height, the body mass index (BMI) was computed and theweight divided by the square of the height. An adjustment was also allowed for age.The findings of the study have unexpected and important clinical implications forthe smoking public. While total weight and BMI proved lower among smokers whencompared to nonsmokers, the circumference of the waist and the WHR in smokerswas greater in the cigarette smokers than the nonsmokers. This variance increasedproportionately with the actual number of cigarettes smoked daily.Further, the scientists report that despite a modest increase in weight amongsmokers who quit, the increase in WHR was less than would have been anticipated.Those participants who started smoking during the course of the study experienceda decline in total body weight (on the average) but their WHR increased. Thus, ciga-rette smoking influenced the placement of fat in the body. Previous studies have demonstrated that when body fat accumulates primarilyaround the waist, individuals greatly increase their risk or developing cardiovascu-lar disease. In addition, experts have noted a marked propensity for developing dia-betes when the waist-hip ratio is high. This is an especially important finding forolder people because the incidence of diabetes and heart disease increases with age.The investigators conclude that people who continue to smoke in order to controltheir body weight are making a doubly bad bargain with their health. Exercise Prevents Disabling Bone Loss in Older Women Each year osteoporosis causes 1.5 million fractures of the wrist, spine, hip, andother parts of the skeleton in people over age 45. This bone-thinning condition,which affects more women than men, develops silently over a period of many years.Gradually and without discomfort, bone loss occurs, leading to a weakened structureless able to support normal daily activities. A minor fall or blow that would notinjure most people can easily break one or more bones in someone with severe osteo-porosis. Fractures directly related to osteoporosis cost Americans an estimated $7 to$10 billion annually. NIA grantees have found that exercise deters the bone loss leading to osteoporo-sis. Dr. Everett L. Smith and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin in Madisonstudied the benefit of a 4-year exercise program in previously inactive women be-tween 35 and 65 years of age (with an average age of 50). Although investigatorshave compared bone loss in active and inactive women at a specific age, few havefollowed the effects of exercise in the same women over a period of many years. Re-searchers believe that early prevention of bone loss could greatly reduce the numberof fractures later in life. Before entering the study, each participant had a thorough physical examination,including measurements of bone mass and a treadmill test to assess her level of fit-ness. The 62 women in the control group did not participate in any organized exer-cise program, but continued their normal daily activities. The 80 women in the exer-cise group participated in a 45-minute exercise program three times a week.Each exercise session included a warmup period, 25 minutes of aerobic exercise(dancing, walking, or jogging), and a cooldown period. During the first year of thestudy, exercises were designed primarily to increase participants' aerobic capacity.During successive years, light wrist weights, push-ups, and various dance routinesthat strenghten the upper body were added. Dr. Smith measured bone width and bone mass in both forearm bones and in theupper arm bones. Measurements were taken every 3 months during the first yearand every 6 months for the next 3 years. He found that bone width and bone massdeclined significantly in all three bones of both arms of the participants in the con-trol group. The rate of decline was significantly less in the exercise group. To determine if menopause influenced the response to exercise, Dr. Smith ana-lyzed premenopausal and menopausal participants separately. As a woman passesthrough menopause, her body produces less estrogen. This hormone influences bonemass by slowing or halting bone loss. As the level of estrogen drops, bones becomeless dense. Dr. Smith found that premenopausal and postmenopausal women whoexercised did not lose as much bone mass as did the women who did not exercise.The results of this study indicate that physical activity significantly reduces boneloss in middle-aged women. In related research, NIA grantee Dr. Gail P. Dalsky and coworkers at the Wash-ington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO examined the effects of exer-344 cise on the spine. Dr. Dalsky studied a short-term exercise training program (9 months), which was followed by 13 months without exercise, and a long-term exer- cise training program (22 months). Participants were healthy, inactive women be- tween the ages of 55 and 70. At the beginning of the study, the women had a thorough physical examination, measurement of bone mass, and a treadmill test. Participants were given 1,500 mg. of calcium daily since some researchers believe that a shortage of calcium after menopause is associated with the development of osteoporosis. The 19 women in the exercise group did weight-bearing exercises (walking, jog- ging, and climbing stairs) for 50 to 60 minutes three times a week. Dr. Dalsky found that bone mass in the lower spine increased significantly after the short-term weight-bearing exercise program and that an increase in bone mass was maintained during the long-term training program. After training stopped, bone mass reverted to what it had been at the beginning of the study, even with calcium intake staying at the level used during the study. These results suggest that exercising led to the increase in bone mass. Although previous animal studies confirm this finding, this is the first time re- searchers have shown in humans that gains in bone mass during an exercise train- ing program are lost when exercising is stopped. Dr. Dalsky's study indicates that continuous weight-bearing exercise can increase bone mass in postmenopausal women. Future studies will investigate more specifically the exact amount and best type of exercise necessary to prevent bone loss. Additional research is also needed to de- velop alternative exercise programs for people with joint and mobility problems that keep them from participating in aerobic exercises. Physical Performance Measures Should Be Implemented in Aging Research and Clin- ical Practice Evaluating a person's functional abilities has long been a cornerstone of geriatric research and practice. Generally, this evaluation is based on the patient's self-report of his or her abilities. However, NIA intramural scientists Drs. Jack Guralnik and J. David Curb, in collaboration with Drs. Laurence Branch at the Boston University School of Public Health and Steven Cummings at the University of California at San Francisco believe that now is the time to supplement this process with objective performance measures. An objective performance measurement is one in which the individual performs a specific task and is evaluated in a uniform manner using predetermined criteria. Some tests measure an individual's ability to accomplish activities of daily living such as walking; others assess more difficult or vigorous activities requiring balance or strength. Most of the recently developed instruments involve timing or measur- ing specific actions rather than simply asssessing the participants' ability to per- form or not perform the entire task. The NIA researchers believe objective measurements may compensate for many of the limitations found in self-reports. For example, objective measures may reduce the confusion between an individual's assessment of his or her ability and the as- sessment of a family member. They are easier to reproduce and not as easily influ- enced by a person's poor cognitive functioning or by culture, language, and educa- tion as other evaluation techniques. There are some disadvantages associated with objective assessments, notably- such tests require time, specialized equipment, and trained personnel. In addition, while they can indicate a patient's functional ability, objective tests may not ac- count for an individual's ability to adapt to the environment. Dr. Guralnik and his colleagues believe the time is right for the field of gerontolo- gy to begin a focused research effort addressing this issue. They indicate that addi- tional research is necessary to assure the development of reliable and valid perform- ance tests. They also point to some important clinical applications. Physicians, for example, may be able to use these tests to track a patient's ability over time. Such comparisons may aid in developing early interventions to prevent the physical con- sequences that can occur in patients having one or more chronic conditions. Urinary Incontinence in Nursing Home Residents Nearly 1 million nursing home residents in this country (over half) suffer from loss of bladder control, or urinary incontinence. The U.S. Surgeon General estimates that the yearly cost of managing urinary incontinence in nursing homes exceeds $8 billion. Tragically, few nursing home residents who are incontinent have had any type of diagnostic evaluation or treatment.345 Although researchers have identified a number of different types of incontinence,surprisingly little is known about which forms of urinary incontinence are mostwidespread among nursing home residents. NIA grantee Dr. Neil M. Resnick atBrigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA has identified a previously unrecog-nized form of incontinence that is particularly common among frail older people.Prior to Dr. Resnick's study, researchers believed that incontinence in nursinghome residents was due almost exclusively to involuntary bladder contractionswhich cause urine to leak before an individual can reach the toilet. This condition iscalled detrusor hyperreflexia (DH). In most cases, the amount of urine lost is moder-ate and the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after voiding is small.Using a number of techniques to measure bladder function, Dr. Resnick has iden-tified a condition called detrusor hyperactivity with impaired contractility (DHIC).This form of urinary incontinence is similar to DH in that the bladder contractsinvoluntarily. Unlike DH, a significant amount of urine remains in the bladderafter voiding. The bladder contraction empties only one-fourth to one-half of thebladder volume. Thus, in addition to causing incontinence, this condition is associat-ed with urinary retention, which can lead to serious infections.Dr. Resnick identified DHIC in patients in a nursing home and two hospitals. Thestudy included 32 patients-27 women and 5 men. The nursing home residents aver-aged 89 years of age. The average age of hospitalized patents was 79 years. Partici-pants had been incontinent more than three times per week for more than 2months. Half of the patients had severe mental or physical disabilities.Dr. Resnick found no significant differences between nursing home residents andhospitalized patients with DHIC. He studied the characteristics of patients' inconti-nence, their other illnesses and any previous surgeries, and the medications theywere taking. Participants underwent extensive urologic tests. They also had a thor-ough neurologic examination, as well as an assessment of their mental status andtheir ability to perform daily activities. Nursing assistants completed 48-hourrecords of voiding frequency and incontinence episodes for each patient.Aside from the fact that DHIC is common among nursing home residents, it's di-agnosis is important because this form of incontinence causes the bladder to retainurine. Urine retention can be especially harmful in patients taking medications thatalso cause the bladder to retain urine. In addition, DHIC may be easily misdiag-nosed and mistreated. For example, this form of incontinence may closely mimicprostate obstruction in men and stress incontinence in women, resulting in unneces-sary and potentially harmful surgery.In a followup study of incontinence in nursing home residents, Dr. Resnick ob-served that the most common types were DH and DHIC. Approximately 61 percentof the 94 patients in this study had these forms of incontinence. The average age ofpatients was 89 years. Surprisingly, he found that the types of incontinence in pa-tients with dementia, mobility problems, or both did not differ markedly from thetypes of urinary incontinence in individuals without these disabilities. Thus, correct-able causes of incontinence are much more common than previously believed, evenin nursing home patients who are demented.Urinary incontinence in frail older persons cannot be dismissed as merely due toadvanced age, dementia, immobility, or institutionalization, although these factorsmay play a part. In a large number of patients, the cause or causes of incontinencecan be identified, and in many cases, the condition can be significantly improved orcured. Patients should not be excluded automatically from urologic examinationsand treatment simply because of age, frailty, or the fact that they are in a nursinghome. If the patient's overall health makes treatment feasible, the cause of inconti-nence should be carefully sought. Pharmacology and Aging People over age 65 comprise 12 percent of the Nation's population, but consumeover 30 percent of the prescription drugs dispensed. Geriatric patients commonlysuffer from multiple disorders for which they often take several medications whoseside effects and interactions may diminish therapeutic efficacy and cause clinicalproblems. It is important to consider the use of medications by older people in the context ofthe most recent research. Three key points include the need to: (1) Distinguish in-trinsic aging factors from extrinsic factors-such as lifestyles, environmental influ-ences, diseases, or the effects of medications already being taken; (2) recognize theimmense variability among older people relative to use and dosage of medications;and (3) identify restoration of function as the principle goal of treatment.346 In addition, we need to know more about how the side effects of medications may contribute to problems frequently seen in older people, including falls, incontinence, and confusion. It is also important to learn more about the long-term effects of chronically administered medications on the lives of older people who are taking them. The NIA and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute currently sup- port a clinical trial for treatment of systolic hypertension. In this trial, the drugs used are monitored for their possible effects on mood and cognitive or physical func- tioning, as well as on blood pressure itself. Another NIA study examines the risks and benefits of antimicrobial treatment for chronic urinary tract infections. In August 1989, NIA issued a Request for Applications titled \"Pharmacology in Geriatric Medicine\" to stimulate a broad spectrum of research relevant to the use and effectiveness of medications in older people. This initiative encourages research on such topics as: New pharmacologic approaches for geriatric problems such incontinence; effects of age-related physiologic changes or dis- eases on responses to medications; causes, prevalence, clinical consequences, and prevention of specific drug side effects and adverse reactions; the role of medications in causing, exacerbating, or ameliorating problems such as falls and gait disorders, confusion, and depression; drug-drug and drug-nutrient interactions; and determin- ing efficacy and side effects in geriatric patients of newly introduced drugs. Older Rural Populations Problems of access to and affordability of medical and social services are of poten- tial concern to people of all ages, but are particularly important issues for older people living in rural areas. In general, rural areas support a narrower range of services and have a higher proportion of poor and medically uninsured individuals than do urban areas. Rural residents typically live at some distance from physi- cians, hospitals, and other social services, and do not have access to public transpor- tation. In addition, many rural communities face a continuing problem in recruiting and retaining health care professionals. The NIA has supported a major epidemiological project on older rural populations in Iowa since 1981. A second epidemiological project, begun in North Carolina in 1984, studies black populations in both rural and urban settings. Other NIA re- search focuses on social support systems in rural areas and farm family intergenera- tional relations. Both the House and Senate appropriations report language for FY 1989 encour- aged an expanded program of research on the health and social needs of older rural residents. In addition, both the House and Senate requested NIA consider establish- ing a center for studies of older, rural populations. In February 1989, NIA convened a panel of experts to consider the feasibility of this center and the role of the NIA in health-related research concerning older, rural populations. As a result, NIA rec- ommended a program calling for the establishment of multiple centers at several sites accessible to older rural populations and funding investigator-initiated re- search. The NIA is currently considering expanding its research on the health and well- being of older rural residents-including the proposed center-although the degree to which expansion occurs will depend largely on the availability of funds. Topics of potential interest include: the epidemiology of pesticide exposure and neurologic dis- eases, sun exposure as a risk factor, geriatric and functional assessment of older rural residents, injury prevention and control, formal and informal health care sys- tems, health behaviors, and the well-being and quality of life among older rural people. ARTHRPs An age-related disease of unknown cause, osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by slowly developing local joint pain, stiffness, limitation of motion, and possible de- formity. It is the most common form of arthritis and affects most adults over age 60. New Grading Scale Is Developed To Assess OA in the Hands NIA intramural scientists Drs. Jordan D. Tobin and Douglas A Kallman of the GRC have developed a grading scale that is more accurate in diagnosing OA of the hand than assessment methods previously used. This new method is especially im- portant because the scale used before (the Kellgren/Lawrence scale) was unable to assess many of the joints in the hands. Participants in the study were male volunteers from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA), GRC's ongoing study to assess the aging processes of healthy adults. Radiographic examinations of the hands of 177 participants were347 made over a period of 20 years and then analyzed using the Killgren/Lawrence scale and the newer grading scale. Drs. Tobin and Kaillman found the newer scale had a higher degree of accuracy in the initial diagnosis, in determining the preva- lence of specific joint abnormalities, and in characterizing the progression of the dis-ease-all factors that will help physicians treat the growing number of older pa- tients. The Impact of Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis on Daily Activities The debilitating impact of arthritis on an older person's ability to function is well documented. Little is known, however, about the impact of different types of arthri- tis on an individual's ability to perform his or her daily activities. NMA-supported researcher, Dr. Edward H. Yelin at the University of California at San Francisco has found that while OA negatively affected some of the activities evaluated in this study, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had a negative impact on all activities. These in- cluded household chores, shopping and errands, social relationships, leisure pur- suits, religious activities, public or volunteer work, and employment. Dr. Yelin's 5-year longtudinal study involved 825 persons aged 50 and over who were diagnosed with QA and HA. The patiewere ere randomly selected from the practices of Northern California rheumatologists and were compared with healthy individuals of the same age and sex who were living in the same community. When patients were compared with people without arthritis, patients with RA ex- perienced greater loss in all studied activities and patients with QA experienced greater loss in only some activities (i.e., performing household chores, shopping and errands, and leisure activities). Thus, the study confirms that OA and HA can limit an indivdual's ability to function in later years, but that RA takes an even greatertoll than OA. HYPERTENSION The NIA supports a number of studies that examine hypertension, a condition ex-isting in half of all people over 65. Dr. William B. Applegate, an NHLBI grantee and a member of the NIA Advisory Council, recently analyzed the benefits and risks of the most common therapies for older people suffering from hypertension. Dr. Applegate, from the University of Tennessee Center for Health Sciences in Memphis, suggests that physicians take special care with older patients and watch for the side effects of the medications used to control blood pressure. At least 40 percent of hypertensive older people are now being treated with drugs which have the potential for affecting their quality of life, mood, and energy level. One of the studies he discusses is the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Pro-gram (SHEP), jointly supported by NIA and NHLBI, which examines isolated systol- ic hypertension (ISH). The results of SHEP's double-blind intervention trial are ex-pected in the next two years, and will provide definitive recommendations on ISH treatment, including benefits and side effects, in older people. In people over age 65, ISH more than doubles the risk of stroke. In screening forthe SHEP pilot study, the prevalence of ISH was about 10 percent of persons over 70 years old, and 20 percent of persons over 80 years old have this form of high blood pressure. Among drug therapies, diuretics are the most effective type of drug used in lower- ing blood pressure in older people. However, Dr. Applegate indicates that a variety of other classes of antihypertensive medications are effective in older patients. The most commonly reported side effects from hypertensive medications are:problems with balance and dizziness upon standing up; confusion and depression; delayed mental reaction time; potential alterations in blood flow to the brain or kid- neys; urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. Older persons do not always experience side effects from the medications. A pilot study of SHEP suggested that ISH can be fairly easily treated with drugs in older people, with relatively low rates of adverse responses. In a separate study of olderpatients who were otherwise healthy, drug treatment revealed that harmful side ef- fects were no more common in older than younger patients. But little data has been collected on the impact of such medications in frail older people who suffer fromother serious illnesses. In the pilot study for SHEP, 551 subjects with ISH were treated with a diuretic and an additional drug if needed, and compared with a placebo group. Seventy-five percent had their ISH controlled with the diuretic alone. There were no substantial differences between the control and treatment groups in terms of toxic reactions to the drugs. 26-386 0 -90 -12348 Dr. Applegate also mentions types of therapy that do not involve drugs for older hypertensive people. These interventions include weight loss for overweight people, sodium restriction, cessation of alcohol, regular aerobic exercise, and relaxation therapy. Treatment of hypertension in older people may become a matter of individual choice in weighing the advantages of a slightly extended lifespan against the disad- vantages of side effects that can include diminished emotional or cognitive func- tions, mobility and balance, or sexual interest. Dr. Applegate warns that in some cases the risks of treatment may outweigh the benefits. AIDS AND OLDER AMERICANS Although most AIDs victims are in a younger age group, the disease affects a large number of middle-aged and older adults. In fact, 10 percent of all AIDS cases reported since the start of the epidemic have involved people aged 50 and over. By 1992 the number of middle-aged and older adults with AIDS is expected to reach 100,000; and for those aged 60 and over the number will be 10,000. MIA Scientists Study Immune Functions in Older Persons With AIDS Dr. William B. Adler of NIA's intramural program at the Gerontology Research Center in Baltimore, MD, is currently studying the course of the illness, the re- sponse to AZT (azidothymidine) therapy, and the changes in immune status in indi- viduals with AIDS who are over age 60. Older persons with AIDS survive a shorter length of time following infection with HIV than do younger persons. This shortened survival for older patients was origi- nally believed to be related to how the infection occurred-that is, through contami- nated blood transfusions rather than other modes of infection. However, this has not proven to be the case since all older patients demonstrate a shortened survival period regardless of the mode of infection. Dr. Adler's study includes 123 individuals with AIDS (adults of all ages). In an attempt to understand why older individuals react differently to an HIV infection the study focuses not only on AIDS, but also on the functional decline of the immune system that occurs normally with advancing age. This decline results in older people becoming more susceptible to infections illnesses and a greater likeli- hood of death as a result of these infections. Thus, at a time in life when older people are already developing an immunodeficiency, the HIV furthe compromises immune function, causing the disease to progress more rapidly. If much of the pathology seen in AIDS is due to the immune system's response to infected tissue, then younger patients would be expected to be sicker and have a shortened survival. However, this is not the case. Dr. Adler hopes that the examina- tion of HIV infection on people of different ages may reveal information useful for the treatment and prevention of AIDS. Publication of NIA Sourcebook on AIDS in Older Persons A sourcebook, AIDS in an Aging Society 1, was recently compiled by the staff of NIA's Behavioral and Social Research program. The volume discusses issues and presents data concerning the AIDS epidemic and the common misconception that the epidemic represents no threat to people over ago 50. Acceptance of this belief has led people to assume prevention efforts are wasted on middle-aged and older people. It also disguises the problem of the rapidly growing need for health care fa- cilities by AIDS patients of all ages. This need will intensify as people with AIDS have to compete with disabled older adults for long-term care resources which are already in short supply. . The chapters were written by researchers throughout the United States who are studying AIDS and aging processes. They address social and behavioral scientists in- volved in research, professionals in practice, and public policymakers who are con- cerned with the far-reaching implications of AIDS on people of every age. AGING AND MINORrry POPULATIONS NIA is especially interested in research to improve the health and longevity of minority populations. Specifically, NIA studies cultural influences, life expectancy, health status, environmental influences, family structure, social networks, and prob- 'Riley. MW, Ory MG, Zablotsky D, eds. AIDS in an Aging Society: What We Need to Know. New York: Springer Publishing Company, 1989.349 lems associated with life transitions as they relate to African American, Asian, His- panic, and Native American minorities. Relatively little is known about how minori- ties age. NIA will continue to encourage an expanded effort in this area. Older African Americans Have Varied Support Networks It has long been known that older people frequently turn to family members for aid in times of troule. Yet, disproportionately high rates of poverty, poor health, and single parent families place especially heavy burdens on African American families just to maintain everyday lives. With these demands and strains within Black fami- lies, to whom do older African Americans turn for help? As one example of research focused on minority populations, NIA grantees Drs. Robert Joseph Taylor and Linda M. Chatters at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Dr. Vickie M. Mays at the University of California at Los Angeles exam- ined data from the 1980 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (a well-known, long-term study of family economics). This survey asked a representative sample of family members to whom they would turn for assistance during an extended time of trou- ble. Respondents ranged from 19-94 years of age; 20.7 percent were 56 or older. Dr. Taylor and his colleagues analyzed the 2,533 responses of African Americans. Re- sults showed that Black Americans have developed a variety of networks for sup- port that include and extend beyond the immediate family. Many similarities in helper networks were found among all population groups. For African Americans, as well as for non-minority older people, the parent-child bond appears to be of primary importance. Being able to turn to adult children in an emergency is considered most important for all older people. Additionally, this study confirms that widows from all ethnic groups seem to have comparatively fewer sources of assistance and frequently rely on distant relatives or non-kin. Racial differences in informal networks show African Americans less likely than Whites and Hispanics to mention in-laws as a source of help; they were however more likely to mention siblings and aunts or uncles. More than 20 percent of the African American participants cited nonfamily members as important sources of support. According to Dr. Taylor and colleagues, support from the church or neigh- bors may be especially important for rural Blacks whose adult children have mi- grated to cities. As the population of older Americans grows-and the proportion who are minori- ties increase even more rapidly, any of the responsibilities for assisting older rela- tives will fall on the shoulders of family members. In African American communi- ties, a clear understanding of how family and friends can function as a helping net- work is necessary to develop realistic policies. Advance planning can strengthen the success of these efforts and allow older people to maintain their independence for as long as possible. D. TRAINING AND cAREER DEVELOPMENT IN GERIATRICS AND AGING REsEARcH The health care needs of a growing population of older persons will result in an increased requirement for geriatricians and other health care providers with train- ing in geriatrics. These growing needs will also require more individuals capable of conducting research in geriatrics and training future geriatricians. At present, the number of such individuals is limited. The Institute of Medicine, in 1987, recommended creating centers of excellence to train academic leaders in geriatrics. In response, NIA created a program of awards which were recently redesignated as the Claude D. Pepper Geriatric Research and Training Centers in honor of the late Senator Pepper. These centers are designed to enhance collaborative efforts in geriatric research and provide training and career development for academic geriatricians who will in- crease academic leadership in the field nationwide. The efforts of individuals trained at these centers will improve the quality of medical care available to our older population. One Center was established in FY 1989 at the University of Michi- gan. It is anticipated that at least one additional center will be awarded in FY 1990. Two complementary awards are the Geriatric Research Institutional Training (GRIT) award and the Geriatric Academic Program (GAP) award. These awards pro- vide a continuum of support from the fellowship to the faculty level. The NIA also supports traditional individual fellowship and institutional training grants found throughout NIH. In addition, NIA supports Special Emphasis Research Career Awards (SERCA) which provide opportunities for researchers trained in one scientific field to develop expertise in allied fields. NIA-supported SERCAs foster the careers of researchers with interests in three special areas: behavioral geriatrics, nutrition and metabolism, and otolaryngology.350 NIA is an active participant in NIH's recent initiative to provide increased re- search experience for underrepresented minorities. The program is targeted to vari- ous levels of students and scientists including high school students, college graduate and undergraduate students, junior faculty members. The NIA intramural program is a major setting for postdoctoral training of prom- ising young investigators (both M.D.'s and Ph.D. s) for research careers in aging-re- lated biomedical and behavioral sciences. Other NIA research and training efforts include a summer institute designed to recruit new postdoctoral students into the field of aging research. m. OTHER REsEARcH ON AGING SUPPORTED AND CONDUCTED BY THE NATIONAL INsTITUTEs OF HEALTH A. NATIONAL CANCER INSTTTUTE Cancer incidence increases with increasing age. Although aging is not the cause of cancer, the two processes are related. More than 80 percent of all cancers occur in persons age 50 and older, and 58 percent occur in people age 65 and over. This year the National Cancer Institute (NCI) contributed to advances in health care for older people through a number of research projects, educational programs, and intervention efforts. Early Detection of Breast Cancer In 1989, about 142,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 43,000 women will die from this disease. Cancer Statistics Review 1978- 1986, published by NCI in May 1989 showed that during the 14-year period of the report, the incidence rate for breast cancer in women age 50 and older was nearly 10 times higher than in younger women. During the same period, the mortality rate from breast cancer in women age 50 and older increased 5 percent compared to a 9 percent decrease for women younger than 50. Early diagnosis improves survival and mammography is the most effective way to detect breast cancer in its earliest stages. However, the 1987 National Health Inter- view Survey revealed that only 17 percent of U.S. women age 40 and older had a screening manmogram during the previous year. Therefore, NCI has engaged in many activities to encourage women age 40 and older to get periodic mammograms, have an annual breast exam by a physician, and perform monthly breast self-exami- nations. This year 11 health care and medical research organizations, including NCI, issued breast cancer screening guidelines stating that asymptomatic women between ages 40 and 50 should have an annual clinical breast examination with mammo- graphic screening every 1 to 2 years. Beginning at age 50, both the clinical examina- tion and mammography should be performed yearly. Scientists estimate that breast cancer deaths would decline by at least 30 percent if women followed these guide- lines. Breast Cancer Treatment In the 'area of breast cancer treatment, three NCI-funded clinical trials reported that many women with node-negative (no spread to underarm lymph nodes) breast cancer may benefit from adjuvant treatments (chemotherapy or hormonal therapy after primary treatment). Each year about half of all patients diagnosed with breast cancer have node-negative disease. Two of the trials were conducted by the NCI-funded National Surgical 'Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, chaired by Dr. Bernard Fisher at the University of Pitts- burgh in Pennsylvania. Twenty-five institutions collaborated in one of the trials and 52 institutions collaborated in the other. The third NIC-funded trial was a collaborative effort of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, the Southwest Oncology Group, and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B. The study was chaired by Dr. Edward Mansour at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. The results provided the impetus for a \"Clinical Alert\" issued to physicians when the data first became available and prior to their publication in a journal. A follow- up assessment of the alert revealed that 75 percent of responding physicians had changed their treatment practice as a result of information provided. Using data: on more than 125,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer from 1973 to 1984, intramural researchers Dr. Rosemary Yancik and Lyn Ries, and Dr. Jerome Yates at Rosewell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, NY, studied the influence of advancing age on breast cancer. They found that 43 percent of newly diagnosed351 cases occur in women age 65 or older, that older women are more likely to present initially with more advanced cancers, that older women tend to have less extensive surgery than younger women, and that older women live as long as younger women after treatment for localized and regional stage disease. However, for distant dis- ease, older women do much worse. Replacement Hormone Therapy NIC visiting scientist Dr. Leif Bergkvist at the University Hospital in Uppsala, Sweden, intramural researchers Drs. Robert Hoover and Catherine Schairer and their colleagues conducted a study of 23,244 Swedish women who used replacement hormones (both estrogen and estrogen-progestin combinations) to ease symptoms of menopause. They reported that the risk of breast cancer was increased by 70 per- cent among those who had used estrogens for more than 9 years. Few women in this study used conjugated estrogens (the form most commonly used in the United States), so a risk estimate for this type of therapy could not be determined by this study. Prostate Cancer Treatments Found primarily in men age 50 and older, prostate cancer becomes increasingly common with each decade of life. In 1989, an estimated 103,000 new cases of pros- tate cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 28,500 men will die from the disease. It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in men. Based on the results of an NCI-funded clinical trial, the Food and Drug Adminis- tration this year approved the use of a combination drug therapy (flutamide and leuprolide) for advanced prostate cancer. The study showed that individuals with ad- vanced prostate cancer who were treated with the drug combination survived nearly 25 percent longer than men treated with leuprolide alone. Collaborating on this study were intramural researcher Dr. Andrew Dorr; Dr. David Crawford and Marilyn Davis at the University of Colorado in Denver; Dr. Mario Eisenberger at the University of Maryland Cancer Center in Baltimore; Dr. David McLeod at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC; Dr. Joseph Spaulding at the University of California in San Francisco; Dr. Ralph Benson at the Mayo Medical School in Rochester, MN; and Dr. Brent Blumenstein and Phyllis Goodman at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA. In 1989 intramural researcher Dr. Charles Myers and his colleagues at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, reported preliminary findings showing that the anticancer drug suramin produced tumor regression in 50 percent of a group of ad- vanced prostate cancer patients who had failed standard therapy. NCI-funded phase II clinical trials of suramin at NCI and three other institutions are attempting to confirm the 50-percent reduction. Current hormonal therapy yields a similar response rate (40 percent), however, patients often relapse within 18 months and die following 6 to 10 months. Clinical Trials NCI has a major initiative to double the number of patients enrolled in clinical trials by 1992, with special emphasis placed on increasing involvement of older people. Information and education programs are aimed at encouraging older pa- tients to consider clinical trials as a treatment option. Smoking In 1989, NCI provided technical assistance to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and Philadelphia's Fox Chase Cancer Center for the development and testing of a targeted smoking cessation program for people age 50 and older. In the newly initiated American Stop-Smoking Intervention Study, a joint project with the American Cancer Society, NCI hopes to reach at least 15 million smokers, in- cluding the 50-plus age group, through 20 community-based tobacco control coali- tions nationwide. Joint Projects Two joint projects on cancer education for older people began in 1989. NCI is working with AARP to develop and education resource kit for AARP's Health Advo- cacy Services Volunteers throughout the Nation. To identify the most appropriate materials for the kit, NCI and AARP conducted a direct-mail needs assessment of volunteers. Production of the jointly funded kit is planned for early 1990.352 Representatives from NOT are working in collaboration with NIA on a joint initia- tive to help older people learn ways to reduce their cancer risk. One goal is to make older people more aware of the importance of receiving state-of-the-art cancer treat- ment; another is to conduct a joint needs assessment survey of older people to deter- mine what educational and intervention programs will be most effective. B. NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) supports and conducts-re- search as it relates to normal function and diseases of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, and blood. Protein Oxidation Correlated With Aging Process. Dr. Earl Stadtman, a NHLBI intramural scientist, has shown that oxidation of proteins (i.e., increasing the positive charges on the atoms) at specific sites and by specific reaction marks those proteins for subsequent degradation and disposal by protein-decomposing enzymes, or proteases, in cells. In Dr. Stadtman's studies, the amount of oxidized proteins in the livers of rats increased with age over a period of 2 to 26 months and this accumulation of oxidized proteins was paralleled by a de- crease in the activity of specific enzymes in the liver. The level of neutral proteases decreased in the livers with age, suggesting that a progressive loss of ability to de- grade the oxidized proteins is the reason for their accumulation. Oxidized proteins also are present in much higher concentration in the tissues of older people, possi- bly because of a similar mechanism. In related studies Dr. Stadtman found that accelerated oxidation of proteins occurs in rates exposed to higher-then-mormal levels of oxygen, in gerbil brains damaged by interruption of blood flow and subsequent reintroduction of blood, and in damaged rat brains when low soldum levels are corrected. A single injection of bacterial endotoxin, into rats provided a fivefold increase in the life span of animals exposed to 100 percent oxygen. The correlation of protein oxidation with age and the basic understanding of the mechanisms by which this occurs may further under- standing of the aging process. Aging Affects Diaphragm Contractility in Hamsters The potential importance of respiratory, chiefly inspiratory, muscle fatigue has been recognized only for the last decade. If inspiratory muscles fail, so do ventila- tion and tissue respiration. There are theoretical reasons to postulate inspiratory muscle failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and their is fairly good evidence that.respiratory muscle fatigue is important in certain neuromuscu- lar diseases such as polio, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, and myopathies. To learn how aging affects diaphragm function, Dr. Steven G. Kelsen, a grantee at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA, studied diaphragm contractility in young adult, middle-aged, and old hamsters. Using in vitro tests on muscle strips. Dr. Kelsen showed that the maximum active tension that could be developed by the muscles from older animals was significantly less than that developed by young adult and middle aged animals. In addition, other changes in the measures of muscle function were adversely affected by aging, such as the speed at which the muscle was capable of shortening. Dr. Kelsen councluded that aging adversely affects the tension-generating ability of the diaphragm, its velocity of shortening, and its resist- ance to fatigue. For healthy older humans, these results are probably of little importance, since the respiratory system normally has considerable reserve. However, for those with respiratory problems such as COPD, these findings show that aging in and of itself is likely to increase the risk of developing respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle fatique. Aging Shown To Affect Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation in Artery Wall Dr. Babette B. Weksler, a grantee at Cornell University Medical College in New York City has been studying the influence of aging on the development of arterio- sclerosis in experimental animals. According to one hypothesis, the early stages of arteriosclerosis are characterized by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the. artery wall at sites of injury to the cells that line the vessel. Such prolifera- tion is stimulated by growth factors (for example, platelet-derived growth factor) and slowed by growth inhibitors (for example, heparin). Dr. Weksler has shown that, following experimental injury to the vessel lining, SMC from the aortas of aged ani-353 mals proliferate at a greater rate than those from young animals, and the prolifera- tion of old vascular SMC is less dependent on serum or added growth factors than that of young vascular SMC. Aging thus favors the development of arteriosclerosis by releasing SMC from the constraints on proliferation found in the cells of young arteries. C. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL RESEARCH Major new efforts to assess the oral health of adults and older Americans are being supported by the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR). Underpinning these efforts are data from the NIDR National Survey of Oral Health in US. Em- ployed and Seniors: 1985-1986 showing that toothlessness, root caries, gingi- val bleeding, and severe periodontal destruction are significant problems among Americans 65 and older. NIDR Develops Research and Action Program Based on these findings, NIDR has developed a new initiative to improve the oral health of adult Americans. The goal of this program is to eliminate tooth loss and prevent further deterioration of oral health in individuals who have compromised dentition. The effort is being coordinated with other Federal agencies and profes- sional and private groups. New Understanding is Gained on Patterns of Tooth Loss Intramural scientist Dr. L. Jackson Brown and Dr. Lawrence H. Meskin at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, in Denver have found that all socio- demographic groups of older people experience extensive tooth loss but that people age 65-69 with higher incomes have less severe tooth loss than do older people with low incomes. These differences diminish with increasing age and by age 80 most people have no teeth. In a related intramural study, Dr. Brown, Ms. Janet A. Brunelle, and Dr. Galen B. Warren collaborated with Dr. Meskin to present a new approach for describing tooth loss patterns. This typology will help target oral health promotional efforts. Preliminary Data Show No Age Difference in Sensory Function Dr. Marc W. Heft, an NIDR grantee at the University of Florida, in Gainesville reports preliminary data that show for the first time that the perception of temper- ature in adults age 65 and older without neurological disease does not differ from that in adults age 20 to 30. This research is being coordinated with three other stud- ies at Gainesville-the site of NIDR's first Research Center on Oral Health in Aging. Decreased Food Enjoyment Is Not a Normal Part of Aging Based on a study of men and women between ages 25 and 92, intramural scien- tists Drs. James M. Weiffenback, Carloyn A. Tylenda, and Bruce J. Baum have shown that oral sensory function (in terms of food enjoyment) remains intact well into old age. Impaired Salivary Function Is Associated with Alzheimer's Disease NIDR and NIA intramural scientists Drs. Jonathan A. Ship, Charles DeCarli, Robert P. Friedland, and Bruce J. Baum report that saliva flow rates from the sub- mandibular salivary gland were significantly lower among patients with early Alz- heimer's disease compared to age-matched healthy individuals. D. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) conducts and supports research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of many of the most serious chronic and disabling diseases that affect public health. Among the diseases under research that disproportionately affect older people are noninsu- lin-dependent diabetes and osteoporosis. Relationship Between Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus and Diet Studied The ideal diet for people with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which affects about 10 million Americans who are middle-aged or older, has been a subject of controversy. Because people with NIDDM are at increased risk for coro-354 nary heart disease, most doctors recomment a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet to help control the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood. LDL, the \"bad\" cholesterol, is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. NIDDK grantee Dr. Roger H. Unger and his colleagues at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Dallas compared the effects of both a high-carbohydrate diet and a diet high in monounsaturated fatty acids. Ten patients (mean age of 56) with NIDDM receiving insulin therapy participated in the study. The high-carbohydrate diet provided 60 percent of calories in the form of carbohy- drates and 25 percent of calories in fat. The high monounsaturated fat diet had 50 percent fat and 35 percent carbohydrates. Both diets provided comparable levels of protein, cholesterol, and dietary fiber. The researchers found that the high monoun- saturated fat diet lowered blood sugar levels and reduced most patients daily insu- lin requirements. This diet also raised levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), the \"good cholesterol,\" by 13 percent. There was no significant difference in total choles- terol and LDL cholesterol in patients on the two diets. Preliminary results suggest that eating a diet high in monounsaturated fats, as a partial replacement for carbo- hydrates, may improve blood sugar control without raising blood cholesterol. Dr. Unger and his colleagues conducted this research at a General Clinical Research Center supported by NIH's Division of Research Resources. Decreased Vitamin D Related to Osteoporosis NlDDK-supported investigators at Columbia University in New York City have demonstrated that decreased production of the active form of vitamin D is related to both osteoporosis and aging. T~heresearchers have established that this active form of vitamin D normally is produced by the kidney and is regulated by parathyroid hormone and by phospate levels. Detailed information on this study can be found in the NIIDDK contribution to a separate report on Arthritis, Rheumatic Diseases, and Related Disorders. E. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AIM SRnOKE As people age they become increasingly susceptible to diseases of the nervous system. As the focal point for research on these diseases, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) supports and conducts investigations of conditions affecting the aging population: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. (NINDS research on the latter two disorders is described in separate re- ports.) Nearly half a million people in the United States, most over age 60 have Parkin- son's disease, which is characterized by uncontrollable tremors, rigidity, and difficul- ties with movement and speech. These symptoms result from the loss of dopamine, a chemical messenger, from the brain's substantia nigra. They can be controlled by medication such as levodopa. Many patients however react unpredictably to such drugs. An estimated one-third to one-half of patients with. Parkinson's disease also develop dementia. NINDS supported scientists are studying the biological progression of Parkinson's disease and experimenting with treatment methods other than drugs. Deciphering Disease Mechanisms A number of scientists are studing animals with Parkinsonian symptoms induced by the neurotoxin MPTP. The toxicity of this chemical and its analogs varies, de- pending on the species of animal tested and the exact chemical structure of the neurotoxin. One team of NINDS-supported investigators, led by Dr. Roger Duvoisin at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Piscataway is trying to pin- point the conditions that encourage or inhibit toxic effects. If, as the team theorizes, an MPTP-like molecule plays a role in Parkinson's disease, then such studies might reveal how to detoxify the agent. Results from in vitro experiments consistently in- that MPTP inhibits respirations of mitochondria-intracellular energy-pro- ducing furnaces-within nerve terminals in the dopamine production system. Other scientists are using MPTP-treated monkeys to study how movement diffi- culties develop. By analyzing firing patterns of brain nerve cells in Pgtail macaques as they move their wrist NINDS grantee Dr. Ray Watts at Emory University in Atlanta, GA, has found the first neuronal evidence of abnormal preparation for movement. Initial results suggest that abnormal timing and directional activity of movement-preparatory cells in the brain leads to disorganized nerve firing patterns.355 This may be an important link in the explanation of why lesions of the brain's basal ganglia lead to Parkinsonian symptoms. Exploring Implant Treatment MPTP models are also used to test treatments for Parkinson's disease, such as implants of dopamine-producing adrenal or fetal tissue into the brain. More than 100 human patients in a number of countries have already had such implants. The results have been contradictory, but varying degrees of recovery have been reported. Scientists are focusing on animal studies because it is not clear how-or whether- implants stimulate dopamine production. The grafts themselves may produce the chemical or they may encourage repair of the host's damaged dopamine system. It could also be that surgery itself stimulates repair. An NIND-supported team at three institutions, working with an MPTP model in African green monkeys, has found that transplants of fetal tissue from the monkey brain's substantia nigra lead not only to dopamine production but also, apparently, to functional improvement. Scientists led by Dr. Donald Redmond at the Yale Uni- versity School of Medicine in New Haven, CT found that the grafts significantly re- versed even major behavioral abnormalities such as cognitive and motor decre- ments. While many scientists believe that fetal tissue is the more promising trigger for dopamine production, some continue to work with adrenal implants. Because adre- nal implants are taken from the participant's own body, they will not be immunolo- gically rejected. An NINDS-supported team, led by Dr. Don Gash at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York is investigating whether adrenal grafts produce growth factors that encourage regeneration. While the grafts themselves survive poorly in the basal ganglia, the team found that the procedure does encourage vigorous recov- ery of the remaining dopamine-producing cells in the Cebus monkeys. Drug Trial Yields Promising Results This year a major NINDS-supported study revealed that treatment with the drug deprenyl delays the progression of symptoms in patients with early Parkinson's dis- ease and postpones the need for L-dopa therapy. Although scientists are unsure how deprenyl works, they believe that this is the first treatment to actually slow the progress of a neurodegenerative disorder. By contrast, therapies like I-opa allevi- ate the symptoms of such diseases without slowing the destruction that causes them. In the deprenyl study, the largest clinical trial ever conducted for Parkinson's dis- ease, scientists studing 800 patients at 28 centers found that during the first year of treatment, 44 percent of 401 patients receiving an inactive placebo declined to the point of needing L-dopa to maintain their normal activities, while only 24 percent of 399 patients given deprenyl required L-dopa. These results are so promising that sci- entists are continuing to investigate if other positive effects are seen with longer use of deprenyl. Thus far the study as shown that patients taking deprenyl are able to continue working fuiltime longer than those given a placebo. The study, under the leadership of grantee Dr. Ira Shoulson at the University of Rochester in New York, continutes to investigate the value of alpha-tocopherol (vita- min E) therapy in conjunction iwth deprenyl, as well as the effectiveness of de- prenyl when combined with L-dopa. Although there is speculation that deprenyl may be effective in other brain disor- ders such as Alzheimer's disease, there is no evidence or even indication at the present time that this is true. Developing Technology Investigators led by NINDS grantee Dr. Stanley Fahn at the Neurologic Institute of Columbia University in New York City are developing a simple, patient-oriented device for meauring tremors and other physical effects of Parkinson's disease. Ini- tial results indicate that this system can successfully quantify symptoms. The device, which relies on miniaturized circuitry, should enable patients to produce an ongoing record of any changes in their condition without entering the hospital. F. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECrIOUS DISEASES Older people may be more susceptible to organisms that cause bacterial and viral infections than those in other age groups. Therefore, improved ways of preventing and treating these illnesses can be lifesaving. The National Institute of Allergy and356 Infectious Diseases (NIAID) conducts and supports research on the biology of many of these organisms, as well as research aimed at preventing these infections. Bacterial Pneumonia May Be Acquired in Hospitals Recently a new stain of chlamydial bacteria, called TWAR, has been identified as one.cause of respiratory tract infections associated with pneumonia. The TWAR dr- ganisum hasnbeen found more commonly in patients.with pneumonia than in pa- tients with other respiratory illesses such as sinusitis. NIAID grantee Dr. J. Thomas Grayson and his colleagues at the University of Washington in Seattle conducted a retrospective study of the relationship between TWAR and pneumonia. The researchers looked at patients who entered the hospital with pneumonia and who developed pneumonia during their hospital stay. Most of the patients ranged in age from 55 to 60 years old and most had a chronic illness such as heart disease. Dr. Grayson and his colleagues looked for an antibody to TWAR in samples of the patient's blood. (An antibody is a protein in the blood and protects the body from foreign organisms). They found that 10 percent of the 198 hospitalized patients had TWAR antibody levels indicating of recent infection. When compared with 20 con-, trol cases of pneumonia, there was no difference in symptoms or clinical signs of pneumonia. Nine of the 20 TWAR patients acquired pneumonia in the hospital. The study demonstrates that TWAR-associated pneumonia can be acquired in the hospital as well as in the community. It also confirms studies showing that commu- nity-acquired TWAR-associated pneumonia in patients with chronic illnesses can result in clinical complications and even death. Further studies will determine pre- cisely how TWAR is transmitted in the hospital-whether it is spread only by person-to-person contact, as is common in the community, or whether a reactivated TWAR infection may be responsible. This study is another step toward determining what role TWAR plays in causing pneumonia. Effects of Drugs on Herpes Zoster Studied Chickenpox, which is caused by a type of herpes virus called varicella-zoster, is contracted by most people during childhood. After the infection has subsided, the virus becomes dormant, remaining in the body but causing no ill effects. However, varicella-zoster virus sometimes reactivates later in life, causing herpes zoster, also known as shingles. It has been estimated that about 50 percent of people who live to age 80 will have an attack of shingles. Symptoms of herpes zoster can range from mild itching to intense pain. Herpes zoster can result in blindness if it affects the eyes. In people with a weakened immune system, shingles may result in disseminated disease in which the virus spreads to organs throughout the body. It can also be life threatening. NIAID contractor Dr. Richard J. Whitely at the University of Alabama in Bir- mingham directs the NIAID Collaborative Antiviral Study Group, which is investi- gating the effects of acyclovir (an antiviral drug) and prednisone (an anti-inffamma- tory drug) on herpes zoster. They are studying these drugs alone and in combina- tion. Acyclovir has already been shown to have beneficial effects against herpes virus infections. The study group is also comparing intravenous vidarabine (another antiviral drug) with acyclovir for treating disseminated herpes zoster in immuno- compromised patients. In addition, they are investigating whether oral acyclovir will prevent the spread of shingles in immunocompromised patients who have local- ized infection. It is hoped that these studies will soon provide a way to relieve the debilitating symptoms of herpes zoster. G. NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE Americans 65 and older account for one-third of all visits for medical eye care. The National Eye Institute (NEI) supports research aimed at reducing the burden of aging-related eye disease. Scientists Study Treatment for Glaucoma Open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of glaucoma in this country, is a leading cause of blindness in Americans 65 and older. Although its cause remains unknown, glaucoma occurs when the natural flow of fluid inside the eye becomes blocked, leading to a buildup of internal pressure that damages the optic nerve. Most cases of glaucoma can be controlled with medication, but for some the medi- cations become ineffective or intolerable. The next step is a filtering surgery to create a-drainage channel to relieve the pressure. In some surgical patients however357 scar tissue later obstructs the drainage channel necessitating a second operation, which often fails. In addition, patients who have had cataracts removed are poor risks for successful filtering surgery. Early findings from an NEI-sponsored randomized, controlled, clinical study show that patients who have had glaucoma or cataract surgery have almost a 50 percent better chance of successful surgery it if is followed by injections of an antimetabolite drug called 5-fluorouracil, or 5-FU. The drug impedes the growth of scar tissue. When the superior results of the combination therapy became evident, the investi- gators stopped the randomization and reported on the condition of all patients one year after surgery. Of the patients who received 5-FU after surgery, 73 percent had filtering channels that were still maintaining satisfactory intraocular pressure after 1 year, while only 50 percent of those who had surgery alone had the same results. Although the 5-FU injections caused some mild and transient side effects in the first month after sur- gery, two-thirds of those receiving the drug did not need glaucoma medication to control their intraocular pressure. In the surgery-alone group, only about one-third maintained satisfactory pressure without medication. Moreover, of the patients needing medication after surgery, those in the 5-FU group needed fewer types of medications than did those who have surgery alone. Although patient status after 1 year is a good predictor of long-term results, the investigators plan to follow the patients for 5 more years to determine how the sur- gical filters in the eyes of both groups continue to function. H. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUScULOsKELMrAL AND SKIN DISEASES The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) conducts and supports research on several diseases that affect older Amer- icans, particularly osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and Paget's disease of bone. Researchers Study Osteoporosis Dr. Carl T. Brighton and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia have applied a novel approach to study the use of electrical stimula- tion to treat osteoporosis in an animal model. Electrical stimulation is a technique developed by Dr. Brighton and others in which fractures that fail to heal are sub- jected to low-level electric fields and currents to stimulate the rate of bone growth and repair. Using this technique on rats, the researchers were able to increase bone mass in the lower limb and to reverse osteoporosis of the spine. This innovative re- search offers hope that loss of bone mass in osteoporosis can be reversed. In other osteoporosis research, intramural scientist Dr. Mark E. Bolander and his colleagues have developed a method for evaluating the effect of estrogen on bone formation. Recent research has shown that bone cells contain binding sites for estro- gen, called receptors, that attach to DNA in the cell. Using advanced molecular biol- ogy techniques, Dr. Bolander and his colleagues found that the level of estrogen re- ceptor varies during fracture healing, implying that estrogen has a direct effect on bone formation. Increased knowledge about molecular action of estrogen during bone formation and healing should add significantly to researchers' understanding of osteoporosis and other bone disorders and, ultimately, to the ability of physicians to treat these disorders. Early Osteoarthritis May Be Linked to a Genetic Abnormality Osteoarthritis (OA) or degenerating joint disease is usually thought of as an inevi- table part of aging. However, new studies show that in some families, where there is no identifiable cause for the disease, OA may be linked to a genetic abnormality. NIAMS grantees Dr. Darwin J. Prockop at Jefferson Medical College in Philadel- phia, PA, and Dr. Roland W. Moskowitz at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, OH, studied three generations of family members with primary OA who exhibited symptoms of the disease in their early twenties and thir- ties. After physical examinations and laboratory studies of these patients, the re- searchers ruled out other diseases. However, X-rays revealed abnormalities of multi- ple joints typical of primary OA and mild chondrodysplasia (abnormality of carti- lage) in the spine. Blood cells from these patients were evaluated and genetically mapped. In each of these patients the researchers found a defect in or near the gene for type II procollagen, the precursor for collegan, the major structural protein of cartilage. According to the researchers, this defect may account for the early onset of this unique type of OA. This work may also help researchers understand causes of OA in older Americans.358 Paget's Disease of the Bone May Be Caused by a Slow Virus Paget's disease or osteitis deformans, a bone disease of unknown cause, affects more than 3 million older Americans. It is a chronic disease of the skeleton charac- terized by abnormal, rapid bone turnover. Bone-resorbing cells cause osteoclasts break down old bone to make way for new bone formation. In Paget's, this new bone is often dense but fragile. Bones of the spine, skull, pelvis, thighs, and lower legs are most commonly affected. With time these bones may become deformed and occasion- ally fracture spontaneously; For many years it has been suggested that Paget's disease may be caused by a slow virus infection that lies dormant for many years. However, viral particles have never been isolated. from the cells of Paget's patients. Drs. Michael M.C. Lai and Barbara Mills at the University of Southern California School of Medicine and School of Dentistry in Los Angeles, used biological engineering techniques to isolate cells from Paget's lesions and from a giant cell tumor which arose in one of these lesions. The researchers then used a genetically engineered viral sequence of the measles virus, the respiratory syncytia virus, and other paramyxoviruses to detect the virus-related material within the tissues. They were able to detect genetic infor- mation in the osteoclast cell that was related to the viruses. No virus-related mate- rial was detected in the normal cells. According to the researchers, this is the first clear-cut evidence of the relationship between slow growing viruses and Paget's dis- ease of the bone. Additional findings relevant to disorders that affect older people can be found in the NIAMS report on Arthritis, Rheumatic Diseases, and Related Disorders. L. NATIONAL INSTrITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS Today more than half of the population age 65 and older are significantly affected by a communication disorder. Research into the effects of advancing age on hearing, vestibular function (balance), speech, voice, language, and chemical and tactile senses, is a major concern of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Commu- nication Disorders (NTDCD). Created in October 1988, NIDCD currently manages a research portfolio in the communication sciences/disorders that has been primarily transferred from NINDS. Hearing Problems C6mmon in Older People Studied Presbycusis (the loss of ability to perceive or discriminate sounds as a part of the aging process) is a prevalent but understudied disabling condition. In presbyusis, the inner ear is primarily affected although auditory nerve and brain stem degenera- tion may also occur. One-third of people 65 years and older have presbycusis suffi- cient to interfere with speech perception. The prevalence rises with increasing age. Studies of the influence of factors such as genetics, noise exposure, cardiovascular status, systemic diseases, smoking, diet, personality, and stress types are contribut- ing to a better understanding of the condition. The effect of known tissue changes combined with the cumulative effect of years of exposure to toxic influences is also being investigated. Studies are identifying the contributions of varying aspects of presbycusis to the actual problems of speech, language, and understanding. This research is providing new information about structural, functional, and chemical changes in the aging au- ditory system. Anatomical and physiological studies are transferring new techniques from cellular and molecular biology to develop animal and human models for pres- bycusis. Clinical intervention research is aimed at detection, measurement, and re- habilitation (including hearing aid use). Researchers have recently discovered that hair cells in the cochlears of both young and adult birds can regenerate if they have been damaged by toxic drugs or noise exposure. In some fish, the vestibular hair cells are replenished almost con- tinuously throughout the-life cycle. NIDCD researchers are studying these regener- ating hair cells to define the biochemical and genetic mechanisms that initiate the regeneration process. Researchers Investigate Problems With Balance Most individuals over 70 report problems with dizziness and loss of balance. In fact, balance-related falls account for more than one-half of all accidental deaths in older people. When balance is impaired, the capability and desire for purposeful motor activity is diminished and there may be secondary effects on motivation, con- centration, and memory.359 NIDCD researchers are looking at adaptive changes in the vestibular system that occur with aging. Relationship of Age and Smell Explored Disorders of the chemosenses (taste and smell) present serious problems for older people. Without these senses older people may lose their desire to eat nutritious meals or to detect toxins in the home and workplace. In addition, these disorders can signal the existence of several diseases or conditions such as diabetes, hyperten- sion, or malnutrition. Age appears to factor strongly in chemosensory disorders. NIDCD researchers have recently found that age takes a much greater toll on smell (olfaction) than taste. Studies of the sense of smell provide a unique opportunity for researchers to ex- plore fundamental mechanisms in the regeneration of nerve cells. Researchers have removed olfactory cells from patients with Alzheimer's disease to reveal microscopic pathologic changes similar to those already known to occur in the brain. Because olfactory nerve cells have a remarkable capacity to grow and divide throughout life, scientists will continue to study them to learn more about injured brains and spinal cord tissue. J. DIVISION OF RESEARCH RESOURCES At research facilities across the United States, the Division of Research Resources (DRR) supports and conducts research into the process of aging. Through its General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) program, DRR provides the research infrastruc- ture for multidisciplinary studies on both children and adults. Specifically, DRR provides patient research facilities, computerized data management and analysis, as well as research nurses, dietitians, biostatisticians, and specialized laboratories forthe translation of basic and clinical research into medical practice. New Research Directions in Osteoporosis One area of intense study is osteoporosis, especially among postmenopausal women. Studies conducted by DRR grantee, Dr. John Bilezikian and associates at the Columbia University GCRC in New York City have traced the weakening of os- teoporotic bones in part to a possible abnormality in the parathyroid gland, which plays a role in regulating calcium in the bone. Dr. Bilezikian has demonstrated thatthe parathyroid's response is diminished in postmenopausal women who have osteo- porosis. Dr. Bilezikian administered phosphate to 8 postmenopausal women with osteopor- osis and 10 women of similar age who showed no signs of the disease. Phosphate, which stimulates the parathyroid to secrete a hormone that increases bone calcium, produced a strong response in the women without osteoporosis and a weak response in women with osteoporosis. The finding indicates that a defect in the parathyroid gland might contribute to osteoporosis. Future research should examine how to im- prove the capacity of the parathyroid gland to compensate for the loss of calcium inpatients with osteoporosis. Spinal osteoporosis, a disease characterized by progressive loss of bone in the spine, affects about 5 million Americans, most commonly postmenopausal women. Because the bone loss weakens the spinal vertebrae, patients are susceptible to frac- tures of the spine, causing curvature of the back, back pain, and gastrointestinal distress. About one-half million persons suffer these fractures each year. Now, Dr. Charles Y. C. Pak, DRR grantee from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center GCRC in Dallas has conducted clinical tests which point to a new treatment to increase bone mass. Dr. Pak's treatment combines a slow-release form of sodium fluoride with a calci- um citrate supplement-a combination that increases bone mass and remineralizes bone. Conventional therapy, using estrogen and calcium supplements, prevents the development of osteoporosis when applied early in the postmenopausal period. The new treatment can help patients who have already sustained substantial bone loss. In a multi-center trial led by the Texas GCRC, more than 300 patients were moni- tored for an average of 3.5 years. Following the new treatment, bone density in the lower spine stabilized or increased. Patients showed an average annual increase of 5.1 percent in bone mass for up to 4 years of study. Using bone biopsies, the re- searchers documented an increase in the amount of normally mineralized bone which was mechanically intact or improved. Adverse complications of treatment were minor; fewer than 5 percent of patients had gastrointestinal complications and360 only about 6 percent experienced rheumatic complications-none resulting in stress fractures. Amino Acids Found to Influence Absorption of Levodopa Parkinson's disease is an other common disorder in older people. Scientists have long known that its symptoms generally respond to therapy with drugs such as levo- dopa. Regular use of levodopa however may cause variable, responses-relief of symptoms becomes neither reliable nor consistent. Dietary protein affects the response to levodopa, but the reason why has been dif- ficult to explain. DRR grantees led by Dr. John Nutt at the Oregon Health Sciences University GCRC in Portland analyzed the clinical response of five patients to meals with varying levels of protein. By monitoring the plasma level of the drug, they found that absorption of levodopa took place at the same rate regardless of the protein content of the meal.. Yet the patients eating meals with the most protein showed the most fluctuations in response to the drug. Dr. Nutt concluded that the effect of dietary protein on the response to levodopa may result from elevated blood levels of amino acids derived from the digestion of dietary proteins. These dietary amino acids compete with levodopa for entry into the brain. Accord- ing to Dr. Nutt, elevated levels of amino acids in the blood can exclude the levodopa from the brain and, therefore, prevent a beneficial response. Reducing the levels of these amino acids may increase levodopa's therapeutic effectiveness. The study of dopaminergic agents such as levodopa in Parkinson's disease is not only important because of the immediate clincal implications 'but also because it adds to our understanding of the brain's response to replacement therapies for neur- otransmitter deficiencies. As a result, what is learned in Parkinson's disease may be important in other disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, in which the deficiency of another neurotransmitter is believed to be particularly critical. K. NATIONAL CENTER FOR NURSING RESEARCH The National Center for Nursing Research (NCNR) focuses on the causes of mental and physical dysfunction in older Americans and on ways to help older Americans maintain their physical and mental function abilities. NCNR also sup- ports research on stress and coping associated with family caregiving and on im- proving methods of care at home. Reducing the Risks of Developing Pressure Sores Older patients in nursing homes and other chronic care facilities are at an in- creased risk of developing pressure sores. These sores can cause extreme discomfort to the patient and increase the risks of infection and death. NCNR grantee Dr. Nancy Bergstrom at the College of Nursing, University of Ne- braska Medical Center in Omaha, is testing and refining a scale that nurses and other health care workers can use to identify individuals at high risk for developing pressure sores. Dr. Bergstrom and her colleagues are testing the scale in up to 1,100 patients in nursing homes, hospitals, and at home. The scale assesses the following factors associated with the development of pressure sores: Undernutrition, reduced skin sensation, low activity levels, moisture remaining on the skin, and friction. Dr. Bergstrom and her colleagues will also measure other conditions that might affect the development of pressure sores, such as blood pressure and skin tempera- ture. In addition, they will look for differences in risk among racial groups. Patients in hospitals and nursing homes will be evaluated three times a week; those cared for at home will be evaluated once a week. An accurate scale to predict which patients are at highest risk of developing pres- sure sores can help caregivers offer prompt preventive treatment. It may also reduce the costs of care by making sure that expensive preventive measures are available to those patients with the greatest need. IV. OUTLOOK The breadth of these research highlights demonstrates the remarkable opportuni- ties available to researchers interested in aging issues. Through its research pro- grams, the NIH is committed to implementing a research agenda that will lead to a fuller understanding of the biomedical, behavioral, and social processes that impact on aging. Since 1974, the NIA has been the leader for these research efforts. We are in an aging society-we appreciate the benefits of this longevity, but can also anticipate the drawbacks. Research conducted or supported by NIA touches the lives of each and every American. Through this comprehensive research effort we361 are learning more about what it means to grow old. We are seeing that aging does not have to be synonymous with decline, and we are learning that the changes we make today can improve our chances of remaining healthy, active, and independent. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM ON ALzaaiimER's DisEAsE, RELAnm DEMEN'flAs, AND MENTAL DISORDERS OF AGING The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) conducts and supports a wide range of research and related activities with direct and indirect relevance to issues of aging. This includes basic research in the neurosciences and behavioral sciences, clinical research in the geriatric mental disorders, and services research related to the utilization and financing of mental health care. Clinical and research training programs as well as service demonstration programs are also supported. In fiscal year 1989 the NIMH budget for research, training, and demonstrations directly concerned with aging was $26,336,000. An additional $20,332,000 was spent for basic research and research training related to issues of aging. Total NIMH direct and related expenditures for aging in FY 1989, then were $46,668,000. Expenditures were made in the following categories: NIMH EXPENDITURES IN AGING, FISCAL YEAR 1989 [n thousands of delars]' Direct Related h fiscal year 1989 funding amounts shown foir hing in this report have been calculated using the same auroach as last errls kging Repwt heCongressional Justification miaterials Budget, however, indicate that fillH supore $ 352 million o Aging research in fiscal year 1989. This latter amount is based on a revised and more limited definition of N1111's s actin vities. Beginning next year, the Aging Report figures will be caculate using the same approach as the Congressional Justification.. This report provides information on program developments in research, research training, and clinical training, and also provides information on developments in mental health services demonstrations for the elderly. TXTRAMURAL PROGRAMS Clinical Research The Institute supports a broad spectrum of research projects in the area of clini- cal research. The core of the research program is to understand and address more effectively the causes, prevention, treatments, and rehabilitation of mental illness in the elderly. Special attention is paid to research in Alzheimer's disease. Research in the geriatric mental disorders has developed into a coherent and so- phisticated body of knowledge. Using the best of contemporary approaches in molec- ular genetics and neurobiology, investigator s projects disease are involved in studies of chromosomal abnormalities on chromosome 21; neurobiological approach- es to the development of diagnostic markers; imaging studies using PET, MRI, and electrophysiological mapping procedures; and neuropsychological studies. While the treatment of the core cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease remains elusive, there are some promising findings using a new cholinesterase inhibitor, as well as with approaches to treatment of associated psychotic symptoms. Such studies may result in strategies that could well improve the community care of these patients and could contribute to an overall strategy for patient care in the nursing home set- ting. A significant aspect of care for Alzheimer's disease patients is the stress that it places on the family responsible for providing support to the patient. Investigators have highlighted the guilt, demoralization, anger, and depression associated with362 this burden of care and have demonstrated the immunosuppressive effect of this chronic stress. In other areas of research, age of onset has been shown to be a significant concern in schizophrenia and in depressive disorder with investigation now explicating the impact of a variable age of onset on clinical presentation, the course of disease, and the outcome of treatment. Research on acute treatment of depression in older patients has shown that treat- ment response to medications alone, and to psychotherapy alone or both treatments combined, is substantial, though naturalistic followup has shown high rates of re- lapse and recurrence. Research to establish protocols for continuation and mainte- nance treatment is now underway. Basic Research The Institute provides support for basic research in the neurosciences, behavioral sciences, and the area of health and behavior. General program areas include bio- logical aspects of behavior; molecular biology; neurobiology; psychopharmacology; personality, emotion, processes; factors influ- encing behavioral development and modification; biological, psychological, and psy- chosocial aspects of stress and other psychological states; behavioral medicine, psy- choimmunology; and research on Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Services Research and Demonstrations Support is provided by the Institute for research and research training that is contributing to the scientific base of knowledge on the organization, financing and delivery of mental health services to the aging. In the mental health services re-- search area, work continued on development of a Resource-Based Relative Value Scale for possible use in reimbursing psychiatrists for services provided under. the Medicare B program. Support was provided to five research grants that focussed on the financing of mental health services to the elderly, the response practices of nursing homes to patients with behavioral problems, and the effectiveness of consul- tation-liaison psychiatric services for elderly hip fracture patients. An Institute survey was conducted to provide a detailed profile of the characteristics and types of treatment received by elderly patients during 1986 in inpatient, outpatient, and par- tial care mental health services programs (see RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS). Institute staff published results of their research on prescribing of psychotropic drugs in nursing homes and on the adequacy of research on mental disorders in nursing homes. In an effort to enhance the data base for mental health services research devoted to the elderly, an Institute staff member serves as technical observer to the Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, a group established to encourage co- operation among Federal agencies in the development, collection, analysis, and dis- semination of data pertaining to the older population. Demonstrations of innovative models of community-based mental health services for the elderly are supported by the Institute through grant awards made to State Departments of Mental Health. Research Training National Research Service Awards, including individual fellowships and institu- tional awards at the predoctoral or postdoctoral levels, provide support for the train- ing of research scientists in the area of mental health and aging. The major orienta- tion is toward postdoctoral training in departments and institutions with major re- search programs in mental health and aging. In particular, program emphasis in FY 1989 was to establish research training programs for basic and clinical scientists at each of the NIMH supported Clinical Reserach Centers on Psychopathology of the Elderly. Clinical Training In FY 1988 the NIMH established a new program, the Clinical Faculty Scholar award, to support the development of clinician scholar/investigators about to launch academic careers. This program was continued in FY.1989 and a program of institu- tional awards to support stipends for trainees was initiated in each of the core mental health disciplines.363 MTRAMURAL PROGRAMS Intramural Research In FY 1989 the Division of Intramural Research spent $4,874,000 or 7.3 percent ofits total budget on research related to aging. A summary of the investigations now being conducted in the Division of Intramu-ral Research, and selected intramural projects which relate to mental disorders ofaging, including Alzheimer's Disease, are presented. Developing and testing pharmacological challenge paradigms with older patientsand controls remains a primary focus of the intramural research program. As inprevious years, the unit continues to concentrate on improving the clinical diagnos-tic accuracy and phenomenological description of Alzheimer's disease by developingand testing new rating instruments. In a signficant new advance in cholinergic pharmacology, the unit studied the ef-fect. of a peptide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (RH), on the memory impairingeffects of scopolamine. In young controls the TRH helped blunt or lessen the effectsof scopolamine, thereby suggesting a possible neuromodulatory role of TRH on thecholinergic system. These results suggest a potential role of TH in the treatmentof Alzheimer s disease. In addition, a series of experiments has been started to testcombined therapeutic agents such as the anticholinesterase inhibitor, physostig-mine, with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, L-deprenyl. This strategy is de-signed to assess whether individual agents act additively or synergistically whengiven in therapeutic combinations to Alzheimer patients.Another pharmacological approach involves a series of studies with serotonergicagent, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). Because the serontonin (5-HT) system isseverly impaired in Alzheimer's disease, there is potential therapeutic benefit fromserotonergically active compounds. Initial findings suggest that m-CPP is safely tol-erated and that Alzheimer patients demonstrate increased behavioral but not neur-oendocrine sensitivity to challenge with the drug. The next step will include chronictreatment with m-CPP and other serotonergic agents. These studies are currentlyongoinginaly, the unit continues to develop new rating scales to assess elderly patients.During the last year, the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale (DMAS) continued to beused to measure depression in Alzheimer's disease. Two new rating instrumentswere also created. The first, a scale to measure the activities of daily living, calledthe daily Activities Questionnaire (DAQ), allows quantitative measurement of indi-vidual functioning over time- and the second, a Clock Drawing Task, focuses on themostly nonverbal visuospatial skills of individual Alzheimer patients compared tocontrols. Beth instrument are designed for research purposes but also have imme-diate clinical applications and will be helpful in testing diagnostic and prognosticaccuracy in Alzheimer patient when used longitudinally.Intramural scientists are using sophisticated imaging techniques and animalmodels as well as new classes of drugs and are continuing to build a base of knowl-edge about diseases afflicting the aged. Studies in Cerebral Circulation and Metabolism and Protein Synthesis The NIMH intramural research program conducts basic research and is especiallynoted for its development and application of methods that created the foundation ofthe new field of imaging of local physiological and biochemical processes and oflocal functional activities in the nervous system. These methods were initially devel-oped 10 years ago for use in animals with quantitative autoradiorgraphy and thenadapted for use in man with positron emission tomography (PET). The deoxyglucosemethod, both in its original autoradiographic version and in its PET adaptation foruse in human subjects, is widely used throughout the world. Major progress hasbeen made toward the adaptation of the deoxyglucose method for use in pathologi-cal tissues. The most recent technique developed by the program is designed to measure re-gional rates of protein synthesis in brain. Protein synthesis is probably the most im-portant biochemical process underlying the development, maturation, plasticity,maintenance and long-term regulation of the nature and degree of functional activi-ty of the nervous system. The structural, functional, and metabolic properties of tis-sues largely reflect the role of structural and enzymatic proteins. In the nervoussystem proteins serve as hormones and are the parent compounds of peptide neuro-transmitters. It is, therefore, certain that changes in protein synthesis can and doalter function and that some mental and neurological dysfunctions reflect disturb-ances in this vital biochemical process. Studies carried out in the program have al-ready demonstrated the usefulness of the method for protein synthesis in studies of364 neural regeneration, plasticity, and the involutional changes which may occur in the process of aging. Muscarinic Receptors Using a prototype SPECT (single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan- ner, NIMH intramural scientists have the first time visualized the location of cholinergic neurotransmitter systems in the living human brain. The scans, which trace the uptake of iodinated QNB (a cholinergic antagonist), reveal the distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors or binding sites on cell surfaces. These binding proteins are part of a messenger chemical system known to be associated with memory loss in Alzheimer's disease. SPECT scan studies reveal major deficiencies in muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the parietal cortex and other brain regions of Alzheimer's patients. Pharmacology in Cognitive Memory Evidence from patients with Alzheimer's disease suggests that the basal forebrain cholinergic system plays an important role in memory. Scientists in the intramural program have found that recognition memory in normal monkeys can be improved by administration of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine and impaired by the cholinergic muscarinic-receptor blocker scopolamine. Spatial memory has-also been found to be impaired by scopolamine. THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) and scopolamine (an anticholinergic agent) impair memory at different time points, sug- gesting that THC acts on memory through a noncholinergic mechanism. Tetrahydrobiopterin Levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) have been found to be altered in Alzheimer's patients by the scientists in the intramural program. An earlier finding that it is only the subgroup of patients with movement disorders who have low CSF levels of BH4 has been extended by showing that those patients with myoclonus (shock-like contractions of the muscles) also show the BH4 deficit. These findings are essential in providing a criterion for the selection of the most suitable Alzheimer patients who might benefit from BH4 administration. Clinical follow-up is under way. Galanin One group of scientists is finding that neuropeptide modulators of brain choliner- gic neuronal activity can affect experimentally induced memory impairment in ani- mals and humans. Neuropeptides are short chains of amino acids believed to fine- tune the action of major brain chemical messengers or classical neurotransmitters. The research team employs animal models to test potentinl new drugs that affect classical neurotransmitter function by targeting particular neuropeptide systems. This strategy holds promise for new, more selective classes of drugs that are now available for treating illesses such as Alaheimer's disease. These studies focus on galanin, a peptide that coexists with acetylcholine in neu- rons that mediate memory processing. Using an animal model of Alzheimer's dis- ease, the research team found that while acetylcholine improves the maze-running performance of rats whose memory systems are chemically impaired, this beneficial effect of acetylcholine can be inhibited by galanin. This work suggests that a drug that antagonizes galanin might help Alzheimer's patients, whose acetylcholine sys- tems are similarly impaired. This laboratory is among several that are testing ef- fect of potential galanin antagonist on memory tasks in animal models of demen- tia. Samatostatin Intramural scientists continue studies of samatostatin in relation to neuropsychia- tric disorders. Some of their findings include: (1) CSF samatostatin was significantly decreased in a large group of Alzheimer's patients compared with the age-matched controls; (2) a trend for significantly lower values was seen in Alzheimer's patients compared with elderly depressives, with values in the latter group significantly lower than controls; and (3) a significant correlation was observed between CSF SRIF and ratings of depression in Alzheimer's patients. DHEA Intramural scientists continue to study DHEA (dydroepiandrosterone) levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease. DHEA levels were lowered in patients with Alz- heimer's compared to age-matched controls. Observations that high levels of the hormone DHEA may provide protection against viral illness have led to the initi- ation of clinical trials of the hormone in Alzheimer's disease patients to determine whether the administration of DHEA has a beneficial effect.365 DHHS Council on Alzheimer's Disease The DHHS Council on Alzheimer's Disease is essentially the former DHHS Secre-tary's Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease renamed. The Council was established bythe Alzheimer's Disease Services Research Act of 1986 (Title IX of Public Law 99-660). Key functions of the Council include identifying promising areas of Alzhei-mer's disease research, coordinating this research, sharing information, and facili-tating the translation of the research into practice. The Council is chaired by theAssistant Secretary for Health. Other membership consists of the Surgeon General,the Assistant Secretary for Health Planning and Evaluation, the Commissioner ofthe Administration on Aging, the Directors of NIA, NIMH, NINDS, NIAID andNCHSR/HCTA, and representatives of the Veterans Administration, Health CareFinancing Administration, and Health Resources and Services Administration. Rep-resentation from the National Center for Nursing Research has recently beenadded. The Council meets twice annually, and is required to submit an annual report toCongress and to the public detailing the plans of four member agencies (NIA,NIMH, NCHSR/HCTA, and HCFA) regarding research on services for dementia pa-tients and their families. Prior reports were submitted in January 1988 and Janu-ary 1989, the latter of which also detailed progress in federally sponsored Alzheimerresearch supported by all member agencies of the Council. The Council met mostrecently in September 1989 to discuss the draft of the next report/update of plans.The NIMH plan in this regard was mandated to provide for research concerning: (a)mental health services and treatment modalities relevant to mental, behavioral andpsychological problems associated with Alzheimer's disease; (b) methods for provid-ing comprehensive multidimensional assessments; (c) the optimal range and cost-ef-fectiveness of community and institutional services; (d) the efficacy of special careunits; (e) methods of combining the services of health care professionals with infor-mal support services provided by family and friends; (f) interventions to reduce thepsychological, social, and physical problems of caregiving family members; and (g)methods of improving service delivery. As determined at the most recent meeting, on behalf of the Council, its supportstaff from the Institute will also assemble and distribute in 1990 a detailed compila-tion of all the research projects, demonstrations, and other activities on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias that are currently funded by its member agencies asof January 1, 1990. DHHS Advisory Panel on Alzheimer's Disease The DHHS Advisory Panel on Alzheimer's Disease was established by Title IX ofPublic Law 99-660 (\"Alzheimer's Disease Services Research Act\") to assist theDHHS Secretary and DHHS Council on Alzheimer's Disease in identifying prioritiesand emerging issues regarding Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and thecare of afflicted individuals. The Panel is composed of 15 non-Federal appointeeswho are prominent researchers or other experts on Alzheimer's disease, and fivemembers of the DHHS Council (including the NIMH Director) who serve ex officio.Members serve for the 4-year life legislated for the Panel (FY 1988-91).The Panel is mandated to center its advice on emerging issues and promising ini-tiatives, or research directions, in four areas related to Alzheimer's disease: (a) bio-medical research; (b) research on services for Alzheimer's patients and their fami-lies; (c) home and community based service provision systems; and (d) financing ofhealth care and social services. The Panel is required to prepare annual reports(transmitted to Congress, the Secretary, the Council, and the public) giving recom-mendations for administrative and legislative actions to improve services and pro-vide for promising biomedical research. The Panel, or its subcommittees, met on three occasions during 1988, leading upto the submission of its first annual report to the Congress, the Secretary of DM,and the DHHS Council on Alzheimer's Disease in March 1989. The Panel met againin June 1989 and began discussing work on subsequent reports, which are likely toaddress a series of specific topics, such as personnel and training issues in the careof Alzheimer victims. At that time the Panel also held an Open Forum in the Dirk-sen Senate Office Building, at which several investigators presented recent advancesin biomedical research on the disease, family members from Alzheimer advocacygroups discussed their responses to the Panel's report, and the Panel heard fromCongressional staff members about responses to the recommendations in the report.The report is currently being printed for wider distribution by the GovernmentPrinting Office. In November 1989, members of the Panel presented the ideas in the366 report at the annual meeting of the Gerontological Society of America, and engaged that professional audience in discussion of its recommendations. The $100,000 per annum that was authorized for Panel activities has come from a tap on appropriate DHHS agencies, including NIMH, in FY 1988 and FY 1989, and has been requested as part of the ADAMHA budget for FY 1990 and FY 1991. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Diagnostic Markers in Alzheimer's Disease Geoge Zubenko of the University of Pittsburgh (MH43261 and KO1 MH00540) has continued to extend and clarify his initial findings of a blood platelet abnormality, namely, increased membrane fluidity, in Alzheimer's disease patients. Zubenko now has evidence that this membrane abnormality identifies a subgroup of patients with distinct clinical features-including an earlier symptomatic onset, a more rapidly progressive decline, and greater likelihood of a family history of dementia-and that it appears to be a stable, familial trait veritcally transmitted in families through inheritance of a highly penetrant autosomal gene. Most recently, Zubenko has dis- covered that the genetic locus (called PMF) for this trait may reside on the long-arm of chromosome 21, where several other genes related to the biology of Alzheimer's disease have previously been localized. He is now beginning to do a linkage analysis study to determine whether the PMF locus does definitively map on this region of chromosome 21 and whether it is distinct from the genes for familial Alzheimer's disease and the beta-amyloid precursor protein, or may be located more closely with a region associated with the development of Down's syndrome. This work is pro- gressing rapidly, and has exciting potential both for clarifying the etiology of Alzhei- mer's disease and for yielding a biological marker useful in the diagnostic identifica- tion of a particular subtype of the disease. Neuropathology of Alzheimer's Disease Dr. Carol Miller of the University of Southern California (MH39145) has devel- oped a panel of antibodies drawn from drosophila that form a comprehensive panel of agents to react against human central nervous system (CNS) tissue, and, with suitable staining, could locate specifc proteins within the subcellular structure of the CNS. Dr. Miller's pilot data established early that there was remarkable speci- ficity afforded by the panel of antibodies, for a wide range of mitochondrial and other subcellular structures, across the nervous system. Moreover, there were sharp specificities in these target proteins, between various neuronal populations, so that some populations of neurons would selectively have some of the subcellular struc- tures stained, whereas the same subcellular structures in other populations would fail to attract the probes in both normal and Alzheimer brains. Unique and major findings have emerged: First, retinal ganglion cells were found to undergo degeneration in the apparent absence of neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, angiopathy, or transynaptic loss, thus suggesting a primary form of neural degeneration. A related finding is that monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3F12 (which se- lectively labels AD-vulnerable neurons) reacts with cochlear nucleus neurons, while the adjacent vestibular nucleus neurons (not affected in AD) are labeled by MAb 6A2. These finding suggest that significant sensory deafferentation appears to occur in the AD patient. In all Alzheimer's cases, the pathology was limited to the gangli- on cell layer, with marked dropout of ganglion cells and nerve fiber layer atrophy present in the most severely affected retinas. It is notable that there were no neuro- fibrillary tangles within the ganglion cells, or neuritic plaques or amyloid angiopa- thy in the retina. The identification of a degenerating population not asso- ciated with neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease is of great interest, since neuronal loss represents one of the foremost pathologic changes in Alzheimer's. Ac- cordingly, Miller's data suggest that neurofibrillary tangles are not requisite for cell death in Alzheimer's dementia. Miller's creative and powerful application of mono- clonal and DNA technologies on CNS tissue obtained from patients with document- ed Alzheimer's disease at autopsy, has yielded findings on the cutting edge of de- mentia research. Drug Treatments in Alzheimer's Disease In an NIMH-supported open trial with Alzheimer's disease patients, Robert Becker and colleagues at Southern Illinois University (MH41821) found that a long- acting anticholinesterase drug (metrifonate) achieved up to 80 percent inhibition of cholinesterase without causing interfering side effects. Furthermore, administration367 of metrifonate for up to 5 months appeared safe, and both clinical reports from pa-tients and their families and psychological evaluations on the Alzheimer Disease As-sessment Scale indicated that metrifonate may imporve cognitive performance inAlzheimer patients. These findings suggest that this drug may be highly useful infurther research and may enable definitive tests of the hypothesis that depletion ofthe neurotransmitter acetylcholine is the central neurobiological pathway, leadingto the cognitive deficits seen in Alzheimer's disease. Becker and his colleagues arenow being funded to extend this line of research into a double-blind clinical trial ifmetrifonate in Alzheimer's disease. Sleep, Depression, and Dementia in Late Life In an ongoing study of sleep in late life mental disorder, Charles F. Reynolds, m,of the University of Pittsburgh (MH37869) has made a number of key observationsconcerning the prognostic significance of EEG sleep changes in late-life depression:-pretreatment REM latency was significantly lower in depressed geriatric pa-tients who would suffer recurrence compared with those who remained wellduring maintenance drug therapy;-early REM sleep rebound and an antidpressant response to one night of totalsleep deprivation corrently predicted in 88 percent of cases which patientswould show a course consistent with depressive pseudodementia versus progres-sive dementia; and -two-year mortality in patients with mixed depression and cognitive impairmentwas correctly predicted in 77 percent of cases by lengthened REM latency andincreased apnea-hypopnea. Response to Tricyclic Antidepressants in Geriatric Patients Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are widely used and show good results in a largeproportion of adults with depressive disorder. Despite this, elderly patients are par-ticularly sensitive to the side effects of TCAs, and there is some evidence that thepercentage of elderly depressed patients showing a complete therapeutic response toTCAs is lower than in young and middleaged depressed patients. Charles Nemeroffand colleagues at the Duke University Clinical Research Center on Psychopathologyof the Elderly (MH40159) have shown that the inhibition of serotonin uptake intoplatelets by imipramine was markedly reduced in elderly depressed patients (com-pared to younger patients and young and older normal controls). This reduced sensi-tivity to imipramine may explain the reduced responsiveness of geriatric patients toimipramine and other TCAs. Geriatric Psychopharmacology Studies continue to evaluate the effects of age, gender and additional relevantvariables on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of psychotropic drugs inhumans, and to advance the methodological sophistication of this line of research(MH34223, R. Shader, Tufts University, \"Applications of Pharmacokinetics in Clini-cal Psychiatry\"). Across a large number of studies, Shader and his colleagues havefound that various widely used benzodiazepines with approximately equivalent anx-iolytic properties clinically have differing effects in terms of sedation, and impair-ments of memory and performance. These pharmacodynamic effects are explainedin part by pharmacokinetic variations among the drugs, but also are mediated bythe differential receptor binding of these agents. Although, for many benzodiaze-pines (clonazepam, estazolam, lorazepam, triazolam), receptor binding is related tobrain concentrations of the drugs according to a sigmoid function, alprazolam ap-pears to interact with benzodiazepine receptors in a unique way. Furthermore, re-ceptor binding is influenced by various other factors, including stress and aging.Shader's current studies are emphasizing the effects of chronic (i.e., long-term) useof benzodiazepines and of alcohol, as well as changes with age.In other developments, Shader found that pharmacokinetic clearance of chlordia-zepoxide is reduced (and its half-life prolonged) in elderly men, but not in elderlywomen-a pattern that has been noted with various other benzodiazepines. His re-search group also demonstrated that sleep disorder (rebound insomnia) that oftenoccurs following discontinuation of triazolam can be attenuated by a gradual taper-ing regimen. In addition to such findings, the research group has contributed toneuropharmacological research by developing analytic methods for a number ofmedications, and by publishing a computer program for pharmacokinetic analysisusing nonlinear regression techniques.368 Stress and Burden: Family Care of the Elderly Stress associated with family-based care of the elderly has significant social, emo- tional, and health consequences. Research on the primary caregiver, who is general- ly a spouse or daughter, has documented an array of psychological and emotional burdens. Approximately 54 percent of Alzheimer's disease caregivers suffer from a depressive disorder. In addition, caregivers have increased rates of depressive symp- tomatology, anxiety, anger and other stress-related morbidity (D. Gallagher, K. Ye- savage, Stanford University' MH40041 \"Clinical Research Center on Alzheimer's dis- ease'). Significantly, caregivers compared to controls, were no more likely to have a relative with an affective disorder or to have had an episode of affective disorder prior to undertaking the role of caregiver (Kiecolt-Glaser, Ohio State University, MH42096). The findings by Gallagher that AD caregivers have elevated levels of anger under- scores the importance of a new multidisciplinary longitudinal study being conducted (P. Vitaliano, University of Washington, R01 MH42840-1). One aspect of this study' is an examination of caregiver expression of anger and psychosocial, immunologic, and cardiovascular distress. Further, there is preliminary evidence that the stress of caregiving is associated with impaired immune functioning and may have long. term health consequence. Research focusing on the chronic impact of caregiving on immune functioning and psychological stress is being conducted (J. Kiecolt-Glaser, Ohio State University, MH42096-01 \"Caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease Victims: Stress and Mental Health\"). The most recent immunological data from the Kiecolt-Glaser study continues to provide powerful support for the negative changes in immune function in caregivers compared to matched controls. From year one to year two they found that immune functioning continued to decline in contrast to nonsignificant changes in controls. This was somewhat surprising because the caregivers had been providing care for an average of 4 to 6 years, thus it might be expected that the immunological differ- ences would be relatively stable at this point in time. In addition, they now have immunological data available for caregivers whose A.D. patient died or had moved to an institution. These caregivers, in contrast to those providing continuous at- home-caregiving, showed significant improvement in depression (Hamilton, Beck). However, the immunological data show continued decline despite psychological im- provement. These results are intriguing because they may indicate long term physi- ological alterations in caregivers following years of chronic stress. One immediate application of this research, however, is that immune functioning can be used as a biological marker to corroborate self-report health measures. This is, in fact, now being done in a major study of the impact of AD caregiving on adapt- ive health outcomes as influenced by coping style, stress, support, and other person- environment factors (I. Grant, University of California, San Diego, MH42840-01). The investigations of this research suggest that neuroendocrine measures and im- munologic variables may help distinguish successful from unsuccessful caregivers, and may predict those who will themselves develop an illness. Critical events in the role of caregiving have differential impacts on individuals. Several current studies are examining, prospectively, large community samples to - better understand crisis versus adaptation in caregivers (R. Pruchno, Philadelphia Geriatric Center, MH 39546-01) and to identify the range of stressors experienced by caregivers and their access to and use of formal and informal supports (L. Pear- lin, University of California, San Francisco, MH42122-01). There is reason to believe that the stress effects of caregiving may be buffered by a variety of factors. Several recent studies are undertaking an examination of the buffering effects of different types of social support and interaction (K. Pillemer, University of New Hampshire MH42163) and caregiver coping (P. Lawton, Philadel-. phia Geriatric Center MH43371). Building on findings that caregivers have elevated levels of anger and depression, a major intervention study to examine the manage- ment of these emotions is being undertaken (Gallagher, Standord, MH43407). Both psychological and medical (primarily cardiovascular) indices will be used to deter- mine treatment effectiveness. While most studies on caregiving have focused on primary caregivers, there is now evidence that the family system as a whole is at risk for negative consequences. This is particularly the case when the primary caregiver is a married daughter with children still at home (E. Brody, Philadelphia Geriatric Center, MH35252-06, \"Parent Care, Sibling Relationships, and Mental Health\"). There is also evidence that geographically distant family members experience mental health distress when a parent develops Alzheimer's disease.369 This research implies that treatment of an older person necessarily includes in-volvement with the family. Families are not only active participants in care but, byand large, willing and proactive partners. In addition, families themselves need sup-port, and they can often benefit from mental health interventions directed towardthem. Many such interventions-both therapeutic and preventive-are being usedwith families caring for the older disabled person. Self-help and mutual supportgroups are growing in popularity and effectiveness. Mental Disorders in Nursing Home Settings A study by Institute staff and related researchers suggests the need for more pri-mary care physician training in the proper and effective prescribing of psychotropicmedications. The analysis examined the prescribing of psychotropics by primarycare physicians in nursing homes (Beardsley, Larson, Burns, Thompson, and Ka-merow: The Journal of the American Geriatric Society, Vol. 37, No. 4, pgs 327-330,1989), using data from the National Nursing Home Pretest, a random sample of 150homes (Skilled and Intermediate Care), stratified by bed size and type of ownership,with the sampling occurring in four metropolitan U.S. areas. Findings from thisstudy included: (1) more than 20 percent of those patients receiving a psychotropicmedication did not have a corresponding mental disorder diagnosis: (2) more than 25percent of those receiving one psychotropic medication were receiving a second psy-chotropic medication as well: and (3) for those receiving at least one psychotropicmedication, they were simultaneously receiving, on the average, an additional 3.3nonpsychotropic medications. Two other studies by Institute staff and related researchers found a paucity of re-search on mental disorders in nursing homes published in major geriatric and psy-chiatry journals. In a systematic analysis of all quantified studies published in threemajor clinical geriatric journals (Beardsley, Larson, Lyons, Gottlieb, Rabins, andRovner: Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences Vol. 44, No. 1, pgs. M30-35, 1989),the authors found that all three of the journals had published only about 5 percentof their geriatric research studies conducted in nursing home contexts. Of the 50studies conducted in nursing home environments, very few included factors ofmental health services. Only one study assessed the impact of counseling, while fivestudies assessed improving specific patient symptoms via behavior modificationtechniques. Only four of the studies evaluated the use of psychotropic medicationtechiques. Only four of the studies evaluated the use of psychotropic medications,but none of these four studied either antianxiety or antipsychotic medications, themost frequently used and the most problematic nursing home psychotropic drugs.In a second systematic analysis published in FY 1989 (Larson, Lyons, Hohmann,Beardsley, Huckeba, Rabins, and Lebowitz: International Journal of Geriatric Psy-chiatry Vol. 4, No. 3, pgs. 129-134, 1989), the authors found that between 1966 and1985 very few nursing home studies were published in The American Journal of Psy-chiatry, Archives of General Psychiatry, and Hospital and Community Psychiatry.This analysis found that only 33 articles, or one-fourth of 1 percent all articles pub-lished in the two decades surveyed and in the three psychiatry journals reviewed,concerned nursing home populations. Only 15 of the 33 nursing home articles in-cluded quantified data, with the remainder being either reviews of the literature,commentaries or case reports. In both of the systematic reviews of published arti-cles, the research that was published was found to suffer from design, methodologi-cal and analytic shortcomings. A review of nursing home grant applications submitted to the Institute during theyears 1975 through 1986 found proportions similarly low to the proportion of arti-cles found in the clinical geriatric journals. Only 0.3 percent, or 61 of 20.904 applica-tions submitted, were to conduct research in nursing home environments. Of the 61submitted, 67 percent were disapproved, 21 percent approved but not funded, andonly 12 percent were funded. Medicare and Prospective Payment of Psychiatric Services Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health are refining a Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) methodology for possible use in reimbursingpsychiatrists under the Medicare Part B program. This Institute-funded project(Contract No. NIMH 278-87-0024) is part of a larger study being financed by theHealth Care Financing Adminstration (HCFA) in response to a Congressional man-date (Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) to the Secretary of the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services to develop a relative value scale that estab-lishes a numerical relationship among the various physicians' services for which370 payment may be made under the Medicare Part B program or under State plans approved under Title XIX (Medicaid). The development of the overall Relative Value Scale Study evolves in part from an interest in developing a prospective payment system- for various medical special- ties that has the potential of more accurately reflecting the various resource inputs by medical specialists than the current customary, prevailing, and reasonable charge (CPR) system utilized in the Medicare Program. The new methodology meas- ures five major components of physician practice by assigning a numerical value for a variety of procedures used by each of the specialties, including operative or en- counter time, pre- and post-operative or encounter time, complexity or intensity per unit of time in performing the procedure, overhead costs, and the amortized value of the opportunity cost for specialty training after medical school. Preliminary findings for the first phase of the NIMH study, directed by Dr. Wil- liam C. Hsiao, Professor of Economics and Health Policy at the Harvard School, in- dicate that fees paid to psychiatrists under the Medicare Part B prgram would in- crease by approximately 7 percent. However, because of sample size limitations in this first phase of the study, as well as the limited number of psychiatric procedures used in this phase under the Physician's Current Procedural Terminology, fourth edition (CPT-4) and the need for more current overhead costs, a second phase, 15- month refinement of the initial analysis is being- conducted by the Harvard re- searchers: The refinement analysis, scheduled for completion on June 30, 1989, is financed by the Institute at a cost of $209,621. This research is being conducted in close collaboration with the American Psychiatric Association and the Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, which have work groups that are considering revi- sions to the CPT-4 procedural classification system used by the Medicare Program. Survey of Mental Health Services Use by the Elderly, The 1986 sample survey of inpatient, outpatient, and partial care programs con- ducted by the Survey and Reports Branch, Division of Biometry and Applied Sci- ences, National Institute of Mental Health, collected detailed information about the characteristics and treatment of the elderly population in mental health organiza- tions. An estimated 17,909 elderly persons 65 years old or older were under care on April 1, 1986, in inpatient psychiatric services of specialty mental health organiza- tions, and 130,443 elderly were admitted to these inpatient programs during 1986. When comparing the representation of the elderly in the under care and admission populations of inpatient programs, the elderly represented a slightly larger percent- age of those under care than of those admitted (11 percent v. 8 percent). In outpa- tient psychiatric programs, 89,590 elderly persons were under care on Apiil 1, 1986, and 66,962 elderly were admitted during 1986. A dramatic difference existed in the percentage of elderly represented in the under care and admission populations of State and county mental hospital outpatient programs. The elderly represented 12 percent of the population under care in these outpatient programs, but only 1 per- cent of the admission population. In partial care programs, an estimated 10,478 el- derly were under care on April 1, 1986, and 7,512 were admitted during the year. PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT-INITIATWES FOR FY 1990 There are several initiatives planned for FY 1990 in the Institute, these include program development in the following areas: Depression in the Elderly Three major activities are planned in this area: Workshops on the neurocognitive correlates of late life depression; on treatment resistant depression in older patients; and a workgroup to evaluate the feasibility of planning a consensus conference in this area. Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders Activities planned in this area include a workship on clinical/basic neuroscience in AD, a workship on psychopharmacologic approaches to memory disorders, and a meeting panel on caregiving.371 Financing of Mental Health Services Research will be stimulated on the financing and cost-effectiveness of outpatient and inpatient care for the mentally ill elderly. Other Initiatives Other activities planned include continuation of activities in DSM-IV and the planning for the second major conference on mental illness in nursing homes.372 aM1UCAL \"Aging and Dementia: Cholinergic Neuron Biochemistry\", $352,864 The goal of this investigation is to provide insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of the cholinergic dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease and some other dementing disorders, and to attempt to use some of the information obtained to improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis. During the previous project period, a number of new monoclonal antibodies were developed and used as probes for the study of pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease. One of these, Alz-50, appears to detect the presence of a protein, A68, which is abundant in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's but is not detectable in the normal adult brain. In this current project period, the investigators will attempt to test the hypothesis that the presence of A68 in cerebroopinal fluid predicts the presence of Alzheimer pathology in the brain. They will also conduct a comprehensive study of possible differences between both plaques and tangles in demented and non-demented elderly subjects, employing monoclonal antibodies to A68 and to other proteins. Studies will continue on the expression to A68-like immunoreactivity in the developing human CNS. 5RO1H43506-02, Gary cDNA Cloning\", $111,707 The aims of this study are: 1. The fragmentation of purified PNF and determination of limited peptide sequence. 2. The cloning, oligonucleotide hybridization, of cDNAs to putative PHF mRNAs. 3. Analysis of these cDNAs, including the determination of the complete DNA sequence. 4. Immunochemical proof that the encoded proteins are PHF- related. 5. Estimation of the amounts of PHF-specific proteins in normal and AD brain. The following studies have been conducted: Paired helical filaments have been isolated from Alzheimer's diseased cortex and purified by electrophoretic separation in the presence of SDS. For the first time, it has been determined that a modified form of actin appears zo be part of the PHF structure. Recently, evidence has been obtained that electrophoretically purified and SDS-solubilized PNF-derived proteins could be reconstituted in bulk into structure with the appearance of genuine PHF upon the removal of SDS. This technique should permit investigators to deduce precisely which polypeptides are true components of the PHF structure, allowing them to rationalize the choice of the 66 kDa polypeptide. The researchers are also in the process of raising monoclonal antibodies to the electrophoretically solubilized PHF proteins. * Dolar ammnts cited in abstracts are recommended direct casts only and do not reflect anmomt of Actual aed.

The specific hypotheses of the current longitudinal projectremain unchanged from the approved proposal. They include: 1. The rate of longitudinal decline in glucose metabolism isgreater for Alzheimer's patients than age matched controls. 2. In Alzheimer's disease, the temporal association cortex, whichshows pronounced deficits at baseline, will continue to decline.3. Individuals with white matter lesions, especially those withAlzheimer's disease are more likely to show change over time. 17 of the 26 longitudinal PET studies have been subject to regionof interest analysis. As expected, the patients differedsignificantly from the controls only in Global DeteriorationScale. Furthermore, the AD patients show progressive cognitivedecline over the study interval. For the PET data, each of the regions of interest were subject toanalysis of variance with diagnosis as a between subjects factor.Analysis of the difference scores showed that the AD patientssignificantly declined and the controls were unchanged intemporal, parietal, and frontal association cortex. Also, notall regions are equally changing over time in AD. The primarymotor sensory and visual cortices showed significant changesindicating that as AD progresses, there is involvement of the primary sensory and motor projections. Areas such as cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia, which are preserved in AD, showed nofurther decline. Overall, as AD progresses, the corticaldeficits become more diffuse, however the maximal decline occursin the temporal cortex, and subcortical structures remain spared. There is no evidence at this time that the rates of decline aredifferent between patients with and without white matter lesions. As estimated from cross sectional work, the magnitude of the PETdetermined functional brain degeneration in AD is greater thanthe CT determined structural change. 5ROlMN43240-02, Leonard Heston, M.D., University of Minnesota, \"Family Studies in Dementia', *163,016 The object of this proposal is to locate and then characterize DNA sequences associated with Alzheimer's Disease or Pick'sDisease or both. During the 02 year, investigators continued to identifypotential families with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD),further define the families already ascertained, performed RFLPanalysis on the current group of families using chromosome 21probes, and performed linkage analysis to detect the likelylocation of FAD gene. The complex nature of FAD diagnosis and the potential of geneticand etiologic heterogeneity has led the researchers to attempt tocomplete the individual pedigrees as fully as possible withrespect to ages of all individuals. The presence of FAD inpedigree members has been verified by autopsy. Members of theinformative families for linkage have been requested to provideblood samples. These samples are used to establishlymphoblastoid cell lines from which DNA may be extracted andgenetic linkage analysis may be performed. Additional typingresults in other family members and the analysis of thesefamilies using the multipoint linkage strategy are being plannedand may produce information concerning the location of FAD withrespect to markers (particularly pPW228c and pPW236b) or othermarkers.374 2R37MH39145-06, Carol Miller, M.D., University of Southern California, \"Mental Illness in Alzheimer's Disease of the Aged\", $238.696 The hypothesis of this proposal is that a defined spectrum of molecular changes will be detectable in AD target tissue and that the sites and degree of AD may be related to specific changes incognition and behavior during the clinical course of thepatients. This study proposes to analyze neuronal-specific function at 3levels: clinical, histologic, and molecular. The clinical studies will focus on the visual system, integrating the neurologic and psychometric database with specific visual function studies. A parallel histologic assessment of auditory system neuronal changes will be made. Temporal progression of neuronal loss in AD will be examined. With use of neuron- specific monoclonal probes, the architectonic differences in neuronal changes in AD will also be compared to other dementing diseases. The AD-vulnerable neurons will be further defined by: 1) immunocytochemical identification of their associated neurotransmitter and neuropeptides, 2) molecular characterization of Ag3F12, and 3) development of a neuron-enriched cDNA library. Development of this neuronal subset-specific molecular panel may contribute to the understanding of regulatory mechanisms operative in these cells in AD. 2R01HN40705-04, Andrew Leuchter, M.D., UCLA, \"Mental Illness inthe Elderly: Diagnostic Testing\", $212,340 The two are: 1. develop computer-analyzed electroencephalography (CEEG) morefully as a tool for the differential diagnosis of dementia 2. begin to establish links between brain functional - abnormalities seen on CEEG and structural lesions seen on MRI scans. There are six steps in this research plan. 1. New subjects will be recurited for the esicting cohort ofsubjects with Alzheimer's disease (DAT), multi-infarct dementia (MID), and normal control subjects (CON). 2. Subjects will be recruited for 3 additional groups: those with major depressive episode (MDE), dementia of affective disorder (DAD) and dementia of other or unknown etiologies. 3. All subjects will undergo conventional EEG studies. 4. All MRI scans will be quantitatively rated by two neuroradiologists .for the severity and location of deep white matter lesions, periventricular lucencies, and atrophy. 5. Subjects will be reassessed on an annual basis. 6. Subjects will be followed to autopsy to confirm clinical diagnoses and correlate MRI lesions with neuropathological findings I Rol MH43326-01A1, Godfrey Pearloon, M.D., Johns Hopkins, \"D2 Receptor, MNI and CT Changes in Late Onset Schizophrenia\". $282,324 This study will exanine the structural and dopsuine D2 receptor brain changes associated with late life onset schizophrenia using MRI, CT, and PET scanning. Preliminary studies indicate that schizophrenic illnes with late life onset shows both important similarities and differences compared to more typical cases with onset in early life. Control groups will consist of elderly normal volunteers and currently elderly early life onset schizophrenics, matched for age, sex, and race with the late life onset schizophrenics. Structural brain and receptor changes will be analyzed to determine their association with clinical symptomatology, neuropsychologic abnormalities. sensory deficits, and social factors. This may aid understanding of late life onset schizophrenia, and clarify the relationship of this syndrome both to early onset cases and to the psychopathology of aging.375 6R01MH40843-03, Peter Rabin-, M.D., Johns Hopkins University,Structural Brain Changes in Late Life Mental Disorder\". $134.360 This project will use a newly developed CT head scan imageprocess analysis technique to study structural correlates of latelife major depression and dementia. To date there are a total of 61 subjects enrolled in this study. The neuropsychological findings confirm previous literature on demented-depressed patients showing that they perform more poorly than age matched depressives on tests of verbal free recall memory as well as verbal recognition mesory. However, they foundthat performance was equal in depressed cognitively normal anddepressed cognitively abnormal individuals on visual recognition memory. They also report an impairment in confrontation naming in depressed demented patients. They performed as poorly asirreversibly demented Alzheimer patients in both speed and accuracy of naming. This could reflect a previously unrecognized language impairment and suggest that it is indeed a precursor to a progressive Alzheimer-type dementia. It could also reflect thenonlocalizing nature of naming. CT scan data suggest that whileventricular enlargement is present in elderly depressives, hippocampal atrophy may be persent only in AD patients. In the next year they will further explore the common co-occurrence of depression and medical/neurologic illness in theelderly depressives. Pilot data will be analysed to determine if improvement in cognition and response to treatment for depressionoccurs at the same rate in the groups who have been excluded from the study because of medical co-morbidity as it does in individuals without identifiable co-morbid conditions. 5ROlMH41648-03, Youngjai Kim, Ph.D., Beth Israel Medical Center.\"Senile Dementia and Brain Atrophy: A Longitudinal Study\", 8181,866 This study concerns one of the puzzling issues observed in AD.the poor correlation between dementia and brain atrophy seen on CT scan. The researchers postulate that predictive informationfor the course of dementia might be buried in incongruent CT anddementia configurations. Currently there are 37 Alzheimer's patients and 35 normalcontrol subjects. Nippocampal volume of 14 AD and 13 controlsubjects has been performed. The ratings of baseline CT scansindicate the following: 1. When the four radiologists' ratings on the Overall Atrophyof each subject were averaged, 60X of AD patients had significantatrophy and 40X had relatively mild atrophy. 78X of had no atrophy and 22X had mild-to-moderatelysignificant atrophy. Statistical analyses are being performed tocorrelate the extent of baseline CT atrophy with cognitive testresults. The significance and relevance of white matter changes inAlzheimer's Disease is not clear and the investigators hope tofind some clues to this issue in their longitudinal study.Preliminary data appear to indicate that while the performanceof the demented subjects has deteriorated, the performance of thenormal controls showed improvement. Many normal control subjects remembered the baseline test tasks and the improvement could beattributed to practice effect. Normal elderly appear to continueto learn and improve. For the 03 year, plans are to continue data collection, publishbaseline findings and preliminary longitudinal findings.376 2ROlHN40052-04, Walton Roth, M.D., Stanford, \"Automatic Elicitation of Cognitive ERP Components\", 8156,669 The four aims of this project are: 1. employ auditory stimuli to explore ways of automatically eliciting N400, a component usually elicited visually by semantically incongruous words. 2. test for the beat auditory stimulus frequency and stimulus duration characteristics for eliciting the automatic P300 in healthy elderly. 3. test healthy young and old subjects on both automatic and effortful versions of the P300 and MKN paradigms, as well as the auditory N400 paradigm to assess cognitive changes associated with normal aging 4. test Alzheimer's patients on the same paradigms to determine whether effortfully or automatically elicited ERP components best delineate cognitive deficits in the patient group. Event Response Potentials (ERPs) have been invaluable in delineating the timing and amount of specific aspects of information processing in cooperative and cognitively intact subjects, but they have been less helpful in the assessment of patients unable or unwilling to cooperate with testing procedures. The researchers-propose to continue developing paradigms for eliciting cognitive event related potential components automatically, and applying them along with conventional tank-related paradigms to anness cognitive changes associated with aging and dementia. 5ROlMH37869-07, Charles Reynolds, M.D., Western PsychiatricInstitute and Clinic, \"EEG Sleep, Aging, and Mental Illness', 6316,465 This is a study of the development of objective indicators of diagnosis, treatment response, and prognosis, based on neasures of nocturnal EEG sleep parameters in healthy elderly controls, major depressives, Alzheimer's patients, and mixed symptom patients. During this past year preliminary analyses has been done of the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation experiment which suggest that elderly depressed patients show more rapid phasic REM activity accumulation than controls and demented, as well as more fixed intranight REM sleep temporal distribution. By contrast, healthy controls evidence more plasticity of REM sleep activity generation. Demented patients show the lowest rate of REM activity generation. Recovery from REM sleep deprivation appears to have a differential impact on slow wava sleep counts: decreasing in controls, increasing in depressives, and staying the same in demented subjects. During the coming year an experiment will be done to test the cholinerigic supersensitivity hypothesis in mixed-symptom (pseudo-demented vs. depressed demented) patients. The investigators will complete enrollment of mixed-symptom patients (i.e., those with both depression and cognitive impairment) into the REM Sleep Deprivation study. This will include projects on Psychobiology of Vulnerability to Recurrence in Late-Life Depression; Psychobiology of Bereavement-related Depression in Late Life; Longterm Evolution of EEG Sleep and Sleep Quality in Healthy 60-90 Year Olds.377 5ROIHh43261-02, George Zubenko, M.D., Western PsychiatricInstitute and Clinic. 'Biological Marker for Primary Dementia in the Elderly\", $250,768 This proposal describes an interrelated series of clinical and preclinical investigations of a biological marker, membranefluidity, in the study of primary degenerative dementia. The following studies were conducted during the past budget year: 1). Electroencephalographic correlates of increased platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease. EEGs from 49 moderate- severely demented patients with probable Alzheimer's were subjected to visual and computerized spectral analysis: Only 14.3X of the cases in the subgroup with increased platelet membrane fluidity exhibited focal EEG abnormalities while 42.9X of the residual subgroup exhibited focal EEG findings 2). Cognitive function and platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease increased platelet membrane fluidity identifies a clinically-distinct subgroup of 50X of patients meeting criteria for Alzheimer's. This study compared the cognitive impairments of patients in this subgroup to those observed in the residual subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's who had normal platelet membrane fluidity. No significant differences in the number or distribution of deficits in 6 cognitive domains were observed. 3). Longitudinal study of platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease. Increased platelet membrane fluidity identifies a prominent subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's who exhibit distinct clinical features. In this longitudinal study, the stability of platelet membrane fluidity was demonstrated. 4). Familial risk of dementia associated with a biologic subtype of Alzheimer's disease. Relatives of patients with Alzheimer's showed a 50X risk of dementia regardless of the platelet membrane phenotype of the respective proband. Relatives of patients with increased platelet membrane fluidity who developed dementia exhibited symptoms significantly earlier than relatives ofpatients with normal platelet membrane fluidity. 5). Honozygotic twins concordant for probable Alzheimer's disease. This study was consistent with published data suggesting that increased platelet membrane fluidity is associated with a clinically distinct subtype of Alzheimer's disease and this platelet membrane characteristic may be genetically determined. 6). Platelet membrane fluidity and treatment response in cognitively-impaired, depressed elderly. These were patients treated with nortriptyline. Those who exhibited worsening of their cognitive impairment exhibited \"increased' platelet membrane fluidity. 7). S-Adenosyl-L-sethionine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Results imply that while SA~e may be useful for other conditions associated with altered membrane fluidity, such as normal aging, changing membrane fluidity per ae is not likely to lead to marked changes in symptoms in AD. 1 ROl MH42819-OIAl, George Alexopoulos, M.D., Cornell, \"Longitudinal Study of Late Life Depression, $209,406 This is a five-year longitudinal project which will study the clinical presentation, outcomes, and predictors of outcomes of geriatric depression with a focus on the effect of age of illness onset. Preliminary data suggest that clinical, biological and family history differences exist between LLD (depression that first occurs in late life) and ELD (depression that first occurs in early life). Specifically, it is hypothesized that: 1. more LLD subjects have delusions, medical morbidity, and/or cognitive dysfunction during episodes. 2, LLD subjects have poorer outcome, including more relapses, dementia, and medical morbidity. 3. LLD subjects have different demographic, clinical, and psychosocial predictors of specific outcomes. The study is expected to yield information that clinicians can use to: 1) determine prognosis of geriatric depression; 2) assess risk-benefit ratio of therapeutic or preventive interventions; 3) identify periods of highest risk for adverse outcomes and plan treatment accordingly.378 SROMH36801-06, R. Thornton Sargent, UC-Berkeley, \"PET Brain Blood Flow and Metabolism in Alzheimer's\", 6196,029 The aim of this proposal is to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in Alzheimer'o dementia and to relate rCBF to regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMR) with positron emission tomography (PET). This study han previously validated the use of I-HIPDM an an extracted flow tracer for rCBF with PET. Comparinons of the regional reactivity to CO show that all regions except thalamus had significant increases in blood flow following CO inhalation. Thin regional difference has not been previously reported. In normal subjects, the researchers found no decrease in blood flow per se with advancing age, in any brain region. However, when the CO reactivity was examined, it was found that increasing age resulted in a diminished CO reactivity in cortex. The sample size is still too small to draw conclusions based on statistics, but at this point the vascular reactivity seems to be comparable to that seen in controls. These results indicate that patients with AD retain the ability to increase cerebral blood flow in response to CO even in those regions most oeverlely affected by the disease. In the next year, nubjects will be increased to include enough AD patients to be studied for cerebrovamcular reactivity 5 R01 MH40827-OS DAT: Longitudinal Perspective\", $192,262 The overall goal of this project continues to be the comprehensive and longitudinal investigation of the effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on communicative function in relation to the following variables: (a) age at disease onset; (b) presence of extraPyramidal symptomatology; (c) family history of AD; (d) rate of disease progression; and (e) dementia severity. The following substudies were conducted during the past, 04, year: 1. Performance of mildly and moderately demented subjects on a linguistic communication battery: task or concept effect. 2. Analysis of the effect of age-at-onset on linguisitc communication performance (LCP). 3. Confronting naming in AD: Evidence of subgroups. 4. Relation of object naming to categorical knowledge. 5. Confrontation naming to picture and objects in relation to auditory comprehension. 6. Performance of advanced AD subjects on linguistic communication tasks: Task or concept effect. 7. Caregiver perceptions of communication deficits of AD patients. In the last, 05, year of this grant, the investigators will continue the above substudies. The paradigm used in this study permits the investigation of possible dissociations among communicative abilities as a result of AD and enables the investigators to study the integrity of the structure and processes of declarative memory systems. 1ROIH43872-01, Kathryn Bayles, Ph.D., University of Arizona, \"Communication and Neuropsychiatric Status in Dementia\", $231,889 The purposes of this project are: (1) to compare patterns of impairment in language and communicative functions, psychiatric, and neurologic status in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD); (2) to describe the progression of change in language and communicative functions, psychiatric, and neurologic status during the course of PD and AD; and (3) to determine the relation of onset and duration of symptoms and depression in PD and AD to the nature of language and communication deficits. The investigators have chosen to approach the study of the effects of PD and AD on language and communicative function as an investi- gation of semantic, episodic, and procedural memory because deficits in the different communicative functions are reducible to deficits in these more generic systems.379 5ROlMH42103-02, Nathan Billig, M.D., Georgetown University, \"Mental Health Changes after Surgery in the Elderly\", 3216.253 The purpose of this study is to assess the extent to which cognitive impairment and/or depression are precipitated or exacerbated bv surgery in the elderly. Specifically, the research aims of the project for the coming year are *a originally proposed: A. to assess the prevalence of peri-operative cognitive impairment and depression in a sample of patients aged 60 and over, undergoing elective surgery. B. to assess whether hospitalization and surgery serve as precipitating factors for cognitive impairment and depression in the elderly. C. to define cognitive impairment in the peri-operative period as to its clinical correlates, including medication use, the nature of the surgical procedure, anesthesia, etc. D. to estimate the extent to which elective surgery affects recovery of pre-morbid functioning over a period of a year following surgery. In the first year, procedures for gaining access to the lists of patients scheduled for surgery were negotiated, and the complex network of surgeons, their staffs, patients and the research staff worked together well. A computerized database was developed for patients scheduled for surgery during the course of this study. All study subjects are receiving structured face-to-face interviews, using a questionnaire to obtain historical and demographic data. Interview and medical record data are being coded and entered into a database for analysis. A preliminary analysis of the results of the Mini-Mental State scores shows that overall the sample is remarkably cognitively intact. The immediate post-operative test results indicate no significant changes except for the oldest age group. No cases of major depression have been identified to date. The sample pool will be enlarged and an increased number of surgical procedures will be performed in future vears. 2ROIMH24433-13. Suzanne Corkin, Ph.D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \"Behavioral Effects of Brain Injury\", t352,330 The overall goal of the proposed research is to investigate brain mechanisms underlying normal human perception, cognition, and action. The approach is to study patterns of sparing and loss of function in patients with selected cerebral lesions. This is a continuation study. In the longitudinal study preceeding, veterans with penetrating head injuries received in World War 11 declined sore in cognition from the 1950s to the 1980s than control veterans with peripheral nerve injuries. The researchers are now proposing to examine some implications of this decline. First they will determine the generality of the effects of head injuries on behavior by continuing the longitudinal study of 203 surviving veterans of the Korean Conflict. Retesting the Korean Conflict veterans will permit them to determine a) whether penetrating head injuries increased cognitive decline in that sample relative to uninjured control subjects, b) whether penetrating and closed head injuries increased cognitive decline equally and c) wbicb of a variety of cognitive, sensory, sensorimotor, and psychiatric measures showed precipitous decline following bead injury. The second question concerns the pathophysiology of precipitous decline. Norphosetric analyses of magnetic resonance imsges will determine the volumes of lesions and of selected brain structures and a series of cognitive, sensory, and motor tests snd psychiatric instruments will assess behavioral functions. Researchers believe that two degenerative processes contribute to decline, and that morphometric analysis is sensitive to the effect of both (a) trasneuronal degeneration consequent to the original injury that compromises new brain regions, and (b) brain atrophy due to aging that impairs the ability of regions spared by the original injury to compensate for dasaged tissue. The third question integrates the labs' long-standing interests in the behavioral effects of brain injury and of Alzheimer's disease. 26-386 S184,472 This is a study of schizophrenia with onset after age 45. The researchers postulate that this illness in this age group is a heterogeneous entity with diffferent subtypes, some of which may be identifiable with certain clinical, neuropsychological and brain morphological evaluations and may be associated with differences in neuroleptic response. In the 02 year 28 patients with a probable diagnosis of late- onset schizophrenia were evaluated. Assessments included psychiatric exam, quantitative neurological exam, neuropsychological testing, and MRI or CT scans. Patients had to meet DSM-III-R criteria for late-onset schizophrenia, as determined independently by at least three physicians. The results to date are: 1. Clinical -late-onset schizophrenia was predominantly of paranoid type. 2. Neuropsychological -patients performed similar to controls on tests of general cognitive abilities but significantly worse on tests of abstraction, concept formation or problem solving. 3. MRI -a majority of patients had abnormalities such as increased signal intensity. All scans were ranked separately on two parameters: ventricular enlargement and signal hyperintensity.- The three groups were not perfectly matched, but a tentative impression about the results is that it seemed the late-onset schizophrenic patients tended to be slightly more abnormal than normal controls in terms of ventricular enlargement and signal hyperintensity, while the Alzheimer's patients appeared to be much more abnormal than either group on both parameters. The work so far suggests that late-onset schizophrenia is, in all likelihood, a valid diagnostic entity. Researchers are continuing to follow late-onset schizophrenic and other psychotic patients, as well as normal controls. 1ROlMH45048-01, Marian Goldstein, M.D., SUNY-Buffalo, \"Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Elderly Undergoing Surgery\", 8197,482 This is a 36 month empirical investigation into the relationship between geriatric surgery and neuropsychiatric decline. The effects of 3 types of elective surgery, all performed under general anesthesia, will be studied: 1) TJR -total and 3) inguinal hernia repair. Subjets will range from 55 to 75 years old. A preoperative psychosocial history, and a battery of 7 standardized measuring instruments will be administered, covering cognitive, affective and functional-behavior aspects of patient behavior. The research design will be a multiple time series design, in which the dependent variable measures will be administered three times. The design will test 5 major research hypothes pertaining to the incidence of post-surgical decline in older patients, its moderation by sex, age and type of surgery and its relationship to post-operative delirium. 1 R829 MH44697-01 Alan Kluger, Ph.D., and White Matter Lesions in Aging\". $106,172 This is a study to examine possible relationships among motoric dysfunction, presence of periventricular white matter lesions (PWML), and cognitive function in the elderly. The presence of PWML on CT/MRI has been recently associated with subcliniical motor deficits in cognitively normal elderly subjects and with an increased prevalence of motor dysfunction and gait abnormalities in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This study will test the motor function of 60 cognitively normal and 60 mildly cognitively impaired elderly subjects by using a variety of neuropsychological and computerized tests of motor/psychomotor performance. Results fron this investigation ar-.expected to contribute to basic knowledge about brain- benavior relationships in aging and dementia.381 IR03 MH45054-OlAI, Joan McDowd, University of Southern California, \"Differential Rates of Aging of the Cerebral Hemispheres\", 529,922 This is a Small Grant looking at differences in aging rates of the right cerebral hemisphere and the left, as evidenced by a performance decrement on tasks assessing functions specialized to the right hemisphere, which has not been seen for tasks assessing functions specialized to the left hemisphere. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate right hemiaging with divided attention/dual task methods. Single and dual tasks will be performed by both younger and older subjects. If, as previously suggested, the right hemisphere does show an age-related decline, manipulospatial activities such as driving and certain occupations which require intact spatial abilities may be negatively affected. I R03 MH44433-01, Arthur Kramer, Univ. of Illinois, \"Aging & the Development of Automatic Processing\", $37,757 This Samll Grant will focus on the investigation of age-related changes in human information processing. Specifically, investigators are interested in how these age-related changes impact the acquisition of new skills and how information processing strategies might be used to reduce decrements in the rate of learning and asymptotic level of performance that are observed with older individuals. This hypothesis is that the conservative response bias observed in the elderly inhibits the acquisition of new cognitive skills and that this deficit may be reduced or eliminated through manipulations which affect response strategies. In addition to contributions to theories of skill acquisition and aging, researchers believe the the research has important practical implications for the development of training strategies that are well suited to older individuals. 5ROlMH41930-03, Robert Marin, M.D., Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, \"Apathy in Late Life Mental Disorders\", $72,151 The overall objective of this project is to document and explore the heuristic value of the concept of apathy for the clinical management and investigation of late life mental disorders. One major hpothesis of this study is that levels of apathy will be significantly higher in right hemisphere stroke (RH), probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression than in normals (NL) and left hemisphere stroke (LH). The comparison of apathy and depression is of particular importance in this study because of the overlap of these two dimensions of behavior in depressive disorders and the fact that the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) includes items which are intended to be sensitive to depression. The ability to discriminate the dimensions of apathy and depression in a sample that includes subjects with depressive disorders would provide particularly strong evidence for the construct validity of the AES. The overall pattern of convergent and discriminant validity correlations provides substantial evidence for the construct validity of the AES and supports the project thesis that apathy is indeed a valid dimension of behavior which is discriminable from depression. In the final year of the project the investigators will continue testing subjects and data analysis will continue. Pilot data pertinent to the development of further research will be evaluated as well. The researchers have recently obtained CT scans on almost all stroke subjects tested to date. They plan to correlate infarct size and location with measures of apathy.382 5RO1MH43435-02, Leonard Poon, Ph.D.. University of Georgia, \"Adaptation and Mental Health of the Oldest Old\" $223,409 This research will examine the proceses involved in thesuccessful adaptation of cognitively intact, community-dwellingoctagenerians and centarians. The major interest is in thenature of the mental health, coping, adaptational skills, andenvironmental support that are necessary to survive successfully in the different stages of late adulthood. Currently eight individuals have participated in this study. Although too small to yield any significant results, a trend isvisible for age differences in family longevity, number of life.events experienced and religiosity. The-centarians reportedfewer overall critical stresses over their life-span. Theirscore on ritualistic religiosity was also lower than the one forthe other age groups. In the next year, 100 subjects from 3 age cohorts will be tested.Investigators also hope to do data coding and begin to debriefsubjects tested so far. The research continues to examine the processes involved in thesuccessful adaptation of cognitively intact, community dwellingoctagenerians and centarians. Four hypothetical models are being designed within a defined general model of factors contributing to life satisfaction, adaptation, and health of the oldest old. First relates a number of adaptational or survival skills; seconddescribes the patterns of physical and mental health amongcognitively intact 60, 80 and 100 year olds and the influence ofhealth on life satisfaction, cognitive skills, andthe level of environmental support; third relates the patterns of activities, time use, and environmental support as indicators of lifesatisfaction and mental health; fourth links individualcharacteristics as predictors of life satisfaction and mental andphysical health. 5 R29 MH43856-02, Barnett Meyers, M.D., N.Y. Hosp. -Cornell, \"Geriatric Major Depression and Delusions\". $04,070 This is study of disturbances of hypothalmic-pituitary- adrenocortical function in-elderly depressives. It will be testing the theory that hypercortisolemia resulting from the depressed state interacts with a trait for an excessive dopaminergic response to steroid stimulation in the patbogenesis of mood-congruent delusional depression. This grant on geriatric major depression and delusions completed its first year in April with the following initial results: 1. subjects with pretreatment DST (Dexamethasome Suppression Test) nonsuppresion achieved normal responses with recovery; subjects with pretreatment suppression continued to have this response; these data suggest that DST nonsuppression is depressed-state specific in the physically well elderly. 2. The preliminary finding that mood congruent delusional subjects achieved the highest post DST plasma cortisol levels is compatible with a principal study hypothesis. The subjects will continue to be studied during the 02 year.Clinical and neurobiulogic assessments will 'be made and post- treatment studies will be done on several subjects. 0 Ro3 MH43549-OlAl, Alan Stoudemire, M.D., Emory Univ.,\"cognitive Dysfunction in Geriatric Depression\", $37,985 This Small Grant will be examining the outcome of elderly depressives with or without signs of concurrent cognitivedysfunction after treatment with tricyclic antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy. Analyses will be performed to a)measure the effects of TCA/ECT treatment on cognitive functioning in the elderly depressed patient; b) evaluate the outcome ofdepressed patients with and without concurrent cognitive dysfunction after treatment of depression, c) to assess if neuropsychological markers can be useful in predicting treatment response in this population.383 5ROIMH43390-02, Ramon Valle, Ph.D., San Diego State University, \"Hispanic Elderly Cognitive Screen Validation Study\", 1192,820 This is a study to evaluate the Spanish language version of two commonly used cognitive screens: the Folstein Mini Mental Status Exam and the Blessed (et.al. 1968) Mental Status Exam with Spanish Speaking Mexican heritage-Hispanic elderly age sixty plus. The goal of the study is to follow the physical and mental health of 600 men from adolescence until late middle life. The purpose is to follow 2 large cohorts of men prospectively until retirement and until a significant amount of chronic illness occurs. To be determined are what familial, childhood, and early adult psychological variables predict physical morbidity, early retirement and psychopathology of late midlife; what is the natural history of marital and occupational careers over the male lifespan and how do these careers affect late-life psycho- pathology and deterioration of physical health?

During this past year two studies have been conducted: 1. Longitudinal study of cognitive functioning in unimpaired elderly with subjective memory decline. This study involves annual evaluations of 60 to 80-year-old individuals who have complaints of memory decline, but no evidence of dementia. They have demographic characteristics comparable to a concurrent sample of 100 patients who have a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease and are being followed in a parallel. separate project. One major objective of this study is the development of improved psychometric procedures for detecting early Alzheimer's disease. The second objective of the study is assessing the long-term clinical outcome of elderly individuals who have memory complaints. The majority of the patients have remained remarkably stable clinically and psychometrically. 2. Automatic and intentional processing in Alzheimer's disease. This study's objective is to compare intentional and automatic information retrieval in patients having a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease. The hypothesis is that mild to moderately impaired individuals will be relatively unimpaired on measures of automatic activation in comparison to demographically matched unimpaired control subjects. 5R37MH33688-10, Patricia Prinz, Ph.D., University of Washington. \"Bionarkers for Early Expression of Alzheimer's Disease\", 8300,180 This study proposes to test the ability of biomarkers to predict for AD-like decline in a sample of 300 individuals \"at risk\" for AD. During the past year, the investigators have refined and improved their analysis techniques using EEGs from a previous population of diagnosed Alzheimer's patients. They have incorporated corrections for artifacts and optimized statistical estimation procedures. The technology that they are developing is ofsignificance in that it expands the diagnostic usefulness of EEGbeyond current clinical EEG approaches, with an improvement in ability to detect minimal neuronal degeneration, such as that in Alzheimer's disease. The researchers are applying this refined analysis to 70 \"at risk\" subjects. The prediction is that their EEG technology will discriminate between subjects who do and do not later develop Alzheimer's disease. During the 10 year the objectives and-ains of this project will remain unchanged. Aim 1 is to refine computer based methods for extracting diagnostic information from the all night sleep EEG. Previous work developed an analysis technique that could be used to discriminate early Alzheimer's patients from major depressive disorder patients and controls at an 85% accuracy rate. Aim 2 is to test the computerized EEG analysis system in predicting an Alzheimer's outcome in a large \"at risk\" population not diagnosable Alzheimer's disease.384 5ROIMH42522-02, Robert Young, M.D.. Cornell, \"Geriatric Mania\", 1 94 ,223 This is a study of the clinical presentation, outcomes, andpredictors of outcomes in elderly patients with bipolardisorder, manic phase. In the last year the investigators have continued to examinebrain morphology in geriatric mania by computerized tomography (CT) The sample of manic patients previously studied wasexpanded. CT scans were compared in 23 hospitalized manic patients, and eleven control subjects without history ofpsychiatric disorder. Patients had greater frequency of globalcortical sulcal widening. They also had higher ratios of thirdventricle width to brain width. In an analysis of therelationship between age and manic psychopathology there were lownegative correlations between age and pretreatment scores on some items of the Mania Rating Scale. There were also low negatlvecorrelations between age and residual MRS scores,'and changes in scores, after two weeks of pharmacotherapy. In related studies, Dr. Young and others have found a statistically significant association between treatment with antidepressants in association with the index manic eipsode and age at first onset of mania. Also, patients who had had the DSM III diagnosis of organic affective syndrome, manic, were, when compared to a group with bipolar disorder, manic, noted to besignificantly older. The most prevalent factors most frequently implicated as etiologic were corticosteroid treatment, thyroiddisease, and sympathomimetic abuse. The goals for the current year are as originally proposed. Investigators will continue to evaluate magnetic resonance, imaging techniques in addition to computerized tomographic imaging. 5R37MH42248-03, George Vaillant, M.D., Dartmouth, \"Life Course, Mental Health, and Later Development\", 5135,445 This study of adult development proposes to follow the physical and mental health of roughly 600 men from-adolescence (1940) until late middle life, age 58-70 years (1990). The purpose isto follow two large cohorts of men prospectively untilretirement and until a significant amount of chronic illnesss occurs. In the past year two studies were completed-on the College sample. As in the Core-city sample,-the researchers found an-identical pattern of the-synergistic effects of alcohol abuse' and smoking abuse on premature mortality. The second study was ofthe effect of ancestral longevity among the College sample's parents and grandparents upon the subjects mental and physicalhealth. This is one of the few studies that has followed a sample of subjects long enough to-obtain accurate dates of death for their parents and grandparents and, at the same time, to havemultivariate prospectively gathered data on competing risk factors for the subjects themselves. Age at death of the'oldestrelative on the maternal and paternal side proved the most powerful means of correlating ancestral longevity with the men'shealth at age 60. In this current year of the grant, questionnaires will be sent toall members of the College study. This is the ninth wave ofbiennial follow-up questionnaires. Work will continue onanalyzing data and writing up the findings from a recent follow-up of women from the Terman Study.

In Phase 1, baseline levels of light exposure will be correlated with physical activity *nd with subjective assessments and objective measures of sleep disturbance. In Phase 2 researchers will evaluate-the short term effects of timed bright-light *xposure on the disturbed sleep patterns of these subjects. As such as 40% of the population over 65 years of age suffers problematic use of hypnotic medications, reduced quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality. The primary features of sleep disturbance in the elderly are fragmented noctural sleep, early morning awakenings and increased daTtime sleepiness. This appears to reflect changes in the circadian timing system. Studies have shown that timed exposure to bright light may be effective in shifting the phase of circadian thythas. as well as increasing the amplitudies of the rhythms. This research will be the first to record chronobiological variables in sleep disturbed elderly subjects in a natural setting, thus providing valuable etiologic data onthis group. lR29MH44176-01, Devangere Devanand, Treatment in- Al heinar's Disease\" 391,334 The efficacy and side effects of low dose (0.5 to 0.75 Kg. daily) -versus traditional dose (2 to 3 lg daily) oral- haloperidol treatment of psychosis and behavioral disturbance will addition to standardized rating scales and the tyacking of target symptoms -specific strategies will be used to overcome difficulties in following symptom profiles in demented outpatients.

Ph.D., New York University, \"AD Caregiver Wellbeing, Counseling, and Institutionalization', S232,868 The objectives of this continuing study remain the same for this coming year -to evaluate the effectiveness of-a multicomponent treatment approach whose primary goal is to optimize the condition of the caregiver, and whose secondary goal io to prevent or postpone institutionalization of the patient. Specific aims are to complete a case control study in which spouse caregivers of AD patients receive all aspects of the counseling program and a parallel control group of spouse caregivers who are followed but not treated, and to administer a caregiver assessment battery tothe treatment and control groups at baseline, after 4, 8, and 12 montho and every 6 months thereafter, and to evaluate the effectiveness of counseling for improving caregiver well-being, to determine the longitudinal outcome, and to assess the influence of treatment and caregiver attributes on ultimate institutionalization. The first follow-up evaluations from this study show that even when the patient has deteriorated from-baseline, the caregivers in treatment have improved overall scores on the mental health indicators. In contrast, control cargivers' scores have deteriorated. Caregivers in treatment have indicated better communication among family members and more cooperation. At the end of the first segment of treatment, each caregiver-in the treatment group was asked to complete an evaluation form, indicating his or her reactions to the effectiveness of individual and family counseling. Initial results suggest that the caregivers' subjective-response to the program has been extremely positive. The ultimate goal of the treatment is to prevent or postpone institutionalization. Results suggest that the treatment is effective in achieving that goal. Given the greater cost-effectiveness of home care compared to institutionalization, the widespread use of similar programs. would potentially have a major impact on the economic burden of AD on individual families.. During the 3rd year of the study the investigators will complete the entry of the total subject sample. An interim data analysis will be conducted to ascertain the short-term effectiveness of the treatment strategy. lR018H45131-01, Dilip Jests, M.D., UCSD, \"Risk 0264,764 Neuroleptic-induced dyskinesia (TD) is a Oerious problem for chronically Dentally ill older patiento.

Progress of the study and tentative conclusions are: Of the 30 double-blind patients, 18 were assigned to drug and 12to placebo. 6 of the 18 drug treated patients but only 1 of the12 placebo treated patients exhibited significant adverse effectsrequiring early termination. Among completers, there was ahighly significant difference between drug and placebo inpsychiatrist ratings of global improvement. 10 of the 12 drug- treated subjects exhibited some degree of improvement compared toonly 2 of 11 p-cebo treated patients. 7 of the 12 drug treatedpatients exhibited either \"much\" or \"very such\" improvementcompared to only 1 of 11 placebo patients. Therefore,nortriptiline remain* an effective treatment for DSMIII MajorDepression, even in the institutional aged. There is however, noeffect of drug on measures of self care activities of dailyliving. Thus, though drug can decrease depressive symptoms, itdoes not appear to reduce disability in this setting. The withinsubject effect was highly significant, confirming the decreasedimprovement among the more disabled patients. The withinsubject effects were not significant, confirming the finding thatimprovement of depression does not translate into reduceddisability in this setting.

It intends to train caregivers in skills to alleviate the patient's depression: This grant began its second year in August. Consistent with the original design, a1l patients met .DSM3R criteria for Primary Degenerative Dementia and met Research Diagnostic Criteria for either Major or Minor Depressive Disorder. Duration of cognitive deficits averaged 18 months. All caregivers were spouses, living with the patient. Their mean age was 61. Two new neasures were developed for use in this study: the Pleasant Events Schedule-AD and the Menory and Behavior Problem Checklist-Revised. Preliminary investigations with the MBPC-R indicate that the subscale of depression items differentiated between DSMIIIR diagnosed depressed and non-depressed AD patients, and that depressive behaviors were more distressing to caregivers than other problem behaviors. In another study investigating the relationship of patient depression to other problems, significant associations were found between MBPC-R depressive and disruptive behaviors with caregiver depression sad burden.

As the lifespan increases, the elderly can be sore prone to the development of serious illnesses, some of which (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) affect cognitive functions and consequently may impair the ability to make competent treatment decisions (i.e. give a competent informed consent). This project is the first large scale empirical study designed to examine proxy consent in psychiatric treatment and research. A workable model of proxy consent must be developed in order to make treatment decisions for incompetent elderly and conduct research on psychiatric conditions which result in a loss of functional competency. Two studies are proposed in this project: one in which proxy decision-making for elderly people is examined using hypothetical treatment and research projects, and a second in which elderly patients about to undergo actual psychiatric treatment or research and their family members are evaluated to determine when proxies are used and how they reach decisions. 5ROINM37196-08, Larry Thompson, Ph.D., VAMC-Palo Alto, \"Psychotherapy for Depression in the Elderly\", $81,049 This study is comparing the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and the two combined in the treatment of depression in elderly outpatients.

During this past year data have been collected from 280 subjects and entered into computer files in preparation for analysis. As originally stated, the hypotheses are: 1. Subjects who improve most from verbal elaboration of visual image association mnemonics will have high scores on measures of verbal intelligence and low scores on state anxiety measures. 2. Subjects who improve most from training in relaxation for performance anxiety prior to learning mnemonics will have low scores on measures of verbal intelligence and high scores on measures of state anxiety. 3. The NEO Personality Inventory will provide additional personality attributes not considered in Hypotheses 1-2 which reflect performance outcome. 4.

The two sources of data are telephone inverviews with nursing home employees and data collected directly from the nursing homes. Investigators are gaining understanding on the process whereby work stress influences morale. Two waves of interviews were completed during the past (02) year. Resident case mix is measured as functional disability (ADLS), behavioral problems (e.g., wandering, screaming) and cognitive impairment. Preliminary analyses suggest that the level of disability among residents is not necessarily stressful for caregivers. Each nursing home has been provided with an individualized analysis of stress and morale for their employees. During the 03 year, the third wave of interviews will be completed. A series of comprehensive analyses will be undertaken. Most analyses to date have been accomplished with traditional statistical methods. Future analyses will exploit more fully the longitudinal nature of the data. For example, structural equation modeling with multiple indicators (using LISREL) will allow exploration of the dynamics of the stress process over time. Planned analyses will further explore substantively meaningful relationships in the data. For example, a factor analysis of the wave 1 nursing stress items yielded six subscales: death and dying, work load, being unprepared to meet residents' emotional needs, conflict with the supervisor, coworker support, and uncertainty concerning residents' medical treatment. Future analyses will investigate the extent to which the effects of these asoects of stress have differential effects on morale. 1 ROI MH45780-01, Carl Cohen, M.D. , SUNY, \"Older Homeless Women\", $140,586 Little has been known about older homeless women and therefore it has been difficult to assess their needs or plan an appropriate array of health and supportive services for them.

Specific areas to be examined are: 1. demographics, mental and physical health, substance abuse, victimization, social reeds and supports. 2. subsets of the population such as the mentally ill and substance abusers 3. pathways to homelessness 4. social networks and their relevance to survival 5. psychological/phenomenological aspects of the homeless condition 6. environmental/social context of hoselessness marginal and community populations examined previously 2ROM1H41766-03, Claire Collins, Ph.D., Michigan State University, \"impact of Alzheimer's Disease on Family Caregivers\", $172,138 The purpose of this ongoing grant has been to develop and test the psychometric properties of instruments to measure the following aspects of the experience of family caragivers in Alzheimer's disease: caregiver involvement in providing care, reactions to caregiving burdens, financial consequences, effects on employment, physical and mental health and social functioning; and use of health services. Further, the researchers plan to examine caregivers' perceptions of the availability of, need for and barriers to use of com-unity services in order to understand the conditions under which community services arm needed and used. This study represents a cost-effective approach to obtaining longitudinal data that will provide highly relevant information to NIMH for use in establishing important features of interventions for family caregivers.392 5ROlMH42840-02, Igor Grant, M.D., UCSD, 'Alzheimer Caregiver Coping: Physical Health\", 8236,239 Thin study of Alzheimer caregivern and a comparison group of non- caregivers currently has 50 subjects in the study and 45 potential subjects. All have undergone .baseline psychosocial interview, blood draw for immune neuroendocrine and catecholamine assays, and neuropsychological assessment. Mean age of the caregiver is 70.6 and 72.3 for the controls. Data gathered for the psychological interview include coping activity, perceived stress, social support, past medical history, cognitive process, physical and psychologic health outcome, and biological mediators. Preliminary analyses show the caregivers to be highly streooed. They report being more satisfied with the emotional support received from their support network and are lens satisfied with their liveo and are more burdened than are controls. In terms of caregiver health, they are more depressed, their quality of well being index in identical to the controls, they report fewer symptoms, and to date the immunological system activity is not different from the controls -neuroendocrine assays will be conducted in batch when more of the cohort has been enrolled. From these data the researchers conclude that the caregivers are 1) stressed, 2) have different coping and social support patterns than the controls and; 3) are currently relatively healthy. 1ROMH43407-01, Dolores Gallagher, 'Ph.D., VAMC-Palo Alto, \"Mental Health Risk Factors in Caregiving: Assessment and Intervention\", 8139,621 This is a study of 150 female spouse caregivers, ages 55-80, whose husbands are victims of Alzheimer's disease. Following extensive psychological; medical; and laboratory evaluation at Time One (Baseline) caregivero will be randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: anger management class (AMC); depression managoment claso (DMC), or wait list control (WL), which is a treatment as usual condition. Each clans ceries will run for 10 weekss Then there will be a Time Two evaluation to measure the extent of pro/ post improvement in indices of psychological distress. In addition, those who were in the WL will now be offered the chance to enroll in either class. Evaluations will occur again after 6 montha and after 1 year. Major hypotheses of this study are: - 1. caregivers who participate in either the Anger Management Class or the Depression Management class will show greater improvement in psychological distress 2. Caregivers with high anger at Time 1 will ohow greater improvement in the anger outcome if they receive the AMC rather than the DMC 3. The mechanism of change from pre to post intervention will be increased self-efficacy perceptions over tine in thooo coregivers who participate in either class series. 5 P01 MH43371-02, M. Powell Lawton, Health:. AMultifaceted Approach\", $828,340 This grant will examine several large areas of concern regarding the process of caregiving by adult children to impaired people. Three separate projects will pursue-different qustions on caregiving stress. They will share a common data core. The common theme is the study of variations in the process of caregiving and the sental health outcomes of caregiving that ere associated with marital statut, intrafamilial dynamics, length of caregiving and characteristics of the person. During the first year of thin grant, staff were recruited and the interview schedule for use in the study was designed. Strategies were designed and implemented for accessing the sample. Data collection has proceeded on schedule. The second year will continue-the recruitment and data-gathering phase for The Family project, The Marital Status project, and The Caregiving Career project. 'Also preliminary analytic reports for each of the 3 projects will be prepared. Approximately 1121 interviews will have been completed by the end of the 02 year.393 5ROlhH39637-03, Gregory Hinrichsen, Ph.D., Hillside Hospital, \"Mental Health of Depressed Aged and Their Caregivers'. $70,498 The purpose of this research is to study the mental health of caregivers to aged persons with Major Depressive Disorders and to examine the impact that caregiveer coping behavior has on the older patient's depressive illness. There have been no changes in the goals of the study in the past year. Rsearch sfforts have been focused in four areas: 1. Tiae one subject recruitment and interviewing -120 depressed aged and their adult child or spouse caregivers have been enrolled. 2. Time two followup interviews -95 followup interviews with discharged oldet patients and/or their caregivers have been completed. 3. Time three followup interviews -60 on-year followup interviews have been completed. 4. Data preparation and analysis -Recent data analyses have found that characteristics of the caregiver are better predictors of caregiver coping behavior than demographic or illness characteristics of the patient. Of particular note is the fact that greater-caregiver use of virtually all coping and patient management strategies is related to caregiver impaired mental health and greater burden. This finding underscores the inherently frustrating nature of interacting with depressed persons. 5ROINK4209S-03, Jwice Kiecolt-Glazer, Ph.D., Ohio State University, \"Caregivers of AD Victims. Stress and Mental Health\", $256,991 This study is usinr a prospective design to better understand the longer-term mental and physical health.consequences of ce-egiving for AD victims. Psychological data, blood samples for immunological and nutritional Analyses are being obtained, as is health status information from AD family caregivers and similar comparisoft subjects. First year's dat- analysis indicats, that caregivers are significantly more distressed th&n comparison subjects. In addition, caregivera report significiatlY more infectious disease in tihe last 6 month-.thsn controls. The investigators find more reliable differences in qualitative or functional i unological assays, compared to quantitative or enumerative assays; this is of particular interest, because the aging immune system shows its greatest. deficits in functional or qualitative aspects of immunity. They have found differences in 'two blastogenesis assays between caregivers and controls. Spousal caregivers are the caregiver subgroup that show the highest ratea of psychiatric dysfunction .Approximately 30X of spousal caregivers met DSM-II criteria for an affective disorder during the caregiving period- compared to virtually none for the matched cosparisen subjects. Rates of offestive disorder are lower among offspring csregivers. Data are beginning to indicate that spousal caregivers who experience high levels of negative or upsetting support may be a particul-r at-risk group, consistent with the original experimental hypotheses. Analysis of the second year data will help assess the direction of causality, i.e., whether the effect is still significant and consistent when controlled for earlier levels of depression and dysphoria.394 5R01MH42163-02, Karl Pillemer, Ph.D., University of New Hampshire, \"Social Relations of Alzheimer's Caregivers across Time\", 8165,582 This study is investigating changes in the social networks and burden of prinary caregivern to elderly relatives with Alzheimer's dinease over a two year period following the initial diagnosis of denentia.

Data will be prepared from both waven for analysis. 5R01NH42122-02, Leonard The goals of this study are: to identify a range of stressors experienced by Alzheiser s caregivers, the coping strategies they adopt to deal with the stressorm, their accesn to and uses of formal and informal support and the consequences of this stress process for symptons of depression and physical illness. The study conceives of the strains encountered within the caregiver role proper as central among the strennors. Thene strains renulto from the anoistance the careaiver muet provide the impaired person in daily activities, froe the nanagement of behavior and froe the overloads on tine and energy. Investigators expect to find that the more intense the various strains and the nore extensively they are diffunod into different areas of life, the nore nental and physical health will suffer. During the first year the study wao expanded to include sample from the Lou Angeles area. Only about 350 eligible people were recruited and the additional 400 people to be studied will come from the Los Angeles area and the LA ADRDA will provide assistance, as will the Survey Research Center at UCLA. The development of the interview schedule and the beginning interviews were Performed. 5 P50 MH40159-06, Dan Blazer, Duke Univ., Clinical Research Center, $603,108 The primary goal of the Duke center has been to define and validate a limited number of depressive subtypes in late life, that are clinically relevant and primq for further study because of recent advances in neurosciences, nosology, and epidemiology, as well as biologic and psychologic approaches to therapy. Four subtypes of late life depression have been targeted for study: 1) major depressive episodes. 2) dYsthymia, 3) mixed anxiety and despressive disorders, and 4) dysphoria not asociated with the above three subtypes. Core activities provide standardized assessments for depressed elderly patients and appropriate controls as well as assistance with data collection, management, and analysis. A core longitudinal study provices information regarding the phenomenology of late life depression, as well as a framework for integration of findings and concepts on several projects -biological markers, electroconvulsive shock therapy, and cognitive behavior therapy.395 !RO1MH43267-02, Peter Vitaliano, Ph.D., University of Washington, \"Correlates of Mental Health in DAT Spouses\", $351,007 This is a longitudinal study of psychosocial, immunological, and cardiovascular distress in 70 spouses of mild DAT patients compared to the distress in 70 age-sex-and health status-matches spouses of controls. In the 01 year, the following results were found: in the two groups, AD patients and controls, there was a difference on HMS and Hamilton ratings. However, the groups are similar in global ratings of patient's/control's physical health. In terms of immune and cardiovascular variables the two groups of spouses (AD caregivers & controls) are similar. The two groups of spouses are most different in the psychosocial variables. Caregivers have a slight trend toward higher anxiety, depression and religiosity and a trend toward less probles-focused coping. Most AD spouses chose the health of their spouses as their major stresssor, whereas most control spouses chose problems with their children. In the second year initial levels of psychosocial, immune and cardiovascular distress in cases versus controls will be compared. Also to be cospared are the initial intercorrelations of immunocompetence, cardiovascular and psychosocial variables in the cases and controls. The studies conducted in Year 1 involve psychosocial assessment, iamunocompetence, and cardiovascular measures. The protocols planned for Year 2 are the same as those reviewed originally. 2P50 MR40381-04, Eric Caine, M.D., Univ. of Rochester, \"Clinical Research Center\", S930,699 This Clinical Research Center was approved in FY 1989 for continuation for three sore years, bringing the total number of years to six.

The goal is the development of objective indicators of diagnosis, of treatment response to antidepressant therapy, and of prognosis. This goal will be achieved by comparing baseline sleep measures among groups of mixed-symptom patients who are responders, partial responders, or non- responders to adequate antidepressant therapy. The experimental hypothesis of this study is that patients with reversible dementia of depression will show sleep and other psychobiologic measures similar to those of depressives without cognitive impsirment, while other mixed symptom patients with early Alzheimer's disease and symptoms of depression will show sleep and psychobiologic measures more similar to those of Alzheimer patients already studied to date. During the past year, Dr. Reynolds has continued to serve as Principal Investigator of two NIMH-funded RO1's: \"EEG Sleep, Aging, and Mental Illness\", and \"Maintenance Therapies in Late- Life Depression\". During the 09 year, Dr. Reynolds has had to learn more about several diverse areas, all related to his research: 1) the construction of questionnaires and the testing of their psychometric properties, 2) the application of multivariate statistical technques to large complex data sets, 3) the design and analysis of data from longitudinal controlled clinical trials, 4) the modification of intervention strategies for long term use in the elderly depressed, and 5) the vagaries of performance testing in the elderly. His professional development has been enhanced through his numerous collaborations with other colleagues and through visits to other laboratories.400 3 K05 MHD0364-07Sl, George Vaillant, Dartmouth, Research Scientist Development Award, $20,898 Dr. Vaillant has been p1eforming life course studies using two valuable longitudinal datasets, the College Cohort and Core City Cohort on men. His studies of mental health, and its relationship to physical health across the second half of life, have led to an important reformulation of the relationship between stress and illness. Both samples have been continuously followed for 45 years. Originally, an interdisciplinary study was made of each subject; parents were interviewed; development histories, school records and the health and psychopathology of relatives were ascertained Psychological and physiological tests were undertaken. Major questions being asked are: 1) How does preexisting mental health affect maintenance of physical health? 2) What familiar, childhood and premorbid psychological variables are associated with resilient and vigorous adaption to life after 65? 3) What is the natural history of marital and occupational careers over the adult life cycle? What is their relation to psychopathology? 4) Can defense mechanisms be made operational? 5 K07 MH00733-02, Pierre Tariot, M.D., Monroe Community Hospital.

Used for this training are the extensive research facilities and faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S), which, In conjunction with Its major research affiliate, the New York State Psychiatric Institute (PI), Is currently the largest recipient of ADAMHA research funds. Training sites include PI, Presbyterian Hospital, and a division of Creedmoor Psychiatric Center which Is directed by Columbia faculty. Trainees are selected from many applicants who are completing, or who have recently completed, psychiatric residency training, though the program Is also open to other physi- cians (e.g., neurologists) and psychologists. Many trainees have participated in research during their medical school or residency years, but have had no formal training In research. There are 3 major components to the training. First, a preceptorial component, in which the trainee Immediately begins participation in the ongoing research projects of the pre- ceptor's research group, thereby learning basic research skills (e.g., standardized assessment) and the research literature in a certain area. Simultaneously, the trainee develops, under guidance, an independent research protocol, often conducted on the same clinical research subjects. The second component Is the didactic component -- training In statistics, re- search design, and in modern research techniques (e.g., genetic linkage analysis, challenge studies). The final component Is a basic science component, in which the trainee learns about the principles and application of laboratory techniques from a collaborative researcher at PI or P&S (e.g., analytic psychopharmacology, brain Imaging, molecular or statistical genetics). Through a combination of federal (NIMH) and NYS funds, this established train- ing program currently supports 8 trainees for at least 2, and usually 3 years of research training. Given the prior success of the program In attracting and training psychiatric researchers, expansion of the program from 8 to 10 fellows is proposed.

Of particular Importance Is the functional relationship between synaptic struCture and the changes in synaptic effectiveners that accompany learning and memory. To address this problem we propose to examine the nature, extent and time course of the morphological events at identified synapses that ccompany elementary forms of learning and memory and explore the role such structural alteratIons may play in initiating and maintaining the changes in synaptic function that underlie these behavioral modifications. Toward this end we plan to use a model system, the gill- withdrawal reflex of th: marine molluac Aplysia californica in which several forms of learning anc memory have been studied to advantage on both the celluar and molecular level. We have recently exploited this system to examine the morphological basis of short- and long-term habituation and sensitization. Using horseradish peroxidase (HaPL) to label the presynaptic terminals of identifiec sensory neurons (a critical site of plasticity for both forms of learning) and complete serial reconstruction to analyze the total number and fine structure of synaptic contacts, we have loune that long-term memory is accompanied by structural alterations on two levels of synaptic organizatlons 1) changes in the number, size, and vesicle complement of focal regions of membrane specialization (active zones) of the synapse, and 2) a parallel but more dramatic and giobal trend involving modulation of the total number of synaptic varicosities. in contrast, the morphological correlates of short-term memory in Aplfsla are restricted to shifts in vesicle populations associated with sensory neuron active zones. These findings provide the lint direct evidence that behavioral modification produces structural changes at the level of identified synapses critically involved in learning and suggest a dear difference in the morphological events that accompany memories of differing durations- To explore these issues in more detail, we now plan to examine the time course and underlying biochemical events responsible for the morphological changes at sensory neuron synapses that accompany both short- and long-term memory. A temporal analysis should allow us to determine which classes of structural change are necessary for the acquisition and maintenance of memory and an analysis of mechanism will aid in establishing a more causal relationship between synaptic Architecture and the learning process. The approaches we have developed and the model system we plan to use provide the requires specificity to address these problems directly and shouid increase our understanding of how the functional architecture of the synapse is related to its plastic capabiities.

At that time, lay organizations alerted their members in order to promote brain donations. Over 500 hD brain donations hav bean made by families having this autosomal dominant disorder. Only in the last year have a substantial number of brain donations been made by the next of kin of persons dying with schizophrenia. This recent increase is largely due to the formation of a national organization called the Alliance for the Mentally Ill (AHI) which is committed to promoting basic research into rental illness. The BTRC has more recently been collecting brain tissue from other neuropsychiatric disorders. A neuropathological examination is carried out on one half of every brain in order to confirm a diagnosis or rule out any pathology in a normal coztrol brain. The remaining half is frozen and then dissected into as many as 60 regions which are then stored and later distributed to neuroscientist. requesting tissue. Brain tissues have been collected frum over 49 states and 6 countries and then dissected end distributed to 200 neuroscientists in 30 states and 5 countries. The BTRC also conducts research in order to improvs methods in the collection and dissection of brain tissue. over the BTRC's nine-year period, there hav been over 300 publications written by the BTRC staff and the investigators utilizing the brain tissue for their studies. These published findings cover 15 different neuropsychiatric disorders as well as much new basic data found in the 'normall human brain. These discoveries have opened a new frontier into the study of a number of human disorders of the brain.

In search for the mechanism of *tilation-induc g-t rm modifications in dendritic spines, we have assumed in analogy with non-neural towues that this change could be related to actin, its regulatory proteins end free cytopic Ca2+. Actin conformation nay be changed within fractions of a second after stimlation, and the duration of such a change may be determined by the onntery conditions of the intracellular environment. For technical reasons it would be difficult to study direct- ly the stinulation-reLated changes in the organization of the actin network. iherefore, we propose to study brain spectrin (fodrin). It is an actin-associated protein, which is intimately involved in the organization of actin filaments ari capable of reorgani- ration in response to timulation in non-neural cells. Given the lack of information on the organization of brain spectrin that is essential for understanding of the func- tion, we propose a series of immunoelectron microscope studies of brain spectrin in sdult rats, in the course of developnt, and during enhanced synaptic activity, like Mong-tarm potentiation (LTP) .Since LTP in the entorhinal-dentate system is currently the best physiological model of synaptic plasticity and an attractive candidate for the physiological mechanism of associative ory, it is essential to understand the mach- anism of LTP. 7his phenonn has all the characteristics that would be expected of an 'associative menry storage device and so has the locus of LTP origin. The second order sensory information converge to the entorhinal cortex and proceed to the dentate fascia where they nay be modulated by the animal's state of consciousness. Condition- ing stimuli increase the dentate granule cell activity without changing the activity of the entorhinal cortex. Senescent rats that suffer fro, a loss of dendritic spines in the dentate fascia were shown to be deficient in both LTP and spatial memory. Thus, dendritic spines may be implicated not only in the mechanism of LTP, but also in the mechanism of memory. Therefore, clarification of the molecular mechanism of morpho- metric changes in spines may provide a valuable tool in studies leading to the under- *standing of higher brain functions. FINAL APPLICANT'S ABSTRACT: The long-term objective of this research is to gain better under- standing of the neural foundation of perception and memory. It is designed to provide new data concerning the processes by which the brain of the primate encodes, retains, and utilizes spatial information in behavior. The rationale is based on suggestive evidence that the pos- terior parietal cortex, in man and monkey, is the cortical substrate for spatial representation, a kind of dynamic neural map of extrapersonal space. The work will be conducted on macaques (Macaca mulatta). Some of the animals will be trained to distinguish ob]ects by touch and to remember their shape for later recognition. The posterior parietal cortex will be cooled with implanted probes to test the effects of the reversible functional depression of that cortex on tactile (haptic) and crossmodal (haptic/visual) recognition performance. will be investigated in the posterior parietal cortex while the monkey is engaged in those forms of performance; the principal aim is to .deter mine the organization of cortical neurons representing stereognostic information. Other animals will be trained to distinguish and remember colored stimuvli indicating the position of reward in the immediate spac. and future. The functional interactions between parietal and prefronta cortex will be explored in these animals with a combination of cryogeni. and microelectrode recording methods. The effects of cooling one corti- cal region on the neuronal activity in the other region will be ar.alyied, as will be the effects of cortical cooling on behavioral per- formance: the aim is to clarify the role of the normal interactions between the- two cortices, presumably mediated by direct connections; in the spatial organization of behavior. Computer methods will be used for analyzing the effects of cryogenic depression as-well as the patterns of neuronal discharge in task performance.

Are the learned properties of a sound differentially represented at various levels of the auditory pathway? Which are the brain structures related to attentional and learning processes involved in associative learning? Twh experimental protocols hane been designed to address these questions using a conbination of classical and operant conditioning paradigm in conjunction with autoradiographic 2-DG techniques for the study of behavior in freely moving animals. The basic Idea is to quantitate the uptake of 2-OG in the brain of rats during a variety of different behavioral conditioning and control situations. The proposed experiments manipulate the specific components involved in auditory conditioning (CS, US, CR) in an effort to discriminate the neural representation in terno of 2-OG uptake, of these coaponents independently or combined In paired and unpaired trials. In the first protocol bw CSs will be ccrpered, using a differential paradigs with reinforced ((5v) and nonreinforced (CS-) presentations, in order to discriminate the tonotopic frcm the reinforcing effects of CSs in terms of 2-00 uptake. The 2-DG method provides a tool that alloe simultaneous visualization of tonotopic representation and functional activity in the auditory system. This method will be used also in a secod protocol comparing the effects of identical CS-US pairings on the brains of four groups of rats: performing animals trained to bar press for reward during a sound signal discriminative group), or bar pressing regardless of sound (nondiscriminative group), and rats yoked to the above groups and subjected to paired CS-US (classical group) and unpaired CS-US.(control group), respectively. It is expected that coparisons using complementary stimulus-response conditions will serve to elucidate the neuroanatomical structures related to the specific components involved in auditory conditioning. The most inportant outcome of the proposed research would be the identification and functional mepping of rat brain structures responsible for the associative learning and rory of auditory stimuli.

Previously we have found that the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflexes -two simple and related behaviors whose neural circuitry is well understood -- are capable of two associative forms of learning, classical and operant conditioning, as well as two nonassociate forms of learning, habituation and sensitization. We have also found that a mechanism of classical conditioning of the withdrawal reflex appears to be an elaboration of a mechanism of sensitization of that reflex on the cellular and molecular levels. We now plan, in the proposed research, to use this system to extend our analysis of associative learning in four new directions: 1) a further analysis of molecular mechanisms of classical conditioning in the isolated nervous system, 2) an analysis of cellular mechanisms of classical conditioning in a semi- intact preparation, 3) a cellular analysis of higher-order features of classical conditioning, and 4) an analysis of cellular mechanisms of operant conditioning and comparison with classical conditioning.

Our studies will be performed on the clonal cell line PC12 and on a 'C12 variant that is resistant to MPTP. MPTP kills wild type PC12 cells, which are dopaminergic, and it does so by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. The PC12 vari- ant is resistant to MPTP because of an alteration In energy metabolism. We will haracterize energy metabolism in the variant to understand its mechanism of MPTP esistance. These studies are important because brain dopaminergic neurons unaffected ,y MPTP may have a similar mechanism of resistance. We will also use the variant to identify, characterize. and determine the func- ion of heretofore unrecognized proteins involved in neuronal storage, release, and euptake of neurotransmitter. Presumably unrelated to its MPTP resistance, the varn- nt has dificiencies in several neurotransmitter-related activities, e.g., neurotrans- itter release and reuptake. Furthermore, the variant exhibits markedly decreased ex- ression of multiple genes, and it is likely that most of the genes that are expressed n wild type PC12 but poorly or not at all in the variant code for proteins involved n neurotransmitter metabolism, storage, release, and transport. We have identified everal of these genes by surveying some rat brain-specific cONA clones and by screen- ng a PC12 cDNA library. After sequencing these cDNA clones, we propose to synthesize he corresponding peptides, raise antibody against the peptides, and Identify and haracterize the natural protein products of these genes. Using the antisense RNA echnique (by which it is possible to reduce the expression in a cell of one gene at a ime) we will Isolate several PC12 strains each of which is normal except for having a educed level of the protein product of one of these genes. We will then determine ich cellular activity pertaining to neurotransmitter storage, transport, or release lost as a consequence of the low level of this protein. Three of the PC12 proteins ot found in the KPTP-resistant variant are calmodulin-binding proteins.

In the marine mollusc Aplysia, bothsensitization and classical conditioning involve increases in transmitterrelease, called heterosynaptic facilitation, from mechanoreceptor sensoryneurons of the pathways that mediate defensive withdrawal behaviors.A number of cellular phenomena accompany this facilitation, amongthem a reduction in potassium current, an increase in spike duration andnumber, and an alteration in the handling of calcium. Earlier workshowed that facilitation involves mobilization of a biochemical cascadethat results in a rise in intracellular protein kinase. The proposed project has a threefold aim:1. To re-examine the role of cAMP in facilitation. This questionis prompted by preliminary experiments that suggest that an increase incAMP alone may be insufficient to account for facilitation.2. To determine which of the cellular phenomena associated withfacilitation are causal and which are not, and to determine how much ofthe faciliation can be accounted for by each process.3. To examine the cellular phenomena associated with activity-dependent amplification of facilitation to determine whether, as has beenproposed, classical conditioning involves only enhancement of processesthat underlie sensitization, or whether new mechanisms are involved.These questions will be addressed by examining 1) the effects onfacilitation of treating sensory neurons with newly-available agents thatinfluence the cAMP cascade; 2) the time courses of. and the effects ofdifferent manipulations on, each of the facilitation-associated phenomena,compared to those of the facilitation itself; and 3) cellular correlatesof activity-dependent amplification of facilitation, This proposal socks funding from ADAriA within the RSDA program ac level II. The long-term, overall goal of this project is to understand the neural bases of mental processes. Though it is probably impossible to underestimate the difficulties chat might impede progress toward this goal, if we do not explicitly try to reach it, then progress will be at best random. I have been encouraged to work on this problem because of the complimantary conver- gence of three disciplines. First, is the increasing incidence over tho last 15 years of cognitive theories that use nouron-like elements as building blocks. Those theories attempt to model psychophysical-like experiments in human pattern recognition and con- cept formation. Of ten the neuron-lika building blocks involve hypothetical properties that are as yet unknown to neuroscientists. Second is work like my own that studies the role of well-defined neural activity in associatively based synaptic modification. These studies aro able to test microscopically tho reasonableness of the hyoothesized neural properties. Third ia tha existence of what are necessarily.precisely defined theories of statistical pattern recognition produced bv engineers. The mathematical groundwork their thoories provide seea eminently suited to orovide a risorous brides for evaluating cognitive thoories and the discoveries of synaptic modification. Because tho hypothesized rules of synaptic modification seem to distinguish among the various noural-lika cognitive theories and because so little is really known about synaptic modification issues. our studies concentrato en constructing well controlled. easily interpreted experimental situations which allow the comparison of various theories of synaptic modification in a context amonable to both aleccrophysiological and electron microscopic analysis. The research proposed here is a continuation of such studies that identify. as ouantitativelv as possible, the characteristics of synaotic modification. In addition. I would like to produce theories which better harmonies the cognitive and neural ex- perimental data. I eagerly anticipatO increased interactions with experimental cogni- tive scientists interested in neural-like theories.

Songbirds learn their songs by Imitating external models. The major brain nuclei involved in vocal behavior have been Identified. These nuclei are sexually dimorphic and develop under hormonal Influence. Lesion studies have shown that the motor pathway for song includes the telencephalic nuclei to RA and RA projects to the caudal portion of the hypoglossal nucleus (nXIlts), which in turn controls the muscles of the syrinx, the bird's vocal organ. Recent work has shown that nXllts and RA contain subregions involved in the control of individual syringeal muscles. In addition, a specialized subregion of RA projects to the dorsomedial nucleus (DM) of the intercollicular area. How is learned song represented in these brain structures? The present work uses physiological, anatomical, and behavioral methods to study the organization and operational principles of this system. Properties of both motor and sensory pathways involved In song learning and production will be studied, focussing on the function of input and output pathways to RA. The detailed organization of inputs from HVc will be studied as will the sources and nature of auditory input. The role of the projection to the midbrain nucleus DII in respiratory-vocal coordination will be examined. This organization will Initially be examined in adult male birds and then in developing birds receiving controlled hormonal manipulations and auditory exposure. In addition, the central control of this behavior, including possible laterailzation phenomena, will be studied using recordings from HVc, RA and syringeal muscles In awake, singing birds. The results of this investigation will help to elucidate the way in which perceptual and motor components of a learned skill are represented in the brain, Including their coexistence or segregation Into separate hemispheres. A better understanding of the principles involved in this form of memory may in turn reveal conditions that encourage or limit learning. FINAL ACTION: May 16-18,1988 26-386 to analyze the cellular mechanisos under-lying two important capabilities of the nervous system: (1) the ability to associate a given stimulus with a novel motor response (tWmulus-resopnse or S-Rlearning), and (2) long-term sensory modifiability. This objective requires thedevelopmnt of preparations, involving well-defined behavioral alterations andidentified neuronal networks, that permit direct analysis of physiological mechanisms. Building on preliminary studies using the siphon, tail, head- andparapodia of the marine gastropod, Anlia, intact and semi-intact preparations will be developed that show the acquisition of novel siphon responses afterpairing parapodial stimulation with head or tall stimulation. ElectrophysIolo- gical correlates of this S-R conditioning will be examined in identified siphon motor neurons and interneurons. Two hypotheses for the development of novel S-R connections will be tested using intracellular recording, voltage clm, andouantal analysis techniques. Long-term sensory memory will be investigated inthe central and peripheral processes of parapodial sensory neurons, which offer special advantages for sensory analysis. The general hypothesis that asso-ciative- information storage in sensory systems makes use of mechanisms evolvedfor sepry ?coiensatfon after- in-jory wi.r -activity-dependent extrinsic modu-lation (AODE) -to sensory modifiability will be tested. Several potential AOEI-4elated enhancements of signalling effectiveness produced by assocative condnti0ning and by iniurv of the receptive field will be examined: synapticfacilitation, increased central and/or peripheral excitability, and sprouting ofperipheral and/or central processes. These studies should provido basic infor- mation on general mechaniscms of learnino; sensory comnensaton, and neuronal reaeneraltin that may eventually contribute to an understanding of normal andabnormal physiological plasticity within the human nervous systea. * i986445 REVIEW INVESTIGATOR: ORGANIZATIONt CITY, STATE: PROJECT TITLEs RECOMMENDATIONtSUMMARY STATEMENT (Privileged Communication) APPLICATION NOt 2 ROt MH33443-10 BPN GROUP' LOUISIANA STATE UNIV NED CTR NEW ORLEANS RFAt NEW ORLEANS LOUISIANA REQ.

The purpose of this program is to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows for \"pur\" and \"applieda research in expert- mental psychology, with special consideration not only to *xperimsntal tech- niques and theoretical developments, but also to areas of significant applica- tions of these techniques to educational, industrial, biomedical, or legal problama. Predoctoral trainees will be graduate students in psychology, the major sub-disciplines of experimental psychology to be emphaaized are perception, learning and memory. psycholinguisticsa emotion, and mathematical psychology. Students are trained to use nmw developments in computer simulation of psycho- logical problems. In addition, each student is urged to take up an \"appliad\" research specialty, such as educational program evaluation, human-computer interactions, evaluation of intellectual abilities, deficits in language develop- ment, evaluation of psychological effects of psychoactive drugs, or research problems in lv (e.g., jury selection, jury dectsion-making; eye witness identification; leading questions in memory distortions), About a quarter of our Ph.D.s do research on such applied problems. Our training program generally requires four years beyond the Bachelor's degree and follows the doctoral degree program of the Psychology Department. Students, in consultation with the faculty, plan a program of courses best suited co their special interests and professional aspirations. From the outset of the program, they spand one- half tims in research under faculty supervision, and they are encouraged to obtain research experience in several different areas of experimental psychology. In addition to course work within the Psychology Department, trainees are required to deepen their knowledge of some related area by electing courses in other departments; with our currant practical emphasis, the electives increas- ingly are in such areas as education, human-factors research, speech-and-hearing sciences, psychopharmacology, and neuropathology. 5 III 6003 3 18,2408 4 5 1le 640 3 3182 4 5 111,6403 188, 4 4 5 APPLIu rs brain. both by articulating Qlicit todoll dosp a tt v fbicfli ot brain training resoarch scholars to invnstigati issues and tbo~r i- cations to to eontal health. students oach student from :to :oacning assistants for cours as in -IlS dopartoont. am tiles as instructors, for RES CDs SR-5 DUAL PR6 CL CDs INVESTIGATOR' MULLIS, RANDOLPH DEGREEi PHD DEPARTMENTs HOME MGNT AND FAMILY LIVING ORGANIZATIONo UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON RFA' CITY.

Our primary concern is with the paredox which has emerged in quality of life research: that some individuals or femilies with, high (low) Incomes report low (high) levels of psychological well'being. We focus on accountingfor the discrepancy, in part, by constructing more rigorous measures of economic well- being than merely 'current income.' and using these measures as better predictors of psychological well-being over the life cycle. The Wisconsin Basic Needs Study will be used to construct measures of economic and psyceologrcal well seins. *n.- .conomic measures will be developed based on concepts arising from three economic hypotheses: (1) The Life Cycle Income Hypothesis; (2) The Relative Income Hypothesis; (3) The Resource Deficit Hypothesis. Use of these hypotheses contribute an added degree of rigor to measures of economic well- being which, it is believed, will result In a partial explanation of the observed discrepancy. The psychological well-being measure is based on the Terrible/Delight scale of Andre And Withey (1976). Due to the empirical evidence supporting the Importance of life cycle transitions on psychological well-being, this construct will be operationalized and provide a framework within which the relationships of Interest will be explored. Multivariate regression models will be developed to estimate the relationship between psychological well-being and each of the three independent variables while controlling for other exogenous variables, particularly life cycle stage, gender of householder, and other demographic variables (e.g. occupation. duties, education, etc.).

With the application of local methods developed in this Laboratory, rates of two proceases can be determined indiscrete regions of the brain in normal conscious animals: (A)glucose utilization and (B) protein synthesis. A. Glucose Utilization. In aged rats, rates of glucose utilization are decreased -in the components of the primary auditory and visual pathways. In addition, glucose utilization in the striatum is particularly and significantly decreased. In order toexamine the functional consequences of these senescent changes inthe nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, we are studying the effectsof aging on the metabolic responsiveness to the donamineraicagonist, apomorphine. These studies are in progress. B. Protein Synthesis. Rates of protein synthesis are alsodecreased in aged rats in components of the primary auditory andvisual pathways. The changes may be the consequences of a chroniclack of sensory input due to age-related degenerative changes inboth retina and inner ear. Aluminum toxicity has been proposed as an etiological factor inAlzheimer's Disease and aluminum has been shown to affect numerous biochemical processes including several enzymes in the metabolic pathway for glucose. Experiments are in progress on the effectsof prolonged (2 years) intake of low levels of aluminum in drinkingwater on local cerebral glucose utilization in aged rats. A -on wq456 COVERED.

By appropriate utili-I zation of existing coursework and research options, along with the careful coordination of graded placement experiences, both postdoctoral trainees and predoctoral students in the APA-approved counseling psychology program at the University of Maryland will be able to develop both the generic skills needed for health service providers in psy- chology as well as the specializations needed for the assessment, intervention and re- search with aged persons with major mental disorders. The program can serve as a national model of how professional psychology training programs can provide a special- ization in geropsychology without diminishing generic skills d- inordinately lengthening training programs. The program builds upon (1) the breadth of University of Maryland faculty resources in the psychology department concerning both research and inter- ventions with the impaired elderly, (2) the well-established minority student re- cruitment and retention program in the psychology department, and (3) the more recent establishment of four types of training and research placements in metropolitan facilities for aged persons, with approximately half of all such residents being ethnic minorities. Placements in this wide range of treatment settings for aged persons -from in-patient medical hospitals, to mobile treatment teams, to assisted living facilities will provide a firm foundation for both assessment and remediation, primarily within a secondary prevention framework, for aged persons as they first encounter major mental disorders. The program will, provide (1) a specialized course in the psychological aspects of identification and treatment of Alzheimer's Disease and (2) three workshops focused on the cultural influences affecting assessment and intervention with Black, Hispanic, and Asian-American elderly persons with mental disorders; both of these aspects will be open to current mental health professionals and graduate students in counseling and clinical psychology.467 GRANS PROJECT SUMMAR Case Western- 1 MaY Louise Wvkce Grant Ho./Pref./Buf.

This training combines didactic content offered at the School of Social Work with clinical training within the Geriatric Health Services of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The Geriatric Health Services (aHS) includes four components (Geriatric Psychiatry Inpatient Program at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC), Senedun Geriatric Center, Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. and Late Life Depression Program) each using a multidisciplinary team approach to provide clinical services to the elderly. While GHS serves as the primary training site. Master's students will also spend a half- day at the Adult Day Center at Vintage, Inc. This involvement offers students the opportunity to learn in a coordinated fashion within the context of an integrated continuum of care. At the Master's level, the training program is designed to prepare in each of the three years, four second-year stipend-students as members of multidisciplinary teams for clinical practice with the elderly. The training model includes a didactic component built upon the School's Health/Mental Health concentration and Certificate of Gerontology program. The didactic content emphasizes geropsychiatric practice skills such as diagnostic criteria, assessment, and treatment alternatives with emphasis on the concerns and needs of minority and economically disadvantaged populations. This content is integrated into the students' clinical field training in which they develop assessment, treatment, and case-management skills while working with the elderly population. The doctoral component of the training program is designed to prepare two second year students for advanced practice, supervision and administration, policy, and evaluation research in the area of mental illness and the elderly. The didactic plan for doctoral students builds on and enriches the existing doctoral curriculum and emphasizes practice, administration and policy concerns of mental illness.. These students complement the didactic component with an advanced practicum. emphasizing clinical understanding of the range of modalities and treatment locations, while increasing their supervision, administration and policy competencies.470 GRANT PROJECT SU1MMRY Oregon Health Sciences I TO1 MH19228-01 University Beverly M.

Four trainees will complete the curriculum in psycho- geriatric social work during each year of the program. The goal will be achieved through accomplishment of the following objectives: a refinement of the School of Social Work's psycho-geriatric case management program models for implementation throughout the curriculum and in selected field placements; development of specialized formal field placement agreements with community agencies; the recruitment of second year graduate social work students; the initiation and implementation of an integrative field seminar and group research project; the development of two new courses within the existing competency based gerontology concentration (case management practice and loss and grief issues); identification of the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed by trainees pertaining to psycho-geriatrics; and conducting in-service and community education for professionals and paraprofessionals working with the elderly. This training proposal will help to develop the models of case management practice based on the needs of psycho-geriatric patients. The training is designed to develop and refine the professional case management skills of graduate social work students who are committed to working in the area of psycho-geriatric services. Social workers who are trained at the graduate level in case management practice will be able to bring to their work knowledge and skills in the areas of administration-management, clinical and human relations. Aggressive case management practice with psycho- geriatric patients will reduce the risk of dependence and increase self-determination. The case management models start with the assessment of the elderly patient's needs forming the basis for the development of plans that are responsive to the patient's psycho-social environment.472 GRANT PROJECT SUMMARY University of 1 TOl MH19305-01 Clfornia Gary W.

The goals are to train graduates to: (a) achieve clinical excellence in assessing and treating mental dysfunction in the elderly; (b) organize and lead geriatric teams serving hospital and community needs; (c) contribute to the scientific literature in geriatric mental health by designing and carrying out original research. Trainees have the opportunity to develop their clinical skills in specially targeted units which emphasize interdisciplinary team training at both the institutional and the community level. Emphasis Is placed on integration of psychological and psychiatric knowledge with medical, neurological, and sociocultural knowledge. Trainees will participate with faculty in ongoing research in geriatric mental.health and will complete an independent research investigation by the end of the two-year program. Trainees entering the program lill be licensed physicians with a minimum of 4 years of prior postgraduate training (internship plus 3 years of psychiatric residency) and clinical 'psychologists who-have completed graduate training and internship in -programs approved by the American Psychological Association. A total of 4 physicians and 4 psychologists uill be trained during the entire project period. Criteria employed in the selection of candidates include demonstrated interest in the field of aging and mental health, as well as interest in and qualifications to pursue an academic career in geriatric psychiatry/psychology. Training facilities include several UCLA clinical sites, especially the Neuropsychiatric Institute and Hospital, the Center for the Health Sciences, and the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center, Brentwood Division, as well as several community mental health programs.473 GRANT PROJCT 8UNKARY 1 TO1 MH19255-O1 Indiana University Huch HendrieGrant Institution Project Director 1 of years 80.000.00Year of Support FY89 Proiect Title: NIMH Institutional Clinical Training Proiect DescriDtion: The purpose of this training grant is to provide support forinterdisciplinary training in psychogeriatrics to psychiatric residents andfellows, and masters and doctoral students in psychiatric nursing. This model is appropriate for the care of the elderly population who present withmultiple, complex, interlocking medical, neurological, as well as psychiatricillnesses, and their institutional and family caregivers. Sixteen percent of the state's population is 60 years of age or older (and growing); 15 -25%suffer from significant symptoms of mental illness and 61 from dementing disorders. Yet, persons over 60 in the state receive only 2 -4% of all mentalhealth services. A major barrier to providing services for the aged is theavailability of professionals prepared to provide geropsychiatric services in avariety of settings. The proposed program builds upon and expands previouselective training opportunities, by formally establishing the interdisciplinarytraining model in psychogeriatrics between the Departments of Psychiatry andPsychiatric Nursing at Indiana University, utilizing the resources of each, anduniversity and community resources, in a collaborative training effort. TheAlzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders outpatient clinic is already anavailable site for elective training in the psychiatric residency program andthe psychiatric nursing program. Additional resources are now available in the Schools of Nursing and Medicine, the university and in affiliated institutions/ programs in the community, to support the proposed program. Broad project goals include: (1) develop and implement the interdisciplinary training modelin psychogeriatrics at Indiana University, (2) increase the availability ofpsychiatric nurses and psychiatrists who are prepared to specialize inpsychogeriatrics, and (3) develop linkages between the training program andprofessionals from other disciplines to provide multi-discipline perspectives on issues related to mental health care of the aged.

DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT FEBRUARY 1, 1990. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The Department of Housing and Urban Development is pleased to respond to the request of the Senate Special Committee on Aging for the annual report on the Department's programs and policies affecting America's elder- ly.The measure of a compassionate society is how well it treats those who are most vulnerable. One of my concerns as Secretary of HUD is to provide a variety of ways to assist the elderly in obtaining appropriate, affordable housing and access to sup- port services as needed. In developing and administering our programs and policies, it is important that we are able to provide assistance with that sense of dignity which is so important to every American. Very sincerely yours, JACK KEMP. Enclosure. U.S. HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY-FISCAL YEAR 1989 The Department of Housing and Urban Development is committed to providing America's elderly with decent affordable housing appropriate to their needs. Our goal is to provide a variety of approaches so that older Americans may be able to maintain their independence, remain as part of the community, have access to sup- portive services, and live their lives with dignity and grace. President Bush and Secretary Kemp announced a forward looking plan for hous- ing, HOPE-Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere-in Novem- ber 1989. Among the major components are several which will assist the elderly. One is a demonstration project to provide service-supported housing for the frail el- derly by coupling housing vouchers with assistance to help pay the costs of the serv- ices they need. Others focus on the preservation of low income housing which will benefit elderly currently residing in HUD assisted housing and on a broader sup- portive services component for the homeless. The Department is currently evaluating its programs serving the elderly. The problems encountered in some of our programs, notably the FHA insurance pro- gram for Retirement Service Centers, have proven to be expensive to the Govern- ment and the intended residents. However, they have given HUD the opportunity to study how to provide both housing and supportive services for the elderly. We want to. learn from these problems and to try new and innovative approaches that are economical and supportive of the type of community atmosphere that is helpful to the elderly. In order that HUD efforts in the area of housing, especially in the provision of supportive services with HUD's elderly housing, receive top level attention, the Sec- retary is appointing a special assistant in the Office of Housing to provide oversight, policy guidance, and coordination with other Federal agencies in the area of sup- portive services for the elderly. In keeping with the Secretary's priority for expanding affordable housing opportu- nities for low-income families, we are improving the delivery of our Section 202 pro- gram so that current and future Section 202 elderly/handicapped units move to pro- duction in a timely manner. Substantial efforts have begun to move the Section 202 pipeline to construction starts. I. HOUSING A. sEcMIoN 202-DIRECT LOANS FOR HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY OR HANDICAPPED The Section 202 Direct Loan Program is the Department's primary program for providing housing for the elderly. It provides direct Federal loans to private, non- profit corporations to finance the construction or substantial rehabilitation of resi- dential projects and related facilities to serve the elderly or handicapped. The Section 202 program was enacted by the Housing Act of 1959. Originally, the program was intended to serve persons whose incomes were above public housing eligibility levels, but still insufficient to obtain adequate housing on the private market. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 amended Section 202 to permit the use of Section 8 housing assistance payments for eligible lower- income persons who live in projects financed under the program. These payments make up the difference between the rent established for the unit and the tenant contribution, i.e., 30 percent of adjusted gross income.477 Section 162 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 further amended Section 202 to ensure that the program met the special housing and relat- ed needs of nonelderly handicapped families and individuals. Beginning in fiscal year 1989, projects for the handicapped will be assisted by project assistance pay- ments. Rents will not be determined on the basis of Fair Market Rents, but will be determined by the reasonable and necessary costs of operating a project for the handicapped. Rental assistance for Section 202 projects for the elderly was not changed. During fiscal year 1989, the Department committed $327.1 million to finance 6,710 rental housing units for the low-income elderly and $112.8 million for 2,463 rental units for low-income persons with handicaps. Loans under the program cover up to 100 percent of total development costs and may be repaid over a 40-year period at below market interest rates. During fiscal year 1989, the interest rate was 9\u00bc4 percent. For fiscal year 1990, the annual inter- est rate is 8% percent. From reactivation of the Section 202 program in fiscal year 1974 through fiscal year 1989, approximately $9.9 billion has been reserved, representing 4,672 projects and 219,613 units. Due to the Department's outreach efforts, minority sponsors were awarded over 28.7 percent of the total funding in fiscal year 1989. The Department has experienced problems in achieving construction starts on al- ready approved Section 202 projects. We are currently working to \"unclog\" the Sec- tion 202 construction pipeline. The Secretary has taken a number of steps including permitting pipeline projects to use the most currently effective Fair Market Rents (FMR); reviewing the new construction FMR system to see if there are ways to sim- plify the process and establish reasonable rent limits; initiating a review of the cost containment policies with particular attention to efficiency units, common spaces and elevators. These actions should go a long way to easing the pipeline problems and produce much needed units. B. SECTION 231-MORTGAGE INSURANCE FOR HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY Section 231 of the National Housing Act authorized HUD to insure lenders against losses on mortgages used for construction or rehabilitation of rental accom- modations for persons aged 62 years or older, married or single. Section 231 is designed solely for unsubsidized rental housing for the elderly. Non- profit as well as profit-motivated sponsors are eligible under the program. Section 231 also permits the construction of congregate housing projects. At the end of fiscal year 1989, 501 projects, providing 66,611 units for elderly families, have been in- sured under the program. Total insurance written was $1.4 billion. c. SECTIONS 221 (D) (3) AND (4)-MORTGAGE INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR MULTIFAMILY HOUSING Sections 221(d) (3) and (4) authorized the Department to provide insurance to fi- nance the construction or rehabilitation of rental or cooperative structures. Special projects for the elderly can be provided under these programs, and may include fea- tures such as congregate facilities. While these programs are not solely for the el- derly, they are available to nonprofit and profit-motivated mortgagors as alterna- tives to the Section 231 program, which has largely been replaced by these sections for construction of housing for the elderly. Mortgages under Section 221(dX4) may be processed and coinsured by approved coinsuring lenders. Under Section 221(d)(4), mortgage insurance was available for Retirement Service Centers which are market rate residential rental projects for the elderly with serv- ices such as meals served in a central dining facility, housekeeping, and laundry. Cumulatively, 128 projects with 18,782 units, are completed or under construction, for a total of almost $1.1 billion. The program was suspended in light of a dramatic incidence of financial difficulty with projects of this type. A large percentage of Retirement Service Centers (a pre- liminary estimate is in excess of 35 percent) have defaulted or are experiencing fi- nancial difficulty. Losses of this magnitude are unacceptable in a program not de- signed to serve lower income people. The suspension will continue until the program has been analyzed and revised to ensure a financially sound program that maxi- mizes benefits to lower income households. The Office of Policy Development and Research is currently studying the Retire- ment Service Centers program and is expected to release its report in late spring 1990.478 From the beginning of the 221(d) (3) and (4) programs through fiscal year 1989, 11,139 projects containing 1,212,302 units were insured, for a total of $30.5 billion. Residents in 483,579 of the units were receiving Section 8 rental assistance. D. SECTION 223 (F) -MORTGAGE INSURANCE FOR THE ACQUISITION OR REFINANCING OF EXISTING MULTIFAMILY HOUSING PROJECTS This program offers mortgage insurance for existing facilities, including coopera- tive and rental housing for the elderly, where repair needs do not warrant substan- tial rehabilitation. The program can be used either in connection with the purchase of a project or for refinancing only. Mortgages under this program can be processed and coinsured by approved coin- suring lenders. E. SECTION 232-MORTGAGE INSURANCE FOR NURSING HOMES, INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES, AND BOARD AND CARE HOMES The primary objective of the Section 232 program is to assist and promote the con- struction and rehabilitation of nursing home and intermediate care facilities. The vast majority of the residents of such facilities are elderly. Since the beginning of the program in 1959 through September 1989, the Department has insured 1,656 fa- cilities, providing 198,315 beds, for a total of $3.4 billion. * The Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act (HURRA) of 1983 established a Board and Care Home program for the elderly and others as part of Section 232. The program permits units with shared bedroom and bath facilities and central kitchens. These facilities provide continuous protective oversight of the residents. There is no medical component and no Federal requirement for a certificate of need. Board and Care Homes must meet State and local licensing and occupancy require- ments. Under the Board and Care Home program, 42 projects with 4,000 units, are completed or under construction, for a total of $145.3 million. An additional 39 projects are in processing. F. SECTION 242-MORTGAGE INSURANCE FOR HOSPITALS Under Section 242 of the National Housing Act, the Department insures mort- gages to finance the construction or rehabilitation of nonprofit, proprietary, and public hospitals, including major moveable equipment. From the inception of the program through fiscal year 1989, the Department has insured 251 hospitals, providing 68,943 beds for a total of $6.2 billion. In fiscal year 1989, 2 hospitals, with 343 beds, were insured for a total of $32.5 million. G. SECTION 8-RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND HOUSING VOUCHERS Section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 authorizes housing assistance payments to aid lower income families in renting decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Section 8 provides rental assistance for families in a variety of housing types, including new construction, substantial and moderate rehabilitation, and existing housing. Under the programs, assisted families generally pay 30 percent of adjusted income toward rent and HUD pays the difference between that and the rent for an adequate hous- ing unit. As of September 30, 1989, approximately 46 percent were occupied by el- derly and handicapped persons. The Section 8 Existing Housing Certificate program has proved particularly help- ful to elderly families, because many of them are eligible to receive assistance while remaining \"in place\" within a dwelling unit which meets HUD's housing quality standards. As of September 1989, more than 900,000 units were approved for the Certificate program. Housing Vouchers, which also enable families to receive assistance without moving, are believed to be even more beneficial to elderly persons because of the additional flexibility offered by the absence of rent ceilings. Cumulatively through fiscal year 1989, 228,558 vouchers were reserved. Authorization is provided also for shared housing arrangements under Section 8 programs. On June 11, 1986, HUD published a final rule implementing this option for the Existing Housing Certificate program. One shared housing arrangement of particular interest to elderly families permits homeowners to rent space in their homes to tenants who receive rental assistance. Such arrangements may facilitate reduced housing costs, companionship, and security for the elderly. Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing is another option which some localities may find especially beneficial for certain segments of the elderly population. SRO's are eligible for assistance under the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program, Ex-479 isting Housing Certificate, and the Housing Voucher programs under certain condi- tions. H. CONGREGATE HOUSING SERVICES PROGRAM The Congregate Housing Services Program was designed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of providing supportive services for the elderly and handicapped underHUD auspices to prevent or delay unnecessary institutionalization. Under this pro-gram, HUD extends multiyear grants (3 to 5 years) to eligible public housing agen-cies and nonprofit Section 202 sponsors for meals and other support services for frailelderly and nonelderly handicapped residents. As of September 30, 1989, $30.8 mil- lion has been obligated to grantees.Sixty grantees are in operation, serving approximately 2,000 residents on a regu-lar basis. About 280 residents were served last year on a short-term, temporarybasis, usually after incapacitation or hospitalization. Congress appropriated $5.4 mil-lion for fiscal year 1989. These funds are being used to extend the 60 grants for atleast an additional 12 months from current expiration dates. The renewals are proc-essed consistent with each grantee's current expiration date. I. MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS At the request of the Administration, the HURRA of 1983 amended Section 207 ofthe National Housing Act to permit mortgage insurance for manufactured homeparks exclusively for the elderly. The program has been operational since theMarch 1984 publication of a final rule implementing the legislation. II. PUBLIC AND INDIAN HOUSING Approximately 537,000 public housing dwellings (44 percent of the total programinventory nationally) are occupied by the elderly. Many of the dwellings are inbuildings designated for exclusive occupancy by the elderly and handicapped.The Public Housing Program is the Nation s oldest and largest housing programfor lower income people, established under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. It is anessentially local program, based on a partnership between the local community andthe Federal Government. Each community, through its Public Housing Agency(PHA) in cooperation with the local governing body, takes primary responsibility forproviding housing to lower income people, with financial assistance from the Feder-al Government. Projects are developed, maintained, and operated by approximately3,300 PHAs (including about 300 Indian housing authorities) in communitiesthroughout the country, ranging from the largest cities and suburbs to small townsand rural areas. Public housing, which is owned by the PHA (or in a relatively fewinstances leased), is distinct from the Section 8 housing assistance payment pro- grams also administered by many PHAs.In the Public Housing Program, the Federal Government-through the localPHA-pays for development costs and provides operating subsidies to ensure that low rents and adequate services are available. In addition, modernization funds areprovided to PHAs to enable them to rehabilitate older projects. As a condition forthis assistance, the PHA agrees to use and maintain the property as decent, safe,and sanitary housing for eligible lower income people, consistent with the require-ments of Federal law and regulations. Rents, including utilities, have been set by Congress at 30 percent of adjusted tenant income. In calculating adjusted income, some special deductions are made in the case of the elderly.In many public housing projects, special facilities and services are provided tomeet the needs of the elderly, such as safety and security features, meals and trans-portation services, and recreational programs. These special services are usuallyprovided by other agencies that rely on funding from Federal, State, and private sources, with the PHA supplying the facilities and acting as the local coordinator.In general, these projects have been very successful in meeting the needs of their elderly and handicapped residents. Standards of design and maintenance have beenhigh, along with resident satisfaction. PHAs report that elderly residents are excel-lent tenants and citizens, who take pride in their homes and play important roles in management and service programs.Development of new public housing is no longer the principal vehicle for produc-ing additional dwellings for the lower income elderly under Federal housing pro- grams. Other programs-such as the Section 202 program and Section 8 certificatesand vouchers-now account for the bulk of the units added in recent years. Withregard to public housing, amendments enacted by the Congress in 1983 and 1984require that the Department give priority in approving new applications to projects for families requiring three or more bedrooms. The primary emphasis with regard480 to public housing for the elderly has become preservation, maintenance, and reha- bilitation of the existing housing stock. III. CoMMUNI PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT A. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement program is HUD's major source of funds to large cities and urban counties for a wide range of community development activities. These activities benefit low- and moderate- income households, eliminate slums and blight, or meet other urgent community de- velopment needs. The CDBG program made available to States and communities ap- proximately $2.8 billion in Fiscal Year 1988. Approximately $2 billion went to 736 metropolitan cities and 121 urban counties by entitlement, with individual amounts determined by formula. States distributed the balance to small cities with popula- tions under 50,000. Entitlement communities' elderly residents benefit directly and indirectly from many CDBG-funded projects. The CDBG program is decentralized, and local commu- nities are not required to report program beneficiaries by age. For this reason, it is extremely difficult to determine the exact amount of CDBG funds that directly ad- dress the needs of the elderly. However, available data indicates that Entitlement communities budgeted more than $23.8 million in fiscal year 1988 to assist senior centers. Metropolitan cities planned to use $13.5 million for this purpose, and urban counties, $10.3 million. Another major source of elderly benefits from CDBG funding is housing rehabilitation. This accounted for approximately 36.1 percent of all Enti- tlement funding. A large portion of the $976.1 million budgeted for these activities by Entitlement communities in fiscal year 1988 benefited the elderly. CDBG funds are used by many communities to make home improvement loans and provide weatherization services for elderly homeowners and renters. Significant amounts of CDBG Entitlement spending for neighborhood improve- ments, public services, and other public works directly and indirectly benefit the el- derly. CDBG Entitlement grantees allocated about $61.5 million for improvements to and operation of neighborhood facilities, $16.4 million for the removal of architec- tural barriers, $6.9 million for centers for the disabled, and $68.6 million for other public facilities. These activities also provided significant benefits to the elderly. The following examples illustrate how the CDBG Entitlement program is used to provide a wide range of benefits and services to the elderly: Anne Arundel County, MD, used $620,000 to design, acquire, and construct a senior citizen center and install handicap access modifications for residential units at the Brunwood Eldely Housing Complex. Chicago, IL, provided $2.2 million for information, referral, and supportive services that assist the elderly and disabled in independent living. This program coordinates the provision of health, social services, homemaking, transportation, medical, and recreational services that prevent unnecessary institutionalization. Dade County, FL, used $148,000 for the development and management of sub- sidized rental housing for the elderly and handicapped by a neighborhood based nonprofit organization; $24,000 for security improvements in elderly residences; and $5,000 for transportation of elderly residents to a senior center. Los Angeles County, CA, provided $393,033 for elderly projects: $173,462 for information referral services targeted to the elderly; $113,185 for the expansion and construction of senior centers; $79,716 for off-site infrastructure and park- ing lot improvements at senior citizen housing projects; and $31,670 for a senior citizen house sharing program. Phoenix, AZ, provided $42,000 for escort services provided to the frail elderly and $6,400 for improving senior citizen housing complexes security through the installation of new telephone activated entry systems. Pico Rivera, CA, provided $100,000 to partially fund the construction of a senior citizen center. Ponce, PR, used $70,000 to improve facilities'at the Los Diamentes Senior Citizens Center and expand community services for the elderly. Portland, OR, used $68,490 for home repair and maintenance, shared housing, self-help weatherization, and home security programs for senior citizens. Seattle, WA, provided $833,995 for elderly projects: $347,885 for senior centers and services including home repairs and homesharing, $332,512 to provide meals for the elderly; and $153,598 for information referral and client assist- ance services for low-income senior citizens.481 B. CDBG STATE AND SMALL CITIES PROGRAM The State Community Development Block Grant and HUD-Administered Small Cities programm are HUD's principal vehicles for assisting communities with popula- tions under 50,000 that are not central cities. States and small cities use the CDBG funds to undertake a broad range of activities and structure their programs to give priority to eligible activities that they wish to emphasize. As in the CDBG Entitlement program, States are not required to report to HUD the ages of individuals who benefit from their recipients' activities. Although State Performance Evaluation Reports contain a wide variety of data, the level of benefits to the elderly cannot be determined with certainty. As of the June 30, 1988, Per- formance Evaluation Report filing date, 48 States distributed $203.5 million of their $808.5 million fiscal year 1988 allocation. States allocated a substantial portion of CDBG funds-37 percent-to activities that benefit elderly persons. Of that amount the largest share, approximately $58.6 million or 29 percent, went to housing-related activities such as the rehabilitation of private properties. An additional $15.5 mil- lion or 8 percent of the State CDBG funds went to public facilities and public serv- ice projects such as support for senior centers, neighborhood facilities, centers for the disabled, and removal of architectural barriers. The following examples illustrate the types of elderly projects that were funded by States in fiscal year 1988: California provided the community of Atascadero with $579,000 for the acqui- sition of property for a 95-unit senior housing project, and $6,250 to Watsonville for housing counseling services. Connecticut provided the communities of Hebron, Morris, and Naugautuck with $1.1 million for the construction and improvement of senior centers and $275,000 for the rehabilitation of homes for senior citizens. C. URBAN DEVELOPMENT ACTION GRANT (UDAG) PROGRAM HUD awarded Urban Development Action Grants to cities and counties to en- hance local economic development activities and create permanent jobs, especially for low- and moderate-income persons. Minimum standards of economic distress had to be met by these communities. The UDAG program's national competition gave consideration to community distress factors, private funds leveraged, number of jobs created, and local tax increases. Since its beginning, the UDAG program has benefited the elderly, directly or indi- rectly, by providing funds to assist communities in the development of health care services, adult day care centers, downtown and suburban shopping centers, and other public and private facilities. Since 1978, HUD has awarded 103 UDAGs to 34 States and Puerto Rico for projects that directly assist the elderly. The following examples illustrate how the UDAG-assisted projects benefit the el- derly: Buffalo, NY, used $600,000 to assist the renovation and conversion of a 166- bed nursing home facility into a 170-bed, skilled nursing care and health-related facility. Pine Ridge Reservation, SD, used $604,000 to assist the construction of a 60- bed nursing home facility located on a tribally owned 10 acre site. Richmond, CA, was provided with $1 million to help construct a mixed use commercial and housing development which includes the rehabilitation of the vacant, historic Hotel Don into 36 units of low-income rental housing for sen- iors. D. RENTAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM The Rental Rehabilitation program was authorized by Section 17 of the Housing Act of 1937, as amended by the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983, and privides grants to States, cities with populations of 50,000 or more, urban counties, and approved consortia of units of general local government. In fiscal year 1989, Congress made $150 million available for Rental Rehabilitation program grants. These grants finance the rehabilitation of privately owned rental housing in order to help ensure that an adequate supply of standard housing is affordable to lower income tenants. In addition, rental assistance is provided to very low-income and displaced persons to help them afford the increased rent of rehabilitated units or to move to other housing. This assistance is made available through Section 8 Existing Housing Vouchers and Certificates administered locally by Public Housing Agen- cies. Although the Rental Rehabilitation program is relatively new, the number of completed units has increased dramatically in the past 2 years. As of June 30, 1989,482 commitments had been issued for 30, 659 projects containing 147,796 units, and all rehabilitation construction work had been completed in 22,330 projects containing 91,186 units. Elderly tenants account for approximately 12 percent of the occupiedunits in.these buildings. E. SECTION 312 REHABILITATION PROGRAM Through the Section 312 Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program, HUD makes loans for the rehabilitation of single family and multifamily, residential, mixed use, and nonresidential properties. These funds are derived from loan repayments, the recovery of prior year commitments, and unobligated balances from prior years. To be eligible for assistance, properties must be located inurban areas designated as eli- gible for the Community Development Block Grant program or the proposed reha- bilitation must be necessary or appropriate for the execution of an approved Urban Homesteading program. Communities must also give priority for loans to low- and moderate-income owner occupants whose incomes are at or below 80 percent of themedian income for that metropolitan area. In fiscal year 1988, 2,140 Section 312 loans totaling $101.9 million were made in 281 communities. The majority of these funds ($51 million) were used to make 1,968 single-family loans. One hundred seventy loans, totaling $49 million, were made for the rehabilitation of multifamily, nonresidential, or mixed-use buildings. Although comprehensive data on the ages of borrowers are not currently collected, availableinformation suggests that about 22 percent of Section 312 single-family loan recipi-ents were 60 years of age or older. F. EMERGENCY SHELTER GRANTS PROGRAM The Emergency Shelter Grants Program provides grants to, States, cities, andurban counties to improve the quantity and quality of emergency shelters for the homeless through the renovation, rehabilitation, or conversion of buildings for use as emergency shelters; the provision of essential services such as medical care or counseling, including the development and implementation of homeless prevention activities, and payment of operating costs such as rent, insurance, and utilities. In fiscal year 1988, States, cities, and urban counties received $8 million in Emer- gency Shelter grants. Approximately $4.6 million was allocated to 309 Entitlement communities, with individual amounts determined by formula. States distributed approximately $3.4 million to cities and counties within their jurisdictions. As in the CDBG Entitlement Program, States and communities are not required to report to HUD the ages of individuals who benefit from their recipients activities. Consequently, the level of benefits to the elderly cannot be determined with certain- ty. However, according to a HUD survey of shelter managers conducted in Septem- ber 1988, approximately 2 percent of the homeless persons occupying shelters on a typical night are 65 years of age or over. IV. POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH A. AMERICAN HOUSING SURVEY The 1985 National American Housing Survey, released December 1988, and subse- quent biennial national surveys, contain special tabulations on the housing situa- tions of elderly households in the United States. The tabulations are in the same format as those produced in previous years for Blacks and Hispanics, for households in the four census regions, and for central cities, suburbs, and non metropolitan areas. An elderly household is defined as one where the householder, who may live alone or be the head of a larger household, is aged 65 years or more. The tabula- tions include information on housing and neighborhood characteristics of the previ- ous housing of recent movers, both owners and renters. Special information is pro- vided on households in physically inadequate housing or with excessive cost bur- dens, and on households in poverty. Separate data are provided for elderly Black and Hispanic households. B. HOME EQUITY CONVERSION MORTGAGE INSURANCE DEMONSTRATION Under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance Demonstration, the De-partment of Housing and Urban Development will insure 2,500 reverse mortgages on the homes of elderly homeowners, enabling them to convert their home equity to cash. Payments received by borrowers from lenders do not have to be paid back until the the borrower moves or dies and the property is sold. HUD will insure lend- ers against losses that could occur if the proceeds from the sale of the property are not sufficient to pay off the mortgage balance.483 The demonstration was authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. Reservations were allocated among the 10 HUD Regions in proportion to each Region's share of the Nation's elderly homeowners. In January 1989, HUD Regional Offices of Housing accepted applications from lenders for 50 reservations apiece, and in February 1989, they held random drawings to select a total of 50 lenders. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on June 9, 1989, and the program became effective on July 24, 1989. Lenders are currently issuing mort- gages under the program. C. REPORT ON SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR THE FRAIL ELDERLY The report, Providing Supportive Services to the Frail Elderly in Federally Assist- ed Housing, prepared by the Urban Institute was submitted to Congress. The report addresses four areas regarding housing and supportive services for the frail elderly. The report first estimates the number of elderly persons in federally assisted hous- ing who are at \"significant risk of institutionalization,\" measured in terms of need- ing assistance with daily living activities. The report estimates that roughly 105,000 residents of assisted housing over the age of 65 are at risk. This represents about 7 percent of the over-65 population in need of assistance with at least one activity of daily living. This number is larger than the number who will actually required in- stitutionalization within the next years or two, but it is less than the one-third of those elderly assisted housing residents who have some degree of frailty. Second, the report identifies and assesses a number of alternative approaches for providing sup- portive services. The report reviews existing Federal, State, and private sector pro- grams and examines several new concepts in service delivery systems. A key finding is that many States have established effective programs for providing services to their frail populations. Third, the report examines potential State and Federal fund- ing streams for financing these delivery systems. Finally, the report provides recom- mendations for possible demonstration programs. D. HUD-HHS SERVICE INTEGRATION PROJECT This project involved coordinating and integrating the delivery of housing and other services for the frail elderly at two demonstration sites in Florida. The project ended in February 1989, with the final report delivered in May. Products from the project include: (1) Senior Connection, a widely advertised, toll-free number provid- ing a central point of access to information and referral services for the elderly; (2) the Housing Connection, an automated housing resource directory consisting of a software package and user manual that allows a locality to enter local housing in- formation into existing formats (clients, who phone in, are then screened and sent printouts profiling suitable facilities in the area that meet their needs); and (3) an information and Client Tracking System which consists of a network of micro com- puters using telecommunications to link a variety of service agencies through a common client profile allowing user agencies to screen clients for different pro- grams including assisted housing. This enhances local ability for case management. The State of Florida has used the HUD-HHS Service Integration Project as a cat- alyst to expand the results of the project statewide using existing State and Admin- istration on Aging Funds. The three project staff positions in the Florida Depart- ment of Health and Rehabilitative Services have been made permanent in a unit called Better Living for Seniors Program. The goal of this program is to implement and expand results of the Service Integration Project statewide. Senior Connection has been expanded into a statewide system called Better Living for Seniors Central Access Phone Sites with a toll-free phone line in each of Florida's 67 counties. More than half of these counties have requested their free copies of the Housing Connec- tion automated housing resource directory. The 5-year plan of the State project in- cludes expanding the automated housing resource directory to include other re- sources for seniors (June 1990), and eventually expanding the information and Client Tracking System to provide a statewide model for case management. E. ADAPTABLE HOUSING MANUAL The 1987 publication Adaptable Housing was reprinted and continues to be widely disseminated. The publication promotes the design and construction of housing in which the basis structure and elements are accessible, in terms of entry and circula- tion, allowing other features to be added or altered easily to meet the special needs of a resident. While the concept of adaptability emphasized the needs of persons with disabilities, it has equal application for eldery persons. Elderly persons would benefit from such features as the ability to lower overhead kitchen cabinets or the ability to adjust the height of a kitchen counter to work while sitting. The most im-484 portant benefit of adaptive housing to elderly persons is that such features. wouldenable persons to remain in their homes as they age. Adaptable features, whichwould be in standard configurations. today, could be adapted easily to meet thefuture needs of a person as their abilities change due to aging, illness, or injury. F. PROGRAM FOR THE CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL HOMELsMs The Program for the Chronically Mentally Ill Homeless is an initiative of theRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, HUD, and HHS to support communitywideprojects aimed at coordinating and expanding services for the chronically mentallyill. These projects are providing a broad range of health, mental health, social serv-ices, and housing options to help the chronically mentally ill function more effec-tively in their everyday lives and avoid inappropriate institutionalization..Under the program, the foundation is providing approximately $28 million ingrants and low-interest loans to 9 of the Nation's 60 largest urban centers with pop-ulations larger than 250,000. As part of its program, HUD has provided 1,125 Sec-tion 8 Existing Housing certificates worth $77 million to local housing authorities for use by mentally ill clients in housing designed for them. The National Instituteof Mental Health is co-sponsoring an evaluation of the program with the founda-tion. The Social Security Administration is working with grantees to improve theefficiency.and effectiveness of the disability determination process. Nine cities are participating in the program: Austin, Baltimore, Charlotte, Cincin-nati, Columbus, Denver, Honolulu, Philadelphia,. and Toledo. All nine have devel-oped housing plans incorporating shelter for their homeless populations affected bychronic mental illness. More than half of the Section 8 certificates are now beingused for independent living situations, with the remainder already targeted as partof each city's housing plan. More than 35,000 people with chronic mental illness arenow receiving services funded under the program. Examples of projects are listed below: Austin, TX: A mobile outreach team has connected more than 100 homelesspeople who lived under bridges or in alleys with a wide range of services. An-other 160 people are using a client-operated drop-in center and social club.Baltimore, MD: A new central mental health authority, Baltimore MentalHealth Systems, Inc., is now providing administrative and fiscal oversight to acomplex system of community mental health agencies. Charlotte, NC: When the project was initiated, only 750 people with chronicmental illness were being served by the mental health system. The number hasnow doubled. In a very short period, this initiative has encouraged Governors, mayors, State. legis-lators, health providers, housing experts, and the public to work together to build abetter system to care for the seriously mentally ill, which has the potential of pre-venting many persons from becoming or continuing to be homeless. V. FAIR HOusInG AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY On September 18, 1988, the President signed the Fair Housing Amendments Actof 1988. This Act extends the protections of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 to familieswith children and the handicapped and provides enforcement powers so the FederalGovernment can assist those discriminated against by helping them secure damagesand other appropriate remedies. Congress demonstrates its concern for the elderly in the Act by defining a catego-ry of \"housing for older persons\" which is exempt from the requirement of nondis-crimination against families with children. Such housing is defined as (1) housingfor the elderly provided under any State or Federal program designed and operatedfor this purpose, (2) housing intended and operated for occupancy by persons 62 orolder, and (3) housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55or older per unit. \"Over 55\" housing must have significant facilities and servicesdesignated to meet the physical or social needs of older persons or show that provi-sion of such facilities and services is impracticable and that such housing is neces-sary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons. The Fair HousingAmendments Act was effective March 12, 1989. The Department continues to process complaints of age discrimination in HUDprograms under the Age Discrimination Act. During 1989 HUD received seven com-plaints alleging age discrimination. Three of the seven have been forwarded to theFederal Mediation and Conciliation Service for mediation. Two were returned tocomplainants due to lack of jurisdiction. Two are now being processed by HUD.485 ITEM 8. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR DEcEMBER 6, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Secretary Lujan thanks you for your letter of October 11, 1989, concerning the annual report of Developments in Aging, 1989. He has asked me to submit the report for the Department of the Interior and to express his appre- ciation to the Committee for printing the Department's full report in the Senate Special Committee on Aging publication in 1988. We are pleased that the report was widely distributed, including Congress, governmental agencies, professionals, aca- demics, journalists, and interested individuals. Interior's bureaus and offices have submitted their reports on the Developments in Aging, 1989, and their reports are presented in Attachments A-N. Following are summary highlights from their reports: The Office of Personnal (Attachment A) reports that the Department employed 291 persons 70 years of age and older which represented a 1.7 percent decrease from the 1988 report, and 19 of the employees were 80 years and older who worked varied schedules from full-time to part-time and intermittent. The Office of the Secretary Personnel (Attachment B) submitted that they are committed to serving the needs of the elderly by providing accessibility to employment opportunities and by provid- ing training and other services to those older employees who wish to remain active in the work force, 56 percent of the employees are over age 40, 91 employees are over age 60, 5 employees are over age 70, older employees are represented in a wide variety of occupations, outreach efforts with no restrictions according to age, the en- couragement of managers and supervisors to insure fairness in the treatment of all employees regardless of age, the recognitioin of aging employees by awards and ceremonies, and the providing of equal accessibility to Interior buildings for older persons. The Office of Equal Opportunity (Attachment C) published a final rule on the Discrimination Act of 1975 that sets Interior's policies and procedure in nondis- crimination on the basis of age in federal financial assistance programs, a Secretari- al publication on Equal Opportunity for all that covers policies and commitment on age discrimination in employment practices, a quarterly publication for members and supervisors on age discrimination laws and related policies, the processing of complaints on age discrimination that showed a 60 percent decrease in complaints from last year, the conduct of civil rights compliance reviews of federally assisted programs and activities, 250 cases of technical assistance and training, a public noti- fication program for non-English speaking people, and the establishment of systems and programs to insure nondiscrimination on aging. Also, the Office of Historical and Black Community University programs and Job Corps (Attachment D) stated that they continue to explore and encourage projects in aging in their dealings with the historically black college and university commu- nity. The Bureau of Reclamation (Attachment E) reports several areas of emphasis in activities and programs for aging individuals, including agreements with other agencies and organizations to promote work opportunities with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Green Thumb, providing opportunities for senior citizens to serve as volunteers, employment opportunities for retirees and older persons in technical and administrative professions, emphasis on facility and program accessibility for individuals who are disabled and/or aging throughout the bureau's vast waterway and dam projects, pre-retirement seminars for employees who are within five years of retirement, many outdoor recreation opportunities for retired and senior citizens, support of the Reclamation Employees Association that includes retirees, and award and recognition ceremonies for senior employees that included 42 service awards in 1989. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (Attachment F) provides social services and fi- nancial payments to eligible elderly Indians and their families who reside on or near reservations, including counseling and support services, adult protective serv- ice for the safety and health of the elderly, adult custodial care in the home or an institution, and financial assistance to elderly Indians with restricted Individual Indian Monies Accounts. The Bureau of Mines (Attachment G), as a scientific orga- nization, submits that it values the technical expertise and experience from senior individuals through temporary hiring authorities to employ reemployed annuitants as members of the Secretary's Advisory Committee or college/university faculty, the employment of 203 employees over age 60 in the bureau compared to 178 last year, the conduct of retirement counseling and seminars for employees, the presentation of service awards to senior employees, and internal and external employment poli- cies that support the interests and needs of the aging. The Minerals Management Service (Attachment H) reports that they had 1,161 older employees that represented 55 percent of their total work force with 16 em- ployees over age 65 and eight over age 70, older employees are in a variety of occu-486 pations such as computer specialists and physical scientists, older workers are ad- dressed through the employee development program, retirement planning work- shops attended by 103 employees, management and supervisory training in equal employee opportunity at a cost of $44,376, and assistance to older Americans through the decrease in foreign oil dependency. The Geological Survey (Attachment I) submits that their employment policy stresses equality of opportunity so that older employees can be used with extensive experience in scientific and mapping programs, 39 persons are employed who are over age 70 and 5,072 employees are between age 40 and 70, 139 people over age 55 are reemployed annuitants, a volun- teer program that uses the talents of older persons in scientific and other areas, data by the National Center indicated that 27 percent of the Fairfax County popula- tion will be over age 55 by the year 2010, the conduct of a survey of all facilities nationally to determine physical barriers for disabled and senior individuals, service awards that included 37 people for 50 years of service and 67 people for 32-40 years of service, and pre-retirement planning programs and counseling services for older employees. Also, the Office of Surface Mining (Attachment J) reports that it relies heavily on the 20 percent of their employees over age 50 which represents an increase by 2.2 percent over last year, the issuance of a policy statement that stresses nondiscrim- ination of older individuals, the use of pamphlets and video tapes on age discrimina- tion, upward mobility training for supervisory personnel, and bureau programs that protect the lives and 'property of older Americans across the country. The Office of Territorial and International Affairs (Attachment K) states that they place no re- strictions on the employment of elderly people and does not let age enter into con- sideration for job training and placement, and provides assistance upon request on programs for the elderly in the territories that are self-governed. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Attachment L) reports that 52 percent of their 7,535 employees are over age 40, representing an increase over past years, 22 percent of the workforce has been employeed in the Service for more than 20 years, approximately 7,500 hours of volunteer service from over 1,500 senior .citizens in fish and wildlife activi- ties, including the cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill and inventoring bird populations, the use of senior volunteers in visitor centers at refuges and fish hatcheries and the celebration for the commemoration of the Kiluasa Lighthouse, programs and activi- ties for senior citizens at the refuges and hatcheries, the assessment of all programs and activities for accessibility to disabled and senior individuals, educational courses for seniors that include field trips and film viewing, and the use of Golden Age Pass- ports by senior citizens that provides them with wildlife and fishery benefits.

ATTAcHMENT \"B\" Memorandum to: Special Projects Coordinator Assistant Secretary Policy, Budget and Administration. From: Personnel Officer Office of the Secretary. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1988. This is in response to your memorandum of October 16, 1989, regarding the sub- ject program in fiscal year 1989. Although the Office of the Secretary does not ad- minister any programs intended exclusively to benefit the aging, our personnel pro- gram is committed to serving the needs of the elderly by providing access for elderly citizens to employment opportunities and by providing training and other services to those older employees who wish to remain active in the work place. We currently employ older persons in a wide variety of occupations; 56 percent of our work force is over the age of 40, a slight decrease from 59 percent in FY 1988. The number of employees over age 60 has increased from 5.8 percent to 6.3 percent of the total work force. Ninety one employees are over age 60, which is an increase488 of 8 since FY 1988. Five employees are over the age of 70, a decrease of one since FY 1988. Older employees are represented in a wide variety of occupations, particularly ad- ministrative and legal and provide a depth of experience that will be difficult to re- place if these employees leave the work force. Continual training of these employees will be necessary to retain them and their valuable skills We are very much aware of the demographic changes taking place in the work force; the over 40 population in the Department and the country as a whole is grow- ing rapidly. In order to meet our demands for skills we must creatively utilize the resources of the older population. The Office of the Secretary provides equal oppor- tunity to all applicants and employees regardless of age and our outreach efforts include all segments of society and make no restrictions according to age. Managers and supervisors are encouraged to ensure fairness in the treatment of all employees regardless of age and to recognize the contributions of employees who have served the Department for many years by presenting length of service awards at local cere- monies and by supporting the hiring and training of older persons whenever possi- ble. Our Division of General Services continues to provide equal access to Interior buildings for older persons when entering to inquire about Interior programs or op- portunities for employment with the Office of the Secretary. J. LYNN SMITH. ATrACHMENT \"C\" To: Dr. Andy Adams, Special Projects Administrator Policy, Budget and Administra- tion. From: Director, Office for Equal Opportunity. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1989. During fiscal year 1989, the Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO) published a final rule effectuating the requirements of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amend- ed, (P.L. 94-135), [54 FR 3596, January 25, 1989]. This new rule will be codified at 43 CFR 17, Subpart C. The rule sets forth Interior's policies and procedures with re- spect to ensuring nondiscrimination on the basis of age in Federal financial assist- ance programs. Although the regulation is intended to prevent unreasonable dis- crimination against the elderly, the nondiscrimination requirements of this rule apply to persons of all ages with certain exceptions. In cooperation with OEO, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior issued a publication entitled, Equal Opportunity For All: A Message from Secretary Manuel Lujan, Jr. The publication unequivocally states the Secretary's policies and commit- ment in proscribing age discrimination in Federal employment practices, at Interi- or, and in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance. OEO also has created a newsletter entitled, Equal Opportunity Highlights. This new depart- mentwide, quarterly publication serves as an important medium for proclaiming to Interior's managers and other supervisory personnel information on Federal age dis- crimination laws and related policies. During FY 1989, in Interior's federally assisted programs, OEO received and proc- essed a total of 5 complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of age, in compari- son to 13 received in FY 1988. The FY 1989 complaints pertained to State and local recipient employment practices, and, federally assisted State fishing and hunting recreational programs. Generally, the program related complaints concerned higher fees that elderly, fixed income, nonresidents had to pay as a condition to be licensed to hunt or fish in various jurisdictions throughout the United States. The Depart- ment of the Interior also conducted a total of 6,872 post award civil rights compli- ance reviews of its most user-oriented federally assisted programs and activities. During the course of these compliance reviews, recipient service delivery practices among other concerns were reviewed, at State and local levels, to determine wheth- er they were being provided equitably to all persons regardless of age. These reviews were conducted in light of the requirements of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987. To this effect, the reviews were not limited in scope to just that part of the program that received Federal Aid, instead all aspects of the recipient's operations were assessed for civl rights compliance purposes. Technical assistance and training were conducted in over 250 instances for Feder- al, State, and local program personnel regarding the Department's various age dis- crimination policies. In such instances, State and local recipient officials were ac- quainted with the requirements of the Age Discrimination Act and assisted in com- plying with the same. OEO continues to manage a national public notification pro- gram for apprizing the public of Interior's age discrimination policies and the proce-489 dures for filing complaints. In FY 1990, OEO plans to broadened this public notifica- tion program to research program beneficiaries who are unable to speak or under- stand the English language. Relative to Interior's Federal work force, allegations of age discrimination re- mains one of the foremost grounds under which equal employment complaints are filed with the Department. In an effort to reverse this disturbing trend, OEO has active systems and programs in place for ensuring compliance with the require- ments of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. This law provides for nondiscrimination on account of age in Federal employment. In advancing the re- quirements of this law, OEO promulgated a comprehensive training module to all bureaus and offices of the Department for the purpose of enhancing their Equal Em- ployment Opportunity Counseling Programs. The module described Departmental policies and procedural standards for training Equal Employment Opportunity Counselors in how to informally resolve age discrimination complaints. Moreover, technical assistance and direct personnel-support have been provided by OEO to In- terior's various bureaus and offices in the areas of complaints processing, investiga- tions, informal resolutions, and equal employment sensitivity training programs. But most important, OEO has effectuated approaches for streamlining the process- ing of complaints and reducing complaint backlogs which, for Interior, translate into less time and expense in resolving are related complaints. In an effort to eliminate architectural barriers and ensure program accessibility for handicapped and elderly persons in Interior's federally conducted programs, over 14,281 self-evaluations were accomplished of bureau and office operations. In 1,069 instances, transition plans were developed and implemented to promote nondiscrim- ination and barrier-free access in these programs. Again, thanks for permitting this Office the opportunity to report on its programs and activities for ensuring nondiscrimination on the basis of age. CARMEN R. MAYmi.

ATrACHMENT \"E\" To: Assistant Secretary-Policy, Budget and Administration Attention: Dr. Andy Adams (4340-MIB) (343-5521). From: Chief, Personnel Management Division, WBR, Denver Office, Denver, CO. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging-1989 (Your Memorandum Dated Octo- ber 16, 1989) (Aging Developments). Enclosed is the above-referenced report from the Bureau of Reclamation in re- sponse to your request. The Bureau of Reclamation supports activities and programs which benefit aging individuals. There are several areas of emphasis, which are described as follows: A. Agreements With Other Agencies.-Results related to agreements with other agencies and/or organizations are described as follows: 1. In Reclamation's Upper Colorado Region, the Weber Basin Job Corps Civilian Convservation Center, Ogden, UT, has an established Human Resource Agreement with the USDA, Forest Service, consistent with Title V of the Older American Com- munity Service Employment Act of 1973. The purpose of this agreement is to foster and promote useful part-time work opportunities in community service activities for unemployed low-income persons who are 55 years of age or older. Two individuals are presently employed at the Weber Basin Center under this agreement; one indi- vidual is employed as a maintenance worker and the other in a clerical position. One of the individuals employed under this agreement was a new appointee in 1989. 2. An established Host Agency Agreement between Green Thumb, Inc., and the Collbran Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center, Collbran, CO, is utilized to employ490 older Americans at the center. Green Thumb, Inc., administers a Senior Community Service Employment Program by virtue of a grant with the U.S. Department of Labor. Three individuals are currently employed at the Collbran Job Corps Center under this agreement; two of these individuals are employed as clerical workers and the third person is employed as a maintenance worker. B. Reclamation has just received approval to accept volunteer services. It is antici- pated that many volunteer activities will benefit senior citizens either by giving them the opportunity to serve as volunteers or as recipients of enhanced services. C. Employment.-In employment, Reclamation stresses equality for all applicants and employees. Vacancy announcements are open to all qualified individuals, re- gardless of age. Reclamation employs older persons in a broad spectrum of occupa- tions and uses re-employed annuitants when appropriate. Reclamation, as an engi- neering organization, employs the advanced level of skills and expertise which older employees can impart to other workers. Reclamation also uses retired individuals as members of boards and commissions and in- a variety of technical, scientific, or ad- ministrative professions. D. Handicapped Access.-Reclamation has increased efforts to make our projects and facilities more accessible to handicapped individuals. Since a sizable percentage of the aging population experiences some degree of disability, these modifications make Reclamation facilities more usable and enjoyable for the elderly as well. For example, as a part of the remodeling effort of the Lower Colorado Regional Office, Reclamation is continuing to make buildings more accessible for handicapped individuals which often affect senior citizens. One of the buildings in Boulder City is currently being renovated to add handicapped ramps and restrooms. It is planned to add an elevator and remodel the restrooms in the Administration Building during 1990 which will provide improved handicapped access. Another example is the Pacific Northwest Region, which has identified and com- pleted extensive projects to make recreation facilities accessible to the aged and all impairment groups in 1989. Facilities have been completely modified at Sugarloaf Camp in Cascade, Henry Haag Reservoir, and Ririe Reservoir in the state of Idaho; at Immigrant and Howard Prairie in the state of Oregon; and at leased facilities in the state of Washington. In the Upper Colorado Region, special emphasis was placed this year in making the visitor centers at Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) dams and reservoirs accessible. Specific activities included modification of restrooms, revamping displays, revising literature, and modifying tour routes. E. Pre-Retirement Seminars.-Reclamation routinely offers pre-retirement semi- nars for employees within 5 years of retirement. The seminars are for both employ- ees and their spouses and cover retirement life style as well as financial consider- ations such as health and life insurance, retirement benefits, and financial plan- ning. F. Recreation.-Recreation opportunities are available at many Reclamation facili- ties for water-oriented activities such as fishing, swimming, boating, and camping. These leisure activities traditionally attract the retired and senior citizen popula- tion. G. Reclamation Employees Associations.-Reclamation has active Reclamation Employees Associations (REA). These associations mail regular correspondence to retirees and encourage them to stay current with Reclamation activities by partici- pating in various civic and recreational REA functions and events. H. Awards and Recognition.-During fiscal year 1989, the following employee spe- cial awards were presented: 24 Superior Service Awards, 15 Meritorious Awards, and 3 Distinguished Service Awards. Many of these awards were received by senior employees in their fifties or older. These awards were presented in special ceremo- nies, where recognition was also given to senior employees for both length of service and outstanding performance. Also, Reclamation recognized senior citizens for thier contributions to Reclamation programs through the citizen's award program. During fiscal year 1989, 10 citizen's awards were presented, a majority to senior citi- zens. ArrAcHMENT \"F\" Memorandum to Dr. Andy Adams, Special Projects Administrator, PBA. From: Acting Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1989. This responds to your request for a report on the activities of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) on Developments in Aging, 1989.491 The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Division of Social Services, provides services andfinancial payments to eligible Indian individuals and families, including the elderly,who reside on or near reservations, and who are not eligible for such assistancefrom any other Federal or state source. Social Services provides counseling and sup-port services to the elderly upon request or referral from other sources. If necessary,adult protective services are provided to ensure the safety and health of the elderly.Another component of services to the elderly is Adult Custodial Care, which is pro-vided in locales where public funds are not available. Custodial care is essentiallyprotective services of nonmedical care to an eligible person when due to age, infir-mity, physical or mental impairment, that the person requries care from others inhis or her daily living. The non-medical care is provided in the least restrictive envi-ronment including the individual's home, group home setting or an institution.Social Services also provides services to elderly Indians with restricted IndividualIndian Monies Accounts on budgeting of financial matters and intervenes on behalfof the Indian upon request or need. ATrAcHMENT \"G\" Memorandum to: Andy Adams, Special Projects Administrator, Office of the Assist-ant Secretary-Policy, Budget and Administration.From: Director, Bureau of Mines. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1989. This is in response to your memorandum dated October 16, 1989, concerning theAnnual Report on Developments in Aging. As a scientific organization, the Bureau values the technical expertise that usual-ly typifies a person who has had long and extensive experience in research, analy-sis, development and assessment activities. We continue to rely on the expertise ofsenior individuals for highly specialized technical and scientific positions. This is ac-complished through temporary hiring authorities utilized to employ reemployed an-nuitants, members for the Secretary's Advisory Committee, and college/universityfaculty. At this time last year, the Bureau of Mines had a total of 178 employees age 60and above. This year that work force increased to 203 employees age 60 and above.This increase was primarily due to a large number of employees reaching their 60thbirthday during this reporting period. Servicing personnel offices provided individ-ual retirement counseling for all interested employees who were undecided aboutretirement. A number of field installations issued periodic information and remind-er notices regarding pre-retirement seminars for persons who would be eligible forretirement within a specific number of years. During 1989, the Bureau awarded fouremployees Superior Service Awards, and two employees Meritorious Awards. Theseawards were received by senior employees in their fifties or older. A review of our internal and external employment policies indicates that theBureau of Mines has and continues to support the interests and needs of the agingthrough its diversified prograrms and service. We continue to stress equal treatmentfor all applicants and employees. ATTAcHMENT \"H\" Memorandum to: Dr. Andy Adams, Special Projects Administrator. Policy, Budgetand Administration. From: Director, Minerals Management Service. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1989. This is in response to your memorandum of October 16, 1989, requesting ourreport on Developments in Aging for 1989. The Minerals Management Service(MMS) continues to work to support programs for older Americans. Our work forcestatistics are as follows:-The MMS work force, age 40 and over, continued to increase during the pastyear from 54 percent in 1988 to 55 percent in 1989 (1,161 of 2,111). Of this total,110 employees are over age 60, an increase of 10 from 1988 (5.2 percent) with 23workers over age 65 and 9 over age 70. In 1988 MMS employed 16 workers overage 65 and 8 over age 70. -Older employees are well represented in a variety of occupations within MMSincluding computer specialists, accountants, auditors, engineers, and physicalscientists.-The needs of our older workers are addressed through our employee develop-ment program. Retirement planning workshops were attended by 103 MMS em-ployees in 1989. Our managers and supervisors continue to receive equal em-492 ployment opportunity training which includes age discrimination and how to avoid it. The MMS spent $44,376 on such training during this past fiscal year. -The MMS mission continues to assist older Americans in the improvement of our economy through the decrease in our dependence on foreign oil. The MMS has a strong commitment to all our employees, including our older workers. Our older workers are a source of valuable knowledge and experience and a significant factor in the success of the MMS mission. Thank you for this opportunity to report on our activities involving the aging. ArrACHMENT \"I\" Memorandum to: Dr. Andy Adams, Special Projects Administrator Policy, Budget and Administration. From: Personnel Officer. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1989. This is in response to your memorandum of October 16, 1989, requesting inform- tion on the activities of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) affecting our older citi- zen during the past year. The USGS employment policy stresses equality of opportunity for all Americans. Qualification requirements are based on the knowledges, skills, and abilities re- quired for each position being filled. This can prove to be beneficial to older employ- ees, many of whom possess long and extensive experience in water resource, geolog- ic or mapping programs. Physical standards are kept at appropriate levels needed for safe and effective performance, but at levels low enough to otherwise accommo- date older employees successfully. The bureau presently employs 39 persons who are 70 years of age and older, and 5,072 persons age 41 to 69 years old, out of a total work force of 10,556 people. Also, we employ 139 people who are 55 years of age or older as reemployed annuitants. These valued employees serve in a broad spectrum of grade levels and professional, technical, and clerical support occupations. Since June 1986, the USGS has conducted a very active, mutually beneficial, vol- unteer program in which science-oriented individuals donate their time and skills in support of the bureau mission. An important element in this \"Volunteer for Science Program\" has been the full utilization of the talents of older persons, particularly USGS retirees. Under this program, volunteers of all kinds provide valuable assist- ance and services to the USGS to supplement our regular staff and programs wher- ever there are bureau activities in the United States. During the past year there were at least 93 USGS retirees and 44 USGS Scientists Emeriti performing volun- teer work under this program. In addition, 20 USGS retirees have signed volunteer agreements to provide personal support and asssistance to the official activities of the USGS Visitor's Center located in the bureau's National Center in Reston, Vir- ginia. The USGS derives many direct benefits from the older persons associated with this volunteer program. Because of our past success, our bureau will continue to encourage participation in and support of volunteer activities by older citizens and USGS retirees. The USGS, as an employer, is well aware of the demographic changes that are taking place in the United States, particularly with regard to the increase in the percentage of citizens who will be older. A new Census Bureau study indicates that there will be more than a million people over the age of 100, and nearly 3 million citizens who will be 95 to 99 years old, by the year 2080. By the year 2000, the Washington metropolitan areas residents aged 65 and older will number almost 430,000. This will be nearly double their number in 1980. During the same period, the 75-and-older population in the area will also more than double. Fairfax County, where the USGS National Center is located, recently provided data that indicated that 27 percent of the county's population will be 55 years old or older by 2010. Ac- cordingly, the USGS employment program is dedicated to making full use of the skills and abilities of all our citizens, but particularly those who are older. In addition to the needs of our handicapped employees, the USGS has conducted surveys of all our facilities, nationwide, to determine if there are any physical bar- riers which might prevent or discourage access by older employees or the general public to our facilities and offices. Facilities are designed and modified, wherever necessary, to meet the needs of handicapped persons and older employees or citi- zens. During the past year, the USGS also recognized the important career contribu- tions of its older employees by presenting a large number of service awards. Three employees received 50-year length of service awards, 37 people received 40-year length of service awards, and 108 employees were given 30-year service awards. This large group of awards is indicative of the fact that the USGS encourages and allows493 its older employees ample opportunities to fulfill their career and work needs. Theexpertise, experience, and scientific and technical knowledge represented by theseolder employees have been invaluable to the activities of the bureau, and we arevery proud to recognize their continuing productivity. Several examples of the contributions of typical older employees include the fol- lowing: (1) Thomas Maddock, Jr., age 83, a reemployed annuitant who providesexpert advice to the Chief Hydrologist in the fields of river hydraulics, sediments, and sediment transport. Mr. Maddock has more than 55 years of effective Federalservice and possesses considerable knowledge and research experience in hydrology; (2) John D. Hem, age 73, currently a Senior Research Scientist, whose chemical re-search, during his more than 50 years of creative Federal service, has greatly con-tributed to our Nation's knowledge of geochemical and hydrologic principles govern-ing rock weathering, mineral synthesis, and ground-water circulation. Recipient ofthe Meritorious and Distinguished Service Awards, Mr. Hem has many outstandingachievements to his credit, and has made many exceptional contributions to the pro-grams of the Department of the Interior and the USGS; and (3) Dr. Ralph L. Miller,age 61, is a reemployed annuitant with a world-wide reputation as an expert on thegeology of energy resources, particulary hydrocarbons. Dr. Miller provides advice onCentral America and on programs in Latin America under the Caribbean Basin Ini-tiative. He has more than 50 years of outstanding Federal service to his credit. These represent but a few of the continuing, significant activities of the bureau'solder employees. The USGS clearly recognizes the value of the service of its olderemployees. Our basic personnel management practices include a strict adherence tonondiscrimination relative to age. Our bureau has a long track record for providingample, fulfilling work opportunities for older employees, and beyond retirement forreemployed annuitants. In particular, we provide continual pre-retirement planningprograms and counseling to help make the transition to retirement less traumaticfor older workers. We also utilize a significant number of part-time positions which,in many cases, make it possible for older persons to be productively employed.Our programs and actions clearly demonstrate that the USGS is strongly commit-ted to a continual awareness of the need to insure that our older employees are pro-vided sufficient opportunities to fulfill their personal career needs, and to allow ourbureau to take maximum advantage of their knowledges, skills, and abilities. Weare proud to be able to contribute to such a goal, and we will continue to strive toremove any barriers in employment which prevent full participation by our olderemployees. ArrAcHMmTr \"J\" Memorandum to: Dr. Andy Adams, Special Projects Administrator, Office of the As-sistant Secretary-Policy, Budget and Administration.From: Director, Office of Surface Mining. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1989. In response to your memorandum of October 16, 1989, the Office of SurfaceMining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) is pleased to submit its Annual Reporton Developments in Aging for 1989. The OSM relies heavily on the 20 percent of our employees who are 50 years ofage or older. These employees account for 232 of our 1,163 total employees and in-clude many of our executives and senior-level managers. Within the past year, thenumber of employees in this age group increased by 2.2 percent. Given the demo-graphic forecast for the next decade, of a decrease in younger employees and an in-crease in older employees, it is clear that we will place an even greater reliance onour more mature employees. As part of OSM's initiative to utilize, develop, and recognize its older employees,several efforts are being implemented. A policy statement has been issued stressingnondiscrimination of older individuals along with all other employees. This will be followed-up with the use of pamphlets and videotapes on subjects such as the pre-vention of age discrimination in the workplace. Furthermore, \"age-neutral\" policiesand practices are emphasized in supervisory training and monitored with regard toemployee participation in the Upward Mobility Program, all training programs, em-ployee promotions, and the awards programs. Finally, the various programs of OSM, to protect lives and property, provide con-siderable aid to our older citizens.494 ATrAcHMENT \"K\" Memorandum to: Dr. Andy Adams, Special Projects Administrator, PBA.' From: Assistant Secretary-Territorial and International Affairs. Subject: Report on developments in Aging, 1989. - Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your memorandum of October 16, 1989 on the above subject. The Office of Territorial and International Affairs (OTIA) does not conduct special programs for any groups of people, including the elderly. It places no restrictions on employment insofar as the elderly are concerned and nor does age enter into consid- eration for employee training, special assignments, or promotions. As previously reported, the territories under the jurisdiction of the OTIA are self- governing. -The territorial governments are responsible for federally funded pro- grams for the elderly under their jurisdication. This office is available at all times to assist them upon request. ArrAcHMENT \"L\" Memorandum to: Andy Adams. From: Deputy Director. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1989. In response to your memorandum of October 16, 1989, I am pleased to provide information pertaining to individuals who are in their. \"prime\". Thb Fish and Wild- life Service (Service) recognizes its responsibility of providing opportunities to all in-, dividuals, including its employees and the public it serves. Of 7,535 Service employees, 52 percent are age 40'and above. Although in. FY 1989 there was a decline of 51 employees age 60 and above, the number of employees be- tween 40 and 49 increased by 144. These statistics show that the overall number of employees in the targeted areas have increased..In addition, the Service has benefit- ted from the expertise and experience of our personnel, especially since 1,631 em- ployees or 22 percent of the workforce has devoted 20 or more years to our mission. One individual has almost spent half of a century with the Service (48 years). The breakdown is as follows: Employees: . Smice time : 30-39 1,322 .20-29 Other contributions made to the Service involve the numerous hours (approxi- mately 75,000) that over 1,500 senior citizens donated this past year. Several volun- teers were utilized in the Alaskan oil spill. In addition to the actual clean up, other activities were equally important. Cal Lensink, a retired Service biologist, could have worked for oil companies because of his skill and demand. However, he chose to work for the Service by establishirig a morgue for the wildlife and also identify- ing and-later making inventories of the birds. Chris Provost created a wildlife reha- bilitation facility that provided a place to care for sick and/or injured birds and other wildlife. Chris also trained and ultimately established a network of volunteers to. help with the operation of the facility. Between other functions, he organized media conferences to assure accurate information was presented to the public in- volving oil spill issues. Some of our older volunteers have also assisted with more pleasant activities such as celebrations. This past year, the Leadville National Fish Hatchery had its Cen- tennial. To celebrate this event, its visitor center was renovated, a visitor kiosk was constructed, and a volunteer program was implemented. Two couples (one in their sixties and the other in their seventies) stayed on nearby campgrounds and provided approximately 1,000 hours during the summer months greeting visitors, conducting tours and assisting with the upkeep of the facilities and the grounds. With limited staff at the refuges and hatcheries, volunteers allow regular staff time to perform other duties. Having volunteers to almost or totally staff the visitor centers is not an unusual occurrence throughout the refuge system. In addition, the volunteers benefit by experiencing the joys of wildlife and interaction with people (up to 1,000 a day). Another celebration was the commemoration of the Kilanea Lighthouse. Two vol- unteers made tremendous contributions to the commemoration's success. One indi- vidual used his scientific and engineering background to allow the lens of the light- house to rotate and once again become functional. The other, Ross Aikin, volun-495 teered to gather information on the history of the 75-year-old lighthouse. What ini-tially began as a small venture turned into something that Ross didn't even imag-ine; a little data became a book. He researched, wrote and published a book entitled\"Kilauea Point Lighthouse-The Landfall Beacon on the Orient Run\", of which hedonated all the proceeds. In addition, he edits two newsletters, one of which is dis-tributed to every 5th grade student in the State of Hawaii. (Ross is a finalist in the1989 Take Pride in America national awards competition and also received the Di-rector's Award.) In addition to participation of volunteers, there are programs and activities thatinterest visitors, including some who are senior citizens. As a result of individualsbecoming wiser (and older), the aging process has a tendency of producing inconven-iences such as visual, hearing or physical impairments that involve making adjust-ments on their part and every other concerned individual. The Service has ad-dressed this issue by completing an assessment of all programs, activities and facili-ties that are open to the public. A plan has been implemented to correct identifieddeficiencies, so that ultimately the activities and programs will be open and accessi-ble to all persons. Some of the programs that are offered include: the Elderhostel Program (must be60) which offers educational courses for seniors that usually consist of field trips,interpretive programs, and film viewing (most of which have audio and visual com-ponents to assist visually and hearing impaired visitors). The visitors also make useof Golden Age Passports (one refuge alone issued 9,228) to observe the wildlife, etc.Another activity includes trail walks. Two individuals on the Flint Hills Refugehave heart problems and signed up with permits to walk in closed areas of theRefuge for their health. The walkers benefitted and the stations benefitted byhaving observers in the field to detect and report violations, unusual wildlife sight-ings and population estimates. Again, the Service is reciprocated with volunteerismby providing the use of its lands to the public. Although some of the activities mayseem to be geared toward senior citizens, there are several comparable programsthat are open to all individuals. As illustrated, the Service utilizes and benefits from older individuals in many as-pects of its operation, and in return, the Service gives them opportunities to takeadvantage of and enjoy the wildlife and its habitat. ArrAcHMENT \"M\" Memorandum to: Special Projects Administrator, Budget and Administration.Through: Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks.From: Acting Director, National Park Service.Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1989. The National Park Service, over the past few years, has made significant effortsto insure that the full range of the visiting public, including senior citizens, can getinto our parks and once there, can participate in and receive the benefits of the pro-grams and services provided. One step taken by the National Park Service to improve accessibility, was tocreate a special unit in its Washington Office to monitor and coordinate the entireSystemwide effort. It was determined by NPS management that we should approachthe issue in a comprehensive, organized way rather than on a project-by-projectbasis. Accordingly, in 1979, the Branch of Special Programs and Populations was es-tablished and staffed with individuals who have specific background and experiencein recreation and park programming with special populations. The primary goal ofthe Branch is to develop and coordinate a Systemwide, comprehensive approach toachieving the highest level of accessibility that is feasible while at the same time,assuring consistency with other legal mandates of preservation and protection of theresources that we manage. Since its creation, the Branch has been working with re-source persons in each of the Regional Offices and other NPS units to assess thecurrent level of accessibility of our various parks, identify the barriers to accessibil-ity, develop policies and guidelines regarding appropriate methods and techniquesfor improving access, and providing technical assistance and in-Service training oncost-effective approaches and program implementation. Through these coordinatedefforts, the National Park Service has been recognized as a leader in opening oppor-tunities to disabled persons and senior citizens as well.At the present time, continued efforts are being made to increase the number ofolder citizens in the Service's Volunteer in the Parks Program and we are currentlyworking with the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). Since 1983, thenumber has increased from 4 percent to 10 percent.496 Another major effort of the National Park Service, as it relates to senior citizens, is the operation of the Golden Age Passport Program. This passport is a free life- time entrance permit to those recreation areas administered by the Federal Govern- ment that charge entrance fees, and is issued to citizens or permanent residents of the United States who are 62 years of age or older. The passport holder also gets a 50 percent discount on Federal use fees charged for facilities and services such as camping, boat launching and parking. Since 1975, when this program was changed from a 1-year permit to a lifetime permit, the Service has issued well over 3 million passports. In 1985, we reported that over 300,000 passports were issued by all Feder- al recreation agencies. In 1986, 302,153 passports were issued and in 1987, 368,569 passports were issued. Data for 1988 shows an increase to 570,529 Golden Age Pass- ports issued. Statistical data for 1989 will not be available until early 1990, however, it is anticipated there will be an increase in the number issued. The National Park Service is increasingly becoming more accessible for all citi- zens including the elderly and other special populations. This is due to our continu- ing efforts to remove barriers that inhibit special population groups from experienc- ing and enjoying the national parks. Many senior citizens, due to the aging process, who are experiencing the loss of hearing, problems with visual acuity and mobility impairments, benefit from these programs and facility modifications. Large type materials, captioned audiovisual programs, audio messages for the blind, and adap- tations for wheelchairs users are all modifications from which the senior citizen can benefit. In 1986, the Service published the report of the 1982-83 Nationwide Recrea- tion Survey (NRS). This report included a chapter on \"Aging and Outdoor Recrea- tion,\" which was based on a series of questions sponsored by the Administration on Aging and asked of.respondents of 60 and over. A major user of the NRS data in 1986 was the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors. The commissions report, published in July 1987, emphasized the implications of an aging U.S. popula- tion and a greater diversity of interest and abilities among older Americans for the future of parks and other recreation resources. * The National Park Service continues to provide financial assistance to State and local governments for recreation land acquisition and development under the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) program. Under this and other financial as- sistance programs, the Service encourages and monitors grant recipients to ensure that adequate provisions are in place to ensure access to assisted recreation facili- ties and services for elderly citizens, in accordance with the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. The Service provides financial and technical assistance to states for Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Planning under the LWCF Act. One of the major objectives of such planning is to identify and address the recreation needs of special populations, including the elderly and people with disabilities. A number of urban communities also continue with special planning and recreation program- ming efforts for senior citizens initiated in earlier years with grants from the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program. The National Park Service continues to monitor and identify the number of em- ployees who are 60 and over. In 1988, the survey indicated a decrease in the number of employees in this age group. However, in 1989, the survey indicated that employ- ees 60 and over are at all GS levels and showed an increase in the total number employed. The National Park Service will continue to monitor this situation and will contin- ue efforts to improve services to this age group. A rrACHMENT \"N\" Memorandum to: Dr. Andy Adams, Special Projects Administrator Policy, Budget and Administration.. From: Deputy Director. Subject: Report on Developments in Aging, 1989. This responds to your request for a report on the activities of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on Developments in Aging. The BLM employs 88 individuals who are 65 years old or older, of which 15 are in their seventies. One employee is 80 years old. The employee skills range from a la- borer, WG-2, to two Senior Executive Service employees. Most of the employees in this age group are on career appointments (66 employees). The BLM is aware of the high skills these employees possess. This is supported by the fact that one employee was hired on a career-conditional appointment at the age of 59. The BLM has also re-employed nine retired employees to utilize their expertise on a temporary basis.497 Senior Volunteers.-The exact number of volunteers BLM recruited in 1989 hasyet to be determined; however, on average, seven percent of the more than 14,000citizens who contribute their services annually to BLM are 55 years of age or older.(BLM's Volunteer and Hosted Worker Annual Report will be completed by the endof the year.) The following narratives exemplify the extraordinary gift of serviceBLM's senior volunteers contribute to America.Mr. Bill McConogal is a retired computer programmer with 30 years experiencewith Honeywell and IBM. As a volunteer, Mr. McConogal designed a computer pro-gram in New Mexico that simplifies BLM's procurement tracking system, savingtime and providing better accuracy.On Saturday, May 20, 1989, Mr. Keith Dymock, who died last August, was com-memorated in a special way by the Tooele (Utah) Wildlife Federation and the BLM.More than 50 officials, family and friends gathered in Rush Valley to witness thededication of the Clover Reservoir Wildlife Habitat Area to the memory of Mr.Dymock. The Clover Reservoir Wildlife Habitat Area is a joint project between theTooele Wildlife Federation, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, and BLM tocreate new waterfowl habitat. BLM would like to use this opportunity to recognizehis valuable work and to again honor his memory. When he was alive, Mr. Dymocknever sought recognition for his 40 years with the Tooele County Wildlife Federa-tion where he donated thousands of hours to the 7,600-member organization and thecauses it represents.When Mr. Homer Culbertson retired from teaching, he had trouble finding hisniche, until one evening during a BLM presentation at a Retired Teachers' Associa-tion meeting, he learned that the Chamber of Commerce needed weekend help atBarstow's Desert Information Center. That was 3 years and hundreds of hours ago.Mr. Culbertson works nearly every weekend and holiday at the information centerwhere he answers questions, sells maps, brochures, and informational materials,and provides other visitor services as a Chamber of Commerce worker. Every Tues-day afternoon he performs the same duties as a BLM volunteer. \"This is one of themost stimulating jobs I've ever had,\" he says. \"I help 100 to 150 people a day fromall over the world.\" More than 36,000 visitors stopped in the Desert InformationCenter last year. BLM volunteers currently donate 100 hours to the Desert Informa-tion Center each month, a figure likely to increase with the growing number ofdesert visitors.Since 1974, Miss Ruth De Ette Simpson has been the project director of the CalicoEarly Man Site near Las Vegas when she took over the job from the late Dr. LouiseLeakey, world renowned early man archaeologist/paleontologist. Since 1964, when apermit was issued to Dr. Leakey by the BLM, more than 11,000 stone tools havebeen discovered. The Calico excavations provide a unique \"Museum in Place\" ofPleistocence archaeology and geology, and BLM has designated the site an area ofcritical environmental concern. On November 1, Project Director Simpson and other\"Friends of Calico Early Man Site\" celebrated the silver anniversary of their contin-uous excavation and scientific research at the BLM site.Last year, BLM awarded the \"Volunteer for the Public Lands\" national award toMr. Frank Bagsby of Tulsa, OK. Mr. Bagsby has been working at BLM's Tulsa Dis-trict Office weekly for the past 4 years. He researched, organized, barcoded, titled,carded, and catalogued materials to create an information system and library forthe Tulsa District Office. This provides the resource professionals with a systematicresearch tool so they can accomplish their work in a shorter period of time.Mr. Bagsby's volunteer job is an excellent example of how BLM tries to place avolunteer in a job position that uses the skills and interest that a volunteer has de-veloped throughout a lifetime. As the letter to Mr. Bagsby from the Director of theBLM said, \"On behalf of all of us, the Bureau thanks you for taking pride in Ameri-ca's Public Lands and their resources remain a treasured heritage for all our citi-zens.\" Hosted Workers Also Serve.-\"Hosted workers\" do work that assists the BLM forwhich they are paid wages or salary from Government funds other than funds ap-propriated to BLM and are paid by some other entity other than BLM. They are not\"volunteers,\" since volunteers are persons who contribute their services to BLM forno pay in wages or salary from any source. Following are brief narratives on two ofBLM's hosted workers. Mr. Bud Cantleberry of Lander, WY, works in the Lander Resource Area as ahosted worker from Green Thumb, Inc. Green Thumb, Inc., is a national public serv-ice employment and training program sponsored by the National Farmers Unionunder contract and grant with the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment andTraining Administration. Mr. Cantleberry has assisted BLM by performing buildingmaintenance, clean-up, mechanical repairs, work in the campground, sign installa-498 tion, and fence repairs. (BLM serves as a \"host\" agency for national sponsors of the Senior Community Service Employment Program such as Green Thumb, Inc. and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). Both of these organizations recruit, place and pay senior citizens a small stipend to work with a Federal agency.) As a hosted worker, Mr. Don Cisney has taken on the primary responsibility of surface compliance for the Kingman (Arizona) Resource Area. Mr. Cisney's duties include surface compliance of mining activities involving onsite meetings with oper- ators to discuss problems and mitigating steps for existing problems. Mining claim- ants and operators have commonly reported their appreciation of the courteous and helpful manner in which Mr. Cisney has represented the BLM. His contributions have allowed other area specialists the time necessary to accomplish much more than they would otherwise have had time to do. Thanks in part to Mr. Cisney's work, the Kingman Resource Area reported an increase in progress in the area of exchanges; minerals compliance; and range, wildlife, and Wilderness Study Area monitoring. Mr. Cisney has been a valuable asset to the Kingman Resource Area and the BLM as a whole. ITEM 9. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE JANUARY 10, 1990. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am pleased to enclose for you and the Members of the Special Committee on Aging the submission of the Department of Justice for Devel- opments in Aging. Within the Department, the Office of Justice Programs sponsors a number of ini- tiaties that affect older Americans. For example, OJP collects information about the impact of crime on elderly victims and victimization rates of elderly citizens; works to improve the treatment of elderly and other victims of crime; and helps pro- tect senior citizens and their neighborhoods through crime and drug abuse preven- tion and control programs. In addition, the Office of Justice Programs provides grant funds to the States that may be used to support State and local criminal jus- tice programs for older Americans. Through initiatives such as these, the Department of Justice is working to safe- guard our Nation's senior citizens, who have given so much to this country, their communities, and their families. We trust that the programs we sponsor will play a meaningful role in ensuring for them the security from fear and crime and, of equal importance, the fair treatment they so richly deserve. I appreciate having the opportunity to share with you and the Committee the sig- nificant accomplishments of the Department of Justice, through its Office of Justice Programs, on behalf of older Americans. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may be of further assistance. Sincerely,CAROL T. CRAWFORD, Assistant Attorney GeneraL Enclosure. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OFFIcE OF JUSTCE PROGRAMS The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), within the U.S. Department of Justice, sponsors a number of initiatives that affect older Americans. OJP was created in 1984 to coordinate the management and programs of five bureaus that work with State and local law enforcement and the criminal justice community. While each bureau or office retains independent authority in awarding funds for sponsored pro- grams, the OJP components form a partnership whose goals are to control crime and drug abuse and trafficking, support cost-effective and innovative programs, pro- mote information sharing, foster improvements in the Nation's criminal and juve- nile justice systems, and improve the treatment of victims of crime. Through its Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), OJP provides funds and technical assistance to State and local units of government to control crime and drug abuse and to improve the criminal justice system. Many of these programs have a positive impact on the lives and environments of older Americans. Since 1985, BJA has provided formula grant funding to States to support a pro- gram to protect senior citizens from physical and mental abuse, prevent consumer fraud directed at them, promote community awareness and crime prevention among the elderly, and provide assistance for elderly victims of crime. To date, the pro- gram has been implemented in Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island. Support for these programs is continuing through499 BJA's Drug Control and System Improvement Program, as mandated by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. OJP also provides crime prevention and personal safety information to elderlycitizens through the National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign. The Campaignfeatures \"McGruff, the Crime Dog,\" who asks Americans to help \"Take A Bite Outof Crime\" by taking simple precautions, by reporting suspicious activity to thepolice, and by working with their neighbors, community leaders, law enforcementofficials, and others to keep their communities safe from crime and drugs.The Campaign is administered through a partnership of OJP/BJA, the NationalCrime Prevention Council, the Crime Prevention Coalition, and the AdvertisingCouncil, Inc. Information packets developed by the Campaign and distributed acrossthe country include special crime prevention tips for senior citizens and focus on thespecial needs, concerns, and vulnerabilities of elderly citizens with regard to crimeand victimization. The Campaign also works to enlist senior citizens in the fightagainst crime and drugs. Its informational materials and public service advertisingencourages older Americans to participate in crime prevention activities in theircommunities. Under a BJA grant, the National Crime Prevention Council is developing Topicsin Crime Prevention, which focuses exclusively on working with the elderly in crimeprevention. The report will be distributed through the 130 member organizations ofthe Crime Prevention Coalition and to crime prevention practitioners throughoutthe country. OJP's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collects, analyzes, publishes, and dissemi-nates statistical information on crime, criminal offenders, victims of crime, and theoperations of the criminal justice systems at all levels of government. No new analy-ses of data relating to the elderly were conducted during the year. However, previ-ous studies have shown that while elderly citizens express a greater fear of crimethan persons in other age groups, Older Americans are actually less likely to be vic-tims of crime. BJS's Reactions to Crime project found that impressions about crime are relatedto the content of information about crime. Such information tends to emphasize sto-ries about elderly victims. These stories may influence older citizens to reduce theirrisk of victimization by constricting their activities to reduce their exposure todanger. This behavior would account, at least in part, for their high levels of fearand low levels of victimization. OJP's Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) provides Federal financial assistance tostates to compensate victims for medical and other expenses resulting from a crimeand to provide counseling, referral and other services to crime victims. OVC fundsalso support services for victims of Federal crimes.Although precise data is unavailable, OVC funds have supported a number of pro-grams that specifically serve elderly victims of crime. In addition, a 1988 amend-ment to the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) of 1984 requires States to set aside 10percent of Federal victim assistance funds for previously underserved victim popula-tions, as determined by each State. Eight States identified elderly crime victims as apreviously underserved group for which they plan to fund programs and services:Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, andRhode Island. Alabama and Rhode Island committed the full 10 percent ($72,900and $29,000 respectively) exclusively to serve elderly crime victims.OVC revised its reporting forms during the year so that, in fiscal year 1989 andbeyond, data will be available on dollars allocated to elderly victims and thenumber of elderly crime victims receiving services in each State.Elderly victims of Federal crimes are provided services through the Victim/Wit-ness Coordinators in the 94 U.S. Attorney's Offices throughout the country. Servicesinclude, but are not limited to, the following: Notification and information about thecase, orientation to the criminal justice system and assistance in participating inthe trial, information and referral services regarding community resources andsocial services, protection from harassment or intimidation, and assistance in ob-taining court-ordered restitution for injuries.In addition, through an interagency agreement with OVC, the Federal Law En-forcement Training Center provides training to Federal law enforcement officers onhow to effectively assist elderly victims of crime. OVC funds also support 29 new victim assistance programs on Indian reserva-tions. The programs provide services such as counseling and emergency shelter toelderly victims of crime.

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR JANUARY 10, 1990. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Enclosed is a summary of the programs and activities of the Department of Labor for fiscal year 1989 related to aging. Described in the report are programs administered by the Employment and Train- ing Administration, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I trust this information will be of assistance to you in preparing your report, De- velopments in Aging. Sincerely, ELIzABETH DOLE. Enclosure. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS INTRODUCTION The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) regularly issues a wide variety of statistics on the employment situation by age. Monthly data are available on employment and unemployment for older persons, and annual data are available on consumer expenditures for this group. EMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS OF OLDER WORKERS At the request of Congress, BLS prepared a report on the employment problems of older workers. This report was submitted to Congress in January 1989. The report examined a wide range of data on such problems as employment, displacement and discouragement. It also reviewed some special labor market prob- lems of older women, particularly those associated with labor market reentry. In addition, the report looked at some possible barriers to older worker employment, including pension regulations and the availability of appropriate part-time jobs. EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ADMINISTRATION INTRODUCTION The Department of Labor (DOL) Employment and Training Administration (ETA) provided a variety of training, employment and related services for the Nation's older individuals during Program Year 1988 (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989) through the following programs and activities: the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) authorized under Title V of the Older Americans Act; programs authorized under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA); the Federal-State Em- ployment Service system; and research and demonstration efforts. SENIOR COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act, employs low-income persons age 55 or older in a wide variety of part-time community service activities such as health care, nutri- tion, home repair, and weatherization programs, and in beautification, fire preven- tion, conservation, and restoration efforts. Program participants work an average of 20 hours per week in schools, hospitals, parks, community centers, and in other gov- ernment and private nonprofit facilities. Participants also receive personal and job- related counseling, annual physical examinations, job training, and in many cases referral to unsubsidized jobs in the competitive labor market. Eighty percent of the participants are age 60 or older, and over half are age 65 or older. Seventy percent are female, about half have not completed high school, and all enrollees are at or below 125 percent of the establishes poverty level. Table 1 below shows SCSEP funding, enrollment and participant characteristics for the program year July 1, 1988, to June 30, 1989.

JOB TRAINING PARTNERSHIP ACT (JTPA) PROGRAMS The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) provides job training and related assist-ance to economically disadvantaged individuals, dislocated workers, and others whoface significant employment barriers. The ultimate goal of JTPA is to move pro-gram participants into permanent, self sustaining employment. Under JTPA, Gover-nors have approval authority over locally developed plans and are responsible formonitoring local program compliance with the Act. JTPA functions through apublic/priyate partnership which plans and designs training programs, and also de-livers training and other services. Private Industry Councils, in partnership withlocal governments in each service delivery area, are responsible for providing guid-ance for and oversight of job training activities in the area.JTPA places emphasis on increasing the post program employment and earningsof economically disadvantaged and displaced workers. Seventy percent of the fundsavailable to service delivery areas are required to be spent on training. Not morethan 15 percent can be spent for the costs of administration, and not more than 30percent may be spent for the combined costs of administration and supportive serv-ices. Basic JTPA Grants Title 11-A authorizes a wide range of training activities to prepare economicallydisadvantaged youth and adults for employment. Training services available to eligi-ble older workers through the basic Title II-A grant program may include activitiessuch as on-the-job training, institutional and classroom training, remedial educationand basic skills training, and job search assistance and counseling. Table 2 showsthe number of persons 55 years of age and over who terminated from the Title 11-Aprogram during the period July 1, 1988, through June 30, 1989. The data do not in-clude the 3 percent set-aside program which is reviewed separately. TABLE 2.-JTPA ENROLLMENT JULY 13.202 U.S Dwartnnnt Programns of JTPA authorizes a State-administered dislocated worker program which provides training and related employment assistance to workers who have been, or have received notice that they are about to be, laid off due to a permanent closing of a plant or facility; laid off workers who are unlikely to be able to return to their previous industry or occupation; and the long-term unemployed with little prospect for local employment or reemployment. Those older workers eligible for the program may receive such services as job search assistance, retraining, prelayoff assistance and relocation. During the period July 1, 1988 through June 30, 1989 ap- proximately 10,200 individuals 55 years of age and over went through the program (7.6 percent of the program terminations). Section 124 Set-Aside Section 124 of JTPA call for 3 percent of the Title 11-A allotment of each State to be made available for the training and placement of older individuals is employ- ment opportunities with private business concerns. The provision specifies that only economically disadvantaged individuals who are 55 years of.age or older are eligible for services funded from this set-aside. JTPA offers wide discretion to the Governors in using the set-aside. Two major patterns have evolved. One is its use for organizationally distinct older worker projects in a manner similar to the categorical separation of SCSEP programs from the rest of the JTPA system. The other is the use of the set-aside as resources for Title 11-A programs to ensure a minimum portion of older workers among the Title 11-A participants, without the creation of separate programs for older workers. In some States, all or part of the set-aside is formula-funded to service delivery areas. In other States, it is used for administration at the State level, for model programs, or for both purposes. For Program Year 1988, (July 1, 1988 through June 30, 1989), the 3 percent set-aside program for economically disadvantaged individuals 55 years of age and over enrolled over 48,000 participants. THE FEDERAL-STATE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE SYSTEM The State-operated public employment service offices offer employment assistance to all jobseekers, including middle-aged and older persons. A full range of basic labor exchange services are provided, including counseling, testing, job development, job search assistance and job placement. In addition, labor market information and referral to relevant training and employment programs are also made available. In response to the paperwork reduction initiatives, Federal reporting require- ments for the State Employment Service (ES) agencies no longer include data on the characteristics of applicants. Therefore, information is not available at the national level on the number of middle-aged and older persons served by the ES. RESEARCH In Fiscal Year 1989, the National Institute for Work and Learning prepared a summary report on the needs and characteristics of union retirees and the services available to them from community resources and from their unions. The report, which was funded by the Employment and Training Administration and the AFL- CIO, will make the results of a two year study of over 10,000 retirees available to an audience of unions and others interested- in the needs of and resources available to older workers and retirees. The findings include information on the retirees' hous- ing, health services, finances, pre- and post-retirement employment, social contacts, general needs and concern, and satisfaction with conditions before and after retire- ment. The roles of the unions and community organizations in satisfying the needs of retirees were examined in a general survey and in detailed studies of representa- tive communities.

National Institute for Work and Learning, January 1990.503 PENSION AND WELFARE BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION INTRODUCTION The Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA) is responsible for en-forcing the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). PWBA's primaryresponsibilities are for the reporting, disclosure and fiduciary provisions of the law.Employee benefit plans maintained by employers and/or unions generally mustmeet certain standards, set forth in ERISA, designed to ensure that employees actu-ally will receive the benefits promised. ERISA does not, however, apply to publicsector plans or to certain private sector plans. The requirements of ERISA differ depending on whether the benefit plan is apension plan or a welfare plan. Both types of plans must comply with provisionsgoverning reporting and disclosure to the Government and to participants (Title I,Part 1) and fiduciary responsibility (Title I, Part 4). Pension plans must comply withadditional ERISA standards (contained in both Title I, Parts 2 and 3, and Title II)which govern membership in a plan (participation), nonforfeitability of a partici-pant's right to a benefit (vesting), and financing of benefits offered under the plan(funding). Welfare plans providing medical care must comply with ERISA continu-ation covergae requirements (Title I, Part 6).The Departments of Labor and the Treasury have responsibility for administeringthe provisions of Title I and Title H, respectively, of ERISA. The Pension BenefitGuaranty Corporation (PBGC) is responsible for administering Title IV, which estab-lished an insurance program for certain benefits provided by specified ERISA pen-sion plans. REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE STANDARD ERISA requires that plans disclose to participants and report to the Federal Gov-ernment information about plan provisions and financial status. Certain plans mustsubmit an annual report in the form of a financial statement; in general, PWBA-regulated benefit plans must also submit a public accountant's opinion. The reportgenerally includes a statement of plan assets and liabilities, a statement of transac-tions involving conflict of interest situations, and other information regarding theadministration of the plan. Annual report forms are simplified for small plans, anda number of paperwork reductions have been instituted since ERISA's passage in1974. The annual report is submitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and sharedby the ERISA agencies. In fiscal year 1989, data indicate that DOL received over 1million annual reports. This information is used for enforcement and research, andthe documents are kept on file for public disclosure. The plan administrator alsoprovides participants, beneficiaries and DOL with a summary plan description (SPD)written to be understood by the average person. The SPD contains a description ofbenefits, the requirements for eligibility and procedures for presenting claims forbenefits. In addition, participants may request, and in some cases must be providedwithout a request, a statement of their individual benefits.The Pension Protection Act of 1987 amended ERISA to authorize the Labor De-partment to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000 per day against plan administra-tors who refuse or fail to file complete annual reports. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR PARTICIPATION AND VESTING IRS, for the most part, enforces the ERISA minimum standards for participationand vesting. ERISA restricts the age and service requirements which plans mayimpose as conditions for eligibility to participate in the employer's pension plan.The basic rule is that an employee cannot be denied membership in the plan,merely on account of age or service, if he or she is at least 21 years old and hasworked for the employer for 1 year.Other ERISA provisions govern when a plan participant must gain a nonforefeita-ble right to the portion of the retirement benefit provided by the employer's contri-butions to the plan. (Amounts attributable to the participant's own contributionsare always nonforfeitable). In this regard, the plan must provide that an employeegain a nonforfeitable right to this portion of his or her retirement benefit at a ratewhich is not less generous than one of the schedules set forth in ERISA. The TaxReform Act of 1986 established new schedules which, for most plans, provide a non-forfeitable right to retirement benefit sooner than under prior law. The new sched-ules are effective for plan years beginning after 1988.ERISA also contains rules on the rate at which participants must be allowed to\"accure\" a benefit, i.e., the rate at which they are considered to have \"earned\" a504 portion of their ultimate retirement benefit. These standards basically are relevant to pension plans which promise to provide participants a defined periodic payment upon retirement. MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARDS ERISA sets forth rules for financing pension benefits. For plans which promise participants a defined periodic payment upon retirement, the employer's contribu- tion are determined actuarially. Certain assumptions or mortality, interest, and turnover rates are used to calculate how much should be contributed to provide the benefits promised by the plan. ERISA provides rules governing what types of fund- ing methods are appropriate and establishes penalties for failures to comply with these standards. These funding rules are enforced by IRS. The Department of Labor, however, has jurisdiction over two new disclosure requirements related to the mini- mum funding standards under the Pension Protection Act of 1987. FIDUCIARY STANDARDS ERISA sets forth certain standards regarding the investment and utilization of plan assets with which fiduciaries of employee benefit plans must comply. These standards include the requirements that plan assets be invested \"solely in the inter- est\" of plan participants and beneficiaries, and that plans be maintained for the ex- clusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries. ERISA provides that fidu- ciaries must adhere to standards regarding the safeguarding and diversification of plan assets that would be followed by a \"prudent\" investor. ERISA also sets forth certain activities that (unless specifically exempted) may not be carried out be cer- tain individuals and groups (including fiduciaries) who, because of the potential for conflict with the interests of the plan, might cause the plan to operate in their own interests. These activities are known as \"prohibited transactions,\" and persons who violate the rules may be subject to an excise tax imposed by IRS, or a civil penalty assessed by the Department of Labor. Civil actions may be brought by the Secretary of Labor or by plan participants and beneficiaries for violations of Title I of ERISA. DOL places great emphasis on enforcing the fiduciary provisions of the Act. In fiscal year 1989, it recovered over $111 million for employee benefit plans through a combination of litigation and vol- untary compliance. Under voluntary compliance breaches of fiduciary duty are cor- rected through voluntary settlement agreements with plan officials. Potential crimi- nal violations involving employee benefit plans investigated by PWBA may be re- ferred to the Department of Justice for prosecution. The Omnibus Budget Reconcili- lation Act of 1989 created new mandatory civil penalties that apply to recoveries for violations of ERISA by plan fiduciaries. PLAN TERMINATION INSURANCE Title IV of ERISA established within DOL a benefit insurance program adminis- tered by PBGC, an independent nonprofit entity with a Board of Directors consist- ing of the Secretaries of Labor, Commence, and the Treasury. This insurance pro- gram is applicable only to certain pension plans which promise a defined benefit upon a participant's retirement. Employers who maintain these plans are required to pay an annual per-participant premium to PBGC to finance this coverage. The guarantee program differs according to the number of employers maintaining the plan. In the case of a single-employer plan, PBGC will guarantee, up to pre- scribed level, the payment of a participant's nonforfeitable benefit if the plan termi- nates with insufficient assets to pay these benefits. In the case of a multiemployer plan, PBGC guarantees benefits up to a prescribed level which is lower than the level guaranteed to single-employer plans. In this case, it is the inability of the plan to pay participants their guaranteed amounts, not plan termination, that triggers financial assistance. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PWBA conducts a coordinated program of research through contracts and in house studies. The research program develops data on employee benefit plans which can be used as the basis for program modifications or policy decisions. It also ana- lyzes economic issues related to retirement decisions and income and to the per- formance and effect of private pension plans in financial markets. The following study areas were reviewed in fiscal year 1989: (1) The changes in retiree's pension benefits over the period of retirement. (2) Pension plan terminations of companies involved in mergers and acquisi- tions; changes in pension generosity as a result of takeovers.505 (3) The effect of the Pension Protection Act on plan funding. (4) Analysis of sampling issues and projection techniques for the Form 5500data; 1986 Form 5500 sample. (5) A supplement to the Current Population Survey on employer-providedpension benefits. (6) The financial factors affecting firm's decisions to grant benefit increases toretirees. (7) The role of innovative investment vehicles in pension portfolio strategies. (8) Development of a microsimulation model for analysis of proposed healthinsurance legislation. (9) Characteristics of the working uninsured. (10) Study of private employers' health care cost containment. (11) Increased in demand for health services by newly insured workers. (12) Analysis of the income distribution effects of mandated health benefits.Further, a book, Trends in Pensions 1989, which compiles for the first time morethan 16,000 statistics about the U.S. pension system from more than 50 publications, was published. INQUIRIES PWBA publishes literature and audio-visual materials which explain in somedepth provisions of ERISA, procedures for plans to ensure compliance with the Act,and the rights and protections afforded participants and beneficiaries under thelaw. In addition, PWBA deals with many inquiries from older workers. During fiscal year 1989, the national office staff responded to over 63,600 plan participants, bene-ficiaries, and other persons interested in the administration of plans. Among thepublications disseminated, the following are designed exclusively to assist the publicin understanding the law and how their pension plans operate:-What You Should Know About the Pension And Welfare Law.-Know Your Pension Plan. -How To File A Claim For Benefits. -Often Asked Questions About ERISA. -Retirement Equity Act: Its Impact On Women. -How to Obtain Employee Benefit Documents From the Labor Department.-Simplified Employee Pensions: What Small Business Needs To Know.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE REPORT ON DEvELOPMENTS IN AGING FOR 1989 The Department of State primary involvement with aging citizens is as a provider of U.S. Government services to Amerians living overseas. In this capacity, Americanembassies assist in the distribution of Social Security benefits to recipients livingoverseas, for example. The Department's second point of interaction with the aging is in the context ofproviding retirement benefits for retirees. The Department of State administers the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System and the Foreign Service Pension System, which provide annuities and survivor benefits to retired members of theForeign Service, and their families. The Department also engages with its former employees by sponsoring Foreign Service Day on an annual basis. This one day conference, held on the Department ofState premises, affords Foreign Service retirees an opportunity to refresh theirknowledge of foreign affairs, through a series of meetings and speakers on foreign policy topices of the day. Foreign Service Day additionally gives our former employ- ees a chance to maintain and revitalize personal contacts and friendships acquiredduring their careers.506 ITEM 12.

SUMMARY OF AcrvrriEs To IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION SERvicEs FOR THE ELDERLY ' INTRODUCTION The following is a summary of significant actions taken by the U.S. Department of Transportation during calendar year 1989 to improve transportation for elderly persons.2 POLICIES Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) continued throughout cal- endar year 1989 its systemwide policy of offering to handicapped and elderly per- sons a 25 percent discount on one-way ticket purchases, with the exeption of certain peak travel days. Senior citizens and handicapped passengers are not permitted to combine their 25 percent discount with any other discounts. With appropriate prior notification to its reservation office, Amtrak provides spe- cial food service, facilities for handling reservations for the hearing impaired, spe- cial equipment handling, and provision of wheelchairs and assistance in boarding and deboarding of elderly and handicapped passengers. Amtrak operates a Special Services Bureau 7 days a week that assists special needs passengers with tickets and transportation. Persons may request speical services by contacting Amtrak's special service desk at 1-800-USA-RAIL. They may also inform the ticket agent of their need at the time they book their reservations or call the railroad station in advance of their travel. More than 120,000 mobility-impaired and other disabled individuals sought assist- ance from the Special Services Bureau last year and tens of thousands of other dis- abled and elderly persons traveled on* Ambrak unassisted. Over the past several years, 48 percent of long-distance passengers were 55 and older, and 28 percent were 65 and older. In addition, Amtrak works each year with a number of organizations on large special moves of disabled and elderly tour group passengers. Amtrak has modified its older coaches and sleeping cars and has incorporated ac- cessibility features in restrooms and in other areas. Virtually every car can accom- modate one electric wheelchair, and Amtrak offers handicapped sleeping accommo- dations on all overnight trains. The corporation is replacing its battery-opreated lifts with mechanical lifts, which are easier to operate and present fewer mainte- nance problems. It is continuing to incorporate accessibility features in its more than 475 stations as they are upgraded. Amtrak is working to improve training of its employees so that they are familiar with the appropriate ways to respond to passengers with special needs. Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) UMTA is the lead agency in an interdepartmental working relationship between the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Under the terms of the interagency agreement, a staff working l Prepared for the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging-December 1989. 2Many of the activities highlighted in this report are directed toward the needs of handi- capped persons. However, one-third of the elderly are handicapped and thus will be major bene- ficiaries of these activities.507 group has been established, and a formal executive level DOT/DHHS Transporta- tion Coordination Council has been formed. The Council which meets biannually, has directed that regional initiatives be undertaken in each Federal region. Federal regional staff from both Departments have worked with State program administra- tors to identify barriers to coordination in federally supported programs and to en- courage state and local efforts to coordinate funding for specialized transportation services. The liaison between these two Departments will increase the mobility of elderly Americans by improving the coordination and effective use of transportation resources of both Departments. As a part of its efforts in the Joint Council on Coordination, UMTA and the De- partment of Health and Human Services developed a \"Manual of Best Practices\" in transportation coordination. This manual covers state and local programs which ad- dress a number of the barriers to coordination identified by the regional initiatives. UMTA is working closely with the Administration on Aging (A0A) to develop joint initiatives to ensure closer working relationships between state transportation agencies and agencies on aging. As a part of this effort, UMTA and AOA jointly funded workshops in Texas and Ohio aimed at developing better coordination of policies and programs at the State level. The workshops identified a number of bar- riers in these States and developed action plans to deal with them. UMTA and DHHS continued to work with the Federal Region IV Transportation Consortium. The consortium is an eight State cooperative effort in Region IV de- signed to achieve improvements in human service transportation delivery. Project components include: Development of a coordinated technical assistance mechanism among the member States; research; and identification and removal of programmat- ic and institution barriers to coordinated human service transportation funded by the two Departments. Particular attention is given to transportation and human service programs administered at the State level. CAPITAL AND OPERATING ASSISTANCE Urban Mass Transportation Administration Under Section 16(bX2) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act, UMTA provides as- sistance to private nonprofit organizations for the provision of transportation serv- ices for elderly persons and persons with disabilities. In 1989 over $34.8 million was used to assist in the purchase of 1,357 vehicles for the provision of transportation services for these persons. Under Section 18 of the Urban Mass Transportation Act, UMTA obligated $84.2 million to States in 1989. These funds were to be used for capital, operating, and administrative expenditures by State and local agencies, nonprofit organizations and operators of transportation systems to provide public transportation services in rural and small urban areas under 50,000 population. Under Section 9 of the Urban Mass Transportation Act, UMTA obligated $1,712.7 million in 1989. These funds were to be used for capital and operating expenditures by transit agencies to pro- vide public transportation services in urbanized areas. While these services must be open to the general public, a significant number of passengers served are elderly persons. RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE Urban Mass Transportation Administration The Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP), in its third year, was authorized to expend $5 million in FY 1989. The program provides funding for training, techni- cal assistance and research, and related support activities in rural areas. States re- ceive 85 percent of the funding, while the remaining 15 percent is allocated to the RTAP National Program. The RTAP National Program supports among other ini- tiatives, a National RTAP Resource Center and toll free hotline, peer-to-peer networking activity, the RTAP Bulletin, regional outreach initiatives and a 15- member Review Board which provides oversight of the training modules. The RTAP Program produces a wide range of initiatives for able bodied, disabled, and elderly and handicapped rural transit patrons. The National Easter Seal Society Project Action (Accessible Community Transpor- tation in our Nation) is a $3 million research and demonstration grant program now in the final implementation phase. National and local organizations representing public transit operators, the transit industry, and persons with disabilities are in- volved with the development and demonstration of workable approaches to promote 26-386 0 -90 -17508 access to public transportation services for people with disabilities. Project Action has identified five priority areas: 1. Clarify disability problems in the community; outreach and marketing strategies for people with disabilities; 3. training programs for transit providers;. 4. training programs for persons with disabilities; and 5. technology to solve critical barriers to transportation and accessibility. Project Action will also assist in the implementation of the Americans with Dis- abilities Act by investigating what training is necessary to sensitize transit drivers to the needs of people with various disabilities. Tie down and securement difficul- ties, especially for the three wheeled motorized wheelchairs have been identified for research. Project Action has also identified the \"Red Mitt\" program instituted by the Southeastern Michigan Area Rapid Transit District (SMART) which allows per- sons with disabilities to get on a bus by merely holding up their hand with a red mitt: It does.not matter whether the transit rider is at a bus stop or not. Now people can wait at the end of a driveway and can be picked up by a SMART bus. This program along with other model projects will be targeted by Project Action to be refined and replicated throughout the country. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Following publication in October 1988 of the Transportation Resarch Board's (TRB) special on Transportation in an Agig Society, the Federal Highway Adminis- tration>(FHWA) developed an \"Action Plan for Older Persons.\" The plan supports the findings and recommendations of the TRB report, but goes beyond them to in- ude all the highway needs of older. drivers and pedestrians. It discusses current FHWA activities and outlines additional data and research needed for better:accom- modation of elderly drivers and pedestrians on our highway system. It is a compre- hensive plan for future activities and research that the FHWA will undertake. An FHWA project produced a handbook compiling information on planning, design, and maintenance of pedestrian facilities. The handbook covers design fea- tures required to accommodate elderly and handicapped pedestrians. Traffc Control Design Elements for Accommodating Drivers With Diminished Ca- pability is the title of a study to determine if drivers with diminished capability are * being adequately accommodated by the current generation of traffic control devices and whether the special needs of these motorists are being met by traffic control design criteria. It is expected that recommendations for meeting these needs will be developed. The project is scheduled to be completed in the winter of 1990. Recently, FHWA initiated a study entitled Traffic Maneuver Problems of Drivers With Diminished Capacity. The study will be part of a national research program area on \"Improved Highway Travel for an Aging Population.\" It will be a major contribution to the objective of identifying, developing, and evaluating engineering enhancements to the highway system to meet the needs of older users. This study will identify driving maneuvers that are most affected by the diminished capacity of advanced age. With this data in hand, it will be possible to determine the effects on traffic operations and highway safety so counter-measures can be suggested. Section 208(d) of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 authorized a pilot program of highway safety improvements to enhance the safety and mobility of older drivers. Arizona, Florida, and Nevada are imple- menting pilot projects in response to FHWA's encouragement of such projects. The FHWA, in its April 1990 report to Congress, will include findings from the partici- pating State pilot projects, as well as any- information gathered from other States addressing older driver problems. During fiscal year 1989, the FHWA also developed a research project that will de- termine the perception-reaction time of older drivers. The results will be of possible use in sight-distance equations for design of intersections and vertical and horizon- tal curves. The contract will begin early in fiscal year 1990. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NH7SA) The year 1989 marked the beginning of a long-term research program by the agency aimed at improving the safety of older persons on our Nation's streets and highways. The agency, in cooperation with the National Institute on Aging, the Cen- ters for Disease Control, and the Federal Highway Administration, sponsored a 2- day workshop to identify the basic and applied research needed to increase the ty and mobility of older drivers. The findings and recommendations stemming from this workshop will form the basis for the development of a cooperative inter- agency research plan on this subject.509 Several specific studies were also initiated in 1989. An interagency agreement was signed with the National Institute on Aging to obtain highway safety-related infor- mation from participants in two ongoing epidemiological studies of elderly popula- tions. The purpose of this effort is to determine how driving and pedestrian prac- tices are influenced by medical conditions and functional capabilities and how these factors relate to crash risks. An associated study with the University of Washington is focused on the same objectives. Finally, a project to develop pedestrian safety ma- terials and design a nationwide safety campaign to safeguard elderly pedestrians is underway. Results from this project are expected to be available in the summer of 1990. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION Federal Railroad Administration To inform older and handicapped Americans about special services, brochures en- titled \"Access Amtrak\" and the 'Amtrak Travel Guide' are made available through the Railroad's Public Affairs Office. The Amtrak Travel Guide, which identifies ac- cessible stations, is also made available through local sales offices and travel agents. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration During 1989, agency staff prepared two reports pertaining to the older driver. The first one, titled \"Licensing the Older Driver: A Summary of State Practices and Pro- cedures\", was disseminated to a wide audience of State and Federal officials, re- searchers, and organizations interested in the welfare of older persons. It describes State licensing practices that affect older drivers and discusses innovative licensing programs underway in Washington, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. The second report, titled \"The Effects of Aging on the Cognitive and Psychomotor Abilities of Older Drivers: A Review of the Research\", will be available for dissemi- nation in the early part of 1990. This report summarizes research from the psycho- logical, highway safety gerontological, and medical literature with respect to the nonpathological effects of aging on perception, cognition and reaction time related to driving. ITEM 13. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY DECEMBER 22, 1989. DEAR CHAIRMAN: I am pleased to submit, for inclusion in Developments in Aging, the Treasury's report on the Department's activities during 1989 which affected the aged. I hope our report will be of use to the Special Committee on Aging and others studying the problems faced by older Americans. Sincerely, BRYCE L. HARLOW, Assistant Secretary (Legislative Affairs). Enclosures. TREASURY ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL YEAR 1989 AFFECTING THE AGED The Treasury Department recognizes the importance and the special concerns of older Americans, a group that will comprise an increasing proportion of the popula- tion in decades ahead. The Secretary of the Treasury is Managing Trustee of the Social Security trust funds. The short- and long-run financial status of these trust funds is presented in annual reports issued by the Trustees. The 1989 reports concluded that Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance benefits can be paid on time well into the next century. As reflected in the past several reports, the financial outlook for Medicare, in particular Hospital Insurance (or Part A), may become troublesome later in the next decade. In this event some Congressional action may be needed in the next several years. Federal individual income taxes for 1989 reflected a larger personal exemption mandated by statute, and the adjustment for inflation of standard deductions and the width of individual income tax brackets. The personal exemption for each taxpayer increased from $1,950 for 1988 to $2,000 for 1989. As the result of indexing to reflect the effects of previous inflation, the width of tax brackets increased by approximately 4.1 percent between 1988 and 1989.510 Taxpayers age 65 or over (and taxpayers who are blind) are entitled to a larger standard deduction than other taxpayers. For 1989, each taxpayer who is at least 65 years old and single ia entitled to an extra $750 standard deduction. Each married taxpayer over 65 is entitled to an extra $600 standard deduction so that a married couple, both over age 65, is entitled to an extra $1,200. Including the extra standard deduction anounts cited above and the basic standard deduction amounts which were adjusted for the effects of inflation, taxpayers over age 65 were entitled to the following standard deductions for tax year 1989: $3,850 for a \"single\" taxpayer; $5,300 for a to claim \"unmarried head of household' status; $5,800 for a married couple filing a joint tax return, if only one is over age 65; and $6,400 for a married couple filing jointly if both are over age 65. Two other special tax provisions for the elderly were retained for 1989: the tax credit for the elderly (and permanently disabled); and the one-time exclusion of the first $125,000 of profit from the sale of the personal residence of a taxpayer over age 55. Under legislation enacted in 1988, Medicare benefits were to be expanded signifi- cantly, primarily ro provide coverage for catastrophic medical expenses, and begin- ning in 1989, monthly Medicare premiums were to increase and a new supplemental Medicare premium was to be imposed. The supplemental premium was to be based on the recipient's Federal income tax liability and was to be collected through the Federal income tax system. The Department of the Treasury developed the tax forms and instructions for collecting the supplemental premium, distributed such information to the public, and included the new instructions and tax forms in the income tax packages prepared for mailing to all taxpayers. Near the close of 1989, legislation repealed most of the expansion of catastrophic benefits as well as the supplemental Medicare premium for 1989 and future years. The increase in the basic Medicare premium was retained for 1989 but repealed thereafter. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AcTIVITIES AFFECrING THE AGED The Internal Revenue Service (MIS) recognizes the importance and the special concerns-of older Americans, a group that will comprise an increasing proportion of the population in the decades ahead. IRS also continues to make special efforts to inform those individuals who, because of immobility, impaired health, or other fac- tors, may miss out on benefits to. which they are entitled. The major programs in this effort are described below. -The focus of the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TWE) Program is free, conven- ient, tax assistance to persons age 60 and older. The IRS enters into cooperative agreements with public and private nonprofit organizations (sponsors) whose members will be IRS-trained and then act as volunteer tax assistors. Although the service is free under the cooperative agreements; volunteers are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred while traveling to community assist- ance sites or residences for the elderly. In fiscal year 1986, the TCE Program was expanded to include telephone service. Sponsors were given the option to operate telephone answering sites to assist the elderly with tax questions, help with forms, or schedule appointments. IRS assistance to older Americans through the TCE program has been growing since the program's inception in 1980. Nearly 28,000 volunteers helped 1.3 million persons during fiscal year 1989. -Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program provides tax assistance to tar- geted groups including the elderly. The IRS trains volunteers who offer their services to taxpayers needing assistance. This service is free and many VITA volunteers also help the elderly in preparing their state and local returns and answering their questions. In addition, volunteers helped-elderly taxpayers to compute their estimated tax for the upcoming tax filing season. In 1989, volun- teers were trained to assist the elderly in computing the Supplemental Medi- care Premium. During fiscal year 1989, some 49,000 volunteers helped more than 1.3 million taxpayers: The IRS is studying whether volunteers training can be enhanced. -The Small Business Workshop Program provides information about business taxes and the responsibilities of operating a small business. Through a unique partnership between IRS and over 1,100 community colleges, universities, and business associations across the country, small business associations across the country, small business owners and other self-employed persons have an oppor- tunity to learn what they need to know about business taxes. Because assist- ance is offered at convenient community locations and suitable times, the elder- ly can avail themselves of this Service, and do, when beginning second careers.511 In fiscal year 1989, some 62,000 small business taxpayers attended nearly 1,400Program workshops. -As part of the Bank, Post Office, and Library Program (BPOL), the IRS supplies14,600 libraries nationwide with free tax aids such as reproducible tax forms,reference publications, and audiovisual materials that can assist the aged inpreparing Forms 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ and related schedules. Also, banks andpost offices distribute the Form 1040 family and related schedules.-The Community Outreach Tax Education Program provides individuals withgroup income tax return preparation assistance and tax education seminars. IRS employees and trained volunteers conduct these seminars, which address avariety of topics, for groups and individuals with common tax interests, such asthe aged. These seminars are conducted at community locations. Nearly 1 mil-lion people attended almost 9,000 Outreach sessions and seminars in fiscal year 1989. The Internal Revenue Service issues a large number of taxpayer information ma-terials for dissemination to the media for the public through field offices and nation-al media. These materials which contain specific information for the elderly includeIRS publications, taxpayer information materials, drop-in public service advertise-ments, and tax supplements as described below:-Publication 910, \"Guide to Free Tax Services,\" describes the free tax servicesavailable from the Internal Revenue Service. The publication includes informa-tion on free tax publications; toll-free telephone service, including recorded taxinformation and automated refund information; education programs, such asSmall Business Workshops; and films that are available for loans to groups. Italso contains tips on filing tax returns, information about IRS programs such aselectronic tax filing and the Problem Resolution Program, and other informa- tion, such as how to check the status of a refund. A list of toll-free phone num-bers, Tele-Tax phone numbers, subjects, and tape numbers, and instructions forusing the Automated Refund Information Systems are included. The following are publications that older Americans may order:-Publication 523, \"Tax Information on Selling Your Home,\" provides that per-sons 55 years of age or older are allowed a once-in-a-lifetime exclusion of up to$125,000 of the gain on the sale of their personal residence.-Publication 524, \"Credit for the Elderly or Disabled\", provides that individuals 65 and over are able to take the Credit for the Elderly or Disabled, reducingtaxes owed. In addition, individuals under 65 who retire with a permanent dis-ability and receive taxable income from a public or private employer because ofthat disability will be eligible for the credit. -Publication 554, \"Tax Information for Older Americans,\" provides that singletaxpayers age 65 and over are not required to file a federal income tax returnunless their gross income for the year was $5,700 or more (as compared to $4,950 or more for single taxpayers under age (65). Married taxpayers who couldfile a joint return are not required to file unless their joint gross income for theyear was $9,500 or more if one of the spouses is 65 or over, or $10,000 if bothspouses are 65 or over. -Publication 721, \"Comprehensive Tax Guide to U.S. Civil Service RetirementBenefits,\" and Publication 575, \"Pension and Annuity Income\" provides infor-mation on the tax treatment of retirement income.-Publication 907, \"Tax Information for Handicapped and Disabled Individuals,\"covers tax issues of particular interest to handicapped and disabled persons andto taxpayers with disabled dependents. -Publication 915, \"Social Security Benefits and Equivalent Railroad RetirementBenefits,\" assists taxpayers in determining the taxability, if any, of benefits re-ceived from Social Security and Tier I Railroad Retirement. All publications ame available free of charge. They can be obtained from IRS byusing the order forms found in Publication 910, the tax forms packages or by callingthe IRS Tax Forms number listed in the telephone directory. Many libraries, banks, and post offices stock the most frequently requested forms, schedules, instructions,and publications for taxpayers to come in and pick up. In addition, many librariesstock a reference set of IRS publications and a set of reproducible tax forms.Taxpayer Information materials are continually being developed, updated, anddistributed to field Public Affairs offices for release to thousands of news media out-lets nationwide. Tax subjects covered in these releases include:-Once-in-a-lifetime exclusion or gain on sale of residence.-Higher standard deduction for 65 and over.-Federal tax withholding on pension payments.-IRS cautions senior citizens about fraudulent tax schemes.512 -Reviewing tax status of pensions, annuities by retirees. -Special tax advice for senior citizens. -Retired taxpayers and estimated tax payments. -Taxability of some social security benefits. (Also in Spanish) -Tax Counseling for the Elderly. (Also in Spanish) -Taxpayer assistance. (Also In Spanish) -Publication 910. -Availability of free tax help for senior citizens. -Community Outreach Tax Assistance (Outreach). -Older Taxpayers' need to file, or not to file tax returns. -Medicare catastrophic premium. -Tax benefits for the handicapped and disabled. The annual Tax Supplement is prepared and distributed to newspapers across the country. The Tax Supplement contains camera ready articles and graphics designed for immediate use. Some of the articles contain information specifically geared to older taxpayers. In 1989, over 5,600 newspapers printed Tax Supplement Informa- tion during the filing season, reaching approximately 53:2 million taxpayers. The IRS uses electronic media, including television, radio, cable, and videotapes to communicate information of interest to the older Americans. Some programs are distributed through electronic media and organizations targeted specifically to the aged. Following are important examples of this service: -The PBS Tax Clinic broadcast on February 5, 1989, and viewed by 4.5 million, contained information of special interest to older Americans. The IRS tax assist- ance phone lines were staffed during the program so that viewers could call with their tax questions. \"Llego la Hora,\" the Spanish language tax clinic, reached 1.2 million viewers when it was aired on the Inivision Television Network in March 1989. It includ- ed information of particular interest to older Americans, and like the PBS Clinic, had toll-free telephone assistance available during the broadcast and for one hour afterward. -A newly produced series called \"Tax Tips and Tapes\" contains 19 films 13Y2- minutes each designed to impart tax information to specific groups of taxpay- ers. One of the tapes provides information relevant to older Americans and is available in Spanish. -IRS-produced radio and television call-in programs and panel discussion shows are used to inform Older Americans about tax on pension income, estimated tax, the Credit for the Elderly as well as other topics of interest to older Ameri- cans. -IRS-produced radio and TV vignettes in contemporary, Spanish and country for- mats, also covered older American issues. Activities in the area of tax forms, development of special interest to older taxpay- ers in fiscal year 1989 include instructions for Schedule R (Form 1040), \"Credit for the Elderly or Disabled.\" These instructions include information regarding the income levels at which taxpayers may not be able to take the credit. This informa- tion was included to make it easier for taxpayers to determine if they qualify for the credit. OTHER TREASURY ACTIVIT7sS AFFECrING THE AGED Other agencies of the Treasury also have an impact on the elderly as part of their specific functions. Developments during 1989 are summarized below: -The Financial Management Service recognizes.that receiving Federal payments on time is critical to a number of older Americans, especially those who may be living on a fixed income. The Service is proud of its on-time delivery rate for all payments issued during fiscal year 1989. The direct Deposit Program -is a key factor that allows Financial Management Service to meet its goal of making payments timely. Following is a summary of activities associated with this pro- gram: The Financial Management Service- continues to promote the benefits- of Direct Deposit/Electronic Funds -Transfer throughDirect WMail' advertising. During 1989, the Financial Management Service enclosed -inserts with recurring benefit checks (e.g., Civil Service Retirement, Veteran. Affairs Compensation/ Pension, Social Security) issued in May and September. In February; June, and August, A Direct Deposit promotional message appeared on the back of check envelopes for all benefit checks. Check inserts and check' envelope messages serve as marketing aids to promote the convenience, safety, and reliability of513 depositing Government payments into personal checking or savings accounts by using Direct Deposit. The Financial Management service has continued to support the Social Secu-rity Administration's Direct Deposit enrollment initiatives by developing and distributing specific promotional materials for the Social Security Administra-tion's district offices nationwide. The district offices, in turn, will provide mate- rials to benefit recipients. On January 3, 1989, the Financial Management Service and the Social Securi- ty Administration tested the use of the Automated Clearing House Prearranged Payment and Deposit Plus Special Type \"05\" Addenda (PPD+) Format, to transmit the 1989 cost-of-living adjustment notices and payments to Social Secu- rity Direct Deposit beneficiaries. The test was conducted with Direct Deposit Social Security payments sent to a portion of Chase Manhattan Bank custom- ers. The test results were favorable, and warranted expanding the test. In De- cember 1989 and January 1990, the PPD+ Format will transmit 1990 cost-of- living adjustment notices, along with the payment to a test area which includes Social Security Direct Deposit beneficiaries in the South Carolina and New York Automated Clearing House areas, and the Chase Manhattan Bank and its customers. The Electronic Benefits Service Program is the first federal attempt to coordi- nate activity for the electronic delivery of benefits. Individual agencies at the Federal, State, and local level have undertaken a variety of pilots which showthat plastic access cards can be used successfully to deliver benefits. In Novem- ber 1989, the Financial Management Service and the Social Security Adminis-tration initiated the first test to distribute Supplemental Security Income bene- fits electronically through ATMs and point-of -sale terminals in the Baltimore, MD, area. Security Income check recipients in Baltimore will use a \"Secure- Card\" to withdraw monthly benefits from the MOST ATM network and point- of-sale terminals, free of charge. Supplemental Security Income check recipients were targeted for this test because approximately 50 percent of these recipients have no banking relationship. The evaluation of the test will help the Financial Management Service and the Social Security Administration determine wheth- er offering the Electronic Benefit Service as an option to the unbanked Supple-mental Security Income benefit check recipients is feasible. In 1989, the Financial Management Service formalized a \"Relations Manage- ment Project\", focused on increasing awareness about Direct Deposit initiativeswith several consumer groups. As part of these efforts, the Financial Manage- ment Service began actively working with the American Association of Retired Persons, to consider joint ventures to assess and satisfy mutual customer needs. The Financial Management Service provided suggested questions for a surveythat the American Association for Retired Persons is conducting. The results ofthis survey should provide information on concerns about the Government's payment. In addition, feedback from the survey will be used to develop aware- ness materials for seniors and to identify areas in which payment systems can be modified. The Financial Management Service also worked with the Consumer Informa- tion Center to provide information for public service radio spots about Direct Deposit. The public service announcements were distributed to over 4300 radiostations across the United States, with 668 announcements being provided in Spanish. The Financial Management Service has continued to supprt the National Crime Prevention Coalition's crime prevention awareness efforts in meetings with older Americans, by providing Direct Deposit marketing materials. The Financial Management Service was featured in articles about Direct De- posit in Milestones, Philadelphia's first newspaper for older Americans. The ar- ticles appeared in the September and October issues of the newspaper. Also, in 1989, the Financial Management Service's seven regional Customer Assistance Staffs engaged in numerous activities promoting Direct Deposit, as well as the features of the Limited Payability legislation to older Americans. The staffs met with Senior Citizens Organizations, displayed exhibits at seniors functions, and provided marketing materials to state Departments on Aging. The U.S. Savings Bonds Division provides millions of older Americans with important tax and interest rate information on a regular basis throughout the year in a variety of ways. Through its convenient, toll-free information service (1-800-US Bonds) more than 660,000 callers, including the elderly, received cur- rent information and assistance during fiscal year 1989. Also during the year,the Division continued its easy-to-purchase mail order program via IRS refund514 checks that resulted in Bond sales of $13 million, a 300 percent increase 'over fiscal year 1988. In addition, milions of older Americans were kept informed of the Bond program through closely coordinated efforts with large national orga- nizations such. as AARP, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and many other groups. Fi- nally, all our promotional materials and media advertising contain specific ref- erences to the benefits of Savings Bonds in retirement. Beginning October 1988, Public Debt initiated a project to locate investors owning matured registered securities which have not been presented for pay- ment. The investors contacted were reminded that they held matured securities, that the securities were not paying interest, and where the securities could be presented for payment. Those investors unable to locate their securities were advised to file claims with the Bureau of the Public Debt. Some securities were owned by elderly individuals who simply forgot they owned securities, and made no attempt to redeem their securities or contact the Treasury as to what action should be taken. This initiative will assist elderly individuals in redeem- ing lost or forgotten securities. In March 1989, Public Debt installed a new menu driven telephone system. The new multi-line, multi-function voice response system offers callers a selec- tion of message recordings concerning general and specific information about Treasury securities. The same menu options are available for both touch-tone and rotary callers. Touch-tone callers punch in a code for the specific informa- tion requested while rotary callers make their election of message by respond- ing \"Yes, I would\" at the end of the question. The recordings are very clear and offer the caller the opportunity to talk to an analyst if the caller needs further assistance. The quality of the recordings and the opportunity to obtain this in- formation 24 hours a day is particularly helpful to elderly investors, many of whom are physically unable or find it very difficult to make personal visits or telephone calls at normal office hours. The titles of the TREASURY DIRECT Reinvestment forms were revised to in- clude the type of security reinvested. This will assist elderly individuals in se- lecting the correct form and will improve the services provided to investors. Initiative in the Savings Bond Program: -During fiscal year 1989, Public Debt's Savings Bond Program implemented elec- tronic deposit of interest payments for newly issued HH bonds. This initiative allows all participants, including the elderly, to realize the benefit of having their semi-annual interest payments deposited immediately to their account(s). -Along with the electronic deposit of interest payment initiative, two associated forms were revised to simplify completion by making the forms easier to read, furnishing clearer instructions, and specifically designating the areas where in- formation is required. This redesign should be especially beneficial to the elder- ly as these forms are now obviously easier to read and complete. -It is planned that in fiscal year 1990, all other forms associated with the resis- suance of HH bonds will be redesigned in s similar manner. The redesigned forms will simplify completion by all participants, including the elderly, in the Savings Bond Program. The method of specifically identifying the required in- formation areas by using large white boxes on a colored background, is especial- ly beneficial to those aged with sight difficulties, as these essential areas stand out on the form. -In July 1989, Public Debt announced a final maturity policy for savings bonds. The new \"40-30-20\" policy for savings bonds is of interest to elderly individuals because now they can determine when their bonds cease earning interest based on the anniversary dates of their bonds. Series E bonds issued before December 1965 sto earning interest on their 40th anniversary. After December 1965, Series E, Series EE, Series H, and Savings Notes stop earning interest on their 30th anniversary. Series HH bonds stop earning interest on their 20th anniver- sary. -The Office of Consumer Affairs continues to serve as the liaison between the Department of the Treasury and individual senior citizens and senior citizen or- ganizations, assisting them in determining which office or department can best answer their questions or help to solve their problems. This Office works with groups concerned with seniro citizens and issues tha affect the elderly. -During 1989, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. (OCC) continued its active liaison with national based organizations including the American Asso- ciation of Retired Persons to share information about banking related issues. Additionally, during 1989 0CC district offices continued their outreach pro- grams for purposes of contacting and meeting with local consumer and commu-515 nity groups to share information about banking related issues. Organizations representing the elderly were among those contacted. In October 1989 the OCC sponsored a roundtable for national bankers to en- courage them to voluntarily provide basic banking services to customers. These customers may include low- and moderate-income, young, retired, or other cus- tomers who may be unable to meet customary minimum balance requirements or pay regular charges associated with some conventional banking services. The OCC continued to enforce the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regula- tion B as part of its responsibility for ensuring a high level of compliance with law by national banks. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act is particularly rele- vant because it prohibits discrimination in credit transactions because of age, provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract. En- forcement of the law is carried out during examinations of national banks. The OCC also is responsible for resolving complaints against national banks. Through the first 9 months of 1989, the OCC received over 10,000 complaints. Older Americans seek OCC's assistance in resolving problems with their bank.-The Treasury Department continued to protect elderly recipients of Govern- ment payments through the vigilance of the Secret Service. During fiscal year 1989, the Secret Service closed 45,084 Social Security check forgery cases and 4,603 Supplemental Security Income forgery cases. In addition, the Secret Serv- ice close 2,644 check forgeries involving Veterans' benefits, 1,342 check forgeriesinvolving Railroad Retirement Checks, and 12,652 check forgeries involving In- ternal Revenue Checks. The majority of these checks were issued to retirees. The forger was identified in 90 percent of all the cases involving check forgery. The Secret Service also conducted over 11,500 investigations involving at- tempts by individuals to illegally divert funds during the direct deposit/elec- tronic funds transfer process. Elderly Americans have been encouraged to uti- lize the electronic transfer process as a matter of convenience and as a safe- guard against the loss of funds. The efforts of the Secret Service protect elderly Americans against financial losses during the electronic transfer process. -The Bureau of Engraving and Printing continued to recognize the special needs of aging citizens during 1989. Services to assist senior citizens who tour the bureau's Visitor Center includ- ed: -Tour guides to assist senior citizens with special needs; -Wheel chairs as needed for those senior citizens touring the facility; -Ramps and wide entrances for those using wheel chairs or walkers; and -Rest rooms designed to accommodate persons using wheel chairs or walkers. The Bureau provides CPR training on an on-going basis to the tour staff, med- ical and police units in the event that an emergency involving a senior citizen should occur. The Bureau also continues to engage in initiatives related to training for itsaging employees. The Pre-Retirement Program is for persons 50 years of age and over. The Pro- gram, also open to spouses, emphasizes the importance of planning for retire- ment in advance. It is offered to employees who are planning to retire within the next 5 years and covers such areas as: Calculation of benefits, financial planning, discovering hidden talents, legal affairs, relationships, and health. The Bureau's on-site medical staff provides Life-Style counseling for senior citizens. The emphasis is on wellness, prevention of disease, and includes advice on nutrition and weight control, testing of blood pressure and cholesterol level, and examinations of possible vision and hearing deficiencies. -Bureaus are expanding their pre-retirement planning seminar programs. The seminars, which are offered to employees nearing retirement, generally include information on retirement and other Federal benefits; health and fitness; retire- ment housing; retirement investments; taxes (individual and estate); and other topics of interest to older persons. Dependent care, a term which generally connotes the need for adequate care for a worker's dependents, has become an issue of interest within Treasury. De- pendent care includes not only daycare for children, but also some degree of custodial care for elderly dependents who are incapable of fully independent living. Bureau Employee Assistance Program staffs are learning more about the problems associated with dependent care needs and are identifying appropriate community support services to assist employees with such concerns. The Federal Employees' Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1979 continues to provide employment opportunities for older Americans, as well as other516 groups interested in less than full-time employment. Older Americans are a spe- cial target group for recruitment efforts to fill positions created under the Act. Vigorous enforcement of the age discrimination statues by the Department continued to protect the interests of Older Americans. The Office of Equal Op- portunity Programs is responsible for adjudicating complaints of age discrimina- tion from both Treasury employees and applicants for employment. -The Customs Service does not specifically target the aged for expedited customs processing. However, the aged are included among those who are entitled to re- quest special treatment when they arrive from abroad; Besides the elderly, that group includes persons who are handicapped or ill and are unable to wait in line, a parent arriving with several infants, and person returning home for emergency reasons such as. a death in the family. Any traveler meeting any of the above criteria may request to speak with a customs supervisor as soon as he or she arrives in the Customs area of the airport or other Customs port of arriv- al. The supervisor will provide all possible assistance in expediting the travel- er's Customs clearance without, of course, compromising Customs enforcement responsibilities. In addition, Customs works with the General Services Administration and local port authorities to insure that. inspection facilities, including restrooms, permit the easy movement of persons who must use a wheelchair or walker. Customs places a high priority on the tactful and courteous treatment of trav- elers. Although that policy is not limitedto our treatment of the elderly, it may be of particular importance to people who have found it difficult to undergo a long, tiring flight from overseas and then must undergo immigration and cus- toms processing. ITEM 14. ACTION -DECEMBER 12, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your letter of October 11, 1989, requesting ACTION's report on our 1989 accomplishments for the next issue of Developments in Aging. In FY 1989, there was expanded emphasis in the Senior Companion Program for visually impaired seniors to both become volunteers and to be served by Compan- ions. Foster Grandparents continued activity in the wide range of care and services to special needs children and the Retired Senior Volunteer Program expanded its intergenerational volunteer opportunities. The examples provided in the enclosed report demonstrate that the more than 430,000 senior volunteers supported by ACTION programs. make a significant and valuable contribution-to their communities and to the Nation. I greatly appreciate this opportunity to submit the FY 1989 report on ACTION's Older American Volunteer Programs. Sincerely, JANE A. KENNY, Director. Enclosure. FosTER GRANDPARENr PROGRAM IN FiscAL YEAR 1989 The Foster Grandparent Program (FGP) is one of the most successful and respect- ed volunteer efforts in the United States. Through FGP, low-income persons aged 60 and older provide person-to-person service to children with special or exceptional needs. The program's budget for FY 1989 was $58.9 million. In FY 1989, there were 264 ACTION-funded FGP projects in all 50 States, the Dis- trict of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In addition, there were 12 projects totally supported by State funds. Program services are now provided in some 685 counties nationwide. Nearly 26,400 volunteers contributed about 21 million hours assisting children suffering from various handicaps, including abuse and neglect, behavior disorders, teen pregnancy, -substance abuse, mental retardation, specific learning disability, and juvenile delinquency. Foster Grandparents assist approximately 71,000 children every day. They serve 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. The program provides certain direct benefits to these low-income volunteers, including a stipend of $2.20 per hour, transportation and meal assistance when needed, insurance protection, and an annual physical exami- nation. Foster Grandparent services are provided through designated volunteer sta- tions in public agencies and private nonprofit organizations. They include schools,517 hospitals, juvenile detention centers, Head Start programs, shelters for neglected children, State schools for the mentally retarded, and drug abuse rehabilitation cen- ters. PROJECT EXAMPLES Tampa, Florida.-At Beach Place, a residential group home in Tampa for drug abusers, juvenile delinquents and runaways, four Foster Grandparents provide a positive role model for youth who often have difficulties relating to grown-ups. They discuss problems, assist with recreational activities and help with school work. Five other Foster Grandparents work at Roosevelt High School, a school with a high ab- sentee rate due to drug abuse. Working with children, many of whom come from Hispanic and migrant families, the Foster Grandparents provide support and a will- ingness to listen so as to help these youth develop critical self-esteem. Paola, Kansas.-Four Foster Grandparents work with mentally retarded youthunder 21 at a nonprofit gift/thrift shop. The shop provides retailing and business opportunities for youth who have already participated in a sheltered workshop pro- gram. The Foster Grandparents help their young clients learn to meet the public and to interact appropriately with customers and peers, thus developing experience in the world of work. Whitfield, Mississippi-Six Foster Grandparents serve at the Shelter for Battered Families in Hinds County, MS. Working with abused and neglected children, the Foster Grandparents provide one-to-one attention to at-risk children whose mothers are often unable to be supportive due to their own emotional upheaval. The Grand-parents work with children who are too young for school. They work with children in a day care program and with toddlers in a nursery. New FGP Projects In FY 1989, ACTION awarded 12 new FGP projects in the South and Southwest. These new projects will focus volunteer resources on children identified as being at- risk of substance abuse, physical/sexual abuse, abandoned/neglected, juvenile delin- quency, status offenders, and other similar problems. The projects are located in: La Grange, GA; Black Mountain, Raleigh, Waynes-ville, Greensboro and NC; Fayetteville, TN; and Nederland, TX. These projects are budgeted to generate over 660 additional volunteer service years (VSYs). Non-ACTION Funding Some $24.1 million in non-ACTION funding was contributed to support FGP projects nationwide. About $13.5 million came from 49 State governments, either through direct appropriations or contributions from State-funded agencies. The bal-ance of $10.6 million was from county/city governments and private sector sources. Total non-ACTION project funds represented approximately 41 percent of the total Federal appropriation for FGP in 1989. This funding represents an increase of over $1 million from last year. Twelve non-ACTION funded FGP projects are operating in the Nation today: Seven in Michigan, one in Wisconsin, two in New Mexico, and two in Georgia.

There were 752 ACTION-funded projects and over 400,000 volunteers assigned to 43,000 community agencies nationwide, pro- viding 72,500,000 hours of service. RSVP volunteers serve in courts, schools, muse- umLs, libraries, hospices, hospitals, nursing homes, and a wide range of other public and private nonprofit organizations. Volunteers serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for, or provided with, transportation and other out-of-pocket ex- penses. All volunteers are covered by appropriate accident and liability insurance coverage. The program continues to expand its efforts to match resources to the diverse needs of hundreds of American communities by providing increased opportunities for retired.persons aged 60 and older to serve their communities on a regular basis in a variety of settings. Seven new projects with an eventual estimated 3,100 volun- teers were funded in FY 1989 in areas previously unserved by RSVP. A Family Caregivers Evaluation, published December 1988, conducted by Sociome- trics, Inc., of Washington, DC, included 67 RSVP projects which provided respite to caregivers residing with their care recipients. RSVP volunteers said they were very satisfied with their assignments and served an average of 16 hours per week. Per- sons served stated RSVP volunteers help them do things they would not usually do, relieve depression, and bring about better understanding with their family mem- bers. ACTION's current RSVP projects emphasize intergenerational activities, especial- ly with \"at-risk,\" literacy, substance abuse, and in-home care. PROJECr EXAMPLES Traverse City,-Mich' an.-Grand Traverse Probate Court volunteer program oper- ates in cooperation with RSVP volunteers and the school system. The Probate Court volunteer program recognized a need to intervene in schools with \"at-risk youth\". The schools called RSVP as a source of volunteers who could work during the day in the elementary schools. RSVP volunteers provide one-to-one tutoring in the school, as well as companionship and role depiction to young males who need the attention of male adults. Elementary school age children from single-parent families experi- encing abuse or neglect in the home, poor school performance and poor peer rela- tionships are factors which school personnel consider in selecting students eligible for the Learning Partners Program. Learning Partners Program provides extra cur- ricular events and outings for seniors and their young \"learning partners.\" For ex- ample, one RSVP volunteer who works with three young boys travels from another county in the summer and lives in town in the winter so he can be sure to make it to school on time. Omaha, Nebraska.-The. Volunteer Security Aid Program of the Omaha Housing Authority was launched in 1982 with a handful of RSVP volunteers. The program now involves over 200 volunteers who perform a variety of security related tasks in 12 senior citizen high rise buildings. Volunteers are specifically trained by the Omaha Police and Fire Divisions to respond to any given emergency situation with- out being placed in physical danger themselves. RSVP aides serve in shifts throughout a 14-hour day. Typically, one volunteer will keep watch of the emergency panel connected to each dwelling unit, another will monitor the entrance door to the lobby. Others will observe the parking lot from some vantage point inside the building, or walk the hallways, checking utility rooms and stairwells, and generally respond to persons in need. Volunteers have access to communications equipment for police and fire emergencies. The program is recognized by the Department of Housing and Urban Develop- ment nationally as one of the outstanding volunteer programs in the publicly assist- ed housing field, and it recently received a President's Volunteer Action Award Ci- tation. Rural Nevada.-The RSVP sponsored by the Nevada Association of Counties ex- tends to 15 rural counties-all of Nevada outside the two urbanized counties that519 include Las Vegas and Reno. One of the greatest needs, as in many other rural areas, is to supplement a support system for the homebound elderly, who often live isolated in remote areas. Recently, the RSVP extended its Home Companion Program (HCP) with the goal of maintaining the elderly of Nevada in their homes whenever possible. The HCP is designed to work with existing services. The emotional support provided by volun- teer companions supplement medical, home health, aging, and other social services, with their heavy caseloads. RSVP provides a key human ingredient to clients in Ne- vada's coordinated effort, and often assists those who do not meet the eligibility cri- teria required by other programs. The HCP has adopted its guidelines from ACTION's Senior Companion Program. RSVP volunteers perform specific tasks such as visitations, shopping, and preparing meals. RSVP now has 60 volunteers who have been specially trained to meet client needs. They are presently serving almost 150 elderly clients in 10 of the countries. Tubsa, OK.-RSVP volunteers are working with the automobile dealers associa- tion and the Police Department on project 'Car Brand It.\" One of the biggest car theft rings in the United States led to \"car branding,\" much like cattle branding became necessary in days when rustlers stole cattle from ranchers. The engine serial number is etched into each pane of glass in the vehicle, discouraging car thieves who are selling the stolen car intact and not willing to replace all windows. Two thousand were branded in 1988. INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS ACTION/RSVP awarded 15 18-month grants of $5,000 each to continue the RSVP Intergenerational Library Assistance Project. This effort was established under an agreement between ACTION and the National Commission on Libraries and Infor- mation Science. It will place an additional 300 RSVP volunteers in 15 new locations to assist public library staffs provide current services and plan new activities for children and youth who are using the library after school in increasing numbers. Working together in drama, music, travel, arts and crafts, and computer programs, as well as one-to-one assistance in homework, will promote positive intergenera- tional relationships between the children and the RSVP volunteers. NON-ACTION SUPPORT Projects have successfully generated non-ACTION resources to help expand and improve volunteer services. RSVP sponsors, their advisory councils and staff, have used imaginative and varied approaches to attract cash and in-kind contributions. RSVP's total non-ACTION support was $29.2 million by the start of calendar year 1989, an increase of 8.1 percent from the previous year. Non-ACTION support was 49 percent of the total funding for RSVP. PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING Forty-six percent of RSVP's non-ACTION funds comes from the local private sector. Private resources generated by RSVP projects totaled $13.4 million national- ly for 1988. This reflects an increase of 108 percent in annual private support since 1983. Much of this private support comes through the nonprofit community sector. United Way organizations now provide annual allocations to RSVP projects in 339 localities totaling over $3.4 million. Other cash and in-kind resources are provided by a myriad of community service, civic, and religious organizations, as well as through local fundraising events. Approximately $1.5 million of RSVP's total pri- vate support comes directly from the business and corporate sectors. This has in- creased each year and represents over 5 percent of RSVP's total non-ACTION sup- port. PUBLIC SECTOR FUNDING RSVP generates a significant portion of its non-ACTION support in cash and In- kind from the community where it operates in a \"funding partnership\" with that community. For example: -Almost thirty-seven percent of RSVP's non-ACTION funding comes through city/county governments.

The Companions provide person- al assistance and peer support, primarily to older adults. Clients served by Compan- ions are chronically homebound with physical and mental health limitations and at risk of institutonalization. Senior Companions strengthen their clients' capacity to live independently in the community. They also ease the transition from institu- tions back into the community. The program's appropriation for FY 1989 was $25.1 million, funding 142 projects and 7,200 volunteer service years nationwide. Senior Companions contributed ap- proximately 7.5 million hours assisting approximately 25,200 homebound clients. In FYU 1989, 27 non-ACTION funded projects in 12 States supported 1,787 Companions and served approximately 6,255 clients. PROJECr EXAMPLES Pittsburgh, Penns lvania.-During the 6 years Jean Moskowitz has been with the Senior Companion Program, this 81-year Pittsburgh woman has assisted the frail homebound elderly who need regular assistanceto retain their independence. She has carried a weekly caseload of five clients. Among the services she currently pro- vides are shopping, cooking, peer support and budget planning. On of her clients is blind. Her Jewish cultural background was particularly helpful in assisting an older handicapped Russian immigrant to negotiate the county health system and inte- grate into mainstream America. . Moskowitz received a special citation from the Governor of Pennsylvania and was featured in a Newsweek article on voluntarism. The Pittsburgh project is the second largest in the nation and is sponsored by the Allegheny County Department of Aging. In Providence, RI, a 75-year old female World War II veteran provides respite care to an older couple through the SCP Veterans Challenge Grant Program, an in- home service activity-that assists veterans discharged from VA Medical Centers. Through the Rhode Island Department of Elderly Affairs SCP, caregiving is di- rected to a 73-year-old man with' battlefield injuries which induced chronic diabetes and circulatory problems that left him homebound. The Companion assists with a range of motion activities and provides peer counseling that builds on shared combat experiences in World War II. The program also provides respite to the cli- ent's wife. She is able to leave the home to shop and visit friends during-the 3 days each week that the Companion visits their home. ',In Wasington, DC, a 67-year-old Companion serves two clients, both vision im- paired. One is totally blind. The other, a diabetic, is partially blind. The Companion takes his totally blind client on long walks, easing the burden on his wife who works full-time. The Companion reads to his partially blind client and recently worked with Goodwill Industries to completely furnish his apartment. Both clients were referred to the University of the District of Columbia SCP by the Columbia Light House for the Blind. SCP EVALUATION A Family Caregiver Services Evaluation of 48 Senior Companion projects,. pub- lished December 1988 and prepared by Sociometrics, Inc., of Washington,'DC, con- cluded that respite services provided by Senior Companions to primary-caregivers of homebound' elderly clients are much needed, provide a high cost 'benefit return,521 \"warranting both appreciation and expansion\". Three-quarters or more of the carerecipients surveyed in the research sample felt that caregivers seemed happier,have more time to do things that needed to be done, and have more time for them-selves. Slightly less than 50 percent of the care recipients felt that caregiversseemed less tense or upset, take better care of the elderly's physical needs, and havemore time to spend with them. ScP/AFB PARTNERSHIP GRANT In FY 1989, ACTION awarded the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB) a 2-year $219,540 Partnership Grant to operate a demonstration program involving vis-ually impaired Senior Companions to serve older visually handicapped clients intheir homes. Under the grant, SCP and AFB will name existing local SCP projects as sub-grantees to generate five volunteer service years at each of the sites, an equivalentof 100 hours of service per week for each site. Demonstrated ability to generate localfunds to continue these components after the 2-year funding period is a condition ofthe sub-grants. NON-AcTION FUNDING Over a 6-year period, non-ACTION funding support through State, and local gov-ernment agencies and from the private sector grew from $4.4 million in 1983 to$13.2 million in 1989. This is equivalent to 52 percent of the FY 1989 ACTION fundsallocated to SCP projects. In addition, 27 non-ACTION funded projects were operational in various parts ofthe country during the fiscal year. These projects are located in: New Jersey, NewYork, Ohio, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, New Mexico, Oklahoma, California,and Nevada.

COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS DEcEMBER 12, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to your letter to William Allen, then-Chairman of the Commission on Civil Rights, requesting information for yourannual report, Developments in Aging. During fiscal year 1989, the Commission continued to process complaints; of 1,373complaints received, 21 alleged discrimination on the basis of age and were referredto the appropriate agency. (The Commission is not authorized to investigate com-plaints, except for those alleging denial of voting rights.)In February 1989, the Commissioners approved a national office project to exam- ine discrimination against the elderly. Planned to begin in fiscal year 1990, theproject will explore the types of age discrimination recognized by the courts and ad-ministrative agencies and age discrimination in employment and the provision ofhealth care.522' Also in February, the Arkansas Advisory Committee to the Commission held a community forum in Little Rock, which resulted in a published summary report, Civil Rights Concerns of Older Americans. Forum participants provided information on such issues as physical and emotional abuse of nursing home residents and denial of their constitutional rights; restrictions on their ability to vote, discrimina- tion in employment, credit, insurance availability, and access to services; and the lack of availability of legal resources. If you have any questions regarding this information, please contact my office, 523-5571.MELvIN L..JEwznaN, Acting Staff Director. ITEM 16. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION OaroBER 31, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAImN: Thank you for your letter. of October 11, 1989, requesting that we submit a report to the Senate Special Committee on Aging about the Commission's activities to improve safety for older consumers. I have enclosed the report to be included.in \"Developments in Aging\" and appre- ciate the opportunity to submit this information. Sincerely,ANNE GRAHAM, Acting Chairman. Enclosure. REPoRT ON Acnrvrms To IMPROVE SAFTrY FOR OLDER CONSUMERS In 1989, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) continued to dis- tribute several publications developed in previous years to promote safety for older consumers. These publications include: \"Home Safety Checklist for Older Consumers,\" a room-by-room check of the home, identifying hazards and recommending ways to avoid injury. \"Product Safety and the Older. Consumer: What Manufacturers/Designers Need to Consider,\" a booklet for manufacturers and designers of products used by older people. The booklet identifies several design changes that would make consumer products safer for older people to use. \"What Smart Shoppers Know About Nightwear Safety,\" a brochure developed and distributed jointly by CPSC and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). The brochure encourages older consumers to look for sleepwear that is flame resistant. In addition, CPSC is working on three projects related to older consumers: \"Nightwear for the Elderly\" encourages the development of voluntary industry actions to make flame-resistant sleepwear available to older people. Appropriate flammability labeling is being considered. The goal is to help reduce deaths and burn injuries suffered by older consumers each year in sleepwear fires. An early result of this project was the development of the brochure 'What Smart Shoppers Know About Nightwear Safety,\" jointly distributed by CPSC and AARP. \"Vulnerable Populations\" will identify regulatory initiatives which CPSC could take in the 1990s to protect such vulnerable populations as children, the elderly, low-income groups, the handicapped, non-English speakers, and others from product hazards. The elderly (age 65 and up) were involved in about 7 percent of all emer- gency room-treated injuries last year, a proportion somewhat smaller than their representation in the U.S. population (about 12 percent). However, when accidental deaths were examined, CPSC found that the rate of fatal injury for persons over age 65 was more than double the rate for persons under age 65. \"Innovative Child-Resistant Packaging\" encourages the development of child-re- sistant packaging that is easier for older people to use but still child-resistant. CPSC has data demonstrating that child-resistant packaging can prevent childhood poison- ings. However, many adults (including older people) do not use child-resistant pack- aging because they find it physically difficult to use. The CPSC project demonstrates that safety packaging can be developed to be easier for older people to use while still child-resistant.523 ITEM 17. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY DBcaECO 8, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIaRAN: Thank you for your letter of October 11, 1989, requesting information regarding research on aging performed by the Environmental Protec- tion Agency. We consider this an important topic and participate wherever we can to contrib- ute to our knowledge about the effects of pollution on the aging process. A book edited by investigators from our Health Effects Research Laboratory (HERL), entitled \"Aging and Environmental Toxicology: Biological and Behavioral Perspectives,\" will be published by The Johns Hopkins University Press in early 1990. It is a state-of-the-art review and summary of the field of geriatric toxicology. The book examines how chemicals in the environment alter the aging process, and how the body's response to environmental chemicals change with age. Investigators at HERL have also been involved with the preparation of a mono- graph on \"Principals for Evaluating the Effects of Chemicals on Aged Populations\" for the World Health Organization's International Programme on Chemical Safety (WHO/IPCS). Background papers for this document are near completion and will be submitted to the WHO/IPCS staff for preparation of the final publication. It is an- ticipated that this document will be available in the latter part of 1990. We currently have one in-house project, also at HERL, evaluating the effects of xenobiotics on the reproductive systems in aging animals. This project has focused on the interaction between age-dependent pituitary gland function and exposure to environmental toxicants. In addition, studies evaluating alterations in pituitary function in the middle-aged female have been completed and the results presented at two professional meetings during the past year. Briefly, this research is designed to evaluate the influence of xenobiotics on delayed ovulation and normal develop- ment of the conceptus in the female during the later portion of her reproductive life span. Last year we reported that we had provided a grant to Dr. Deborah Drechsler- Parks at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to study pulmonary, metabol- ic, and ventilatory responses of older men and women to ozone and nitrogen oxide (R81-3049-03). The study period was to end in August 1989, but was extended with- out additional funds to the end of November 1989, in order to complete additional publications resulting from this research. The results from one group of studies were published in the Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association, 39:194-199, 1989, \"Adaptation by Older Individuals Repeatedly Exposed to 0.45 Parts per Mil- lion Ozone in Two Hours\" (copy enclosed). The manuscript containing the results from another study on aging men and women was submitted for publication in Ex- perimental Gerontology. Additional manuscripts will be prepared as the data are analyzed. I hope this information will be of use to you as you prepare your annual report on aging. Sincerely yours, WILLIA K. REILLY. Enclosure.524 JAPCA IID Repoatedy Eo 0.45 Part Votoo. (0 5 roro oNl) d 0 reports't have indicated that young adults have a reduced pulmonary function reoponoe to ozone exposure (0.) if they are exposed to a sufficient concentration of 03 for 3 to 6 consecutive days. In general, larger decrements in various measures of pulmonary function occur during or following the second consecutive 0s exposure day. This ex- aggerated pulmonary function response, if daily exposures mre continued, s generally followed by a decrease response over the next I to 3 days, such that most subjects no longer respond to Os exposure with pulmonary function decre- ments. Available evidene\"S further indicated that the lack of pulmonary function response noted above, persists for only a short time (ie. 3 to 7 days) once regular exposures to s conse. We recently rported7 on the pulmonary function re. sponses of a group of healthy older men and women (51-76 years of ae) exposed to 0.45 ppm 0 for 2 hours alternating 20-min work (minute ventilation -27 Ll and rest periods. tqahh0m.w a W 104Older men and women wore generally less responsive to Os than young adulta. Only four of the 16 subjects, bad decre- menbo in forced expiratory volume in I second (FEV,) of 7 percent or greater following the Os exposure. The most re- oponrive of these older subjects had decrements in FEVs comparable to those observed in h healthy young adult of only \"averege\" responsiveneas (ie., 10-15 percent). Earlier, Schlenker and Jaeger' reported that consequent to resting. exposure to a combination of 0.5 ppm O and 0.5 ppm sulfur dioxide, older subjects (73 k 7.7 years) had no significant responses in any pulmonary function measure, in contrast to signifiant decrements in younger individuals (25.5 * 4 years). Recently, Reiseauer et all reported that older wom- en, but not older men, had an increase in respiratory reos- tonce of 13 percent ns a consequence of being exposed for I hour (4wo 10-min exercise periods) to 0.3 ppm Os. Although single exposures to Os have not elicited large group mean cluonges in pulmonary function of older adults. repeated exposures might cause significant decrements in the pulmonary functions of older individuals. Reduced pul- monary function due to aging, and the increased incidence of various pulmonary diseases among many older adults, make any further reduction in pulmonary function due to sir pol- lution exposure a matter of concern. We tharfore, determined the pulmonary function re- sponses of a group of healthy older men and women over 60 years of age to 3 consecutive days of O exporure, and detcr- mined whether any decrease in the pulmonary function re- oponse toO observed, persisted over 2 days of non-exposure in a relatively low pollution air basin (Santa Barbara, Cali- fornia). tBothoclo Sixteen healthy nonsmoker betlween 60 and 89 years of oge volunteered to participate in this study (Table l). The purpose, attending risks and benefits of the study were ex- plained verbally and were given on a written form to each subject prior to bis/her voluntary consent to participate. The protocol and procedures were approved by the Universi- ty's Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects. Each potential subject was acreened by medical history, resting 12-lead electrocardiogram, a battery of clinical pul- monary function tests, and a submaximal exercise test. The oubjects participated in five experiments. AU exposures were at the same time of day for each individual subject. Th2 experimental schedule began on Tuesday with a 2-h control exposure to filtored air (FA). The subjects then participated in 2-h exposures to 0.45 ppm Os on Wednesday, Thursday ond Friday of the same week. They then returned to tb, laboratory on the following Monday, and were re-exposed ts 0.45 ppm Os for 2 houn to assess the effect of 2 days of non exposure.

During the 2-h expocures, the subjecto alternated 20-min periods of exercise (n -3) and 20-min periods of rest (n -3). Ten subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer (Monark) and esh on a motor-driven treadmill (Quinton) at a workload sufficient to induce a ventiLrtory minute volume (VE) of approximately 25 L In consideration of the age of the group, subjects wre given a choice of exercise equipment to facili. tate the subject's completion of the three exercise periods. The appropriate workload for each subject was determined during the preliminary screening submaximal exercise test. Inspired ventilation was measured during the last 3 min- utes of each exercise period by software integration of the flow signal from a Fleisch #3 pneumotachometer. the cal- bration of which was verified with a known volume of air delivered with a 3-L syringe. Resting ventilation was not measured. Mixed expired gases were sampled from a 3-L mixing chamber at 100 Hz and measured for oxygen (Servo- mex paramagnetic analyzer) and carbon dioxide (Beckman LB2) concentrations, which were averaged over 30-s epochL The analyzers were calibrated prior to and following each exposure with known gas concentrations. The electrocardio- gram was continuously monitored (Hewlett Packard 1500A), and heart rate wus recorded at 5-min intervals during exer- crise. Functional residual capacity (FRC was determined prior to, and immediately after each exposure bye helium dilution method on a *&S51, water-seal spirometer (W. E. Collins). Three forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers were recorded before exposure began, 5 minutes after each exercise period, and following the 2-h exposure on a rolling seal spirometer (Model 822, Ohio Medical) which was interfaced to a micro- proceesor (Spirotech 300), which analyzed and printed out the results of each testr A pulmonary function tets were performed with the subject in the etanding position.

The Os concentration used in this study, 0.45 ppm, is approximately at the third stage alert concentration (0.50 ppm) in the Southern California Air Basin. Although O concentrations of 0.45 ppm occur only occasionally, this concentration was chosen to be comparable with other pest wmrk. and as a concentration which was likely to elicit a response,whileminimiling irritationtthe iubject' Before and following each exposr, the subjects complet- ed a written questionnaire on which they mere asked to indicate whether or not theY experienced each of a list of 14 symptoms commonly associated with exercise and/or 03 ex- posure. Symptoms were rated for severity on a scale of zero to five. Data were analyzed as the absolute volume change be- tween pre- and post-exposure. The data analysis proceeded in several stages. The firust step, a one-way analysis of vari. ance comparing the changes between the FA and first Ox exposures, was to determine whether the initial Os exposure induced significant decrements in any pulmonary function. Following a positive roult, a three-way analysis of variance with repeted measures across btme period and exposure days with a grouping factor of sex, was performed. Where sgnificant factor interactions occurred (P < 0.01), a further analysis of the simple main effects and the Tukey multiple comparison procedure was performed to isolate the signifi- cant factor levelas In addition, subjects were classified as sensitive if the pro-poet percent change in FEm, on the first Os day wus 5 percent greater than the percent change in FA. Subsequent analysia of pre-peat changes were analyzed crou the 5 exposure days with a grouping factor-subject sensitivity.

Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEVI) and third sec- ond (FEVs) exhibited significant decrement. following the third measurement period-after 105 minutes of exposure The period 3 values relitive to the base line on the first (120 mL FEV,) and second 0, exposure (132 mL FEVW) dayswere significantly greater than period I values relative to ban line (-I and 59 mL for FEV, on the first and second 03 exposure days respectively), and different from the filtered air expo- sure (0 mL for FEV)). No difference in the group response for FVC. FEV, or FEVy between FA or the third or fourth day of 0, exposure was found. There were no significant changes in any other pulmonary function test parameters, including flow parameters (FEF25-75 percent.

(EEOC'S MISSION) The Office of Program Operations was created in 1982 to accomplish all ofEEOC's enforcement mandates embodied in the EEOC mission, with the exception ofmanaging litigation actions. The Director of the Office of Program Operations (OPO) serves as theprincipal advisor to the Chairman on equal employment opportunity administrativeenforcement and government affirmative action matters. The staff ensures theeffective and efficient management and implementation of the Commission'sadministrative enforcement and government affirmative action programs. Theimmediate office of the Program Director has overall supervisory, management andfiscal responsibility for the Office. OPO is comprised of a number of program areasin Headquarters and fifty field offices to carry out the enforcement activitiesassociated with EEOC's law enforcement mandate. OPO comprises the nucleus ofEEOC's ongoing program activity to assist individuals who are potential victims ofemployment discrimination. This report provides the status and accomplishments of OPO in fiscal year198g. The report is divided into five sections. An executive summary graphicallypresents the major accomplishments for the fiscal year. Following the summary,information is provided on the organizational structure, mission and functions ofOPO Headquarters and District Offices and overall OPO goals and objectives for1988. Accomplishments of each program are set forth in the final section of thereport, including more indepth descriptions of office activities. The appendixprovides supporting tables. 11. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Office of Program Operations (OPO) accomplished most of the goals andobjectives of its program related activities during the 1988 fiscal year. The Office.through its fifty field offices, clearly increased efficiency of operations andimproved the quality of its investigative product. Achievement of these statedobjectives resulted in higher productivity in charge resolutions, reduction of pendinginvestigative workload, full implementation of new investigative strategies, and anincrease in litigation activity. Agencywide initiatives on local workload management led to full implementationof uniform methods of monitoring and tracking charge investigations throughout thefield. Training in case management systems was provided to most District Officesduring FY 198. The measurable increase in the number of on-site investigationscompleted at respondents' facilities yielded better evidence obtained in shorter timeperiods. Field offices made great strides during FY 198g toward overall timeliness,efficiency, and quality in the charge resolution process and in reducing theAgency's workload to manageable proportions. OPO Headquarters components similarly achieved increased levels ofperformance in FY 1988 in support of field activities. These components performedat high levels of efficiency in systemic charge processing, review of fieldinvestigative findings, management of field operations, development of programrelated guidance, and provision of appropriate research for charge processingactivities throughout the year. The following pages graphically highlight these fieldand Headquarters accomplishments.

OFFICE OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS: AN OVERVIEW A. ORGANIZATION MISSION & FUNCTIONS Of COMPONE Ar PROGRAMS The Office of Program Operations (OPO) includes the Office of the Directorand five program areas structured to enable efficient realization of its goals andobjectives. The mission and component functions of each program are providedbelow. An organization chart, including the various divisions of each OPO program, isincluded on page 10. 1. Office of the Director-provides Overall direction, coordination, leadership andadministrative support to the OPO program areas and has supervisory, managementand fiscal responsibility for the Office of Program Operations. 2. Field Management Programs. East and West (FMP)-ensure effective and efficientoperation of field offices through operational oversight and monitoring of programimplementation, evaluation of performance, and provision and coordination ofadministrative services. Headquarters Field Management Programs are divided intoEast and West geographic regions for effective delivery of services, coordination,and communication of information. The field offices are charged with o enforcing the statutory responsibilities of the Commission throughinvestigation, determination and litigation of charges filed; and, o achieving timely and appropriate resolution of discrimination casesthrough the efficient administration and effective implementationof the various case processing systems. Under Field Management Programs, Districts are comprised of the following:I) Director, 2) Administrative Staff including Deputy Director, 3) EnforcementGroups including Charge Receipt and Technical Information Staff, Enforcement(General Investigative) Staff, and Systemic Investigative Staff, 4) Legal Staffdirected by Regional Attorneys, who are accountable to the General Counsel formanagement of litigation, 5) Federal Hearings and Affirmative Action Staff, and6) Area and Local Offices. The Directors of the Area and Local Offices aredirectly accountable to the District Director. 3. Systemic Investigations and Individual Compliance Programs (SIICP)-initiate,refine and recommend charge processing procedures, technical administrativesupport systems for systemic and individual charge investigation, and developintermittent instructions which assist field staff in the timely enforcement of TitleVI], EPA, and ADEA. SIICP investigate large systemic charges and providecase-by-case technical assistance to District Offices as they accomplish theirpattern and practice charge investigative responsibilities. SIICP are also chargedwith developing, monitoring and implementing the work-sharing relationships ofEEOC with the state and local Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs) andTribal Employment Rights Organizations (TEROs). 4. Federal Sector Programs (FSP)-provide leadership and guidance to Federalagencies on all aspects of the Federal Government's equal employment opportunityprogram in accordance with the specific laws enforced by EEOC. FSP developproposed policies and monitor implementation of approved affirmative employmentpolicies and programs designed to ensure hiring, placement and advancement ofminorities, women and handicapped individuals in she Federal Government. FSP alsohave oversight responsibility for Federal agency pre-appellate complaint processingprograms, with specific management responsibility at the hearing stage. S. Determinations Review Program (DRP)-reviews, upon requests of chargingparties, charge resolutions in which field staff has determined that there is noreasonable cause to believe the charges have merit. DRP's full review of chargeinvestigations is completed by both investigators and attorneys and may sustain thefield determination, cause the case to be remanded for further investigation, orcause reversal of the field determination by the Program Director. 6. Program Research and Surveys Staff (PRSS)-determines the quantitativeinformation required by OPO and the Commission in planning and carrying out theirfunctions This staff designs and conducts surveys of employment sectors; developsand maintains the necessary recordkeeping and reporting processes applicable to allemployers; analyzes data from employment sectors and from OPO field andHeadquarters offices to systematically identify trends in the area of equalemployment opportunity and in the Commission's administrative enforcement andpolicy and program needs.542 PRSS was a separate program staff during FY l98g that was merged with components of the Office of Performance Services in a September Headquarters reorganization. The new program is railed the Operations Research and Planning Programs (ORPP). In addition to the functions mentioned above, ORPP also provide long and short range planning systems from which OPO decisions regarding operational plans and goals, resource and staffing determinations, and workload distribtition may be made on a national and office-specific basis. 8 FISCAL iEAR 1988 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The Office Of Program Operations set three program goals and a number of objectives fur fiscal year 19)12 The three goals are summarized in the following statement and are supported by objeetiues emphasizing Program activities encompassed by each. TO ENSURE QUALrT. TIMELINESS. AND EFFECTIVENESS IN ALL OFFICE OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS' ACTIVFTES IN SUPPORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS IN BOTH THE FEDERAL AND PRIVATE SECTORS. SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVES: 1. -To implement uniform case management principles and systems for timely identification and resolution of problems and technical assistance for field offices charge processing activities and Federal hearings process. 2. To develop and implement appropriate review and oversight for identification and correction of problems, improved evaluation of performance and provision of technical assistance for field charge resolution activities and systemic charge processing. 3. To develop data management systems, research activities, and reporting systems to enhance statistical analyses in support of field charge resolution. agencywide charge/complaint processing, Federal complaint, processing and affirmative employment programs, and internal headquarters and field management decisions. 4. To develop and communicate policy and procedural guidance for field office compliance in private sector complaint processing and for Federal compliance in complaint processing systems, and in implementation of viable affirmative employment programs. 5. To develop and implement innovative techniques and approaches to enhance enforcement capabilities of state and local Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs), and Tribal Employment Rights Organizations (TEROs). 6. To implement training activities, designed to enhance the general public's knowledge of rights, respondents' knowledge of responsibilities, and FEPA staffs' ability ti perform. 7. To improve field/Headquarters communication and coordination. In February of 19gg, the Director of the Office Of Program Operations reviewed the goals and objectives set forth in the beginning of the fiscal year and reiterated, more specifically. additional program efforts required to meet those goals and objectives At that time, benchmarks for performance were set forth. numerically and qualitatively defining selected objectives (see Table I on page 14) The' most salient elements of that mid-year review focused on the need for OPO Field hAnagemcat Programs (East and West) to firmly establish quality and timely charge processing, increased productivity, reduction of inventory, and sound administrative enforcement in the field offices Recommendations were made to increase on-site management reviews and develop and provide office-specific assistance in correcting identified Problems. Field Management Programs Directors were instructed to develop workplans that would facilitate the on-site reviews and ensure a focus on general management activities, office communications, and labor-management relations in addition to a review of open and closed charge investigations and charge processing systems. One important aspect of this process was the review of the methodology used in the development of charge related information and coordination of these activities with administrative and legal staff within the Districts and the offices of Management and General Counsel at Headquarters. The thorough review of charge processing activities was mandated with clear directions regarding resolution of problem situations that tended to hinder accomplishment of the Agency's enforcement goals. Objectives to improve data analyses and utilization within OPO were designed to enhance charge processing activity, enhance utility of research in both Federal and Private sectors, and to enable comparative trend studies for special reporting projects. Other data concerns centered on field oversight of responsibilities and the need to increase the accuracy of charge processing data, submitted intermittently by field offices, for assessment of program performance. Other objectives focused on the development of cases for litigation at the level of Agency acceptability, including improved coordination with the Office of the General Counsel.543 TABLEI OFFICE OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS SELECTED PERFORMANCE INDICATORS .............................................................................

Therefore. the average processing time increased by 46 days. IV. FISCAL YEAR 1988 ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Office of Program Operations made great strides in the Agency's enforcement activities during fiscal year 1908. Most of the program objectives of the Headquarters and field components were met or exceeded during the period. Establishment of quality as a constant investigative objective, measurable reduction of pending inventories. productivity at expected levels, consistent managerial attention to resolution of aged cases, and reduction of the time required to reach decision in Federal hearings are goals to which the Agency has aspired for several years and which continue to represent the focus of managerial attention. The levels reached in these areas during FY 1988 make OPO look forward to FY 1989 with increased anticipation of continued progress toward mission accomplishment. In FY 1988, OPO was required to monitor and track charges received based on the new Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) and take various research, investigative, and reporting actions in response to the Age Discrimination Claims Assistance Act (ADCAA). These activities substantially increased OPO's workload and staff played a key role in ensuring complete and timely notification of rights to claimants and tracking and resolution of related charges. Two new Local Offices were added to Field Management Programs in 1988. Savannah (Atlanta District) and Honolulu (San Francisco District). The El Paso, Texas office was upgraded from a Local to an Area office and it became a part of the San Antonio, rather than the Dallas, District Office. During 1988, requisite Case Development Training was initiated and provided to several of the field offices. This training was designed to reinforce ways in which managers and supervisors can ensure that EEOC investigations meet the highest standard of quality. The philosophy conveyed in the course places increased emphasis on the affirmative role of supervisors and management in the management and development of cases. The training stresses that all levels of supervisors and managers must be actively involved in caseload planning and prioritization. as well as the development of the investigation, i.e., reading files as they are being developed and identifying substantive, procedural, or time/management problems in the investigative process. Most of the field offices received this training in FY 1988. The remainder will receive their training in the first quarter of FY 1989. Automation of all offices within OPO is an ongoing objective. The Charge Data System (CDS), a Commission initiative in 1986. became fully operational at the local level, providing for computerized management information systems in the field offices that enable staff to manage and access their own data. These efforts were also extended to the sixty-eight Fair Employment Practices Agencies that have the largest charge workloads. All equipment and software have been installed. Each office is provided the flexibility of developing additional software to aid in the544 overall database management effort. Districts completed hard inventory of active charges during the year in order to ensure a higher degree of accuracy of charge data entered into the CDS. CDS will enable OPO to fully integrate information on field and state and local enforcement activities A. FIELD MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS Field Management Programs (East and West) are responsible for managerial oversight of all field activities. Data reported from the field offices at the end of each quarter. as well as other periodic reports, are analyzed by FMP to determine the extent to which overall goals and objectives are being met. In fiscal year 1988, EEOC received 5S8.53 charges to process, a reduction of 5 percent from FY 1987. Of that number, almost 73 percent were filed under Title VII. while one-fourth were filed under The Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The remaining two percent of receipts to process were charging violations under the Equal Pay Act or were mixed charges. Productivity increased substantially in FY 1988 with the number of resolutions up 32 percent over FY 1987. Closures were higher than in any other fiscal year under review in this annual report. Concomitantly. pending inventory decreased by nearly thirteen percent (or, 7,900 charges) between FY 1987 and FY 1988. (See Figure 13.) Overall, resolutions made per investigator were up almost three percent. EEOC investigators resolved 80.4 cases on the average in FY 19S8, up from 78.4 in 1987 (see Table A10). In FY 1988, FEPAs closed approximately 40,000 Title VII charges and 5,000 ADEA charges. The FEPAs were responsible for processing nearly half of the charges/complaints filed by individuals under the statutes enforced by EEOC. FEPAs received just over 59,000 complaints to process in FY 1988, an increase of 10.5 percent over FY 1987. (See Figure 14.) Of the more than 45,000 FEPA closures. 11 percent were under ADEA and the remaining 89 percent were Title VII. Approximately 50 percent of closures for either ADEA or Title VI] were no reasonable cause closures. Nearly thirty percent were settlements or successful conciliations. Monetary benefits gained through both systemic and compliance activities in FY 1988 increased by 48 percent over FY 1987. FY 1988 compliance benefits increased by 36 percent over TY 1987. with a corresponding increase of 55 percent in the number of people benefitting from the actions. (See Figure 15.) Non-monetary benefits also increased. Non-monetary benefits may include changes in the mode and geographic area of company recruitment efforts, implementation of training programs, changes in promotion procedures for employees, provision of educational and business opportunities (e.g. developing joint programs with public school systems to stimulate interest and careers of female and minority youth and collegians in technical fields), more use of minority businesses and suppliers, expansion of apprenticeship and training programs. and diversity training for current company managers and supervisors The total number of merit resolutions increased by 31 percent between FY 1987 and FY 1988, an increase of approximately 2500 resolutions. Merit resolutions are settlements, withdrawals with benefits, successful conciliations, and unsuccessful conciliations (that arc forwarded to the Commission as litigation recommendations). The number of reasonable cause resolutions increased substantially from 1,412 in FY 1987 to 1,938 in FY 1981. a tbirty-seven percent increase. Field staff found no reasonable cause in 49.7 percent of the FY 1988 resolutions, as compared with 55.3 percent of resolutions in FY 1987. (See Figure 16.) The number of 'aged' cases in the pending inventory declined by four percent between FY 1987 and FY. 1988. This occurred even though the benchmark for measurement was changed. In FY 1987, 'aged' cases were defined as cases which were 300 or more days old, as compared with the standard of 270 or more days old in FY 1988. The field offices provided technical assistance and education programs to area employers, including 101 voluntary assistance program (VAP) presentations which instructed 6,337 individuals (representing 2,398 employers) of their rights and responsibilities under the statutes in FY 1988, enforcement activities resulted in 764 litigation recommendations forwarded to the Office of General Counsel (OGC). According to preliminary data from OGC, a total of 482 recommendations was approved, an 11 percent. increase over approvals in FY 1987. A record 554 suits were filed, including 115 subpoena enforcement actions. Sixty-nine percent of the direct suits and interventions, filed by the Commission, were for Title VtI violations and twenty-four percentwere for ADEA' violations. (Note: suits filed during a given year may include some which have been approved in prior fiscal years.)545 FMP emphasized uniform case management initiatives in the field offices.These efforts included the nationwide implementation of standardized computerprograms and reports and training of field supervisory staff in utilizing thesereports to monitor case management. Additional ongoing training, begun in FY19g8, focused on the importance of the role and participation of supervisory staffthroughout the investigatory process. These training programs were central to thefield's case management results attained in FY 19g8, including reduction ininventories improvement in the quality of charge processing and case tracking, andgeneral enhancement of charge processing operations. Frequent meetings between FMP and the Field Contact Division of Systemicand Individual Compliance Programs (SIICP) were held to (I) discuss meaningfulgoals and progress on systemic case investigations, (2) determine an organizedapproach to the effort. (3) collaborate on case processing, and (4) provideheadquarters input and guidance during the field's systemic investigatory process.This coordinated approach provided timely input to field offices' charge processingwhich translated into improved quality and quantity of systemic charge processing. On-site quality reviews were conducted by FMP staff in most of the fieldoffices during FY 1988. In prior years, much time was spent in reviewing case filesto ensure consistency in applying standard investigative procedures. In FY 19t88these visits also entailed a review of the quality of case processing from chargereceipt to case closure. FMP guidance was provided when efficiency problems werediscovered. R. SystEMIC INVESTIGATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL COMPLANCE PROGRAMS Systemic Investigations and Individual Comolijuce Programs (SIICP) areresponsible for identifying and inivestigating large pattern and practicediscrimination cases and providing technical guidance to the field concerning patternand practice and limited scope Commissioner charges prior to presentation to theCommissioners for approval. The Commission approved various actions in 51 systemic cases in FY 1988,compared with 30 in FY 1987, an increase of 70 percent. (See Figure 17.) Further,of those 51 case actions approved, 19 or 37 percent were final decisions on themerits of the case (as compared with 10 such decisions in FY 1987), 7 werewithdrawals, 9 were settlements, and 5 were conciliations. Eleven new charges wereinitiated since March of 19gg, while over 100 pattern and practice charges were inthe investigative process at fiscal year's end. Of the forty-four case actions (less withdrawals). 57 percent were in casesfiled by Commissioners who have served since 1982. Therefore, timelyadministrative enforcement of the statutes, in a quality manner. is becoming aplanned reality. FY 1988 was the first year that any systemic charge was Cullyinvestigated and decided during the tenure of the Commissioner who filed thecharge. A total of $9,617,935 was secured for affected individuals in FY 1988 systemicback-pay and other awards, an increase of 264 percent over the monetary benefitsof $2.639.300 gained in FY 1987. (See Figure It.) The field's positive approach ininvestigating systemic matters resulted in increased quality in alt aspects of thisprocess. SIICP also completed liaison activities with the Department of Justice in theprovision of innovative and effective techniques for problem solving in the TEROcase management training sessions. Justice participated in the training to explainthe government-wide effort to eliminate discrimination against Indians. A recordnumber of representatives from fifty-eight tribes attended these sessions. SIICP conducted the annual conference for Fair Employment Practices Agenciesjointly with the US. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Thisconference enabled FEPA representatives to gain a more complete perspective ofFederal anti-discrimination efforts and was the first successful joint effort in thisprogram area.546 ({o: EEOC/FEPA RECEIPTS PROCESS Thoo 140 10i am 198 1987 I vEEOC 14 I I = Fguuto 14547 Figure 16 Oe TVW AJS 4 A4)Monetary Benefits -Compliance 70, 60- 60- 40 - 30- 20 - 10 - 0 - FiguTeA15 (See TVI P.14) FY 88 APPROVED so s0 40 * 30 20 10 0 Figure 17 (Boo Tabb A lI) 108 -........... FEDERAL SECTOR PROGRAMS Federal Sector Programs (FSP) staff is responsible for providing the necessaryguidance and instruction to EEOC field staff who hold Federal complaint hearingsnationwide. Twenty-three percent more cases were closed through the FSP hearingsprocess in FY 1988 than in i9J7, resulting is a thirty-three percent reduction ofpending inventory ( a difference of nearly 1300 cases). (See Fagure 19.) Of the federal sector cases resolved through hearings in FY 1988. 9g percentwere individual complaints, including 36 percent (2,222) which were recommendeddecisions, 30 percent settlements, 17 percent remanded to the agencies, and 15percent withdrawn by the complainants. The remaining 2 percent were class actioncomplaints The average processing time to reach a recommended decision was 100 days.An average of 82 closures per administrative judge in FY 19BB represented anincrease of 12 percent over the prior year's figure of 73. (See Figure 20.) Bench decisions, enabling the administrative judge to make a decision directlyafter the hearing, became a reality in FY 19BB. This allowed the hearing transcriptto become the hearing decision, eliminating additional processing time, after thehearing, during which previous decisions had been written. FSP responded to approximately 8,200 telephone and written inquiries duringthe 1988 fiscal year. Of these, 30 percent were related to the AffirmativeEmployment Programs while 70 percent sought information regarding the Federalcomplaint system. Commission approval was obtained for the following management directives: o MD-713-'Affirmative Action for Hiring. Placement, and Advancement ofIndividuals with Handicaps'; o MD-714-'lnstructions for the Development and Submission of FederalAffirmative Employment Multi-Year Program Plans, Annual Accomplishment Reports,and Annual Plan Updates for FY 19B8 through FY 1992-; and, o MD-107-'Federal Sector Complaints Processing Manunl'. MD-712 was revised to provide guidance to agencies on conducting theirinternal program for individuals with handicaps. The revisions to 29 CFR 1613 became effective this fiscal year. Theserevisions provided for more effective remedics in the Federal complaint systemthrough addition of the Commissioner's expanded remedies policy. This policy addspreventive and curative relief, including the posting of notices when discriminationis found, to the Commission's previous relief definition which only provided forcorrective relief as full remedy. In FY 1988, FSP revised the mechanism to collect complaints processing datafrom Federal agencies. This was the first revision of this data collection method inten years. Additional efforts enabled FSP to computerizce complaints processingreports submitted by Federal agencies and conduct more definitive analyses of thedata. According to data reported to OPO's Federal Sectors Program staff during FY1988, the FY 1987 complaints filed with Federal agencies were down 12.3 percentover FY 1986. There was a corresponding decrease of 4.3 percent in pendinginventory. Federal agency closures were down 5.3 percent over 1986 figures. Feedback on MD 714 indicates positive responses to the flexibility given toagencies to focus on affirmative issues. It is expected that much attention will bepaid to internal progression of employees and identification of existing barriers thatimpede the advancement of selected groups during FY 1989. Staff guides, covering MD-712, 713, and 714, were issued for the evaluationand coordination of Federal affirmative employment programs for minorities, women,and individuals with handicaps. A number of agencies were reviewed to determinethe extent to which requirements set forth in MD-712 were being met. D. DETERMINATIONS REVIEW PROGRAM The Determinations Review Program (DRP) allows charging parties/complainantsto request a Headquarters' review of 'no reasonable cause' determinations issued byEEOC field offices. DRP 1987. In FY 19B8, itreceived 8,604 determinations for review or twenty-five percent of the 'no-cause'determinations issued by EEOC District directors in FY 1988. During FY 19B88DRP reviewed 5,559 field determinations. Sixty-two percent of the review requestswere filed under Title VII, followed by 36 percent for ADEA, and 2 percent whichincluded EPA and those with three or more concurrent charges.550 A total of 5,495 inventory items were closed. (See Figure 21.) Eighty-eight percent were closed by decision (based upon review) and 12 percent were closed administratively, including withdrawals, rejections. field office reevaluations, suits filed, or settlements. Approximately 99 percent of the cases decided by DRP in FY 19S8 sustained the field's 'no reasonable cause' determinations. Approximately five percent of the total charges reviewed (or 235) were remanded to the field offices for additional investigation. In addition, in some cases that were remanded, the Districts reversed their original determination or settled the case without further DRP review. E PROGRAM RESEARCH AND SURVEYS STAFF In FY 198g, the Program Research and Surveys Staff (PRSS) completed five major research reports using data collected through the surveys conducted by this office. Two major publications were produced, based on the Commission's survey data, and provide information on job patterns for minorities and women in private industry and state and local governments. PRSS also was given responsibility for developing' the' OPO-wide Data Management System, in support of Programmati efforts. Through this effort. OPO was able to generate a number of responses to requests from the Congress and staff related to ADEA enforcement Full completion of the OPO Data Management System during 1989 will allow EEOC to merge internal charge data, EEOC survey data, and external data bases to conduct relevant EEO research analyses and comparisons. Ten individual industry analyses were conducted by PRSS in FY1988 for use by District or Headquarters Offices to assist in specific case investigative activitiest This provided a successful means by which an office could establish more viable methods of identifying industrial employment problems of a systemic nature. During FY i9gg, PRSS also responded to inquiries for information from sources external to EEOC. Requests for information from the various employment surveys totalled 1,311. up from 1,100 in FY 1987, with a corresponding generation of 23,000 reports in response to these requests. Large volumes of data (either in hardcopy or tape format) were provided to the four federal agencies that are routine users of these data. In addition, over 30,000 private employer reports were provided to FEPAL This staff has now become a part of the larger OPO Operations Research and Planning Programs, resulting from a reorganization at the end of the 19gg fiscal year.

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION DECEMBER 21, 1989. DEAR CHAIRMAN PRYOR: We are pleased to respond to your-letter of October 11, 1989, requesting information on those activities of the Federal Communications Commission during fiscal year 1989 that affect the elderly, either directly or indi- rectly. A summary of Federal Communications Commission activities affecting the elder- ly is enclosed. We hope that this information will be useful to you and your staff and can be incorporated into the report of the Special Committee on Aging entitled Developments in Aging. During the past several years, in addition, the Commission has participated in leg- islative efforts and rulemaking proceedings designed specifically to help the handi- capped, which include the deaf and hearing impaired, the blind, and the physically disabled. A significant proportion of people age 65 or older fall into these categories. Our efforts to address the telecommunications needs of the handicapped are thus also a matter of interest to the elderly community. The Federal Communications Commission will continue to be cognizant of the needs of the handicapped and attentive to telecommunications matters which affect the lives of the elderly as we fulfill our mission to serve all Americans in the public interest. Sincerely, ALFRED C. SiKEs, Chairman. Enclosures. SUMMARY OF FEDERAL COMMUNIcATIONS COMMISSION AcTirriEs- AFFECTING THE ELDERLY One of the FCC&s basic goals has been to protect universal telephone service while promoting economically efficient use of the telephone network and preventing unjust discrimination. among the Nation's telephone users. We believe great progress has been made this year to encourage universal telephone service at rea- sonable rates. The FCC has taken several steps in the subscriber line charge proceeding, based on the recommendations of an -advisory group of Federal and State regulators, to assist-low and fixed income telephone subscribers. These measures include high cost assistance designed to keep local exchange rates lower than they otherwise would be in certain parts of the Nation. The Commission also has implemented a Federal lifeline program to reduce tele- phone charges for low income subscribers. Under this program, local telephone com- panies are able to waive the subscriber line charge for low income subscribers quali- fying under specified State assistance programs when the State makes an equal monetary contribution to reduce local exchange rates for these customers. Based on the current $3.50 subscriber line charge, qualifying subscribers can receive up to a total of $7 per month in assistance for qualifying. On April 16, 1987 the Commission also introduced a connection assistance pro- gram called \"Link-Up America,\" which provides a discount of 50 percent-up to $30-for connection charges to low income households seeking telephone service. The FCC estimates that approximately 3 million low income households, including many elderly, will be eligible for assistance under the program. In addition, tele- phone companies are encouraged to offer interest free deferred payment schedules on the remaining balance and, where appropriate, to reduce or to waive any deposit that may be required. Both the lifeline and high cost assistance programs are funded through usage- based charges paid by the long distance companies. To date, 27 States and the Dis- trict of Columbia have federally approved lifeline programs, and 39 States, the Dis- trict of Columbia and Puerto Rico have federally approved connection assistance programs. Most of the Bell Telephone companies also offer budget rate measured service with a very low flat monthly charge for basic service with additional usage- based charges. Further, as a result of the Commission's subscriber line charge program and other actions, direct dial interstate toll rates have dropped approximately 40 percent since May 1984. A January 1989 study by Southwestern Bell further demonstrates the value of these rate reductions to the elderly. The study shows that senior citizens have increased their long distance usage 92.6 percent since 1983 (before SLCs were557 in effect). This is well above the average residential subscribers usage increase of 72.2 percent. In addition, the Commission's Industry Analysis Division continues to monitor telephone penetration rates for the elderly as well as other segments of the popula- tion. Census Bureau data collected at the request of the FCC show that telephone subscribership has increased or remained stable since divestiture, even in the case of the unemployed and those with extremely low income levels. In fact, the Census Bureau data for July 1989 (the most recent information currently available) showthat 93.8 percent of American households have telephone service in their homes compared to 91.4 percent in November 1983, just prior to divestiture. The elderly in all income brackets have telephone subscribership levels that are significantly higher than those for households headed by younger people. The July 1989 census data indicated that 95.3 percent of households headed by a person be- tween 60 and 64 years of age had a telephone at home compared to 93.8 percent subscribership level of all households. Based on the July 1989 census data, 96.1 per- cent of households headed by someone between the ages of 65 and 69 subscribed to telephone service, while households headed by someone from 70 to 99 years of age had a subscribership rate of 96.5 percent. Subscribership levels for these groups have increased or remained stable since divestiture. The Commission also has been working with Congress and the Administration to monitor or implement legislation to ensure that hearing impaired persons, including the elderly, have reasonable access to the telephone network. The Telecommunications for the Disabled Act of 1982, 47 U.S.C. 610, passed Janu- ary 3, 1983, permits carriers to provide specialized customer premises equipment (CPE) to disabled persons under tariff or through other means authorized by State commissions. (The Act contemplates State enforcement of Commission rules regard- ing placement of specialized telephone equipment.) Further, the President signed the Hearing Aid Compatibility Act of 1988, Public Law 100-394, on August 17, 1988. This law requires most telephones manufactured in or imported into the United States more than 1 year after its enactment to be hearing aid compatible. On May 11, 1989, the Commisssion released an order adopt- ing rules consistent with Public Law 100-394. A petition for reconsideration of this order is currently pending. On October 28, 1988, the President also signed the Telecommunications Accessibil- ity Enhancement Act of 1988, Public Law 100-542. This law requires the General Services Administration to take action as necessary to assure that the federal tele- communications system is fully accessible to the hearing and speech-impaired popu- lations and directs the Commission to complete its interstate TDD relay system in- quiry, CC Docket No. 87-124, within 9 months of enactment of the law. In response to Public Law 100-542, the Commission released an order on July 27, 1989, finding that an intersate TDD relay service is necessary to provide reasonable access to telephone service to the hearing and speech impaired. The Commission issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) to consider specific rules. In the FNPRM, the Commission concluded that the benefits of an interstate TDD relay system outweigh the costs, the FCC has jurisdiction to require such a system, and users of the service should pay the same rates as non-TDD users. The FCC also noted that interexchange carriers could provide the service and recover costs from charges associated with their other interstate, interexchange services or the Nation- al Exchange Carrier Association could manage the service and recover costs from the Universal Service Fund. The FNPRM is still pending. ITEM 20. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DEcEMBER 22, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to your letter of October 11, 1989, I am pleased to forward the annual staff summary of Federal Trade Commission activities affect- ing older Americans for the year 1989. As this summary indicates, many of the Commission's efforts to police the market for unfair or deceptive practices and to promote a competitive market are particularly significant for older consumers. I hope this information will be helpful to the Committee. Please let me know if we can provide any further assistance. By direction of the Commission.JA~r D. SPACERn. Chairman. Enclosure558 STAFF SUMMARY OF FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACTIVITIES AFFECTING OLDER AMERICANS This report discusses recent activities of the Federal Trade Commission on behalf of older Americans. The first section of the report describes the Commission's health-related activities, which are of particular importance to older Americans be- cause persons over age 65 spend almost three time as much per capita on health care as do other adults. The second section addresses a variety of non-health-related issues that have a disparate impact on older Americans. These include the mandato- ry review and enforcement of the Commission's Funeral Rule, enforcement of the Commission's Mail Order, R-Value, Used Car, and Cooling-Off Rules, investigations into the delivery of legal services, issues surrounding credit, investment and travel frauds, and activities in the real estate, grocery, transportation, and taxicab indus- tries. The final section describes the Commission's consumer education activities that are of special significance to older consumers. HEALTH-RELATED AcTIvrITsS HOME HEALTH CARE Older Americans make greater use of health care facilities, including hospitals, than other segments of the population. Thus, as a group, they stand to benefit more from effective competition among health care providers. Home health care agencies, which offer skilled nursing and other health services to patients in their homes, can provide some older Americans with an important alternative to hospitalization or nursing home care. Home health services offer the possibility-of reduced health care expenses and can enable some people who would otherwise require institutional care to remain at home. One of the- key components of, effective home health care is the durable medical equipment necessary for the patient to be able to receive care at home instead of in a hospital. The Commission completed its investigation of the proposed merger of two of the largest suppliers of home health care beds in the United States and found reason to believe that the merger would raise prices to consumers. After the Coin- mission directed its staff to seek an injunction against the transaction in Federal district court; the parties cancelled the transaction. HOSPrTAL sERVICES The results of a study released in January 1989 conducted by the Bureau of Eco- nomics on hospital costs and the effects of state certificate-of-need (\"CON\") regula- tions were incorporated in several staff comments filed this year. CON regulations limit the entry of new hospitals into the market. The study found that hospital costs might decline by 1.4 percent, or $1.3 billion per year,.if all states with CON laws doubled the dollar thresholds at which they review hospital expenditures. Thus, the study found that CON laws do not appear to serve their originally intended purpose of reducing hospital costs. Staff's comments were filed in several states, including Nebraska, North Carolina, and Ohio in February, March and June 1989. The Com- mission's staff also discussed the effect of CON laws in March 1989 testimony before the Subcommittee on Health for the Committee on Ways and Means of the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition, the Bureau of Economics has undertaken a study of hospital merger. policies in order to assist in the development of an effective antitrust policy toward hospital markets generally and hospital mergers in particular. The study examines the vast literature in health care economics to apply the latest empirical and theo- retical findings to health care antitrust issues. This study is nearing completion. The Commission also investigates mergers or proposed mergers among hospitals which may injure competition. In November 1989, the Commission issued an admin- istrative complaint challenging the acquisition of one hospital by another in Ukiah, CA. The transaction gave- one firm control of three of the five general acute care hospitals in' the area. According to the complaint, the acquisition will injure con- sumers by giving one firm a dominant position in the market and increasing the likelihood of collusion among the hospitals in the area. In another case, two hospi- tals in the same community rescinded their affiliation agreement after the Commis- sion staff completed its investigation. NURSING HOMES Currently about 23,000 nursing homes provide care to approximately 1.4 million older residents in the United States. For some time, the Commission has been inves-559 tigating marketing practices in the nursing home industry. In 1988 the Commis-sion's staff began a project to improve a liaison with nursing home ombudsmen, State attorneys general, and other appropriate sources in order to develop leads for possible investigations of unfair and deceptive practices by nursing homes. In par-ticular, the Commission's staff is looking into potentially unfair or deceptive provi- sions in nursing home contracts. MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE The Commission's activities in this area included the filing of Commission staff comments with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") urgingthe Department to develop regulations that make clear that certain types of legiti- mate, pro-competitive arrangements and practices do not violate the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute. HHS was developing regulations to clarify whatpractices are permissible under the statute. The Commission's staff commented that some business arrangements and practices that could be construed to violate thelaw are actually likely to increase competition among health care providers and help control Medicare and Medicaid costs as well as costs to the patients of theseprograms. The staff urged that HHS interpret its rules in a way that allows the continuation of pro-competitive forms of health care insurance and providers such as Health Maintenance Organizations (\"HMOs\") and Preferred Provider Organiza- tions (\"PPOs\"). PRPSCRIMPION DRUGS Although persons aged 65 and over comprise only about 12 percent of the popula-tion, they consume over 30 percent of all prescription drugs nationwide. Consequent- ly, savings on prescription drugs purchases are especially significant for older con- sumers. In 1989 the Commission staff continued its investigation of State pharmacy boardregulations that prohibit pharmacists and pharmacies from offering services that provide consumers with more convenient access to prescription drugs. In response tothese investigations, one state board voluntarily liberalized its restrictions on the operation of mail service pharmacies and on the operation of pick-up stations or pre-scriptions depots that facilitate the delivery of prescription drugs to consumers.In June 1989 the Commission staff filed comments with the New York State Senate opposing proposed legislation that would prohibit physicians and dentistsfrom dispensing more than a 72-hour supply of prescription drugs to their patients.The comments pointed out that consumers are likely to benefit from the availability of physician dispensing as a possible alternative to dispensing by pharmacists.The Commission staff also filed comments with the Massachusetts House of Rep-resentatives, opposing proposed legislation that would have prohibited prepaidhealth benefit programs that include coverage of pharmaceutical services from con-tracting exclusively with selected pharmacies to provide prescription drugs to their subscribers. The comments pointed out that the legislation could increase consumer costs for health insurance by preventing prepaid health benefit programs, such ashealth maintenance organizations, from obtaining lower prices for prescription drugs. VISION CARE In March, the Commission promulgated a rule that invalidates four types of Staterestrictions imposed on the commercial practice of optometry: (1) prohibitions oncertain forms of lay association or control over optometric practices; (2) limitationson the number of branch offices that optometrists may own or operate; (3) prohibi-tions on the practice of optometry in commercial locations; and (4) prohibitions onthe practice of optometry under a nondeceptive trade name. The Commission foundthat these restrictions harm consumers by raising prices to consumers and decreas-ing their access to vision care. The removal of these restrictions will stimulate com- petition in the vision care industry and allow consumers to purchase vision caregoods and services at lower prices without any compromise in the quality of carethat consumers receive. This matter is on appeal in Federal Court. The Commission also continued requiring, as prescribed in the Eyeglasses I Rule,that optometrists and ophthalmologists give consumers copies of their prescriptionsafter an eye examination, thereby enabling consumers to comparison-shop for eye-glasses. The Commission staff also is engaged in discussions with state boards composed ofvision care professionals about the revision of regulations restricting truthful adver-tising.560 In March 1989 the Commission staff submitted comments to the Michigan Board of Optometry concerning proposed regulations that would prohibit optometrists from delegating certain procedures to nonlicensed, qualified eye-care professionals unless a licensed professional supervised performance of the procedure. The com- ments pointed out that the regulations would prohibit opticians from performing without supervision procedures that they have routinely performed, and that the proposed regulations appeared to harm consumers by increasing costs without im-proving the quality of care. DENTAL CARE The Commission staff conducted investigations of whether restraints by profes- sional associations and state boards composed of dentists harmed consumers, includ- ing older Americans, by restricting unreasonably the dissemination of truthful in- formation. As a result of one such investigation, a state dental board voluntarily amended its regulations governing advertising. In April 1989 the Commission staff filed comments on regulations of the Pennsyl- vania State Board of Dentistry that appeared to restrict truthful price and quality advertising claims. The staff indicated that when professionals are free to advertise truthfully, prices for goods and services are lower than when anticompetitive agree- ments restrict such advertising. PHYSICIAN SERVICES In August 1989 the Commission placed on the public record a consent order that would settle charges that a doctor in Sioux Falls, South Dakota illegally attempted to eliminate or limit competition among faculty members by conspiring with other doctors to boycott the obstetrician and gynecologist residency program of the Uni- versity of South Dakota School of Medicine. Eleven other doctors in the area en- tered into consent agreements settling similar charges in 1988. In July 1989 the Commission issued a consent order settling charges that 12 phy- sicians, two medical societies, and hospital medical staff conspired to prevent a hos- pital from opening a clinic that would compete with the doctors. The complaint al- leged that the doctors threatened not to refer patients to specialist physicians who would practice at the clinic, agreed to refuse to work with or for the proposed clinic, and threatened to stop referring patients to specialists at the hospital. In January 1989 the Commission filed an amicus curiae brief in the Eleventh Cir- cuit Court of Appeals in a case involving a vascular and general surgeon's loss of medical staff privileges at three hospitals. The brief argued that the State of Florida does not actively supervise hospitals' decisions to terminate staff privileges, as re- quired for the State action doctrine to protect the defendants' conduct from anti- trust scrutiny. These Commission activities benefit older consumers, as well as consumers in gen- eral, by helping to remove limitations on the ability of consumers to choose among a variety of providers, helping to increase the availability of convenient and innova- tive forms of services and helping consumers to receive the benefits of price and service competition among health care providers. PHYSICAL THERAPY SERVICES In February 1989 the Commission staff submitted comments concerning proposed legislation in Missouri that would have prohibited physical therapists from accept- ing wages or any other form of payment from a person who refers patients to the therapist. The staff comments pointed out that the bill would prohibit therapists from working for referring physicians or physician-owned physical therapy services, and as a result was likely to injure consumers by reducing competition among phys- *ical therapy providers. The comments filed in Missouri and staff comments submitted to the Nevada State Legislature in May 1989 also discussed proposed legislation that would prohib- it physical therapists from paying referral fees. The comments pointed out that a total prohibition on the payment of referral fees could inhibit the operation of some alternative health care delivery systems, such as preferred provider organizations, that may reduce consumers' health care costs, and could restrict the ability of physi- cal therapists to participate in referral services that would help consumers locate a suitable therapist. Therefore, the comments urged consideration of less restrictive alternatives that could protect consumers from abuses connected with the payment of referral fees while permitting arrangements. that could be beneficial to consum- ers.561 CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES In April 1989 the Commission placed on the public record a proposed consentorder that would prohibit the Texas Board of Chiropractic Examiners from restrict-ing certain kinds of truthful advertising by chiropractors. The consent order wouldsettle charges that the Board had enacted rules that unreasonably restrained adver-tising, and would permit the Board to adopt reasonable rules to prohibit advertisingthat the Board reasonably believes to be false, misleading, or deceptive, and to pro-hibit oppressive in-person solicitation. The Commission staff is investigating restrictions on offering free or discountedservices and advertising, including price advertising, imposed by a private associa-tion of chiropractors. RESTRAINTS ON ADVERTISING BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS Advertising by professionals in general, and by health care providers in particu-lar, has grown tremendously since the mid-1970's. The Commission supports theright of professionals to advertise truthfully. However, the Commission also recog-nizes the importance of policing the market place to ensure that health care profes-sionals do not engage in deceptive or misleading advertising practices.The Commission staff works closely with professional health care organizations tohelp them develop ethical codes that protect against deceptive advertising withoutinfringing on the rights of professionals to advertise truthfully. In December 1985,for example, the Commission published the proceedings of a Commission-sponsorednational symposium on \"Advertising by Health Care Professionals in the 80's.\" Thesympium featured experts in most facets of professional advertising and was at-tended by more than 100 representatives of health care groups. The program ex-panded the Commission's dialogue with these groups, which continued in 1989, andprovided information needed by the Commission for an effective professional adver-tising enforcement program. In January 1988 the Commission issued a final consent order that prohibits theWyoming State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, the licensing authority for chiro-practors in Wyoming, from restricting the advertisement by chiropractors of pricesand certain other truthful, nondeceptive information or from characterizing suchadvertising as unethical or unprofessional. In June 1988 the Commission ruled that the Massachusetts Board of Registrationin Optometry, the licensing authority for optometrists in Massachusetts, illegally re-stricted truthful advertising. The Commission decision upholds a 1986 ruling by anadministrative law judge, which supported a Commission complaint charging thatthe board unlawfully conspired to prohibit optometrists from truthfully advertisingdiscounts. The complaint also charged that the board prohibited optical and othercommercial establishments from truthfully advertising the names of optometrists orthe availability of their services. The order issued by the Commission does not affectthe board's authority to prohibit advertising that is fraudulent, deceptive, or mis-leading in violation of State law. In May 1988 the Commission staff filed comments on regulations of the MontanaBoard of Dentistry that appeared to restrict truthful price and quality advertisingclaims. The staff indicated that when truthful advertising is permitted, prices forgoods and services are lower than where advertising is restricted or prohibited.In 1989 the Commission continued its cooperative efforts with professional grouregarding allegations of deceptive advertising in a number of health care fieldsDuring this year, the Commission staff initiated several investigations involving pos-sible deceptive claims in advertising of health care services, and expanded its effortsto work cooperatively with State medical boards in their efforts to police deceptiveadvertising. In particular, the Commission staff is examining claims by infertilityclinics and by plastic and cosmetic surgeons. In addition, the Commission staff this year completed or initiated new investiga-tions of State professional board regulations that may unnecessarily restrict nonde-ceptive advertising by dentists and optometrists. These activities permit older Americans and others to obtain truthful informationabout health professionals' prices, services, and qualifications and to receive thebenefits of price and service competition among health professionals, while allowingreasonable advertising guidelines that protect the public from false or deceptive ad-vertising. PODIATRY SERVICES The Commission staff recently closed an investigation of regulations enacted by aState podiatry board after the board amended the regulations in question. The regu-562 lations had, among other things, prohibited certain kinds of truthful advertising by podiatrists. MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS The Commission staff regularly investigates proposed mergers among producers of medical instruments to determine whether each merger is likely to increase prices to health- care professionals and thereby to consumers. An investigation of a pro- .posed merger involving equipment and services used in sterilization of medical in- struments led to the abandonment of the proposed transaction. FOOD, DRUG, AND HEALTH CARE ADVERTISING Older Americans spend considerably more per capita on health care than do other adults. An important part of the Commission's effort to protect the public from de- ceptive food, drug, and health care claims is its advertising monitoring program. In addition, the Commission's ongoing contacts with other Federal and State officials have helped identify potential targets and projects. During 1989 the Commission has taken action with respect to advertisements for foods and for drugs. i. Food and Food Supplement Advertising The Commission has an active program to police false and deceptive claims in food advertising. A U.S. Department of Agriculture study showed that persons over age 65 spend about 22 percent of pre-tax income on food, compared to 17 percent for persons under age 65. This increases to as much as 40 percent for those with small- er incomes. The Commission staff monitors extensively to determine current issues in food advertising and to identify new ad campaigns of significance to consumers. For example, the staffs monitoring has revealed that nutritional and other composi- to be popular in food ads. Research conducted by the Opinion Re- search Corporation for the National Food Processors Association confirms that sodium, fat, calories, and sugar, and cholesterol claims are important to consumers. During 1989 the Commission staff initiated several new investigations involving either false or unsubstantiated claims for foods or food supplements. In addition, several active cases were continued or concluded this year. In 1988 the Commission held hearings before an administrative law judge on charges that Kraft, Inc., had misrepresented the calcium content of its Kraft Sin- gles. The ALT ruled that Kraft falsely advertised that its Kraft Singles cheese slices contain as much calcium as 5 ounces of milk and more calcium than do most imita- tion slices. The judge also found that the milk equivalency and imitation cheese su- periority claims were unsubstantiated. The ALJ ordered the company not to misrep- resent the nutrient content of its individually wrapped slices of cheese in the future. This ruling has been appealed to the Commission, and oral arguments were heard on December 7, 1989. The Commission will hold administrative hearings in March 1990 to hear, allega- tions that another major food producer, Campbell Soup Co., has made deceptive and unsubstantiated claims in its \"Soup is Good Food\" advertisements. According to the complaint, the ads link the low fat, low cholesterol content of its soups with a re- duced risk of some forms of heart disease, but fail to disclose that the soups are high in sodium and that diets high in sodium may increase the risk of heart disease. The complaint charges that, in light of the representations made in the ads, the compa- ny's failure to make this disclosure is deceptive. If the Commission finds that Camp- bell violated the law, it may order the company to notify consumers of the sodium content of its soup in certain advertisements. In September 1989 the FTCs Bureau of Economics released two reports concern- ing health claims policy for foods. One report provided an analysis of the appropri- ate role of health claims regulation generally. The second study examined the data from recent health claims made for fiber cereals and found that the claims provided significant benefits-,2 million more households began to eat high-fiber cereals and the advertising reached those people who were ordinarily not reached by govern- ment and other general information regarding the potential benefits of fiber con- sumption. ii Drug Advertising The Commission staff regularly monitors over-the-counter drug advertising, focus- ing especially on fraudulent or deceptive performance, pain relief, and safety claims.563 Such claims are likely to be important to older consumers because of the higher in-cidence of health problems among this population.In addition, the staff carefully monitors all advertising for weight-reduction plansand products which have an appeal for many overweight older Americans. In 1989,the Commission issued complaints against two nationally known companies, Sche-ring Corp. and Revlon, Inc., for their advertising of weight and fat reduction rod-ucts. The administrative complaint alleges that Schering falsely claims that FibreTrim is a high fiber supplement and the recommended daily dosage of Fibre Trimprovides a significant portion of a person's daily requirements of dietary fiber. Thecomplaint also alleges that the company did not have a reasonable basis for claimsthat Fibre Trim is an effective weight loss or maintenance product and provides thehealth benefits associated with a fiber-rich diet.The Commission's complaint against Revlon alleges that it had made unsubstanti-ated claims about the effectiveness of its Ultima II ProCollagen Anti-cellulite bodycomplex. The Commission alleged that Revlon does not have a reasonable basis forits claims that the product significantly reduces cellulite and reduces the skin'sbumpy texture, ripples, or slackness caused by cellulite, that its product helps todisperse toxins and excess water from areas where cellulite appears and increasessub-skin tissue strength and tone. The Commission recently accepted a consent order with Nutritione, Inc., a Boston-based health club, which had claimed that its electric muscle stimulation treat-ments produced the same effects as exercises. The health club and its former ownersagreed not to misrepresent the efficiacy or comparability of any diet, or strengthdevelopment or fitnesss Program or product. In addition, in 1988 the Commission filed separate actions in Federal district courtagainst companies engaged in the sale of baldness remedies. In one case, CaliforniaPacific Research, Inc., the court issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting thecompany from making certain claims relating to the mgrketig of New Generationbaldness preventative and remedy. In issuing the order, the judge stated that thereis no scientific evidence to support a representation that the product is effectiveeither to deter hair loss or to promote new hair growth. The order also requires thecompany to send copies of the order to all consumers who have purchased New Gen-eration products within the last 2 years. NoN-HzALTH-RELm.nw Acrivmxs FUNERAL serVICas The Commission's Funeral Rule, which became effective in 1984, is of particularconcern to older Americans. It seeks to increase consumer access to accurate infor-mation about prices, options and legal requirements prior to and at the time of pur-chase of a funeral. In summary, the Funeral Rule: (1) requires funeral directors toprovide consumers with a general price list, a casket price list, and an outer burialcontainer price list, as well as an itemized statement of the goods and services se-lected by the customer at the time funeral arrangements are made; (2) prohibitsmisrepresentations of legal and cemetery requirements and the preservative valueof embalming, caskets, and vaults; (3) prohibits funeral directors from requiring thepurchase of certain goods and services as a condition for purchasing other goods andservices; (4) prohibits funeral directors from embalming without prior approvalexcept in very limited circumstances; (5) requires funeral directors to make alterna-tive containers available for direct cremation; and (6) requires funeral directors togive price information over the telephone.To date, the Commission has filed 12 enforcement actions for violations of its Fu-neral Rule. Eleven of these cases resulted in court-approved consent decrees thatimposed civil penalties ranging from $10,000 to $30,000 on funeral homes in Texas,New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, D.C. TheOregon and Nevada settlement also required that $7,500 and $4,200, respectively,in consumer redress be paid to customers who had not given prior authorization forembalming of the deceased or who were charged for cremation caskets that werenot actually used. The remaining case resulted in a court-imposed civil penalty of$80,000 against a Texas funeral home. This decision has been appealed and thematter is pending. Other matters are under investigation or negotiation by the Com-mission staff. Staff members also continue to work closely with consumer and indus-try groups to educate their members about the requirements of the Funeral Rule.In 1988 the Commission also initiated a rulemaking proceeding to review the Fu-neral Rule. This proceeding was mandated by Section 453.10 of the Rule. Duringthis mandatory review, the Commission will determine whether the rule should beretained unchanged, or be expanded, modified, or repealed. The determination will564 be based on whether the Rule is operating as expected and whether it is still needed. In May 1988 the Commission initiated this proceeding when it issued its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"NPR\"). The NPR informed the public about the evidence the Commission had gathered, the issues that had been raised and the means for public participation in the rulemaking hearings. The Commission re- ceived 189 comments, of which 147 came from consumers. Eighty witnesses present- ed testimonial and survey evidence at four public hearings held in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and San Francisco between November 1988 and February 1989. Addi- tional submissions were made in April and May 1989 by the participants in the rulemaking on whether the Rule should be retained, modified, or repealed. The rulemaking staff and presiding officer are currently preparing their reports, sum- marizing the record evidence and making recommendations to the Commission. The Commission will likely make its final decision by late next year. During 1989 the Commission staff continued its investigations of certain State board regulations that may restrict pre-need sales of funeral services..In response to these investigations, one State board deleted its prohibition on testimonial advertis- ing affecting both pre-need and at-need funeral services. The Commission staff also testified before a Pennsylvania legislative committee, and filed a comment with the Virginia General Assembly, concerning proposed leg- islation that would restrict pre-need sales of funeral arrangements. MAML ORDER SALEs In issuing its Rule relating to mail order sales, the Commission noted that less mobile consumers, especially older Americans, frequently order by mail. The Rule requires sellers to: Make timely shipment-of orders, give options to consumers to cancel an order and receive a prompt refund or to consent to arty delay, have a rea- sonable basis for any promised shipping dates (the Rule presumes a 30-day shipping date when no date is promised in an advertisement) and make prompt refunds. The Commission staff works closely with industry members and their association to obtain compliance with the Rule and initiates law enforcement actions where appro- priate. In 1989 the Commission initiated a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether the Rule should be amended to cover orders placed by telephone. The Com- mission began the proceedings by publishing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule- making in November 1989. After reviewing the comments, the Commission will so- licit oral and written comments 6n the proposal. ENERGY COMTS The cost of heating and cooling one's home can be significant to many consumers, but especially to older Americans. These individuals may be more likely to spend time at home than working or school age persons, and thus may not be able to con- serve energy costs by lowering the thermostat during the day in winter or raising the thermostat during the day in summer. The cost of heating or cooling may fall particularly hard on the older person who lives alone, because the cost is not pro- portionately less than for a household including two or more persons. The Commission's Rule regulating claims about home insulation products, the R- value Rule, seeks to protect consumers: who attempt to lower energy costs by adding insulation to their existing homes and when purchasing new homes, including re- tirement housing. The Rule requires that insulation sellers disclose the R-value of the insulation so that consumers can buy the best thermal protection for their money. (R-value measures insulation effectiveness: The higher the R-value, the greater the insulating power.) The Rule also requires installers and new home sell- ers to give consumers a written disclosure of the type and R-value of the insulation installed. In 1989, the Commission settled two district court actions, one filed in 1988 and the second filed in 1989, that alleged violations of the R-value Rule. The actions charged that two cellulose insulation manufacturers overstated the R-value of their insulation. One consent decree requires defendants to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, to conduct a quality control testing program staisfactory to the Commission for three years, and to comply with the Rule in the future. The second consent decree requires the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $15,000 and prohibits further viola- tions of the Rule. USED CAR SALES The Used Car Rule requires that car dealers disclose on a \"Buyers Guide\" window sticker information concerning whether the vehicle comes with a warranty or is sold \"as is.\" This Rule can be of particular benefit to older Americans who may be565 more likely to purchase used rather than new vehicles. The Commission has vigor-ously enforced this Rule and, in FY 1989, filed actions against nine car dealers andobtained a total of $185,000 in civil penalties. DOOR-rDOoR SALsM The Cooling-Off Rule requires that consumers be given a 3-day right to cancel cer-tain sales that occur away from the seller's principal place of business. This salesmethod may have a greater impact on older Americans, who may be more suscepti-ble to the high pressure sales tactics that sometimes accompany door-to-door sales.The Commission continued monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Cooling-Off Rule during 1989. Staff regularly investigates complaints and reviews the prac-tices of companies engaged in door-to-door sales to ensure that their procedures ade-quately inform customers of their right to cancel. For example, several 1989 investi-gations focused on possible rule violations by sellers of hearing aids, a product pur-chased in disproportionate shares by older consumers. In one civil penalty actioncompleted in 1989, which included Cooling-Off Rule violations as well as other lawviolations, the Commission obtained consumer redress in the form of contract can-cellations and refunds of amounts previously paid. DELIVERY OF LEGAL SERVICEs During 1989 the Commission staff continued its efforts to facilitate consumers'access to legal services. Removing unnecessary restrictions may benefit older Ameri-cans, whose income often exceeds limits established by Government-sponsored as- aistance programs but may be insufficient to cover high legal fees. In July 1989 the Commission staff commented to the Florida Supreme Court on its rules of professional conduct governing attorney advertising and solicitation. The staff suggested modification of the rules to allow truthful, nondeceptive advertise-ments and solicitation. In addition, the Commission staff in 1988 continued its investigation of advertis- ing restrictions by a State bar association on lawyers' marketing of their services toolder Americans. CREDrr In the area of consumer credit, the Commission protects older consumers by en-forcing the age discrimination provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act(ECOA). Although Federal law permits creditors to consider information related toage, creditors may not deny, reduce, or withdraw credit solely because an otherwisequalified applicant is over 61 years old. Moreover, retirement income must be con-sidered, to the extent that employment is considered in rating a credit application,and credit may not be denied or withdrawn because credit-related insurance is notavailable to older persons based on their age. During the past year, the Commission has resolved three cases under the ECOAin which discrimination on the basis of age was alleged. In December 1988, anamended complaint was filed and a consent decree entered in Federal Trade Com-mission v. Green Tree Acceptance, Inc., Civ. Action No. 4-46-469-k N.D. Tex. Dec. 15, 1988). Green Tree, a financier of mobile homes and recreational vehicles, paid a civilpenalty of $115,000 to settle FTC charges that the company discriminated on thebasis of age by requiring elderly applicants to make larger down payments. The con-sent decree also prohibits Green Tree from discriminating on the basis of age in thefuture. In October 1989, a complaint was filed and a consent decree was entered against alarge retail creditor that required successful applicants to its instant credit programto be employed full-time and so discriminated against elderly applicants who re-ceived their income from retirement benefits and part-time employment. To resolvethe complaint allegations, the creditor paid a civil penalty of $275,000 and was en-joined from discriminating on the basis of age. Also in October 1989, the principals of a small loan company entered into a con-sent decree to resolve allegations that they discriminated against elderly applicants by refusing to lend to persons who were not employed full-time. To resolve the com- plaint allegations, the principals agreed to pay a civil penalty of $12,500 and to be enjoined from discrimination. Since 1983, six other cases alleging age discrimination under the ECOA werebrought by the Department of Justice either on behalf of the Commission or based on evidence developed by the Commission staff. A consent decree was entered by thecourt in each of the cases in settlement of the issues raised. In those cases broughton the Commission's behalf, the defendants paid substantial civil penalties, ranging566 from $90,000 to $235,000, as part of the settlements. They were also enjoined from discriminating against older credit applicants in the future. The Commission staff has also continued its investigatory testing program to mon- itor compliance with these provisions of the Act. Testers pose as credit applicants to discover whether unlawful discrimination is occurring during the application inter- view that might otherwise go undetected. The testing program continues to be an efficient means of selecting targets for investigation and assessing compliance with the Act. One of the cases brought within the last year relied on evidence from test- ing. Investigations currently underway also include allegations of age discrimination by creditors. GROCERIES Older Americans are particularly susceptible to competitive harm from high food prices and- noncompetitive markets. In the past year, the Commission has issued two administrative complaints against grocery store mergers that allegedly lessened competition, and accepted a consent order requiring divestitures of stores in concen- trated markets in New England. The Commission also required the issuance, of a consent order requiring divestitures of overlapping food product lines in the KKR acquisition of RJR Nabisco. TRANSPORTATION The Commission issued a decision and order in the New England Motor Rate Bureau case, ordering a tariff bureau composed of motor carriers to stop fixing prices for the intrastate transportation of goods, in Massachusetts and New Hamp- shire. The Commission also accepted for public comment two consent agreements. One would order the New Jersey Movers Tariff Bureau and a related trade association of movers to stop fixing prices for the intrastate transportation of goods. The other proposed agreement would prohibit eight motor vehicle dealers and their trade asso- ciation; the Cleveland Oldsmobile Connection, from agreeing not to advertise prices and other terms of new automobiles. TELEMARKEING FRAUD i. Investment Fraud The Commission's investment fraud program is another example of a program that benefits all consumers, but especially older, retired citizens. Investment frauds frequently victimize the public through false promises of large returns on \"safe\" in- vestments. These frauds obviously harm all investors, but they can particularly hurt older investors, who are vulnerable to fraudulent operatorts and often ill-prepared to absorb the losses. Some investment fraud firms have bilked individual consumers of $5,000 to.$10,000 or more by promising large returns for investments in art work, gold mines, gemstones, precious metals, rare coinss, oil. and gas leases, or cellular telephone licenses. These firms usually employ telephone room salespersons who use high-pressure, polished sales pitches. Although fraud cases, especially those involving oral misrepresentations, are very difficult to investigate, the Commission has an active program to combat investment fraud. Since .1982 -the Commission has succeeded in placing approximately 167 named defendants under preliminary or permanent Federal district court orders barring fraudulent and deceptive practices. The Commission also has obtained court orders freezing personal and corporate assets that may be used for consumer re- dress. The Commission staff estimates that since 1982 the Commission's actions have halted frauds that cost consumers approximately $1.2 billion. To date the Com- mission's efforts have secured approximately $33 million for consumer redress. In 1989 the Commission continued its active program in this area. The Commis- sion filed five cases in Federal district court involving investment coins and one case involving investment art. In five of these cases the Commission has been able to freeze the defendants' assets and secure preliminary injunctive relief. iie Other Telemarketing Scams The Commission remains concerned about the proliferation of companies selling a variety of goods and services over the telephone through deceptive means-so-called \"telemarketing scams.\" The Commission has been concerned about travel scams and scams involving the sale of water purifiers, to which older consumers may be espe- cially vulnerable for several reasons.567 With respect to travel scams, many older consumers have spent years in the work force saving and planning for travel during their retirement years. Thus, they pro- vide a ready market for travel services. In addition, older citizens often have fixed incomes and seek \"bargain\" vacations. Finally, many older citizens may find tele- phone shop p ing to be a convenience, if not a necessity; thus, telemarketers provide an easy and sometimes essential means of purchasing goods and services, including vacation packages. For these reasons, the Commission is sensitive to the susceptibili-ty of older Americans to travel scams. During 1989 the Commission staff continued investigations of travel companies engaged in telemarketing fraud, and monitoring of the sales practices of compnaiesthat sell vacation or travel vouchers and certificates. As a part of these efforts, the Commission obtained a consent decree against one travel telemarketing company, permanently enjoining their deceptive marketing practices. The Commission staff continued litigation against another fraudulent travel scam. In a third case, the Commission's $6.6 million consumer redress judgment from Amy Travel Service, Inc., was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. With respect to water purifier telemarketing scams, older consumers may be espe- cially concerned about their health, and fraudulent telemarketers play to this con- cern by making various false and misleading claims about the health benefits associ- ated with their devices. During 1989, the Commission filed three Federal court ac- tions against companies that misrepresented the ability of water purifiers to remove contaminants, promised consumers valuable prizes if they purchased thier purifiers (but delivered essentially worthless prizes), or failed to provide consumers with re- funds of the $300 to $400 fee for the purifiers upon request, as promised. In these actions, the Commission has obtained preliminary injunctions and orders freezingthe defendants' assets; the cases are awaiting trial. The Commission's objectives are to permanently prohibit the defendants' misrepresenatations and to obtain redressfor injured consumers, if possible. REAL ESTATE SERVICES The Commission is involved in several different facets of real estate services thatare of particular concern to older Americans. In 1988 the Commission concluded its Federal district court litigation, initiated in 1985 against Nationwide Mortgage Corp., Community Mortgage Corp., and the individuals. The defendants agreed to consent orders enjoining them from misrepresenting loan terms and requiring them to make affirmative disclosures to consumers before making loans. The Commission staff also this year has been investigating restraints imposed by real estate multiple listing services. Real estate multiple listing services are associa- tions of firms engaged in real estate services that provide a clearinghouse through which member real estate brokerage firms exchange information with one another on properties for sale in order to locate purchasers and transact sales more efficient- ly. The potentially anticompetitive restraints being investigated include maintain- ing bylaws and engaging in practices that exclude certain licensed real estate bro-kers from membership in the services or that restrict competition among the serv- ices' members. Removal of these restraints on residential real estate services may permit older Americans to enjoy increased price and service competition among real estate brokers. LAND SALES Since 1972, the Commission has issued 13 orders against land developers. The companies were charged with misrepresenting that the purchase of any land is asound financial investment; includes little or no monetary risks; and will benefit the purchaser economically as a result of profitable resale. Some of the orders entered in these cases provided for pro-rata refunds to the purchasers or the expenditure of development costs to improve the subdivisions. Many of the consumers that purchased these undeveloped lots are now senior citi- zens. These persons counted on the land purchases to aid them in their retirement years or to serve as development homesite property to build their retirement homes. These cases represent approximately 31 subdivisions located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, Missouri, and Texas. More than a half million per- sons own property in these subdivisions. The Commission staff, over the years, has monitored to ensure that the mandated redress payments or refunds have been paid and promised improvements made. In 1988 Horizon Corp., paid out a third distribution of $410,000 to 37,901 lot purchas- ers, and as proivded by the order, the remaining residue of $39,468.50 was distribut- ed to four home improvement associations.568 TAXICAB REGULATION Older Americans are disproportionately heavy users of taxicabs. The Commission staff in 1988 continued its efforts to encourage State and local governments to endregulation of rates charged by taxicabs and to remove limits on the entry of newproviders of taxi services. These regulations unnecessarily limit competition andtend to raise prices in the taxicab industry. These efforts included the filing of staff comments with regulators in Montgomery County, MD, and in Providence, RI. CONSUMER EDUCATION Acrivmrs AFFECrING OLDER AMERICANS The Commission, through its Office of Consumer and Business Education, is in- volved in preparing and disseminating a variety of consumer publications and broadcast materials. Many of the subjects are of significant interest to older con- sumers. Some recent consumer education activities are described below. COMPLAINT RESOLUTION AND SHOPPING AT HOME In 1989 the Commission continued its cooperative efforts with the American Asso- ciation of Retired Persons (AARP) in distributing How to Write a Wrong, a bookletjointly developed by the Commission and AARP. The booklet explains how to com- plain effectively about consumer problems and get results and also contains infor- mation about two types of merchandising frequently aimed at older citizens: door-to- door sales and mail order promotions. This booklet is a component of a training pro- gram developed by AARP for use in its 5,000. local offices around the country. The FTC, AARP, and the Consumer Information Center in Pueblo, CO distributed morethan 18,000 copies in 1989 and more than 618,000 copies of the publication since it was first published in 1983. TELEMARETING SCAMs AND OTHER FRAUD During 1989, the FTC continued its focus on telemarketing fraud and distributed its brochures concerning various aspects of the topic. Over the past 2 years, for ex-ample, the Commission has filled requests for several hundred thousand copies of publications such as \"Magazine Telephone Scams,\" \"Telephone Investment Frauds,\" and \"Telemarketing Travel Frauds.' In addition, the Commission published and distributed copies of new brochures in 1989, to alert consumers about other kinds of marketplace fraud. These publications provided information that could be of special importance to the elderly because the topics refer to activities, products, and services often important to them. Such new publications include: \"Dollars for Dancing,\" which cautions consumers against con-tract sales practices used by some dance studios; \"Car Rental Guide,\" which ex- plains car rental contract terms and suggests ways to negotiate a lower price; and 'Program-length TV Commericals,\" a new kind of television sales program that may misrepresent itself as an objective news show. New publications that advise about products and services include: \"Buying a Home Water Treatment Unit,\" which gives scientific purchasing information about a product that sales people sometimes misrepresent; and \"Lawn Service Contracts, which describes how to select a contractor who will meet work requirements and environmental concerns. Requests for each one of these five brochures over the past year numbers 20,000 copies or more. CREDIT During 1989, the FTC continued to market and distribute its credit publications that it released in the past few years. The following titles are especially useful to older persons or to widows who find they have problems geting credit. \"Building a Better Credit Record,\" explains how to understand credit records and credit reports and warns against using fraudulent credit repair clinics. Since it wasproduced in 1988, more then 200,000 copies of the booklet have been requested. Credit and Older Americans,\" produced in 1987, explains the Equal Credit Oppor- tunity Act, especially in regard to age. Since its release, more than 75,000 free copies have been distributed. Other credit publications that are useful to the elderly and that the FTC contin- ues to distribute since they were released in 1987, include: \"Fix Your Own Credit Problems;\" \"Lost of Stolen Credit and ATM Cards\"; and \"Buying and Borrowing.\" \"Fix Your Own Credit Problems\" is a how-to publication that also cautions consum- ers about credit repair clinics. More than 140,000 copies have been distributed in English and Spanish during the past 3 years. \"Lost or Stolen Credit and ATM Cards,\" which discusses liability, was distributed to 67,000 consumers since 1987.569 \"Buying and Borrowing,\" a summary of information about buying on credit, bu on layaway, and buying by phone and mail, was distributed to more than 70,000 re-questors over the past 3 years. FUNERALS During 1989 the Commission continued its print education campaign explaining key elements of the Funeral Rule. In response to individual requests, the Commis- sion's staff and the Consumer Information Center sent out approximately 70,000 copies of the consumer brochure last year, bringing total distribution of this publica-tion since 1984 to more thafn 300,000. HEALTH In 1989 the Commission and AARP distributed more than 122,000 copies of theirjoint publication, \"Healthy Questions.\" This booklet explains how to select and usethe services of health care professionals, including doctors, dentists, pharmacists,and vision care specialists. Since the publication's release in 1985, more than 522,000 copies have been distributed. In addition, the Commission produced its own consumer brochure, \"Health Claims: Separating Fact from Fiction,\" on specific aspects of health fraud. Since itsrelease in 1986, more than 75,000 copies were distributed to organizations on agingand individual consumers. HOUSING In cooperation with AARP, the Commission developed a publication entitled\"Your Home, Your Choice: A Workbook for Older Persons and Their Families.\" Thepublication addresses independent and assisted living options for older persons, in-cluding home health care, nursing homes, and life-care facilities. Such information is important for older Americans because more than 90 percent of persons over age 65 live in some form of \"independent\" housing. During 1989, the booklet was distrib-uted to more than 51,000 requesters by the Commission, AARP, and the ConsumerInformation Center, bringing total distribution since 1985 to more than 350,000. Inaddition, AARP uses the workbook as a component in one of its training programs. In 1986 the Commission published and distributed a brochure called \"Real EstateBrokers\" to help familiarize consumers with ways to protect their interests when buying or selling a home. The brochure explains technical terms that are used inthe industry and elaborates on matters relating to real estate contracts. Since 1986, 95,000 copies of the free brochure were distributed to organizations on the aging andothers. In 1986 the Commission also released a consumer booklet, \"How to Buy a Manu- factured Home,\" prepared in cooperation with the Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI). The booklet discusses warranties and other consumer protections and ex-plains the importance of home placement, site preparation, transportation, and in-stallation. M=I released the publication at its 50th annual National Housing Showin Louisville, KY. It made 115,000 booklets available to manufacturers, who distrib- uted them to retail sales centers for point-of-sale availability to consumers. MHIalso provided copies of the booklet free to the Consumer Information Center for dis- tribution. In 1989, more than 15,000 were requested, which brings total distribution from the Commission and the Center to more than 80,000. In a readership surveyconducted by the Consumer Information Center in 1986, 45 percent of the respond-ents were 55 years of age or older. MONEY MATERS As a companion piece to \"Healthy Questions,\" the Commission, in cooperation with AARP, developed a consumer publication called \"Money Matters,\" which ex-plains how to select and use the professional services of lawyers, accountants, finan- cial planners, real estate brokers, and tax preparers. In 1989 the booklet was distrib-uted to 77,000 requesters by AARP, the Consumer Information Center, and the FTC,bringing total distribution since 1986 to approximately 600,000. CoNCLUsION In this report we have reviewed Commission programs that are of special signifi- cance to older Americans. We emphasize, however, that older Americans also bene-fit very substantially from the Commission's general enforcement activities. In all ofits work the Commission is guided by the conviction that vigorous and honest com-petition is the best mechanism for satisfying consumer needs at the lowest possible570 cost. Competitive markets are particularly important to older persons, who may be less mobile and limited in their ability to comparison, shop. Commission efforts to halt consumer deception and eliminate anticompetitive conduct are designed to keep markets free and fair, and thereby promote the welfare of all consumers. ITEM 21. GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE JANUARY 12, 1990. DEAR MR. CHAianmA: This report is in response to the Committee's October 11, 1989, request for a compilation of our fiscal year 1989 activities regarding older Americans. Our work covered a broad range of issues, including income security, health care, housing, nutrition, social, community and legal services, employment and age dis- crimination. Some of the Federal policies that address these issues are directed solely or primarily to the elderly, such as Social Security and Medicare. Other feder- al policies target the elderly as one of several groups served by a program or fund- ing mechanism, such as social services block grants or Medicaid. In the appendixes, we describe five types of GAO activities that relate to older Americans: -Reports on policies and programs directed primarily. at older Americans (see app. I).-Reports on policies and programs in which the elderly were one of several target groups (see app. II). -Testimonies on issues related to older Americans (see app. III). -Ongoing activities on issues related to older Americans (see app. IV). -Other activities by GAO officials, such as speaking engagements and publica- tions, on issues related to older Americans (see app. V). These products and activities and the issues addressed are presented in table 1. The table shows that income security was the leading issue among activities direct- ed primarily at the elderly, while health was the leading issue across all types of activities and products. Appendix I list 59 issued reports on policies and programs directed primarily at the elderly (see table 1). We include in this section reviews of income security, health, social and other services, housing and veterans issues. We also describe GAO's management reviews of the agencies dealing with the elderly, as well as re- ports on the infrastructures of such agencies, including their computer systems. These aspects of agency operations determine how well agencies can implement policies relating to the elderly.

With the exception of Older Americans Act pro- grams, social and other services are generally financed in conduction with services to other populations. For example, block grants fund community services or energy assistance for the elderly, as well as services for other age groups; Medicaid finances nursing home care, as well as medical care for poor people of all ages; and Native American programs fund social and health services for Native American elderly, as well as progams for other Native Americans. We also describe two transition re- ports, which are broad policy overviews of health and human services and housing.571 Appendix m describes the 26 testimonies given in fiscal year 1989 on subjects fo-cused primarily on older Americans. We testified more times on income securitythan any other issue. In appendix IV we have listed the 114 studies directly related to older Americansthat were ongoing as of September 30, 1989. As table 1 shows, we are increasing ouractivities on all issues relating to the elderly. In addition to reports and testimonies, GAO officials are called upon to appear onnews interviews and professional and academic panels, as well as to publish ontopics for which they have particular expertise. Appendix V describes the 39 timesGAO officials spoke or published on aging issues. You also asked for information on our employment of older Americans. Our poli-cies prohibit age discrimination (see app. VI). On September 30, 1989, 54 percent ofour work force was 40 years of age or older. We continue to provide individual re-tirement counseling and group preretirement seminars. As arranged with your office, we are sending copies of this report to interestedcongressional committees and subcommittees. Copies also will be available to otherson request. This report was prepared under the direction of Joseph F. Delfico, Director,Income Security Issues. Should you have any questions concerning this reportplease call him on (202) 275-6193.

Of these, 25 were on incomesecurity, 21 were on health, 12 on veterans' issues (including 5 on veterans' health care), and 1 on other issues. An asteriskafter the report title indicates that the review was performed at the request of Committees or Members of Congress. Two asterisksindicate that the work was mandated by statute. HEALTH Board and Care: Insufficient Assurances That Residents' Needs Are Identified and Met (GAO/NRD-89-50, Feb. 10, 1989)' Many elderly and disabled adults reside in board and care homes; little is known nationally, however, about the residents' needs, the care they receive, or the total number of homes operating inthe United states. In 1976, the Congress enacted the Keys Amendment to the Social Security Act. The act required states tocertify, to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),that all facilities in which a significant number of Supplemental Security Income recipients resided or were likely to reside metappropriate standards. HHS is only required to record that it received the states' annual certificates concerning compliance. HHS has done little to monitor state actions or sanction statesnot in compliance. In the six states we visited, the states continue to find serious problems in some licensed board and care homes. These problems range from very serious situations, suchas residents being subjected to physical and sexual abuse, topersistent unsanitary conditions. In some cases residents were denied heat, were suffering from dehydration, were denied adequate medical care, or had food withheld if they did not work.Situations have occurred that have contributed to the death of board and care residents. HHS needs (1) to conduct a comprehensive assessment of states' oversight activities fortheir board and care population and (2) report to the Congress findings and, if appropriate, recommendations as to furthersteps needed to assure protection of residents and changes neededto the Keys Amendments to make it more effective.578 Health Insurance: BibliograPhy of Studies on Health Benefits for the Uninsured (GAO/HRD-89-27F5, Feb. 24, 1989) This annotated bibliography lists studies concerning health benefits for the uninsured. It cites literature, including books, journal articles, and research reports published between 1980 and 1988. Information Technology: Health Care Financing Administration's Budget Process Needs Im rovement (GAO/IMTEC-89-3 , Au. 11 1989);, The Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA's) Information Technology System budget request of $73.6 million for fiscal year 1990 may not accurately and fully estimate automated data processing (ADP) expenditures. HCFA's cost estimate of $22 million for an ADP initiative to expand system capacity for the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 was not supported by sufficient analysis because HCFA lacked time to make a more accurate estimate. Fiscal years 1991-92 costs of the PRISM system have been increased by about $7.2 million. The system is intended to give HCFA additional ADP and telecommunications capacity to improve program operations and supply better data to assess the impact of new health care proposals. Further, HCFA has not included in its information technology systems budget request over $947 million included in its programmatic budget for Medicaid state and Medicare contractor ADP costs and for a major Medicare project. Although HCFA believes that contractors can contribute to Medicare ADP cost reduction--by cutting the number of systems used and trimming maintenance costs through sharing arrangements or adopting a HCFA-compatible system--HCFA believes that it does not have the legal authority to direct system standardization and consolidation. Internal Controls: Need to Strengthen Controls Over Payments by Medicare Intermediaries (GAO/HRO-89-8, Nov. 14, 1988) NCFA is experiencing problems in resolving claims processing errors concerning Medicare payments to institutions and needs to better use the results of external reviews in managing Medicare. HCFA has not ensured that intermediaries resolve potential claims processing errors identified by master record computer edits. This has resulted in a backlog of over 2 million unresolved errors as of JulY 1987. In reviewing 277 of these potential errors, GAO found 73 overpayments totaling $272,011 and 7 underpayments totaling $5,468. GAO projected that the three peer review organizations (PROs) had allowed millions of dollars in overpayments and underpayments. To more adequately ensure the appropriateness of Medicare payments to institutions, HCFA should more effectively use its internal controls and strengthen other controls. Long-Term Care for the Elderly: Issues of Need, Access, and Costs (GAO/HRD-89-4, Nov. 28, 1988)* In 1985, an estimated 6.2 to 6.5 million elderly depended on - others for help with activities of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activities of daily living. About 20 percent of --these dependent elderly lived in nursing homes; the majority lived in the community. :Nearly all of the'elderly in the community received all or some of their care from informal - -caregivers--family and friends. A'1982 survey noted that' despite - help-from family and friends, about 48 percent of the:elderly ' with one or more ADL dependencies still had unmet needsafor help. a Individuals with mental/behavioral problems and/or multiple AOL ' ' dependencies -who require. extra nursing -care and for whom ' payments 'willbe made by.Medicaid are likely to wait thelongest. . --, -: ' for-help.

Publicly funded health care programs--Medicare for the aged and Medicaid for the poor--pay less than half, with consumers paying the remainder. Private long-term care insurance offers potential to help defray these costs; it is intended to address these gaps and limitations in other insurance. Typically, such policies pay a set amount over a specified period for each day a policyholder uses a covered service. But policies vary considerably in terms of coverage, the amounts payable per day, and other conditions affecting policy value and cost. State approaches to regulating long-term care insurance vary greatly. Half the states have adopted specific legislation, although they vary in the degree to which they meet the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' recommended minimum standards. Many states allow insurers to use policy provisions that offer consumers less protection than recommended. While such provisions can result in lower policy premiums, they can adversely affect policyholders by (1) decreasing the likelihood that needed services will be covered and (2) increasing the risk of policy terminations for reasons other than nonpayment of premiums. Medicaid: Recoveries From Nursing Home Residents' Estates Could Offset Program Costs (GAO/HRD-89-_6,WMar. 7, 1989) Through asset recovery programs, states can recover from the estates of nursing home recipients or their survivors a portion of the expenses the state incurs in providing nursing home care. Estate recovery programs require Medicaid recipients whose primary assets are their homes to contribute toward the cost of their nursing home care in the same manner required of recipients whose assets are in the form of stocks, bonds, and cash. unlike the payments made from liquid assets, however, payments from the home's equity are deferred until the recipient and his or her spouse and dependent children no longer need the home. Estate recovery programs provide a cost-effective way to offset state and federal costs, while promoting more equitable treatment of Medicaid recipients. GAO studied Medicaid nursing home programs in eight states to determine the potential financial impact of asset recovery programs on Medicaid and whether they provide a mechanism acceptable to the elderly for sharing the costs of nursing home care. Medicaid: Some Recipients Neglect to Report U.S. Savings Bond Holdings (GAO/HRD-89-43, Jan. 18, 1989) In a limited test in Massachusetts, GAO identified 143 Medicaid nursing home residents whose individual bond holdings could render them ineligible for benefits. Their combined outstanding bond holdings totaled about $1.5 million. Most of the holdings were not reported on the individuals' Medicaid applications, even though the form used in Massachusetts specifically asks recipients to list government bonds/notes. Although the Social Security Act requires state agencies that administer certain federal benefit programs to verify income by comparing the income declared by program applicants and beneficiaries with information obtained from the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration (SSA), it does not require verification of U.S. savings bond holdings. The Department of the Treasury maintains such information on the value of savings bond holdings, but this information is not currently available to the states. To help prevent ineligible individuals from obtaining Medicaid benefits, GAO recommends that (1) procedures for verifying saving bond holdings be included in an Income and Eligibility Verification System and (2) the Secretary of the Treasury, upon request, make such information available to the states.580 Medicare: An Assessment of HCFA's 1988 Hospital Mortality Analyses (GAO/PEMD-89-llBR, Dec. 13, 1988)- HCFA has made several refinements in its analytical approach to hospital mortality analyses. It has (1) modified the composition of the 17 broad categories used to characterize the principal diagnosis of all Medicare patients, (2) reported outcomes of each hospital over several years rather than a single year, and (3) initiated studies to validate its analytical approach. However, its current analytical approach and associated validation efforts still have several limitations that diminish its ability to ensure the validity of its analyses. Until HCFA expands on its current efforts to validate its approach and to examine the effect of data deficiencies, it will be difficult to determine the actual proportion of hospitals that are correctly identified as having, or not having, quality of care problems. Medicare Catastrophic Act: options for Changing Financing and Benefits (GAO/HRO-89-156, Sept. 15, 1989)* Members of Congress and the public have expressed concern about the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, particularly about the amount of supplemental premium that higher.income Medicare beneficiaries will pay. In this report, which provides a summary of options available to either revise the benefits and financing under the act or phase out the program, GAO finds no \"painless way' to reduce beneficiary funding. Revenues from other sources will need to be raised or benefits provided under the act will need to be cut. Compounding the problem from a budget standpoint is that the act was designed to build a contingency reserve so that estimated revenues exceed estimated costs for the catastrophic program in its early years. Therefore, repeal of the program would increase the federal deficit for Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction purposes for the next few years. Medicare: Health Maintenance Organization Rate-Setting Issues TGAO/HRD-89-46, Jan. 31, 1989)* The report provides an overview to three broad topics of concern relating to current rate-setting methodology. These issues are the (1) accuracy of the forecasted adjusted average-per-capita cost (AAPCC) rates; (2) appropriateness of tying health maintenance organization (HMO) payment levels to county fee-for- service Medicare cost levels; and (3) potential of the current capitation payment system to adversely affect Medicare, its beneficiaries, and HMOs. Forecasts of future costs are made using relatively old data for the base period, because complete data on actual Medicare payments are generally not available until 3 years after a given time period. Thus, the data must be inflated to account for price increases over time and'adjusted for factors such as changes in utilization rates and patterns. Questions have been raised about whether the county is the appropriate unit of local rate-setting, and whether there are alternatives to using local fee-for-service Medicare cost as the means of setting HMO payment rates. While the capitation payment system creates strong' incentives for the efficient use of resources-and cost containment, AAPCC capitation in a fee-for-service environment also creates incentives that may hamper the achievement of Medicare's cost containment and quality-of-care goals. GAO will present the results of its analysis in later reports. Medicare: Impact of State Mandatory Assignment Programs on Beneficiaries (GAO/HR0-89-128, Sept. 19, 1989)5 Mandatory assignment laws reduced out-of-pocket health care costs for covered beneficiaries in four states that enacted laws requiring physicians, uinder certain circumstances, to accept Medicare's approved amount as payment in full. The Massachusetts law eliminated all billing by physicians that exceeded the amounts allowed under Medicare; the amount of savings in the other three states (Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Vermont) was less clear. Indicators developed by GAO suggest that physicians have not offset reducing bills for covered beneficiaries by increasing bills for noncovered beneficiaries. The volume and581 intensity of services provided by physicians to Medicare beneficiaries in three states did not increase as some people had feared. In Massachusetts, the volume and intensity of services increased, but the law's relative importance in causing this increase is not clear. Access to care was not reduced in the four states as a result of the mandatory assignment laws. Medicare: Incentives Needed to Assure Private Insurers Pay Before Medicare (GAO/HRD-89-19, Nov. 29, 1988) Medicare saved about $1.4 billion in fiscal year 1987 by paying beneficiaries' medical bills only after other responsible insurers had paid, but it is still paying many claims that other insurers should pay. While Medicare has taken steps to improve the information available for identifying claims that others should pay, insurers and contractors do not have adequate incentives to comply. Until they do, Medicare secondary payer provisions will not achieve all possible savings. Medicare: Indirect Medical Education Payments Are Too High (GAO/HRD-99-33, Jan. 5, 1989)- Under Medicare's prospective payment system, teaching hospitals receive extra payments. These payments are to compensate for higher patient care costs associated with providing graduate medical education. In fiscal year 1986, the additional payments were about $2.1 billion--$l billion for direct medical education costs and $1.1 billion for the indirect cost of medical education. GAO's analysis showed that the add-on payments to teaching hospitals for the indirect cost of medical education are too high, and GAO recommends reducing the teaching adjustments factor, which helps determine these payments. Medicare: PhYsician Incentive Payments by Prepaid Health Plans Cou Lower Quality or Care (GA 0HRO-89-29, Dec. 12, 1988)- Concerns have been raised that the incentive payments made to -physicians participating in Medicare may be so strong that they represent a potential threat to the quality of care by encouraging inappropriate reductions in service. Incentive features most likely to adversely affect quality are (1) shifting HMOs' risk to physicians, (2) distributing incentives based on individual physician cost performance, (3) paying a percentage of HMO savings on patients, and (4) measuring physician cost performance over a short time period. Strong HMO management controls are needed to identify and prevent physician behavior that adversely affects quality of care. Medicare: Program Provisions and Payments Discourage Hospice pat A This report discusses why hospices are not participating in Medicare, the reasonableness of hospice payment rates, and hospice quality requirements. At least one-half of the nonparticipating hospices sampled during GAO's national survey said the main concerns that led them not to participate in Medicare were (1) the language required in hospices' certification of terminal illness related to the certainty of the physician's prognosis of death, (2) the requirement that hospices obtain contracts with hospitals for inpatient services, (3) limits placed on aggregate payment amounts and inpatient days, and (4) payment rates. Medicare PRos: Extreme Variation in Organizational Structure and Activities (GAO/PEMD-89-7FS, Nov. 8, 1988)* The Utilization and Quality Control PROS operating under contract with the HCFA and provide nurse and physician review of hospital medical records for discharged Medicare patients. In fiscal year 1987 these contracts totaled $155 million. This fact sheet describes four aspects of PRO operations: (1) organizational characteristics, (2) review activities, (3) PRO objectives and interventions, and (4) relationships with other health and consumer groups in the state where the PRO is located.582 Medicare: Reasonableness of Health Maintenance Organization Payments Not Assured (GAO/'RD-89-41, Mar. 7, 1989) Under risk contracts, HMOs agree to provide all Medicare-covered services for a fixed monthly amount per beneficiary (capitation payment) and to experience a profit or loss depending on their cost to do so. Medicare law provides a payment safeguard to help ensure the accuracy of the methods used to calculate capitation rates. This safeguard, the adjusted community rate (ACR) process, is intended to prevent HMOs from retaining excessive profit from Medicare's payments. HCFA's process for reviewing, validating, and approving ACR submissions provides little assurance that the ACR process is meeting its payment safeguard objective. GAO's case studies of ACRs submitted by 4 HMOs and review of a random sample of ACRS submitted by 15 other HMOs showed that the process is susceptible to HMO manipulation and error. This is because HCFA does not always enforce its requirements that an HMO (1) use its own historic cost and utilization data as a basis for calculating its ACR, (2) follow the prescribed computational methods to account for differences between Medicare and commercial members' volume and cost of services, and (3) document the calculations. Medicare: Status Report on Medicare Insured Group Demonstration Projects (GAO/HRO-89-64, June 27, .l989)** The Secretary of HHS is authorized to conduct demonstrations of contracting on a prepaid capitation basis with Medicare Insured. Groups (MIGs) to provide Medicare benefits to retirees. A MIG must agree to provide the full range of Medicare-covered services to its Medicare-eligible retirees for a per capita rate of payment. The MIG's loss or surplus for servicing these retirees depends on whether its costs to provide the Medicare services are more or less than the capitation payment. HCFA has entered into cooperative agreements with Chrysler Motors Corporation, Southern California Edison Company, and Amalgamated Life Insurance Company to establish the three MIG projects authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. In April 1989, HCFA officials told GAO that they were not certain when any of these projects would become operational. Medicare: Statutory Modifications Needed for the Peer Review Program Monetary Penalty (GAO/HRD-89-18, Mar. 30, 1989). Medicare seeks to ensure that beneficiaries receive hospital care that is medically necessary and meets professionally accepted standards. To detect any violations of such standards, Medicare contracts with PROs to examine beneficiaries' inpatient hospital records. If they identify instances of improper or unnecessary -care that are gross and flagrant or numerous, PROs must report them to HHS's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and provide appropriate recommendations. In the most serious cases Medicare can exclude the provider from the program. If exclusion is not warranted Medicare can impose monetary penalties instead. The dollar penalty, however, is based on the cost of Medicare of the improper or unnecessary care, and this cost can be very small. In a 1987 memorandum, the OIG advised PROs not to submit cases with recommendations for monetary penalties unless the penalty would be cost effective. Specifically, the memorandum indicated that PROs should not recommend such penalties unless, among other things, (1) the provider displayed a pattern, rather than one or two instances, of unnecessary or poor-quality care and (2) the Medicare program improperly reimbursed the provider a significant amount of money. To make the PRO monetary penalty a useful alternative when exclusion is not appropriate, the Social Security Act should be amended by substituting a fixed dollar limit on monetary penalties for the current cost-based limit.583 U.S. Employees Health Benefits: Rebate for Duplicate Medicare Coverage (GAO/HRD-89-58, Mar. 23, 1989)- The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 extends catastrophic insurance protection to about 33 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries, including Medicare-eligible federal retirees. Many of these federal retirees are also enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). To finance the cost of the new catastrophic benefits, additional Medicare premiums were imposed. Because federal employees already pay premiums to have many of these medical costs covered under FEHBP, the Office of Personnel Management was directed to reduce FEHBP premiums to prevent federal retirees from paying twice for the same benefits. INCOME SECURITY ADP Budget: SSA's Fiscal Year 1990 Information Technology Systems Budget Request (GAO/IMTEC-89-60, June 28, 1989)- SSA's fiscal year 1990 information systems budget request for $204 million provides $160.5 million to fund ongoing data processing and telephone operations and maintenance. The request includes $43.5 million to fund capital investment projects directed at enhancing the capabilities of its information systems, such as acquiring additional ADP and telephone equipment, new software development, and related contractor services. ADP Planning: SSA's February 1989 Report on Computer Modernization Is Incomplete (GAO/IMTEC-89-6, Sept. 25, 1989) This report presents the results of a review of SSA's ADP report, which showed the context in which the agency's fiscal year 1990 information technology budget supports the larger mission of SSA and prepares the agency to meet its service demands through the year 2000. The report, however, does not identify the specific long-term ADP activities to be undertaken; the objectives of each activity; the personnel, equipment, and financial resources needed to accomplish them; or their milestones. SSA officials estimated that it could take the agency until September 1990 to develop such detailed information on its computer modernization activities. ADP Systems: SSA Efforts in Implementing Its Field Office Mdernization (GAO/IMTEC-89-45, May 17, 1989)* In 1982, SSA began the field office modernization project to provide for more rapid client service. The project called for increasing the number of computer terminals available to provide automated capabilities for entering information and making benefits calculations on new accounts, thereby eliminating the paper-oriented manual process. GAO found that: (1) SSA met its initial field office hardware installation schedule by installing 22,892 computer terminals and the new communications network in some 1,300 field offices and (2) SSA had redesigned portions of its retirement software and planned to complete this redesign by 1992. Also, SSA field office personnel believed the increased quantity of terminals and the ability to quickly access data base information for retirement and supplemental income accounts allow personnel to promptly answer client inquiries while clients are in a field office or on the phone. Age Discrimination: Use of Waivers by Large Companies Offering Exit Incentives to Employees (GAO/HRD-89-87, Apr. 18, 1989)1 GAO reviewed Fortune 100 companies' use of waivers to release employers from certain legal claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in special short-term exit incentive programs. These programs were designed to encourage employees' early departure through some form of financial incentive. About 80 percent of Fortune 100 companies sponsored an exit incentive program at least once during 1979-88. About 30 percent of these584 companies required their employees to sign a waiver as a condition for receiving enhanced benefits. Overall, the use of waivers increased during the years 1985-88 and was highest in 1987 and 1988. During those peak years, 35 percent of the companies with exit incentives used them. officials from companies that required waivers said such a practice protected the company from lawsuits. Companies not using waivers contended that they were unnecessary because of the voluntary nature of exit incentive programs and the adverse effect that waivers would have on employee relations. Computer Operations: Improvements Needed in Social Security's Capacity Management Program (GAO/IMTEC-89-8, Jan. 18, 1989) SSA has estimated that since 1982, it has spent about $643 million for its computer systems and planned to spend about 9170 million in fiscal year 1989 to maintain and further modernize its systems. SSA has not effectively performed capacity management activities needed to accurately assess its computer capacity needs. For instance, while the agency prepares various reports on total system utilization, these reports do not have sufficient detail at the transaction level; therefore, SSA cannot determine whether the current computer processing environment is operating effectively and efficiently. The agency has initiated improvements, but until they are completed, SSA cannot determine its ongoing capacity requirements and provide assurance that future computer acquisitions are justified. District's Workforce: Annual Report Required by the District of Columbia Retirement Reform Act (GAO/GGD-89-57, Mar. 22, 1989)*W The District of Columbia Retirement Reform Act provides for annual federal payments to the District of Columbia's Police Officers and Fire Fighters' Retirement Fund. These payments, however, are to be reduced when the disability retirement rate exceeds an established limit. An enrolled actuary determined the disability retirement rate to be 0.733 percent. Since this rate is less than the established limit of 0.8 percent, no reduction is required in the fiscal year 1990 payment to the fund. Employee Benefits: Company Actions to Limit Retiree Health Costs (GAO7HRD-89-319R, Feb. 1, 1989)* Company group health plans, generally financed at least in part by the companies, play a major role in giving retirees and their dependents access to life-saving services. However, significant and increasing costs, and the potential adverse effects on business operations from disclosing unfunded benefits, could prompt companies to take action to change their health plan provisions. GAO looked at the retiree health plans of 29 medium and large companies in the Chicago area and found the following. All 29 companies have the right to modify or terminate health benefits for active workers and retirees due to specific language in the plans. During the 4-year period 1984-88, all the - companies changed their plans by adding cost-containment measures to help ensure that the health services provided are medically necessary and qualify for coverage or by raising the amount plan participants pay for health coverage and for medical services received. Emploee Benefits: Companies'-Retiree Health Liabilities Large, Advance Fundlng Costl_ r uX/ RD-89-51, June 14, 1989)- Companies have been financing retiree health care for years. Although seen as a low-cost employee benefit decades ago, such care now has become a major concern for employers because of demographic and economic trends. Retiree health costs have skyrocketed, in part because there are more retirees than ever before--workers retire earlier and live longer. The growing cost has raised questions about the security of retiree health benefits and companies' ability to pay future costs. In contrast to pension plans, where moneys are set aside to pay future benefits, companies generally handle costs for retiree health benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis out of current revenue. By and large, companies do not prefund retiree health care costs. The Congress may wish to protect retirees' health care coverage by requiring employers to advance-fund such benefits or provide coverage that retirees can buy at group rates.585 Federal Employees: Early Retirements at the Defense Department in jisca, Year 19,3 iGA /GGD-9-5iS, _e. 2, l9H9) This fact sheet examined certain aspects of the Department ofDefense's (DOD's) management of the voluntary early retirementprogram authorized in fiscal year 1988 at the Army Material Command, the Army Aviation Systems Command, the Army TroopSupport Command, and the Air Force Air Logistics Center. Thefact sheet focused on the cost and possible adverse affects oflarge numbers of DOD employees electing early retirement. Federal Retirement: Use of Contractors to Implement the FederalEmployees Retirement System (GAO/GGD-89-29, Feb. 1, 1989) The use of contractors and other agencies by the office ofPersonnel Management (OPM), SSA, and the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to implement the Federal EmployeesRetirement System (FERS) was appropriate. OPM paid about $3.8million primarily to develop and print information to helpfederal employees better understand and compare the features ofthe new system and the Civil Service Retirement System. SSAcontracted through the Government Printing Office for anautomated system, using machine-readable forms to respond tofederal employees' requests for Social Security earnings andcoverage information at a total cost of $621,586. The ThriftBoard paid about $14.6 million primarily to develop and operatean automated recordkeeping system and to prepare, print, anddistribute materials and forms. Federal Workforce: Positions Eligible for Law Enforcementof icer Retirement Benefits (GAOGGD-89-24, Feb. 2, 1989)- Concern was raised that agencies may be inappropriately classifying jobs as law enforcement positions to help employeerecruitment and retention, since federal employees in the lawenforcement officer retirement program receive more generousbenefits that are more costly to provide than the retirement program for other employees. Various laws enacted since 1947allow employees in such positions to retire earlier and toreceive higher annuities for the same length of service to maintain a young and vigorous law enforcement work force. Themost recent data available showed that 44,646 employees werecovered by the special retirement benefits as of June 38, 1987.From January 1985 through June 1987, the Department of Justice's law enforcement work force increased by 5,588, and the Department of the Treasury's U.S. Customs Service law enforcement work forceincreased by 817. The majority of the new hires were placed inpreviously approved positions; thus, the new positions generally did not appear to contribute to the work force increase or to aid in recruitment and retention. Leveraged Buy-Out Funds: Investments by Selected Pension Plans(GAO'HRD-89-121, Aug. 1, 1989)T GAO's review of the extent to which eight selected pension plansponsors participated in limited partnerships, or leveragedbuyout (LBO) funds, which pool capital for buy-outs, showed thatthey have invested a relatively small portion of their assets in LBO funds. Most sponsors have received higher returns thanachieved on other plan investments. Further, the sponsors appearto be selective in choosing the funds to invest in, and most haddiversified their investments among different funds.586 Pension Plans: Labor and IRS Enforcement of the Employee Retirement Income becurlty Act (GAO/HRD-39-32, ian. 23, 989) - The Employee Retirement Income security Act of 1974 was enacted to eliminate mismanagement and abuses of private pension plan assets and to ensure that participants of these plans receive the benefits to which they are entitled. The Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service are responsible for enforcing the act's provisions. Labor's enforcement activities included: (1) an increase in the number of individual pension plan investigations closed from 1,259 in fiscal year 1985 to 1,323 in fiscal year 1987 and (2) an increase from about $42 million in fiscal year 1985 to about $106 million in fiscal year 1987 in the value of plan assets restored and transactions reversed as a result of its actions against plans with fiduciary violations. The Internal Revenue Service's efforts included increasing (1) the amount of excise taxes and penalties assessed from $7.9 million in fiscal year 1985 to $12.5 million in fiscal year 1987 and (2) the proportion of plans examined that were cited for .violations from 20.5 percent in fiscal year 1985 to 32 percent in fiscal year 1987. Poor Performers: How They Are Identified and Dealt With in the Social Securit mnis raon (GAO/GGD-09- 8, Jan. 27, 1989)* This report provides insight into how the SSA identifies and deals with poor performers. SSA's performance management system provides supervisors with a mechanism for dealing with poor performers.- Generally, the system produced positive results in cases where poor performance was identified. Although SSA experienced some success, GAO also learned that poor performers were not always identified and that the process for dealing with poor performers was not always used. Moreover, some supervisors said they would be reluctant to initiate performance actions against unsatisfactory performers in the future. Private Pensions: Plan Provisions Differ Between Large and Small Employers (GAO/HRD-89-l1S5R, Sept. 26, 1989)* employer-sponsored pension plans that qualify for preferential tax treatment must meet several federal rules designed to improve the equity and security of pension benefits. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that tax preferences for these plans will result in a $46 billion loss in tax revenue in 1989. The report focuses on the most prevalent types of pension plans in industries having most employer-sponsored plans. It describes some of the options thatjlarge and small companies sponsoring these plans chose in designing their pension plans to meet federal rules. GAO focuses on four provisions: (1) how long workers must wait to participate in the plans, (2)-how long workers must'wait to gain a legal right to receive earned benefits, or 'vest,\" (3) how plans coordinate or 'integrate' benefits with social security, and (4) how long workers must wait to be eligible for full retirement benefits. The report also., discusses the impact of some of the changes mandated by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Private Pensions: Portability and Preservation of vested Pension Benefits questions about'pension portability and preservation. Portability refers to the ability to transfer years of service credits or pension benefits from one employer to another. Preservation refers to encouraging workers to save , cashed out pension benefits for retirement income.-587 Railroad Retirement: Future Rail Employment and Trust Fund Solvency (GAO/HRD-89-30, Apr. 5, 1989)* Rail employment has steadily declined, from 1,688,000 in 1945 to 307,e00 at the end of 1988. A number of forces are at work that likely will cause this decline to continue to 200f,00 or less. The overall drop in rail employment since 1945 has been influenced somewhat by this country's evolution toward a more service-oriented economy. The principal causes were the loses of passenger and freight traffic to other means of transportation. Despite lower employment levels in the future, current projections show that the railroad retirement account should be able to pay benefits into the first decade of the next century. These projections show an improvement in the financial status of the program because of a 1988 payroll tax increase, the extension of federal contributions from general revenues, and changes in certain other actuarial assumptions. Social Security: Leadership Structure for an Independent Social Security Administration (GAO/HRD-89-154, Sept. 13, 1989)* On the basis of its own reviews of the management experiences of different agencies and studies by others, GAO concludes that a single administrator rather than a board would be the best management structure for SSA. Under a board form of organization, board members are, in principle, able to bring different points of view and different experiences to the decision-making process. GAO's work, however, suggests that, in practice, boards have not proven effective in providing stable leadership, insulating decisions from political pressures, and ensuring that diverse viewpoints are considered in the decision- making process. Conversely, the single administrator form of organization offers the advantage of allowing for clear delineation of authority and responsibility--an operational characteristic found in most successful public enterprises. Social Security: Results of Required Reviews of Administrative Law Judge DecSsions (GAO/HRD-89-489R, June 13, 1989) Social Security disability claimants whose initial benefit applications are denied may appeal through several layers of administrative and judicial review. The appeal process, however, is very time-consuming. For some claimants, even favorable decisions by administrative law judges (ALJs) are delayed because they are chosen at random for further review by SSAs Appeals Council. This random review process is carried out under the Bellmon Amendment. Early reviews under the amendment were directed at ALJs who issued favorable decisions in 78 percent or more of their cases and were so controversial they led to a lawsuit by the Association of ALJ2. GAO studied 5,860 cases reviewed by the Appeals Council in fiscal year 1985. About 91 percent of the decisions reviewed were approved without objection. Over 80 percent of the cases not approved initially by the Council eventually became benefit awards anyway. In total, only 1.6 percent of the cases reviewed initially were kept off the benefit rolls. Nonetheless, benefit savings resulting from Bellmon reviews appear to be significantly greater than estimated costs. Social Security: Staff Reductions and Service Quality (GAO/HRD- 89-106BR, June 16, 1989)* Morale at SSA has been identified as a problem in various surveys since 1986. SSA employees and managers attribute the low moraleprimarily to staff reductions, which have been underway since fiscal year 1985. In a 1988 GAO survey, SSA field office managers and employees ranked the quality of SSA's service in processing post-entitlement work loads lower than most of its other services. The agency has asserted that its quality of service has remained high over the last several years. Its most recent service quality reports submitted to the Congress in March 1989, generally indicates stable performance in the agency, with a major exception being the backlogs and processing time for bearings before ALJs, which have remained relatively high overthe last 2 years. (See GAO/HRD-89-37BR.)Social Security: Status and Evaluation of Aqency ManagementImerovement Initiatives (GAO/HRD-89-42, July 24, 1989) In March 1987, GAO issued a report on the management of SSA; it contained recommendations to improve program operations and better prepare for the future. SSA has made good progress in beginning to implement these recommendations. The Commissioner and her staff have exhibited much needed leadership in establishing agencywide goals and objectives and developing tracking systems to assure accountability. SSA has made a number of organizational changes, appointed a senior executive officer, and set up offices for financial management and strategic planning. It has also made substantive progress in setting up a structured planning process.and taken steps to integrate planning with budgeting. The Commissioner has instituted several major changes to improve the management of ADP, but SSA needs to appoint a full-time information resource manager to ensure that efforts are integrated and coordinated and support long-range goals. In some areas, however, additional management action is needed to redirect initiatives or to take more effective actions to correct.the problems pointed out in the management report. Social Security: Time Required to Approve and Pay Attorney Fees Can Be Re uce (GAO/NRD-89-7, Oct. 18, 1988)* A median of 7 months is needed-for attorney fees to be approved and paid by SSA. The approval and payment process involves five steps: (1) notice of disability decision, (2) benefit calculation,>(3). fee petition, (4) fee approval, and (5) fee payment. SSA can shorten the process by requiring attorneys tohave claimants sign fee petitions before they are sent to the hearing offices, which could save up to 30 days and by performing a detailed review of the entire process to determinewhere other efficiencies may shorten the process time. Social Security: The Trust Fund Reserve Accumulation, the Economy, and the Federal Budget (GAO/HRD-89-44, Jan. 19, 1989)' The Social Security Amendments of 1977 and 1983 moved the Old- Age, Survivors' and Disability Insurance trust funds away from their traditional, pay-as-you-go financing basis toward the accumulation of a substantial, though temporary, reserve. Revenues (mainly payroll taxes) were set higher than needed to cover current expenditures (mainly retirement benefits), causing the trust fund balance to grow. As annual trust fund surpluses accumulate, they are invested in special issue U.S. Treasury securities. That is, the cash receipts that are not currently needed to pay benefits are loaned to the Treasury, which uses that cash to meet its current requirements. In 1985, legislation was enacted that removed social security from the unified budget. Now budget documents routinely report separate totals for the .on-budget programs and the off-budget social security program. At the same time, however, the budget documents routinely combine the on-budget and off-budget financial results and projections into a single series of numbers, labeled the 'total deficit.\" In fiscal year 1988 thesocial security trust funds had a surplus of $39 billion. The rest of the government ran a deficit of $194 billion, and together with the social security surplus, this produced a combined deficit of $155 billion. The budgetary reality is that the payroll taxes are being used to finance the current operations of the government and are masking the size of the on-budget deficit. The economic reality is that the trust fund reserves consisting of Treasury securities that are financing current consumption rather than productive . investment are illusory. They will remain so until the rest of the government achieves approximate balance between revenues and outlays.589 Social Security: Views of Agency Personnel on Service Quality and Staff Reductions (GAO/HRD-89-37BR, Feb. 10, 1989)* GAO was asked to obtain the views of SSA personnel on the quality of the agency's service to the public and the impact of staff reductions. Questionnaires were mailed to a sample of 467 managers and 643 employees in SSA's district, branch, and hearing offices in June 1988. Both employees and managers said that quality of service to the public has gone down and that morale had gone down due to staff reductions. (See GAO/HRD-89-106.) Software Maintenance: SSA's Use of Its Software Maintenance Package (GAO/IMTEC-89-38, June 15, 1989) One important measure of a computer program's quality is how well it is structured. A well structured program is clearly organized; its logic is apparent and easily understood by a programmer. In contrast, a poorly structured program is not well organized; its logic is complex, making it difficult to understand, and increasing maintenance time and cost. Between June 1987 and September 1988, SSA periodically evaluated the quality of the batch programs supporting its retirement system using a measurement package. GAO analyzed the package's evaluation of these programs and found that 1,992 of the 2,441 retirement systems programs evaluated appeared to be poorly structured. SSA had not taken full advantage of the benefits of the measurement package because it had not (1) developed a complete inventory of its programs, (2) ensured that programs are consistently named, or (3) issued specific written guidance to managers on using the package. VETERANS Financial Audit: Veterans Administration's Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1987 (GAO/AFMD-89-69, Sept. 15, 1989) This report presents the results of GAO's audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Veterans Administration (which became, in March 1989, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1988 and 1987. In addition, it addresses the financial condition of VA's life insurance and housing credit assistance programs, which are designed to be financed primarily from self-generated revenues. The report contains separate reports on VA's system of internal accounting controls and on its compliance with laws and regulations. Financial Management: Opportunities for Improving VA's Internal Accountin Controls and Procedurea GAOAAFMD-89-35, Aug. 1 1989) VA has demonstrated a commitment to strengthen financial management and was one of the first federal agencies to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the federal government. However, GAO's audit disclosed weaknesses in internal controls, which VA has subsequently initiated actions to correct. The principal weaknesses GAO found were: (1) a lack of financial reporting systems that automated the financial system consolidation process and financial statements; (2) a lack of effective internal controls in the medical care, veterans' benefits, and housing credit assistance areas that are intended to ensure proper recoveries of cost and accuracy of account balances; and (3) inadequate automated payroll system controls for ensuring that all VA employees are paid correctly and on time. VA Benefits: Law Allows Compensation for Disabilities Unrelated to Military Service (GAO/HRD-89-60, July 31, 1989) In fiscal year 1986, the VA paid about 88.4 billion in compensation benefits to 2.2 million veterans disabled by injuries or diseases incurred or aggravated during military service. On the basis of a random sample of 480 veterans590 receiving compensation, GAO estimated that about 19 percent of the compensated veterans had disabilities resulting from diseasesthat were probably neither caused nor aggravated by military service. Many of the diseases were related to heredity or lifestyle rather than to military service. Based on the sample,GAO estimates that benefits paid for these types of disabling diseases totaled about $1.7 billion in 1986. Current law doesnot require VA to determine if military service was a contributing factor in the cause of a disease; the Congress maywish to reconsider whether these diseases should be compensated as service-connected disabilities. Any such changes should beprospective in order not to affect veterans already receiving compensation benefits. VA Health Care: Allegations Concerning VA's Patient MortalityStudy (GAO/HRD-89-80, May 18, 198\\ - GAO was asked to examine allegations that the VA altered the design of its patient mortality study to obtain results more favorable to the agency. It was alleged in a newspaper article that VA's Chief Medical Director ordered that the confidence level used in calculating the number of VA medical centers that had higher-than-expected mortality rates be changed from 95 to 99 percent in order to arrive at a lower number of hospitals withpotential quality assurance problems. Based on information provided by VA, GAO cannot conclude that the Chief Medical Director or any agency official inappropriately attempted to givethe appearance that it had fewer hospitals with higher-than- expected mortality rates than actually exist. VA Health Care: Delays in Awarding Major Construction Contracts (GAO/HRD-89-75, Mar. 31, 1989)^ VA was given funding in fiscal year 1988 for 15 major construction projects, each estimated to cost $2 million ormore. Public Law 100-202 required that (1) working drawings contracts be awarded by September 30, 1988, and (2) constructioncontracts be awarded by September 39, 1989. VA reported that, asof September 30, 1988, working drawings contracts for 2 of the 15fiscal year 1988 projects and construction contracts for 3 of the 11 fiscal year 1987 projects had not been awarded as required. Information provided by VA officials indicated that variousprogrammatic considerations caused the contracting delays. Themost common reasons cited for delays were changes in the projects' scope or design or receipt of bids that exceeded the available funds. VA Health Care: Few Veterans Denied Care at Florida Clinics (GAO/HRD-89-69, May 31, 1989)* Concern was raised that VA clinics might be denying care to large numbers of veterans who apply for outpatient medical carein high-demand areas. GAO visited 4 of the 14 VA clinics in Florida, which VA considers to be a high-demand area. GAO estimates the four clinics denied outpatient care to less than 1.4 percent of the applicants during fiscal year 1988. Theseapplicants were denied care because either they were not eligible to receive care at VA clinics or the services needed were not available. VA Health Care: Improvements Needed in Procedures to AssurePhysicians Are Qualified (GAO/HRD-89-77, Aug. 22, 1989)' Verifying physicians' credentials and examining their ability toperform specified procedures are important elements of an effective quality assurance program. Despite legislation requiring VA to improve its credentialing and privileging processes, GAO found after reviewing eight medical centers during 1987-88, that problems still exist. State licenses werenot being consistently verified with state boards; residents' backgrounds were not being adequately checked; privileges were not reviewed in a timely manner; credentialing and privileging decisions were not documented; physicians found to be deficient did not have their privileges formally reduced; and the names ofphysicians found to be incompetent were either not submitted tostate licensing boards and/or the Federation of St~ate MedicalBoards or not submitted in a timely manner.591 VA Health Care: Language Barriers Between Providers and Patients Have Been Reduced (GAO/HRD-89-40, Mar. 8, 1989)* Public Law 95-201 requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enaure that VA health care personnel have the basic proficiency in spoken and written English to carry out their responsibilities satisfactorily. VA's efforts since the law was enacted have significantly reduced the problems with English language proficiency among its direct health care providers. VA Health Care: Resource Allocation Methodology Has Had Little Impact on Medical Centers' Budgets (GAO HRD-89-93, Aug. 18, 1989,) * VA's Resource Allocation Methodology (RAM) is designed to link medical centers' budgets to actual work load and to provide a financial incentive for centers to improve their efficiency. Since 1985, VA has used RAM to transfer funds, through its budget formulation process, from less efficient medical centers to centers judged to be more efficient. The RAM-related adjustments to medical centers' fiscal year 1989 budgets generally represented less than 2 percent of the total dollars budgeted. The budget adjustments were small in relation to the centers' budgets because VA established a maximum amount that a center's budget would be increased or reduced in order to cushion the RAM's financial impact. In addition, as medical centers incur expenses that cannot be financed through their existing budgets, the centers' directors can request further funds from regional directors. The regional directors thus serve as safety nets to help centers cope with financial pressures caused by RAM-related budget adjustments. Veterans' Benefits: Improvements Needed in Processing Disability Claims (GAO/HRD-89-24, June 22, 1989)' Each year VA pays more than $14 billion for disability benefits and processes more than 600,000 initial and reopened applications for these benefits. GAO investigated numerous allegations about VA's claims-processing practices and found that the rate of occurrence for most of the alleged problems was very low or did not appear to adversely affect benefit decisions. Significant problems, however, were found in these areas: notices to veterans concerning VA decisions on disability claims did not give veterans meaningful information; development of claims was sometimes inadequate; and claims were not always controlled promptly. Overall, these problems resulted in adverse effects on veterans in about 13 percent of both the compensation and pension claims. With the exception of notice problems, it was difficult to identify any single cause of these problems. Veterans' Benefits: Improvements Needed to Measure the Extent of Errors in VA Claims Processing (GAO/HRD-89-9, Apr. 13, 1989) Each year VA pays about $14 billion in compensation and pension benefits to about 3.8 million veterans and their defendants or survivors, and about $125 million in burial benefits to veterans' survivor or estates. VA relies on Statistical Quality Control (SQC) system to determine the extent of errors made in adjudicating claims for these benefits. VA's SQC system does not provide reliable estimates of the extent of errors made in processing claims because (1) its case sampling is not consistently random; (2) regional staff performing SOC reviews are not independent of claims processing; and (3) the central office does not ensure that the regions comply with SQC procedures or that they report errors accurately. Moreover, the system does not break out error rate data by program. As a result, VA lacks the information needed to produce accurate reports or take corrective actions within a given program. VA can improve the reliability of its measurements of claims adjudication quality by addressing these problems.592 Veterans' Benefits: Need to UPdate Medical Criteria Used in VA's Disability Rating Schedule (GAO/HRD-89-28, Dec. 29, 1988) VA cannot ensure that veterans are given accurate and uniform disability ratings because the rating schedule has not'been adjusted to incorporate the results of many recent medical advances. Without current medical criteria, it is difficult for rating specialists to classify a disease or injury correctly. As a result, veterans may be assigned inconsistent ratings, and some veterans may be undercompensated or overcompensated. To better ensure t)at the rating schedule serves as a practical tool in assigning uniform disability rates, VA should (1) prepare a plan for a comprehensive review of the rating schedule and, based on the results, revise medical criteria accordingly and (2) implement a procedure for systematically reviewing the.rating schedule to keep it updated. OTHER aging Issues: Related GAO Reports and Activities in Fiscal Year 1988 (GAO/HRD- 9-38, Jan. 26, 1989)- This report lists GAO issued products--35 reports, 10 briefing reports, and 3 fact sheets--concerning activities of the elderly. It also lists 59 assignments in process as of September 30, 1988. The reports cover various topics, such as age discrimination and health care. APPENDIX II APPENDIX II FISCAL YEAR 1989 GAO REPORTS ON ISSUES AFFECTING THE ELDERLY AND OTHERS GAO issued 28 reports in fiscal year 1989, on policies and programs in which the elderly were one of several target groups. Of these, 8 were on social and other services, 7 on health, 5 on veterans issues, 4 on income security, and 4 on housing issues. An asterisk after the report title indicates that the review was performed at the request of Committees or Members of Congress. Two asterisks indicate that the work was mandated by statute. HEALTH ADP Planning: FDA's Plans to Improve.Processing of Medical Device and Drug Applications (GAO/IMTEC-89-58, June 13, 1989) As part of its mission, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for assuring consumers that medical devices and drugs are safe and effective for their intended uses. Responsibility for reviewing and approving medical device and drug applications is divided between two centers within FDA. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health, which reviews medical device applications, has prepared an automated data processing system to improve the quality and timeliness of its application reviews. The Center estimates that carrying out its plan will cost $3 million through fiscal year 1993. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which reviews drug applications, has not prepared a plan. The Center is, however, participating in several activities aimed at improving'its drug- review process, and Center officials say that they are developing a plan.593 ADP Systems: Better Control Over States' Medicaid Systems Needed (GAO/IMTEC-89-19, Aug. 2, 1989)\" The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and the states depend heavily on automated systems to manage and control the annual $48 billion in Medicaid program costs. GAO reviewed 129 state requests for federal funds, submitted between November 1985 and July 1988, to either acquire or enhance automated Medicaid systems. GAO found that because HCFA has not issued guidelines concerning the requirement for states to prepare cost-benefit analyses, HCFA approved 116 of these requests--costing about S119 million--without the means to determine if the projects would be worth their costs or whether the most cost-effective alternative was selected. In addition, GAO noted that HCFA funds 90 percent of the costs of approved state enhancements to automated Medicaid systems, rather than 75 percent, as specified in federal guidelines. Health and Human Services Issues (GAO/OCG-89-10TR, Nov. 1988) This report highlights actions that should be taken in four critical areas affecting the large and diverse operations of the Department of Health and Human Services. The areas include improving departmental management, containing the cost of health care, enhancing the financing and delivery of social security benefits, and implementing the recently enacted welfare reform legislation. Medicaid: Federal Oversight of Kansas Facility for the Retarded Inadequate (GAO/HRD-89-85, Sept. 29, 1989) One month after it was terminated from the Medicaid program in 1987 for deficiencies deemed to pose an \"immediate and serious threat\" to the health and safety of its residents, the Winfield (Kansas) State Hospital and Training Center for the mentally retarded was reinstated as a Medicaid provider. Staff abuse of residents, resident neglect, inadequate medical and nurse services, inadequate dental services, and poor sanitation were the deficiencies cited for termination. Controversy surrounding the reinstatement of the facility, after so short a time, led to a request for GAO to determine whether the regional office complied with Medicaid requirements in its oversight of Winfield. This report contains our analysis of the facility's termination from the Medicaid program and its subsequent reinstatement. Mental Health: Prevention of Mental Disorders and Research on Stress-Related Disorders (GAO/HRD-89-97, Sept. 12, 1989)* In 1980, the Congress amended the Public Health Service Act to give special attention to efforts, both at the national and at the state and local levels, to prevent mental disability. As of April 1989, however, GAO found that the national prevention goals, priorities, policies, and programs required by the 1980 amendment had not been established. The Deputy Director for Prevention and Special Projects at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is responsible for carrying out the requirements of the amendment. GAO believes that the Deputy Director lacks the resources and authority to accomplish the task. In addition, only one person has served as the Assistant Administrator for Prevention at the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration since the position's creation in 1983; he was appointed in August 1985 and served until June 1987. During fiscal year 1987, NIMH funded 42 grants, totaling over $9 million, that investigated loss-related stress and effective measures to prevent the development of stress-related disorders. However, the Institute's stress-related activities were spread among several divisions with no central direction.594 Prescription Drugs: Information on Selected Drug Utilization Review Systems (GAO/PBND-89-18, May 25, 1989)e GAO was asked to provide information on the extent to which drug utilization review systems can identify adverse reactions that may result from (1) the interaction of the prescribed drug with one or several other drugs, (2) the interaction of the prescribed drug with a known physical condition or illness, (3) the interaction of a prescribed drug with over-the-counter drugs, (4) incorrect dosages, and (5) the under- and over-utilization of the prescribed drug. The systems reviewed were those at Giant Pharmacies, Long Pharmacies, Thrift Pharmacies, Walgreen Pharmacies, National Data Corporation, Clinical Screening Program, Home Shopping Network, and the Tri- Service Mirco Pharmacy System of the Department of Defense. In summary, the information needed to identify adverse reactions through the drug utilization review system and the patient profiles is currently available in at least some operating systems. In addition, issues concerned with data security were dealt with, to some degree, by all systems. Prescription Drugs: HCFA's Proposed Drug Utilization Review System Ignores Quality or Care Issues (GAO/PEMD-89-26BR, July 13, 1989) Current research on prescription practices for the elderly clearly indicates that inappropriate drug prescription can cause adverse drug reactions, which can lead to drug-induced illness, hospitalization and even death. In addition, inappropriate drug prescription leads to enormously wasteful expenditures by the government, private insurance companies, and of course, the recipients of these prescriptions. The Medicaid Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 covers outpatient prescription drug costs for an estimated 17 percent of the elderly and provides a mechanism for checking the safety of drugs for all the elderly who use a participating pharmacy. This mechanism is an electronic drug utilization review system for prescription at the point of sale. The review system function proposed by HCFA is very basic with regard to drug information to be produced: it will only compare drug-to-drug interactions for a limited number of drugs. Several important issues remain unresolved. It is also questionable whether HCFA's system will meet the legislative objectives of being operational by January 1, 1991, and be consistent with the law's requirements. HOUSING Housing and Urban Development Issues (GAO/OGC-89-22TR, Nov. 1988j This report on the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) describes GAO's concerns about two important issues that need closer attention--low-income housing and homelessness. If these issues are not addressed, the Secretary of HUD can expect (1) continuing decreases in the supply of rental housing that is available and affordable to low-income people and (2) a growing national homelessness problem. In this report, we offer a wide range of observations and suggestions on how the Secretary can best address these concerns. Housing Conference: National Housing Policy Issues (GAO/RCED-89-174, Aug. 1989) GORE-914 For many years, the federal government has played an important role in ensuring and providing an adequate and affordable supply of decent safe, and sanitary housing for many citizens. However, since 1980, federal funding for housing programs has been reduced substantially for some programs, and others have been targeted for further reduction or even elimination. The Congress and the administration have again begun to emphasize the need for immediate attention to programs that would provide an adequate and affordable supply of housing, including housing for the homeless. This staff study was sponsored by GAO to help it plan its future work on the problems of availability and affordability of housing for low-income households, homeless individuals and families, and first-time buyers. In view of the recently disclosed problems in mismanagement at the HUD, GAO also plans to undertake studies of internal controls in various HUD programs.595 Partnersh Ir s: e o ublic-Private Housing and ~Iihmnt Efforts iGA.fPHO892SH Sept 14, 1VUP)' This fact sheet focuses on federal programs that support public- private partnerships in housing and community development. It describes federal programs currently supporting partnerships and, in particular, four characteristics of those programs: (1) purpose, (2) types of assistance, (3) mediating agents, and (4) target populations. Tax Policy: Costs Associated With Low Income Housing Tax Credit Partnershp (GAO GGD-89-109FS, July 10, 1989) The 19 publicly offered partnerships being marketed for low income housing tax credit projects on average use a higher proportion of equity to pay fees and expenses than those for residential and residential/commercial investments. The low income housing partnerships devote an average 27 percent of equity for fees and expenses, while the other types of investments use about 21 percent for this purpose. According to industry analysts, the proportion of fees and expenses spent by these low income housing partnerships are generally within guidelines issued by the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. INCOhE SECURITY Eployee Stock Ownership Plans: Allocation of Assets in Selected Plans (GAO/HR0-89-91, June S, 1989) Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are recognized under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act as a type of defined contribution plan. Unlike other defined contribution plans, ESOPs have multiple purposes. In addition to providing retirement or deferred income to participants, their objectives include (1) improving productivity by giving workers an owner's stake in the success of the company, (2) broadening stock ownership and transferring company ownership to employees, and (3) providing a way to finance company operations or buy out existing owners. GAO reviewed nine ESOPs established in 1985. The data obtained on the nine plans showed that their ownership of company stock ranged from 2.2 to 160 percent; five plans owned less than 15 percent and four owned over 50 percent. Individual participant account balances ranged from $467 to $38,311. All nine plans allocated assets based on participant salaries. In three plans, the participants with the highest percentage of ESOP assets were company officers who also held company stock that was not in the plan. Federal Compensation: Premium Taxes Paid by the Health Benefits Program (GAO/GGO-89-102, Aug. 8, 1989)- State and other governmental entities impose premium taxes on insurance underwriters that service participating plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. In 1987, 22 of the 25 participating fee-for-service plans charged the health benefits program about $44 million for premium taxes imposed by the 5s states and other entities, including the District of Columbia and the Republic of Panama. These taxes are included in the plans' premiums charged to enrolles and the federal government. In 1988, the Congress exempted Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Program premiums from similar premium-based taxes because it considered the program to be self-insured and because states generally do not tax self-insured programs. Since the health benefits program operates in a similar fashion, the Congress may want to consider exempting the health insurance program from premium taxes as well.596 Social Security: Selective Face-to-Face Interviews With Disability Claimants Could Reduce Appeals (GAO/HRD-89-22, Apr. 20, 1989)^ Nearly two-thirds of the people who apply to SSA for disability benefits are initially denied them. The state Disability Determination Service (DDS) makes the initial disability determinations for claimants. Many appeal this decision, asking for reconsideration; some appeal to an administrative law judge (ALJ). ALJs reverse DDS decisions in over 60 percent of the cases they decide, often disagreeing with DDS determinations about claimants' remaining ability to work. Some of these appeals might be avoided if DDS interviewed selected claimants at the reconsideration stage. To date, the limited experience with face-to-face interviews at the reconsideration stage suggests that these interviews improve decisional quality and resolve some cases that would otherwise go to ALJs for appeal. SOCIAL AND OTHER SERVICES Block Grants: Federal-State Cooperation in Developing National Data Collection Strategies (GAO/HRD-89-2, Nov. 29, 1988)* Current flexibility of states in collecting data on block grant programs contrasts markedly with data collection requirements under previous programs, which required states to adhere to federal standards. The Congress, in an effort to receive uniform data, legislated the development of model criteria and standardized forms for some block grants that relyheavily on voluntary state cooperation. Through this approach the data were timely, and officials in the six states GAO reviewed--California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and virginia--perceived the collection efforts to be less burdensome. However, data collected through this approach for block grants were not always comparable across states. National leadership in developing standard forms and definitions can improve data comparability. Community Development: Distribution of Small Cities Funds by PennsylvanDa (uAD/RCEu-59-1I1, May 3, 19Jv) Under the Community Development Block Grant, Small Cities Program, funds are allocated to the states on a formula basis for the development of viable communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expending economic opportunities for. low- and moderate-income persons. GAO was asked to review the methodology Pennsylvania used to distribute its funds. Some of GAO's findings showed that the state's methodology for estimating the percentage of low- and moderate-income persons is not consistent with the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The act says that estimates should be developed using income criteria and income data for the same year. Pennsylvania's methodology compared 1979 income levels with 1983 income criteria. The result is that the number of communities that are predominately of low and moderate income is higher than if HUD's estimates were used. The Department believes that the methodology the state uses overestimates the low- and moderate-income population in certain areas and has required the state to use HUD's estimates or some other appropriate alternative to distribute Small Cities funds. Financial Audit: Food and Nutrition Service's Financial Statements for 1987 (GAO/AFMD-89-22, Mar. 15, 1989) This report examines the statement of financial position of the Food and Nutrition Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, as of September 30, 1987. This is the first year that the Service's financial statements have been subjected to an audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. In addition, we also report on our study and evaluation of the Service's internal accounting controls and on its compliance with laws and regulations.597 Food Stamp Program: Administrative Hindrances to Participation (GAO/RCED-89-4, Oct. 21, 1988). States have adopted a number of procedures to assure eligibility for Food Stamp Program benefits and ensure that needy people receive the appropriate amount of assistance in the most economical and efficient way possible. However, under certain circumstances, procedures adopted by the states GAO visited (California, Illinois, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Texas) have prevented or delayed eligible households from applying for food stamps and participating in the program. For example, GAO found that two offices conducted normal business only four days each week, which limited access to food stamp services; all local offices in one state and one local office in each of two other states did not consider applicants for expedited benefits or provide expedited benefits on time; and three local offices in one state did not always help applicants obtain the documents they needed to complete their applications. Food Stamp Program: Participants Temporarily Terminated for Procedura Honcom liance (GAO RCED-89-91, June 22, 1989)- The Food Stamp Program is designed to provide low-income household members additional food-purchasing power to help them acquire an adequate low-cost diet. However, eligible program participants can be temporarily terminated from the program if they do not comply with procedural requirements. GAO, on the basis of its sample, estimates that about 49 percent of the households in Georgia and about 68 percent in Wisconsin experienced breaks in service. Participant- caused breaks resulting in benefit losses were caused by participants not (1) submitting timely monthly reports, (2) providing requested verification documents, (3) notifying their local office regarding the nonreceipt of stamps, or (4) meeting work requirements. Other participant-caused breaks were due to participants not filing timely or complete new applications for recertification. Food Stamps: Reasons for Nonparticipation (GAO/PEMD-89-5BR, Dec. 8, 1988)* In both 1979 and 1986 slightly more than half of the households eligible for food stamps did not participate in the program because they did not think they were eligible. Approximately one-third of the 58 percent who did not think they were eligible thought their assets or income were too high for the program. About two-thirds of the eligible nonparticipants who thought they were eligible for benefits did not try to get food stamps. The reasons this group gave most frequently for not participating in the program were: (1) they did not need the benefits and (2) they were concerned about the likely administrative 'hassles.\" Montana Indian Reservations: Funding of Selected Services, Taxation of Real Property (GAO HR_-89-lsR, Oct. 11, 1988), This briefing report contains information applicable to the Blackfeet, Flathead, Fort Balknap, and Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservations in Montana. Specifically, it mentions (1) state and county health care and social services for Indians, (2) funding information for school districts serving Indian students, and (3) taxes billed by counties for real property located on the reservations and taxes not billed due to the tax-exempt status of trust and tribally owned properties. Parental Leave: Revised Cost Estimate Reflecting the Impact of Spousal Leave (GAO/HRD-89-68, Apr. 6, 1989)1 GAO was asked to estimate the cost of adding a provision allowing 10 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a seriously ill spouse to H.R. 770, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1989. H.R. 770 permits an employee to take up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave over a 2-year period upon the birth or adoption or placement for foster care of a child, or the serious health condition of a child or parent, and up to 15 weeks every year for personal illness. Upon returning to work, the employee is guaranteed the same or equivalent job. The legislation requires employers to continue health benefits for workers while on unpaid leave on the same basis as if they were still working, but does not require the continuation of other employee benefits. The598 proposed provision would provide the same job protection and health benefits for spousal leave. The estimated cost of H.R. 770 to employers having 50 or more workers would be about $188 million annually. If the legislation is expanded to include leave to care for a seriously ill spouse, the cost increases by $142 million to about $330 million annually. When firms employing between 35 and 49 people are included, the cost of H.R. 770 is estimated to be $212 million annually, which increases to $368 million annually when the provision to care for seriously ill spouses is included. VETERANS Defense Health Care: Patients' Views on Care They Received (GAO/HRD- 89-137, Sept. 13, 1989)- Overall, patients expressed satisfaction with the care they received in all nine military treatment facilities GAO surveyed. High percentages of patients said they would want to go again to the same facility, for both inpatient and outpatient care. Despite generally favorable ratings, 53 percent of the outpatients and 39 percent of the inpatients commented negatively on some element of the care they received. Each facility surveyed had established patient representative programs to handle complaints and conduct surveys. Defense Health Care: Workload Reductions at Military Hospitals Have Increased CHAMPUS Costs (GAO/HRD-89-47, July 10, 1989)^^ The first.priority of military hospitals is to treat active duty members. When space, staff, and other resources are available, however, they also care for military retirees and dependents. For outpatient care, these beneficiaries can choose between military facilities and civilian hospitals and physicians under Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). The amount and cost of care provided under CHAMPUS have increased in part because the amount of care provided to beneficiaries at military facilities has declined. Other reasons for CHAMPUS cost increases include increases (1) overall in the cost of providing medical care, (2) in the number of military beneficiaries, and (3) in the rate at which they utilize the medical care system. DOD has initiated several actions designed to increase the availability of services at military facilities and reduce CHAMPUS costs. These initiatives, however, have not been in operation long enough to determine their impact. DOD Health Care: Issues Involving Military Nurse Specialists (GAO/HRD-89-20, Mar. 29, 1989)^ various private sector nursing organizations had expressed concern that military nurse specialists--nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners--are not being granted the administrative and clinical responsibilities that their training justifies. Nurse specialists are individually privileged or authorized to perform specific functions (e.g., initiate, alter, or terminate medical care regimens) within established medical protocols and service guidelines. As matter of practice, however, DOD physicians are ultimately responsible for the care provided to patients in military treatment facilities. For this reason; a health care provider who is not a physician may not practice totally independent of a physician. Other issues raised involved military nurse specialists' promotions and their input to DOD policy. According to DOD officials, nurse specialists who are promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel (Army and Air Force) or commander (Navy) and higher ranks may be required to assume supervisory or management responsibilities. In most instances, however, they will also continue to do clinical work within their specialties. Concerning input to policy; according to most specialty advisers, their input is solicited and used by the services but less so in DOD.599 DOD Health Care: Occurrence Screen Program Undergoing Changes, but Weaknesses Still Exist (G AO/ Jan. 5, 1989)- Occurrence screening is one of several elements in the DOD's hospital quality assurance program. it involves a review of patient records by trained personnel who use designated criteria to identifyoccurrences that represent deviations from normal procedures orexpected outcomes. Examples include a patient who had a drug ortransfusion reaction or was unexpectedly returned to an operatingroom after initial surgery. Substantial numbers of occurrences werenot being identified during the initial screening process. DOD's.recent policy changes were designed to improve the utility of theprogram at the hospital level and were needed to achieve greateracceptance of the program by the hospitals. The extent to whichthese changes help to improve individual hospitals' programs willdepend on how the hospitals and services design and implement theirprograms within the revised policy framework. DOD Health Care: Extent to Which Military Physicians Performminstrative Tasks (GAO/H.R 8s3, Feb. 13, l989)* Concern was raised that military physicians were spending timeperforming office management tasks, such as answering phones andtyping documents, that would be better spent providing medical care.There is general agreement within DOD and the military services thatphysicians are performing clerical and administrative tasks and thatthis detracts from their clinical practice time and adversely affects their productivity. Although the full extent of the administrative support problem and its effects are unknown, DOD health care professionals agree that it is a serious matter requiring priorityattention. Each service has initiated or planned various actions toaddress this issue, but the impact of these actions may not be felt for a long time. APPENDIX III APPENDIX III FISCAL YEAR 1989 TESTIMONY RELATING TO ISSUES AFFECTING THE ELDERLY GAO testified 26 times before congressional committees duringfiscal year 1989 on issues relating to older Americans.

CHAIRMAN: Thank you for the opportunity to provide the Special Com- mittee on Aging with information regarding the Legal Services Corporation's activi- ties related to meeting the legal needs of older Americans. I hope that the enclosed material is useful to those who will be using your Com-mittee s publication. Sincerely, KENNETH BoEHm, Director, Offrce of Policy Development and Communications. THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION ADDRESSING OLDER AMERICAN'S LEGAL NEEDS The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was created by Congress in 1974 to help pro- vide legal assistance to the poor in civil matters. LSC is responsible for the adminis- tration of awarding grant money to local community legal services offices through- out the country. These local offices, in turn, hire advocates to provide day-to-day legal assistance to the poor. Each legal services office follows certain guidelines as to the types of cases it accepts and the financial eligibility of possible clients. During 1989, Congress appropriated over $308 million to provide legal assistance to the poor through LSC. The approximately 324 regularly funded LSC grantees, throughout the country, maintain over 1,150 local offices, staffed by over 6,380 advo- cates (attorneys and paralegals). These advocates were responsible for closing 1,396,796 cases nationally, during 1988. Approximatley 13 percent of those clients were over age 60. While LSC provides the majority of funding for these services, additional income sources, such as other federal funds, state and local grants, and Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (IOLTA) programs, continue to provide significant resources. These additional funds for LSC grantees totaled over $129 million during 1988. Of this amount, over $11 million alone was provided by the Federal Goverment through the Older Americans Act, to provide services for senior citizens. Additional funding from private sources continues to climb each year with IOLTA funding leading the way in growth. In addition to the funding of local legal services providers, LSC also funded or ad- ministered a variety of other major programs which increased the provisions of legal services.to older Americans. These programs included the 1988-89 and 1989-90 Law School Civil Clinical Programs, the National Senior Citizen's Law Center, and Legal Counsel for the Elderly. This report will give an overview of those programs. 1988-89 LAw SCHOOL CIVIL CLINICAL PROGRAM For the academic year 1988-89, LSC funded a total of 26 law school clinics. Eight of those schools concentrated their efforts throughout the year in assisting elderlyclients. University of Denver School of Law.-The Univeristy of Denver received $50,000 to broaden outreach efforts to disadvantaged elderly clients from the Denver, Colo- rado area in consumer, housing, family, public benefits, health care, insurance, and Wills. Indiana University at Indianapolis School of Law.-Indiana University chose to combine grants from LSC and the Department of Education to expand services to the elderly who suffer from disabling illnesses. Particular emphasis for the LSC grant of $20,604, is to expand supporting services to deal with Medicare, Medicaid, medical insurance, nursing home and home health care legal services. Gonzaga University School of Law, University Legal Assistance.-Gonzaga Univer- sity chose to target senior citizens as one of three primary focus groups for legal services to be provided under its $48,349 grant. The grant funds enabled student in- terns to expand administrative agency and housing legal assistance for the elderly in Spokane, Washington. Thurgood Marshall School of Law, Texas Southern University.-Thurgood Mar- shall School of Law was granted $45,110 to expand its elderly law clinic. Areas of focus included wils, taxation, public benefits, housing, and protective services. The clinic continues to emphasize preventative legal education as well as direct client service to the elderly in Houston, Texas. Southern Illinois University at Carbondale School of Law.-Southern Illinois Uni- versity, also a Title m recipient, was granted $49,448 to expand its ongoing program611 of providing legal assistance to the elderly in southern Illinois. The clinic will con- centrate its efforts on providing services to minorities, the homebound, and nursing home residents in such areas as family law, public benefits, and adult guardianship. Sixty Plus Law Center, Thomas M Cooley Law School.-The Sixty Plus Law Center was granted $50,000 to continue its programs of assisting client services by the Medicare Recovery Project. The Project will assist residents of skilled nursing facilities in Michigan in appealing denials of Medicare coverage. Columbus School of Law, The Catholic University of American.-The Columbus School of Law was granted $49,981 to continue its Advocacy for the Elderly Clinic. The clinic was founded in 1985 with a grant form the Legal Services Corporation. The clinic specializes in servicing the homebound with an emphasis on the legal problems created by physical immobility, and mental incapacity. In addition to health care issues, the clinic assists Washington, D.C. residents with the legal prob- lems surrounding guardianship and institutionalization. Benjamin N. Cardoza School of Law, Yeshiva University.-The Cardoza School of Law was granted $50,000 to continue delivery of legal services to the homebound and hospitalized elderly poor in New York City. The clinical program also assists other legal services providers with research, model pleadings, and memoranda on elderly issues. 1989-90 LAW SCHOOL CIVIL CLINICAL PROGRAM For the academic year 1989-90, LSC awarded grants to a total of 19 law school clinics, five of which concentrate their efforts throughout the year in assisting elder- ly clients. SUNY at Buffalo Law School.-SUNY received $53,320 to continue to fund a health law clinic for the elderly. The clinic has been recognized as a solid service delivery program which proposes to address the needs of a comparatively high number of clients. This clinic has become recognized for its expertise in Medicaid and Medicare and has educated the private bar and public agencies in these areas. Southern Illinois University at Carbondale School of Law.-Southern Illinois Uni- versity, also a Title HI recipient, was granted $55,956 to continue its ongoing pro- gram of providing legal assistance to the elderly in southern Illinois. The clinic will concentrate its efforts on providing services to minorities, the homebound, and nurs- ing home residents in such areas as family law, public benefits, and adult guardian- ship. Students address the legal needs of residents in 13 rural southern Illinois counties. Proposed case closure numbers are comparatively high at 700-900 cases.

CHAIRMAN: I am pleased to report to you on the fiscal year 1989 activi-'ties of the National Endowment for the Arts involving older citizens.This year realized the implementation of the Local Programs Model Demonstra-tion Projects for older and disabled persons. Seven grants totalling $100,000 wereawarded to municipal and county art agencies for improving access to the arts forthese persons in their local communities. In addition, we are developing a first-timepublication about museum accessibility for older and disabled visitors in cooperationwith the Institute for Museum Services and the American Association of Museums.The book should be a valuable resource for administrators of a wide variety of mu-seums, both large and small. In addition, our report documents how Endowment grantees conduct audience de-velopment for older adults through ticket discounts, transportation, touring tohealthcare facilities and community centers, and educational outreach. Others de-velop programs focusing on issues related to aging or expressing the ideas and feel-ings of older Americans. Because the arts are lifelong professions, recipients of ArtsEndowment support include many older visual, performing, and literary artists.Through such support, the Arts Endowment seeks to affect the lives of all Ameri-cans, diverse in age, culture, and interests. Thank you for this opportunity -to present the Special Committee on Aging withthis documentation of the Arts Endowment's efforts to increase older Americans'participation in the arts. Sincerely, JOHN E. FROHNMAYER, Chairman. NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES.RELATING TO OLDER AMERICANS FISCAL YEAR 1989 INTRODUCrION The National Endowment for the Arts' mission is \"to foster the excellence, diver-sity, and vitality of the arts in the United States and to help broaden the availabil-ity and appreciation of such excellence, diversity, and vitality.\" The arts are inevery person. Art can expand the fullness of human -life and it is our task to makethe arts available to all. If we succeed, our society will be richer for it. -The Endowment encourages greater access to and participation in the arts, believ-ing that exposure.to artistic experiences of highest quality contributes to the qualityof life for all persons, including older adults. Through grants awarded to individuals and organizations, as well as its own pro-gramming, the Arts Endowment works to assure continued involvement of olderadults as creative artists, students, volunteers, audience members, and patrons. OFFICE FOR SPECiAL CONSTITUENCIES Established in 1976 by the National Council on the Arts, the Office for SpecialConstituencies works to make the arts more available for people who are older, dis-abled, or living in institutions such as long-term care facilities. This office:-Assists individuals and organizations to design arts programs that are accessibleto special constituencies.-Initiates collaborative projects with other Federal agencies to educate adminis-trators and professionals about the benefits of arts programming for special con-stituencies. -Advocates increased attention to the needs of special constituencies through En-dowment Programs, and through State, regional, and national meetings thatare concerned with the arts and/or special constituencies.613 -Advises Endowment staff and grantees regarding program accessibility and compliance with Federal regulations. -Develops model projects with Endowment Programs which demonstrate innova- tive ways to make the arts available to special constituencies. Most significant is the Office's liaison with Endowment Programs, for the Arts Endowment rejects the notion that special or different programs should be devel- oped for older persons. Instead, the Endowment chooses to find ways to open exist- ing programs of high quality to all Americans. OLDER ADULTS' THEATRE During this decade, theatre groups by and for older people have developed across the country in a variety of settings such as senior centers, retirement communities, schools, colleges, and community and professional theatres. Many groups are pri- marily therapeutic or recreational in nature. Others focus on artistic quality, employ professional artistic directors, and receive funding through the Arts Endow- ment. For example, theatre groups that received FY 1988 support from the Arts En- dowment accomplished the following: Living Connections, in Batesville, AR, was supported by an Endowment Arts- in-Education subgrant from the Arkansas Arts Council to a local school for a 10-month residency by Donna Wallace, a theatre director and educator. Living Connections, a troupe of 10 older actors, performs at senior centers, healthcare facilities, and public schools in rural Arkansas. During the past two summers, they served two residencies at the Sheriff's Boys Ranch for abused youths where they created intergenerational plays that were performed at a communi- ty festival. The Oldsters in Detroit, MI, received an Endowment Theatre Program grant through its sponsor, the Attic Theatre. This inner-city group began in 1977 with a CETA grant to train older actors and subsequently became Attic Theatre's outreach group that continues to present original material throughout south- eastern Michigan. Oregon Senior Theatre Ensemble, in Portland, OR, received funding from the Endowment's Expansion Arts Program to tour an original musical revue to rural communities in Oregon. This group tours extensively, having appeared throughout Oregon, northern California, Louisiana, Washington, DC, and Canada. All three groups, composed of actors between 60-90 years old, develop their own material from cast members' real-life experiences, resulting in performances of un- usual vitality and veracity. Bonnie Vorenberg, Artistic Director of Oregon Senior Theatre Ensemble and editor of New Plays for Mature Actors, says older performers \"are at a time in their lives when they have a need to comment on life, and theatre provides that forum.\" Kevin Beverly found that The Oldsters have a remarkable sense of savvy, \"getting right to the core of the drama. From the director's stand- point, they are a great resource, sensitive to all kinds of problems.\" He feels that performances by older actors are enriched by the diverse experiences of their own lives. The primary message conveyed by theatre for older people is one of empowerment for the present and hope for the future. Vorenberg believes that her theatre gives younger people inspiration for their later years and an impetus to fulfill their own potential. This was exemplified by a 6-year boy who said, following the Ensemble's performance: \"I will never worry about growing old.\" Donna Wallace hopes that au- diences for Living Connections share her actors' \"reaffirmations of life as a continu- ation. Aging is not an ending.\" REGIONAL ACCESS SYMPOSIUM State arts agencies' staff need encouragement and direct assistance in making their agencies more accessible, and in educating grantees on how to make programs more available to older and disabled people. Because the Special Constituencies Office has received many requests from State arts agencies for this kind of help, the Coordinator met with directors of the seven regional arts agencies to discuss conven- ing a series of access symposiums for State arts agencies and other grantees. Mem- bers of the Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation (representing nine States) voted unani- mously to convene the first symposium on July 9-10, 1990 in Washington, DC. The event will feature panels and workshops on model efforts by art organiza- tions, and presentations by groups and individuals representing special constituen- cies. Topics will include audience development, and new technologies for accessibil- ity. Other workshops will focus on design solutions and access training for grantees.614 The conference itself will serve as a model, demonstrating ways to conduct a com-pletely accessible meeting. The Special Constituencies Office hopes to engage otherregional arts agencies in hosting similar symposiums across the country. LOCAL PROGRAMS' MODEL DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS The Special Constituencies Office worked with staff and the advisory panel of theEndowment's Local Programs to develop one-time guidelines for local arts agenciesto create model demonstration projects which encourage greater access to arts ac-tivities for special constituents. Through this effort, local arts agencies are encouraged to demonstrate leadershipby generating incentives and supporting programs that will affect change. Specificobjectives are to develop, implement and document ways to involve more older anddisabled people in the arts. Emphasis is placed on integrating older adults into cur-rent arts activities rather than developing new or separate programs. Most impor-tant, older people are involved in determining accessibility needs, carrying out theproject, and evaluating the results. Local Programs awarded a total of $100,000 to local arts agencies. For example:Bronx Council on the Arts, in Bronx, NY, will train staff at 20 senior centersand healthcare facilities to make the arts more available to visually impairedindividuals. The trainers include representatives of service agencies for visuallyimpaired persons and arts organizations, as well as space designers and artistswho work with visually impaired people. At ten centers, visually impaired olderpeople will create theatre, music, or visual arts projects as models for othersenior centers. Community Programs in the Arts and Sciences (COMPAS), in St. Paul, MN,will hire professional writers to teach creative writing seminars for older adultsat ten sites.around the state. Each site will organize two public readings at acommunity center and a healthcare facility. Local writers will coordinate writ-ing support groups. In addition, COMPAS will help staff develop larger audi-ences and self-sustaining programs. Council for the Arts in Westchester, in White Plains, NY, will provide accessworkshops for arts administrators representing diverse art forms. The projectincludes incentive grants to help them implement access plans. More than 20arts organizations will participate in a discounted admission program for thoseon fixed incomes. To market the arts to older and disabled individuals, thecouncil will develop large-type playbills, a \"hot-line\" using a telecommunicationdevice for deaf individuals, and a radio broadcast calendar.Metropolitan Arts Commission, in Portland, OR, will identify resources andresearch about arts accessibility, which will result in publication of: (1) 40,000copies of a program and facility guide for older and disabled visitors; and (2) 300copies of a marketing manual concerning older audiences. In addition, the Com-mission will hold a regional conference on accessibility for arts administrators.To celebrate improved access, the Commission plans an arts festival for theentire community. Kaw Valley Arts and Humanities, in Kansas City, KS, will collaborate withAccessible Arts, Inc. and the Wyandotte Players to improve access to the arts inWyandotte County. For example, older adults will be trained to provide individ-ual assistance to visually impaired youth in an after-school arts program, culmi-nating in the creation of murals at healthcare centers. Further, actors, direc-tors, and board members at Wyandotte Players will participate in awarenesstraining and develop a 3-year plan to make their facilities and programs moreavailable to older and disabled persons. Documentation of these projects will be disseminated to local arts agencies acrossthe country by the Special Constituencies Office through its technical assistance ma-terials, and through arts service organizations such as the National Assembly ofLocal Arts Agencies. DESIGNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR PERSONS wITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE During FY 1988-89, the Center for Architectural and Urban Planning Research atthe University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee received grants from the Endowment'sDesign Arts Program to develop Holding on to Home, a guidebook for designers toplan environments for people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Prop-erly planned interventions, sensitive to the needs of persons with degenerative dis-abilities and their caregivers, can help assure more independent functioning. Thisproject made possible the translation of principles for planning and design into pro-615 totypical designs for daycare and respite centers, group homes, and renovated long- term care facilities. More than 1.5 million citizens have Alzheimer's disease, including 60-70 percent of all residents in long-term care centers. Degenerative disabilities such as Alzhei- mer's disease are not a normal result of aging. Symptoms range from impaired memory and judgment to total loss of neuromuscular functioning. Authors Uriel Cohen and Gerald D. Weisman present solutions that ensure safety and security, maximize awareness and control within one's environment, provide opportunities for socialization, and protect privacy. These design principles include non-institu- tional character, elimination of architectural barriers, inclusion of things from the past, sensory stimulation without stress, and opportunities for interaction with others. For example, not only do many persons with Alzheimer's disease experience diffi- culties with steps due to weak muscles or stiff joints, but they often become disori- ented. Consistent environmental cues can help alleviate confusion. Design solutions include making doors to residents' rooms a different color than doors used by staff, and providing uniform color coding of fixtures such as bathroom faucets and kitch- en appliances (e.g., hot things red, and cool things blue). The book is readily comprehensible and useful to both experts and laypersons. One of the first efforts to link environmental design and caring for persons with Alzheimer's disease, Holding on to Home will be published in 1990 by Johns Hop- kins University Press. INTERAGENCY ACTIVITIES To extend arts accessibility as broadly as possible, the Arts Endowment collabo- rates with other government agencies and private organizations which share common objectives. Museum Access Publication An interagency agreement was developed with the Institute of Museum Services (IMS) to produce a resource guide to help museum professionals make their collec- tions fully accessible to older and disabled people. The publication will comprise 20 case studies of exemplary programs in a variety of museums, both large and small, throughout the country with specific data sufficient for replication. An annotated bibliography will list articles, pamphlets, books, films, and videotapes about accessi- ble programs, such as Museums Opportunities for Older Persons, a booklet for those who wish to serve as volunteers or staff. This effort responds to needs expressed by museum administrators who are frus- trated by low attendance of special constituencies, and by expenditures and complex undertakings beyond the scope of their small budgets and staffs. The publication may resolve some of these problems by providing examples of successful programs to emulate, as well as resources to assist in these efforts. The Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art (NMAA) provided the ini- tial research for the book. Working with a consumer advisory committee, NMAA developed the National Survey of Accessibility in Museums that was sent to 2,000 museums across the country; 40 percent of the museums responded. This research uncovered a broad spectrum of exciting projects to help museum professionals devel- op accessible programs and bring greater visibility to these issues. On May 9, 1989, the Special Constituencies Office developed a cooperative agree- ment with the American Association of Museums (AAM) to produce the book. In spring of 1990, the Endowment and IMS will convene a panel to recommend the 20 museums to feature in the book. AAM will then work with the Arts Endowment to produce the book. As the major national service organization for museums with ex- cellent marketing capability, AAM can assure broad distribution. In addition, the Arts Endowment and IMS will distribute 2,000 free copies to grantees. Design for Aging Project The Special Constituencies Office has a cooperative agreement with the American Institute of Architects (AIA) to update the Design for Aging computerized bibliogra- phy (as listed in Design for Aging: An Architect's Guide, produced by AIA with En- dowment support). Researchers at the University of Michigan conducted a compre- hensive search to identify and organize information published since 1978 that would be useful to architects and others working in design for aging. This research ex- panded the database from 100 to 4,000 citations. The AIA plans to update the data- base annually.616 ARTS ENDOWMENT FUNDING The Arts Endowment supports programs in the design, literary, media, perform-ing, and visual arts that involve people of all ages. In addition, many activitiesfunded by the Arts Endowment specifically address older Americans. The followingare examples of these projects and fellowships as listed under the Arts EndowmentProgram providing the grant: PROGRAM SUMMARY OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS ARTS IN EDUCATION Seneca Indian Historical Society, in Irving, NY, is developing a curriculum modelfor teaching Native American arts such as beadworking and woodcarving. Classestaught by Seneca elders at the Wolf Clan Teaching Lodge will be videotaped; eldersnot able to travel will be videotaped on the reservation or in their homes. Curricu-lar materials will be published for use in Native and other schools to pass the skillsof older masters on to future artists. DANCE Choreographers'Fellowships were awarded to six older tap dancers to assist theirindividual artistic growth: Eddie Brown, Los Angeles, CA;James Buster Brown, of New York City; Charles C.

The public will experience the work in specially decorated wheelchairs with built-in sound systems. The event will include a visit to a critical healthcare facility. Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, at the University of Illinois in Urbana/ Champaign, presents a wide variety of programs for older adults including special performances and education in cooperation with senior centers, healthcare resi- dences, and social services agencies. For example, Medicare, a musical group com- prised of retired facility, performed for an audience of 500. In another activity, senior volunteers, foster grandparents, and children participate in \"Meet-the-Artist\" programs. ITERATURE Community Writers' Project, in Syracuse, NY, conducts 5-week creative writing workshops, biannually, at five senior centers in rural and urban areas. Sessions are open to the public to assure intergenerational involvement. The Metropolitan Com- mission on Aging publishes an anthology of works written during the workshops.

NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES DECEMBER 7, 1988. DEAR SENATOR PRYOR: I am pleased to enclose a report summarizing the major activities for or about the aging supported by the National Endowment for the Hu- manities in fiscal year 1989. Many of the projects that received Endowment support during the past yeareither involved older Americans as grant recipients or project contributors or were of particular interest to them. Several also specifically addressed older persons as an audience or aging as an issue. But the potential of NEH for older Americans doesnot stop there. The products resulting from all Endowment programs are available to older Americans for their personal enjoyment and enrichment-from the books and articles written by humanities scholars to the film and radio programs andreading and discussion groups supported by our General Programs division. The State humanities councils have also been very active in developing programs for or about the aging, and a number of their efforts are summarized in the report.Anyone wishing further information on the State councils' activities in this area isinvited to contact NEH or any one of the councils. I hope that you and your committee will find this material useful. Please let me know if we can be of any further assistance. Sincerely, LYNNE V. CHENEY, Chairman. Enclosure. NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES REPORT ON ACTIVITIES AFFECTING OLDER AMERICANS IN 1989 I. THE MISSION OF THE ENDOWMENT The National Endowment for the Humanities was established by Congress to sup- port the advancement and dissemination of knowledge in history, literature, philoso- phy, and other disciplines of the humanities. NEH grants sponsor scholarship and research, promote improvements in education, and foster greater public understand- ing and appreciation of our cultural heritage. Grants are awarded in response to unsolicited project proposals and on the basis of evaluative judgments informed by a rigorous process of peer review. The agency does not set aside fixed sums of money for work in any discipline or for any particular area of the country or group. As a result, there is no grant program at NEH specifically for senior citizens; nor is there a funding category within the agency expressly designed to support the study of aging or the elderly. Rather, projects for or about senior citizens may receive sup-port through the full range of Endowment programs. Although the Endowment does not have programs specifically related to aging,NEH-supported books, lectures, exhibitions, productions for radio and television, li-brary reading and discussion programs, and adult education courses help bring the humanities to senior citizens. In addition, each year a number of scholars, 65 or older, receive NEH funding to conduct research in the humanities, while others assist the Endowment by serving on grant review panels or as expert evaluators. II. PARTICIPATION BY OLDER AMERICANS IN NEH PROGRAMS Older scholars compete for Endowment support on the same basis as all other similarly qualified applicant Applications for funding are evaluated by peer panels and specialist reviewers, Endowment staff, the National Council for the Humanities, and the NEH Chairman. Only applicants whose proposals are judged likely to result in work of exemplary quality and central significance to the humanities receive sup- port. However, anyone may apply for an NEH grant, and no one is barred from con-sideration beause of age. Each year numerous projects are funded that involve olderpersons as primary investigators, project personnel, or consultants. The Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities is the highest official award the FederalGovernment bestows for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities. Since its establishment in 1972, the lecture has provided an opportunity for 19 ofthe Nation's most highiy regarded scholars to explore in a public forum matters ofbroad concern in the humanities. Not coincidentally, many of the scholars so hon- ored have been among the most senior members of their profession. Bernard Lewis,who will deliver the 1990 Jefferson Lecture, Walker Percy, Robert Nisbet, and Cleanth Brooks are among the American scholars, 65 years of age or older, whohave received this honor in recent years.620 Older scholars are particularly evident in several types of research and teaching projects supported by the Endowment's Fellowships and Seminars division and Re- search Programs division. Of course, this is merely a reflection of the depth and breadth of knowledge that many senior scholars bring to their work in the human- ities. In a number of cases, older scholars are receiving NEH support to continue long-term collaborative research projects that they have directed and sustained for many. years. Several projects conducted by scholars, 65 years of age or older, illus- trate the excellent research and teaching currently being done with NEH support by these older Americans. In FY 1989, the Endowment awarded: -$22,750 for an NEH Fellowship that is helping independent scholar Helen Tanner to produce a history of the Caddo people on the Red River frontier in the American Southwest. -$750 that enabled Peter Guenther, professor of art history at the University of Houston, to travel to Nuremberg in order to conduct research for a study of German Expressionism. -$86,923 that will enable Leonard Thompson, professor of history at Yale Univer- sity, to direct an NEH Summer Seminar for Colege Teachers entitled \"The Po- litical Mythology of Racism.\" -$110,000 that is supporting the efforts of Frederick Burkhardt, under the aus- pices of the American Council of Learned Societies, to prepare an edition of the correspondence of Charles Darwin. This project, which the Endowment has sup- prted since 1974, has resulted in the publication of three volumes. -$125,000 that will enable Lloyd Kasten, emeritus professor of Spanish and Por- tuguese at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, to complete the Dictionary of Alfonsine Prose. At the conclusion of the grant, this long-term project will result in the publication of six volumes totalling 2,500 pages. -$80,000 to David H. Donald, Charles Warren professor of American history at Harvard University, to support the research and writing of a biography of Abraham Lincoln. In 1961, David Donald was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his biography, Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War. Older Americans also participated in NEH programs by serving as grant review panelists, specialist reviewers, or members of special advisory groups. Ellen F. North, professor of classics at Swarthmore College; John H. Fisher, John C. Hodges, professor of English at the University of Tennessee; Marjorie Kaufman, Emma B. Kennedy, professor of English at Mount Holyoke College; and David H. Pinkney, professor of history at the University of Washington are among the senior scholars who contributed their time and talent in this way during FY 1989. In some cases, older Americans without scholarly training have contributed to En- dowment-sponsored projects by providing invaluable information. For example, sev- eral NEH-supported projects to document or preserve the unique cultures of Native American peoples are heavily indebted to older tribal members for their, in many cases, irreplaceable resources of memory and understanding. In FY 1989, a total of $169,995 was awarded for two projects that are compiling dictionaries of the Hopi and Siouan native American languages. Another $56,023 was awarded for a project to collect, transcribe, translate, and annotate the oral traditions of the Tlingit, a major tribe of the Pacific Northwest. Some of the programs for the general public that the Endowment supports also depend upon the substantive contributions of older Americans. For example, in FY 1989 the Endowment awarded $75,000 to the Museum of the City of New York for an exhibition commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1939 New York World's Fair. A variety of educational programs is being offered in conjunction with this ex- hibit, including special \"Senior Days\" and a series of activities that will effect an intergenerational partnership between the schools and senior centers by pairing ele- mentary-aged children with older adults. Of course, the Endowment achieves its greatest impact among older Americans when they read books, attend public programs, or participate in educational activi- ties made possible by an NEH grant. The humanities programs for the general public supported by the Endowment through our Division of General Programs and many of the formal learning opportunities supported through our Division of Educa- tion Programs reach large numbers of older persons. Higher Education in the Humanities.-According to statistics released by the De- partment of Education, 39 percent of the students enrolled in institutions of higher education in 1986 were 25 years of age or older and 42 percent were attending class- es on a part-time basis. Adults of all ages are now returning to college to take courses outside of the regular undergraduate schedule or sequence. The Endow- ment's Higher Education in the Humanities program offers support for institutions seeking to make humanities study more accessible to these adults, who may not be621 adequately served by the conventional structures of higher education. Because con-tinuing education programs are typically offered in local communities at sites suchas community colleges, high schools, or public libraries-sometimes supplementedby telecommunications hookups with an instructor at a central location-such pro-grams are particularly well suited to the needs of older persons. As in all Endow-ment programs, NEH-supported projects for adult learners are intellectually sub-stantive and thoroughly grounded in the scholarship of the humanities.Humanities Projects in Media.-Television productions supported by the Endow-ment are ideal for older people who cannot or prefer not to leave their homes.Widely acclaimed programs such as the series of dramatic literary adaptations,American Short Story and Life on the Mississippi; the biographical documentary,Huey Long; and Voices and Visions, a 13-part series chronicling the achievements ofAmerica's outstanding contemporary poets, have been viewed by millions through-out the county. Or, elderly persons who have visual handicaps may find Endow-ment-sponsor radio programming best suits their needs. For example, the Endow-ment supported the broadcast over National Public Radio of five of Eugene O'Neill'splays during 1988, the centennial year of his birth. Tell Me A Story, NPR's long-running series of half-hour programs in which major contemporary authors readfrom their short stories and comment on the creative process, and the series of fea-tures on art history and criticism on NPR's daily arts program, Performance Today,are two more examples of outstanding radio programs that have aired recently withEndowment support. Information about NEH-sponsored media programs is routinely provided to orga-nizations working for special groups, including the elderly. For many elderly peopleconfronting problems such as impaired vision, reduced mobility, and isolation, En-dowment-funded media programs not only provide individual access to the human-ities but can also provide the context for stimulating group activities and discus-sions. Humanities Projects in Museums and Historical Organizations.-In this program,the Endowment encourages museums or historical organizations receiving Federalfunding to waive entrance fees for the general public on certain days, an effortwhich helps make cultural programming more accessible to retired persons livingon a fixed income. In recent years, a number of the institutions that have receivedNEH support for interpretive exhibitions have begun to establish a continuing rela-tionship with local senior centers.Humanities Projects in Libraries and Archives.-By sponsoring reading and dis-cussion programs for adults in public libraries, this Endowment program is helpingto make intellectually stimulating activities available to senior citizens in their localcommunities. For example, in FY 1989 the Southern Connecticut Library Councilreceived $194,540 to support a series of programs in 60 libraries and at severalsenior centers. The participants read and discuss selected American biographies andautobiographies and reflect on contemporaneous events in American history, suchas the Great Depression and World War II. In New Jersey, Stockton State Collegereceived $89,751 to produce a program of lectures, book and film discussions, andtraveling photo exhibitions entitled \"Women, War, and Peace: An Examination ofan American Experience in the 20th Century,\" which considers the roles of womenin the military services and in various antiwar movements. In all, the Endowmentawarded $1.5 million during FY 1989 for programs that will offer older adultsthroughout the country an opportunity to read and talk about important books andissues, and a great many more reading and discussion programs were supported bythe 53 State humanities councils. III. EXAMPLES OF NEH GRANTS SPECIFICALLY FOR OR ABOUT OLDER AMERICANS Since FY 1976, the Endowment has awarded approximately $3.3 million to theNational Council on the Aging for its 'Discovery Through the Humanities\" pro-gram. Throughout a network of over 1,500 senior centers and other sites participat-ing in this project, volunteer leaders guide small groups of senior citizens thoughactive, in-depth discussions of the work of prose writers, poets, artist, philosophers,scholars, anc critics. Project staff prepare and distribute thematically organized an-thologies and ancillary instructional materials and provide training and technicalassistance to discussion leaders. The fourteen anthologies currently in use include:\"A Family Album, The American Family in Literature,\" \"Images of \"Amer-icans Life,\" and\"The Search for Meaning.\" Each anthology is designed to stimulate the group par-ticipants to relate what they read to their own experience and to universal humanissues. Ranging between 100 and 300 pages in length, printed in large print type,622 and attractively illustrated with paintings, sculpture, and photographs, each anthol- ogizes material from history, philosophy, and literature; both the classics and con- temporary authors are represented. In FY 1988, the National Council on the Aging received $70,935 to continue and to broaden the \"Discovery Through the Humanities\" program. During the Constitu- tional Bicentennial period of 1987-89, the program is stimulating thoughtful discus- sion of constitutional issues through its newly developed anthology, \"The Family, The Courts and the Constitution.\" During the past fiscal year, the Endowment made three other awards for projects designed to inquire into aging-related issues or to make available materials or ac- tivities of interest to the elderly: -$3,500 for a Summer Stipend that will enable a scholar at the College of Woos- ter in Ohio to conduct research on concepts of old age and aging in classical Greek literature. -$750 that has enabled an historian at Arizona State University to travel to the National Archives in order to examine documentary sources for a study of older workers in the United States, 1850-1950. -$24,930 to the National Council on the Aging to implement a series of reading * and discussion programs on railroad history that will be presented in six West- ern States. The programs, linked to the 1989 centennials of Washington, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming, are being produced in collaboration with NCA-affiliated resource centers for older adults and with the six State humanities councils. IV. STATE PROGRAMS AND THE AGING The State Programs Division of the Endowment makes grants to humanities coun- cils based in the 50 States, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. These councils, in turn, competitively award grants for humanities projects to institutions and organizations within each State. State humanities councils have been authorized to support any type of project that is eligible for support from the Endowment, including educational and research projects and conferences. The spe- cial emphasis State programs, however, is to make focused and coherent humanities education possible in places and by methods that are appropriate to adults. Examples of projects for older Americans or about aging-related topics that re- ceived State council support during FY 1989 are presented below. ARIZONA The Arizona Humanities Council awarded a grant to fund a seminar on the ethi- cal issues that face persons as they age: health care, values that govern life, and models for ethical decisions. MINNESOTA The Minnesota Humanities Commission supported a series of humanities courses for older adults that covered a wide range of humanities topics including ethics, his- tory, ethnic studies, and the history and criticism of the arts. Faculty from area col- leges and universities, many of whom have had previous experience in adult educa- tion, served as discussion leaders. NEW HAMPSHIRE The New Hampshire Humanities Council supported a series of programs entitled \"Philosophical Discussion for Older People.\" Five philosophers taught a total of 10 non-credit, weekend courses at libraries and retirement homes throughout the State. Focused primarily on European and American philosophy, the courses are in- tended to help the participants gain further insight into their lives and philoso- phies. NORTH CAROLINA The North Carolina Humanities Council supported an effort by the University of North Carolina at Ashville's North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement to pro- vide humanities reading-discussion programs for older adults in four rural counties. The programs are being held in conjunction with organizations such as libraries, senior centers, churches, and retirement communities.623 Funded projects Grantee: Individual, FE-23197-89, Professor in United States, 1850-1950.Grantee: Individual, FT-32448-89, Professor Thomas $3,500Title: Concepts of and Aging in Classical Greek Literature.

NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION DECEMBER 4, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Your letter of October 11, 1989, to the Director of the Na-tional Science Foundation (NSF) was referred to me since this Directorate providesmost of NSF's support for research on aging.It is a pleasure to report on the activities of NSF related to aging and the con-cerns of the elderly. As stated in the enclosed report, the Foundation does not haveany programs directed specifically toward issues related to aging. However, basicand applied research projects having both direct and indirect bearing on this impor-tant area of national concern are supported through the Foundation's regular re-search grant programs. Most such projects have been supported through the Divi-sion of Emerging Engineering Technologies in NSF's Directorate for Engineering,and through the Divisions of Behavioral and Neural Sciences, and Social and Eco-nomic Science in the Directorate for Biological, Behavioral and Social Sciences.If you would like additional information, please do not hesitate to call on me.Sincerely, MARY E. CLUTTER, Assistant Director.Enclosure. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION REPORT FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN AGING The National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the ExecutiveBranch, was established in 1950 to promote scientific progress in the United States.The Foundation fulfills this responsibility primarily by supporting basic and appliedscientific research in the mathematical, physical, environmental, biological, social,behavioral, and engineering sciences, and by encouraging and supporting improve-ments in science and engineering education. The Foundation does not supportprojects in clinical medicine, the arts and humanities, business areas, or social work.The National Science Foundation does not conduct laboratory research or carry outeducation projects itself; rather, it provides support or assistance to grantees, typi-cally associated with colleges and universities, who are the primary performers ofthe research.624 The National Science Foundation is organized generally along disciplinary lines. None of its programs has a principal focus on aging-related research; although, a substantial amount of research bearing various degrees of relationship to aging and the concerns of the elderly is supported across the broad spectrum of the Founda- tion's research programs. Virtually all of this work falls within the purviews of the Directorate for Biological, Behavioral, and Social Sciences and the Directorate for Engineering. DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND SOCIAL SCIENCES The research projects supported by this directorate are designed to strengthen sci- entific understanding of biological and social phenomena. Research is supported across a spectrum ranging from the fundamental molecules of living organisms to the complex interaction of human beings and societal organizations. These projects are supported by six research divisions incorporating 26 research programs. The Division of Behavioral and Neural Sciences supports research which is aimed at understanding the behavior of human beings and animals. To achieve this end, it uses molecular, developmental and cultural approaches while concentrating on model systems, behaving organisms, and cultures. Currently supported projects in- clude studies of the effects of aging on the nervous systems of animals, the attempt to identify specific brain areas involved in age-related learning and memory deficits, and research on the maintenance of knowledge during the human life span. Other research on the aging process in plants and animals is supported by the Division of Biotic Systems and Resources. The Division of Social and Economic Science focuses primarily on expanding fun- damental knowledge of how social and economic systems work. Attention is cen- tered on organizations and institutions, and how they function and change, and how human interaction and decisionmaking take place. The Division supports the collec- tion of large sets of data, such as national surveys, that are used by many investiga- tors, as well as the research projects of individual scientists. Most of the work sup- ported by this division has indirect, rather than direct, relevance to aging and the concerns of the elderly. For example, the Panal Study of Income Dynamics provides information on changing household composition, labor force participation, income, assets, and consumption patterns as individual respondents grow older. The General Survey contains several attitudinal questions relevant to older persons, such as the optimal age of retirement and government's role in the care of the elderly. This survey also permits the assessment-by age and by cohort-of shifts over time in opinions generally. The final survey supported by this division is the National Elec- tion Survey, which provides information on attitudes regarding candidates and issues held by different age groups in the population at large. One additional project funded by the division during the past year is focussed on the causes of victimiza- tion, a particular problem for the elderly. DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING The National Science Foundation's Directorate for Engineering seeks to strength- en engineering research in the United States and, as appropriate, focuses some of that research on areas relevant to national goals. This is done by supporting projects across the entire range of engineering disciplines and by identifying and supporting-special areas were results are expected to have timely and topical appli- cations. Most aging-related research supported by this directorate is through its Bioengin- eering and Aiding the Disabled Program, in the Division of Biological and Critical Systems. Most of this work is indirectly related to issues of aging and the elderly- its relevance derives from the increased propensity for the elderly to develop physi- cal disabilities. Examples of projects currently funded by this program include stud- ies of bone and cartilage degeneration and restoration, speech recognition, and hear- ing as applied to a deaf/hearing telephone system, biomechanics of diarthrodial joints, autonomic control of urinary bladder and large intestine, development of an intelligent hip prosthesis, fluid dynamics of heart valves and blood vessels, and a fundamental engineering study of swallowing to aid those handicapped by dyshagia. While not specifically directed toward problems of aging, these studies have poten- tial for dealing with conditions prevalent in old age.625 ITEM 26. OFFICE OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS DECEMBER 8, 1989. DEAR SENATOR PRYOR: In response to your request, I have enclosed the \"Report ofActivities on the United States Office of Consumer Affairs During 1989 Relating toOlder Americans.\" My office is pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the Committee's Annual Report on Aging. If you have questions, please call Juanita Yates of mystaff at 634-4297. Sincerely, BONNIE GUITON Special Adviser to the President for Consumer Affairs, and Director, United States Office of Consumer Affairs. Enclosure. REPORT OF AcTrvrrmEs OF THE UNITED STATES OFFICE OF CoNSuMER AFFAIRS DURING 1989 RELATING TO OLDER AMERICANS The Director of the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs (OCA) is Bonnie Guiton, who is also Special Adviser to the President for Consumer Affairs. The President hasalso designated Dr. Guiton as the Chairperson of the Consumer Affairs Council, es-tablished by Executive Order 12160. Dr. Guiton directs consumer affairs activities atthe Federal level. OCA provides the staff and administrative support to carry outthese responsibilities. OCA encourages and assists in the development and implementation of programsdealing with consumer issues and concerns; advises agencies with business and in-dustry officials by encouraging the development of voluntary employment, con-sumer protection and information programs; serves as the focal point for the coordi-nation and standardization of Federal complaint handling efforts; works to improve and coordinate consumer education at the local, State and Federal levels; and coop-erates with state and local government agencies, and voluntary consumer and com- munity organizations in the delivery of consumer services and information materi- als. The major activities focus on voluntary mechanisms, marketplace innovations,consumer education and information, and conferences to exchange information and develop dialogs. OCA's activities also focus on helping State and local government units and consumer and community groups to deal with issues affecting consumers.Highlighted below are major activities having the greatest impact on older Ameri-cans. OUTREACH The OCA Director has convened a series of meetings focusing public attention onthe privacy concerns associated with consumer credit, medical, and other records.She also testified in September before the House Banking Subcommittee on the Fair Credit Reporting Act. OCA's research on consumer privacy issues revealed that con- sumers feel that a great deal of their personal information is being circulated due toa competitive marketplace and technological advances. Industry sees this access to more information as a marketing tool for efficiently targeted campaigns. Althoughmost campaigns are legitimate and people are not getting information for unscrupu- lous purposes, elderly citizens are often the targets of illegitimate marketing cam- paigns. OCA has coordinated meetings between industry representatives, consumergroups, Congressional committee representatives and special interest groups to ad-dress the issue. Research will continue in 1990. Meetings and Conferences The OCA Director and staff met with program staff from the American Associa- tion of Retired Persons and other aging constituency organizations to underscorethe Administration's concern for the elderly and seek their support and views onpolicies which impact on the elderly. OCA distributed copies of our Consumer's Resource Handbook to the 3,000 atten-dees at the National Council on the Aging Conference. The conference was heldMarch 29-April 1, in New Orleans. In April, OCA's Associate Director for Special Concerns coordinated and hosted a Consumer Information Seminar for the Information and Referral Consortium on Aging. A representative from the Consumer Information Center discussed Federalaging-related publications which are available from the Center in Pueblo, Colorado.626 The Consortium is a network of organizations which provide information and refer- ral services to the elderly. OCA's Associate Director for Special Concerns participated in the planning and served as a speaker at the May 10-12 Nationa Energy and Aging Consortium (NEAC) Conference which was held in Tulsa, Oklahoma. More than 250 attended the conference which was held in conjunction with Older Americans Month. The NEAC is a network of 50 organizations helping older Americans cope with high energy costs and related energy concerns. OCA is a founding member of NEAC which includes aging and social service organizations, Government agencies, utili- ties and trade associations. The conference theme was \"Building Better Partner- ships: Energy and the Elderly in the 1990s.\" Also in recognition of Older Americans Month, OCA's Associate Director for Spe- cial Concerns coordinated and presided at a special May 17 seminar on \"Addressing the Consumer Problems and Concerns of America's Elderly and Disabled Citizens. The seminar was cosponsored by OCA, the American Association of Retired Persons, the National Organization on Disability and the Society of Consumer Affairs Profes- sionals in Business. The seminar was designed to raise the consciousness and in- crease the sensitivity of consumer affairs professionals to the needs, concerns and abilities of our elderly and disabled citizens. OCA's Associate Director for Special Concerns conducted a consumer education workshop at the June 22-24 National Caucus and Center on the Black Aged Confer- ence which was held in Columbus, Ohio. Copies of our Consumer's Resource Hand- book were distributed to attendees. OCA, in cooperation with the Direct Marketing Association, held Consumer Indus- try Dialogues in Atlanta on August 23, and in Cleveland on October 31. The purpose of the sessions was to discuss the problems of purchasing goods and services through the mail. Participants included representatives of the mail order industry, including the catalog, list selling, sweepstakes, telemarketing, and television marketing divi- sions. Postal inspectors, officials of Federal, State and local consumer protection of- fices and representatives of Better Business Bureaus also attended. The sessions ad- dressed concerns of the elderly. Older individuals, who may be ill or have limited mobility, are particularly receptive to direct marketing solicitations and are most often the victims of fraud. OCA's Associate Director for Special Concerns participated in the September 7-9 National Association of Community Action Agencies Conference which was held in Washington. The community action agencies provide services to low income and el- derly citizens. As part of the National Energy Awareness Month celebration, OCA's Associate Director for Special Concerns coordinated a special luncheon seminar sponsored by the National Energy and Aging Consortium. The seminar was held October 3 and focused attention on successful, eldercare programs. The speaker was Dr. Michael Creedon from the National Council on the Aging. The seminar was the only nation- al activity which focused attention on the elderly. The OCA Director was the keynote speaker at the Food and Drug Administra- tion's Consumer Affairs Officers Conference which was held December 12 in New Orleans. Consumer Affairs Officers are located in communities throughout the coun- try. They answer questions, respond to consumer complaints and provide consumer education on issues relating to health and nutrition, safety, food labeling, prescrip- tion drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices. The role of Consumer Affairs Officers in educating elderly consumers and restoring their confidence in the safety of generic drugs is especially important. The OCA Director gave opening remarks at the Food and Drug Administration's Food Labeling Hearing in Atlanta on December 13. Since many elderly citizens have restricted diets, it is especially important that food labels carry full and accurate ingredient and nutrition information. INFORMATION AND EDUCATION Publications OCA updated and published the Consumer's Resource Handbook which contains a section on aging and refers to other sections in the Handbook of interest to the el- derly, such as health care, Social Security, and veterans affairs. The State and local directory section lists Government offices responsible for coordinating services for the elderly. The Handbook also provides consumer information on a number of issues of interest to older consumers, including health fraud, telephone solicitations, warranties, contracts, mail order, and vacation certificates. In addition to the listing of Federal TDD numbers, the Handbook also includes TDD numbers of State and627 local government and corporate listings. The Handbook is being distributed to agingorganizations and State and area agencies on aging.OCA reprinted the Special Report on Cold Stress and Heat Stress which offersuseful information on how to identify the causes and symptoms of these weather-related conditions that often threaten the lives of the elderly. Single copies of theReport are distributed free from the Consumer Information Center in Pueblo, Colo-rado. OCA has also provided bulk copies of the Report to aging organizations to beused at conferences, workshops, and seminars. OCA continued to distribute a booklet produced by the American Bar Association,in conjunction with OCA and TRW Information Services entitled, Your Legal Guideto Consumer Credit. The booklet discusses the wise handling of credit and credit dis-crimination, both important issues to older Americans. Consumer News, OCA's monthly newsletter, carries articles of general interest toconsumers. The following articles were of special interest to elderly consumers.-March-Announced the May 10-12 National Energy and Aging ConsortiumConference which was held in Tulsa, Oklahoma. OCA is a founding member ofthe NEAC and participated in the planning of the conference.-April-Announced the availability of two publications which discuss how to un-derstand and control blood cholesterol. So You Have High Blood Cholesterol andEating to Lower Your High Blood Cholesterol were published by the NationalHeart, Lung and Blood Institute. -May-Reported that the Food and Drug Administration is advising physiciansto warn their patients of the side effects of common arthritis drugs. New labelsare being required which state that the products pose a risk of serious gaster-ointestinal problems, such as peptic ulcers.-June-Announced the Federal Communications Commission's final rule whichrequires that nearly all telephones manufactured in or imported into theUnited States must be hearing aid compatible. -September-Discussed the Food and Drug Administration's crackdown on fraud-ulent activities in generic drug companies. October-Announced that October is \"Talk About Prescriptions Month.\" Themonth is sponsored by the National Council on Patient Information and Educa-tion to raise awareness about medical misuse by the elderly and to help con-sumers use prescription medication safely and effectively.November-Announced the availability of OCA's updated Special Report on ColdStress and Heat Stress which provides information on how to identify and pre-vent these conditions which threaten the lives of the elderly. Education OCA has worked in partnership with the American Association of Communitand Junior Colleges (AACJC) to develop and expand consumer programs whichmeet the needs of the community. In October, AACJA and the J.C. Penny Companyawarded minigrants to community colleges in Jacksonville, Florida, and Weed, Cali-fornia, whose programs are directed to elderly consumers. To address the consumerconcerns of Jacksonville's 130,000 elderly citizens, the Florida Community Collegewill develop the \"Wise Center for Elderly Program.\" Through video, older consum-ers will be provided information on consumer rights and responsibilities, making in-formed choices, defense against power of persuasion, awareness of risks in telemar-koting and impulse buying, recognizing unwise investments, and avoiding victimiza-tion by fraud. A consumer education outreach program for rural elderly is being developed atthe College of the Siskiyous in Weed, California. Working through established serv-ice provider networks, older consumers will be provided information on money man-agement, wise spending, energy conservation, health care, nutrition, and otherissues of interest. The community college expects a ripple effect in passing alongconsumer information, since 90 percent of Weed's elderly are phoned by another el-derly person at least twice weekly to ensure overall well-being. National Consumers Week OCA coordinated National Consumers Week (NCW) which was held April 23-29.More than 650 organizations celebrated throughout the country. Many of the eventsaddressed issues of interest to the elderly. For example: The Arkansas Office of the Attorney General conducted a special \"ThereOught to Be A Law\" contest for students and senior citizens.The Federal Trade Commission's Los Angeles Regional Office discussed tele-marketing fraud at a workshop for representatives of aging organizations.628 Senator Orrin Hatch's Senior Conference highlighted the theme, \"Consumer Protection: If It Sounds Too Good To Be True, It Probably Is.\" The conference addressed the most commonly violated consumer protection laws, including sea- sonal, telemarketing, and health frauds. The Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation produced a series of print advertisements and radio shows that addressed the energy needs of the elderly. Cornell University's Cooperative Extension Service provided training for senior citizens, staff and volunteers on \"Understanding Small Claims Court.\" Lederle Labs provided information on rheumatic arthritis in a radio message transmitted via satellite to more than 2,000 radio stations on the Consumer Broadcast Network. The Suffolk County Department of Consumer Affairs developed a program on \"How To Be A Wise Consumer.\" The program was presented to more than 300 representatives of senior citizen clubs. The Mercer County Office of Consumer Affairs presented skits at senior cen- ters and nutrition sites. The skits were designed to educate the elderly about their consumer rights and responsibilities. Patricia Faley, NCW Chairman, was the keynote speaker at Jacksonville, Florida's Senior Consumer Protection Workshop. The workshop focused on health scams, mail order fraud, insurance information, and telephone solicita- tions. Constituent Resource Exposition OCA sponsored a Constituent Resource Exposition (EXPO) on June 16 to improve communication and understanding between Federal officials and Congressional staff in order to help expedite accurate replies to inquiries and marketplace complaints received by Congressional offices. More than 1,000 Congressional staff officers and experts from 36 Federal departments and independent agencies participated in EXPO which was held at the Cannon House Office Building. To further assist Con- gressional staff, OCA distributed a Congressional Liaison Handbook which lists the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of Federal liaison officials within each of the agencies. Many of the inquiries and letters of complaints that Congressional of- fices receive come from elderly citizens. INTRAGOVERNMENTAL ACTIVMES International The OCA Director headed the November United States Delegation to the Organi- zation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) meeting of the Commit- tee on Consumer Policy. This Committee addresses a variety of subjects of interest to all consumers, including the elderly. The Committee is composed of representa- tives from the 24-member countries. In 1990, the Committee will publish reports on aging-related issues, including the impact on the deregulation of financial services on consumers. Reports will also analyze the impact of agricultural policies on con- sumers. Product liability systems, new technologies, marketing, and advertising are some of the topics that are currently being discussed. All issues addressed by the OECD are reviewed from a broad consumer perspective and the concerns of the el- derly are always reflected in final reports. Committees OCA was represented on the following committees which have a special impact on the elderly. The National Energy and Aging Consortium is a network of 50 government, aging, and private sector organizations which have joined together to help the elderly cope with rising energy costs. The Information and Referral Consortium on Aging is a network of govern- ment, aging and private sector organizations which provide information about and develop programs which strengthen information and referral systems throughout the country. The Alliance Against Fraud in Telemarketing is a network of government agencies, consumer organizations, telecommunication companies, and market- ing trade associations which provide consumer information on telemarketing fraud. OCA participated in the development of a manual which highlights many of the most common telephone scams. The manual had been distributed to the media, consumer protection officials, and consumer groups. The elderly are par-629 ticularly vulnerable to telemarketing fraud. This is reflected in many of thewritten inquiries and complaints that OCA receives each year from older Amer-icans. Executive Order The OCA Director is designated by the President to be the Chairperson of theConsumer Affairs Council, established by Executive Order 12160. Executive Order12160-the Consumer's Executive Order-is a directive to Federal agencies to insti-tute consumer programs which are effective and responsive to the needs of consum-ers. This action is a logical progression from the Consumer Representation Plans ofthe 17 Executive Branch departments and agencies developed in 1976.The Order addressed the problems of citizens in achieving adequate participationin government decision making processes. For example, agencies are required to de-velop information materials to inform consumers about their procedures for partici-pation. Elderly consumers have been identified as a consitituent group which shouldbe reached with information. Under the Order, agencies must ensure that groupssuch as the elderly are being reached. ITEM 27. PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION DECEMBER 13, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am pleased to submit the enclosed report for your annualcompilation of Developments in Aging. As you requested, our report reviews thePension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's activities on behalf of older Americansduring Fiscal Year 1989. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to describe our actions and programs onbehalf of the elderly. Sincerely, JAMEs B. LOCKHART III, Executive Director. Enclosure. PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), created by the Employee Re-tirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, is a young and relatively smallagency with 550 employees. PBGC protects the pension of nearly 40 million Ameri-can workers in about 100,000 private sector defined benefit pension plans-the typeof plan that promises to pay specified retirement benefits. The agency estimates itsinsurance covers $750 billion in pension liabilities that are backed by $1 trillion inassets. ERISA gave PBGC three important missions:-to encourage voluntary private defined benefit pension plans;-to provide uninterrupted payment of pension benefits; and-to maintain premiums at the lowest prudent level.That mission continues to be the Corporation's mandate as it moves toward thenineties. Although PBGC is government-owned, it could be regarded as a mutual insurancecompany. Its policy-holders-American businesses with defined benefit plans-sup-port the agency through their premiums and bear fundamental responsibility forproviding retirement security for their workers and retirees. In turn, PBGC is re-sponsible for encouraging employers to continue their plans and protecting the re-tirement incomes of workers whose employers are unable to do so.PBGC's financial condition is important both to employees and employees. Em-ployers share in PBGC's results by having higher or lower premiums. PBGC has anobligation to its policy-holders, which is codified in ERISA, to control its premiumsand, consequently, its costs. A stable insurance program guarantees workers and re-tirees tha their retirement incomes are safe. Given its responsibilities, the agency set goals during fiscal year 1989 to reduce itsdeficit through continued effecive financial management, investment performance,and legal action; to hold the line with no increase in PBGC insurance premiums; toprevent abuse of the insurance programs; and to encourage the growth of definedbenefit plans. The financial results for the year offered a promising start toward these goals.Increased premium revenues, strong investment returns, and the absence of verylarge losses from plan terminations enabled PBGC to sharply reduce its deficit630 during the year. The key to PBGC's future health will be its ability to resist abuses of its insurance programs and avoid significant new losses. FINANCIAL CONDMON At the end of fiscal year 1989, PBGC had assets.of about $3 billion and liabilities of about $4 billion, reducing its accumulated deficit by about 30 percent. These fig- ures exclude losses attributable to the pension plans of the LTV Corp., which are the subject of a pivotal case awaiting decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The pension insurance system has two insurance programs. One program guaran- tees payment of benefits if an underfunded single-employer plan terminates. The other program provides financial assistance to insolvent collectively bargained mul- tiemployer plans to guarantee their continued payment of retirement benefits. The single-employer program dominates the agency's financial position. Revenues of about $1 billion produced net income of more than $400 million, the second-larg- est gain in the program's history. PBGC achieved this profit despite its increasing its reserve for future losses from $108 million to $242 million. The multiemployer program continued to show very positive results, gaining about $20 million to end the year with an accumulated surplus of about $110 mil- lion. As required by the Congress in amendments enacted in 1980, PBGC is conduct- ing a study, to be completed by the end of fiscal year 1990, to determine whether the multiemployer program's premiums or guarantees should be adjusted. PREMIUMS PBGC's premium income for fiscal year 1989 increased to over $600 million. These revenues reflect the effects of the Pension Protection Act of 1987, which increased PBGC's premium rate and created a new variable-rate structure for single-employer plans. All single-employer plans pay a flat annual rate of $16 per participant. Un- derfunded plans pay an additional variable charge (based on unfunded vested bene- fits) up to a maximum total premium of $50 per participant. Fiscal year 1989 was the first fiscal year for which the new premium was fully effective. INVESTMENTS The agency's investments' now totaling nearly $2.5 billion, provided about $400 million in income, a substantial increase over the previous year's results due to the very strong stock and bond markets. Invested funds provided a return of over 15 percent for fiscal year 1989. PBGC historically has managed its assets like a private pension fund, investing in a diversified portfolio to reduce risk and maintain steady income. Aided by its Presi- dentially appointed Advisory Committee, the agency regularly reviews its asset allo- cation and investment policies to assure that its investment posture will meet its current and anticipated financial needs. During fiscal year 1990, PBGC will study whether there are any better ways to invest assets to insulate against future fluctu- ations in its liabilities. IMPROVED SEvicE TO THE PUBUC PBGC is dedicated to continually improving the quality of its service to those who rely on it for benefit payments. During its 15 years, PBGC has trusted about 1,500 plans, and presently is paying about 110,000 retirees. Another 115,000 workers will be paid when they reach retire- ment age. If participants in three LTV Steel Co. pension plans in litigation are in- cluded, the numbers of participants receiving and owed benefits would increase by almost 50 percent. -PBGC paid about $330 million in benefits during fiscal year 1989, approximately the same as in fiscal year 1988. In addition, under PBGC's management approxi- mately 60,000 LTV retirees received benefit payments totalling about $320 million from three LTV Steel pension plans and PBGC assets. PBGC also provided $13 mil- lion in separate financial assistance to three multiemployer plans covering about 7,600 participants. About 6,000 of these participants continued receiving benefit pay- ments from their plans as a result of PBGC's assistance. PBGC substantially restructured its benefit payments operations to expedite its processing of terminated plans and participants' benefits and to enhance its commu- nication with participants. PBGC also completed a major overhaul of its standard correspondence to provide participants with simplified information about PBGC's in- surance coverage, their guaranteed benefits, and their benefit options.631 ENFORCEMENT AND PRESERVATION Since its inception, PBGC has successfully defended the insurance programs fromattempts by some employers to abuse the insurance system or evade their obliga-tions to their employees. At the end of fiscal year 1989, PBGC had 120 cases in liti-gation. Of these, the agency's legal battle with LTV remained the most prominentas the case was accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court. THE LTV CORPORATION In January 1987, PBGC terminated and trusteed three LTV Steel Co. pensionplans after LTV, in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, stopped contributing to the plans andinformed PBGC that it could not and would not fund them. The three plans, whichcovered more than 100,000 workers and retirees, were underfunded by more than $2billion. Subsequently, LTV established new \"follow-on\" pension plans that wrap aroundPBGC-paid benefits and result in a de facto continuation of the old plans. Thesefollow-on plans, in combination with the guaranteed benefits paid by PBGC, providesubstantially the same benefits as those provided under the original plans.PBGC has long taken the position that such follow-on plans abuse the pension in-surance program by effectively converting PBGC insurance from a safety net for re-tirees into subsidy of corporate pension costs. Allowing LTV to have them wouldcreate a powerful inducement for other companies to terminate their underfundedplans, with potentially grave consequences for the pension insurance program.PBGC already is facing such \"copycat' cases.Based on LTV's establishment of the follow-on plans, as well as on dramatic im-provements in LTV's financial condition, in September 1987 PBGC restored thethree previously terminated plans to full active operation by LTV. A legal battleensued in the Federal courts in New York. The district court and the court of ap-peals subsequently reversed the restoration, ruling that follow-on plans do not con-stitute an abuse and that PBGC was required to defer to general policies underlyingbankruptcy and labor law. The courts also ruled that LTV's financial improvementwas not a sufficient basis for restoration unless PBGC could establish that LTVcould fully fund the plans over the long term. Convinced that the future of the pension insurance program was at risk, PBGCasked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. The Solicitor General of theUnited States filed a \"friend of the court\" brief supporting the PBGC's request forreview. On October 30, 1989, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Briefingwill be completed early in 1990, and oral argument is expected to be heard in Febru-ary or March. A decision is likely before the end of the summer. OTHER CASES PBGC also continued its vigorous efforts to pursue those who abused their posi-tions of trust as fiduciaries of pension plans and those who assisted them. One suchcase involves pension plans formerly sponsored by Lundberg Industries, Ltd. In co-ordination with the U.S. Department of Labor, PBGC is pressing forward with civilsuits seeking restitution of more than $7 million improperly removed from the plansby the former owner of the company and several associates.In another important case, PBGC is suing M&I Marshall and lisley Bank, aformer trustee of pension plans that were terminated by Wheeling-Pittsburgh SteelCorp. in 1985. PBGC contends that the bank accepted an imporper contribution ofnonmarketable company stock in lieu of cash, violating both its fiduciary duty to actsolely in the interests of the plan participants and ERISA's prohibited transactionrules. According to PBGC calculations, the plans lost approximately $40 million as aresult of this transaction, because of the minimal value of the stock and the lostincome that could have been earned had cash been contributed instead. INTERNAL CONTROLS PBGC recognizes the importance of assuring the public, and particularly the em-ployers whose premiums support its programs, of the integrity of its employees andoperations. For this purpose, it maintains systems and procedures to safeguard itsresources, assure adherence to applicable laws and regulations, and promote oper-ational economy and efficiency. For years, the agency also relied on internal auditors to examine the quality andefficiency of its programs. In response to a change in law, PBGC established an In-spector General with expanded powers to audit and investigate PBGC operationsand the activities of PBGC staff. The Inspector General reports directly to the Exec-632 utive Director and to the Congress and is responsible for detecting and preventing fraud, misuse of agency resources, and other unethical or criminal conduct. The In- spector General also evaluates the agency's programs and operations to identify de- ficiencies, recommend improvements, and monitor the agency's progress in taking the necessary corrective actions. His first report to Congress (November 1, 1989) re- ported no significant issues. THE FUTURE OF DEFINED BENEmIT PLANS Defined benefit plans are healthier than ever before, with assets of about $1 tril- lion covering benefit promises of about $750 billion. However, terminations of fully funded plans have remained steady, with slightly more than 11,000 termination no- tices filed during the past fiscal year. Cases involving reversion of excess assets to an employer continued to decline from their peak in 1985. To date, reversion activi- ty is 37 percent less than 1 year ago, and the majority of participants in these plans continue to be covered under new defined benefit plans. PBGC is concerned for the future, though, because indications are that defined benefit plans are not growing and, at best, may be plateauing. PBGC's premium base of participants has continued to grow at 1 percent per year but the number of insured plans has been dropping in recent years. The decline in small defined bene- fit plans has been particularly dramatic. In addition, since 1980, the proportion of employees with pension plans whose primary retirement vehicle is a defined benefit plan has slipped from 80 percent to 70 percent. For the remainder, defined contribu- tion plans are the only or primary plan. A number of factors may be involved in the shift observed. According to Depart- ment of Labor research, changing employment patterns, and particularly the trends toward smaller businesses and service industries, account for about half of the shift from defined benefit plans. Other reasons are cited-frequent complicated and costly changes in legal requirements for pensions, over-regulation by the Federal Government, tax changes, confusing procedures-but there has been no conclusive analysis. As part of its mission to encourage growth of defined benefit plans, PBGC has initiated several studies to isolate the problems of greatest concern to employers and begin the search for solutions. Defined benefit plans are not suitable for all companies, but they do offer consid- erable advantages over other types of retirement arrangements for many compa- nies. For the employer, they help provide workforce stability and promote employee loyalty. For employees, defined benefit plans offer predictable retirement income, with protection against the uncertainty and volatility of investment risk backed by Federal pension insurance. As one step toward increasing employer and public awareness of the value of a guaranteed pension, as provided by a defined benefit plan, PBGC published a new booklet entitled \"The Employer's Pension Guide.\" The booklet, issued with the coop- eration of the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service, is a basic, easy-to-understand primer on defined benefit plans. THE ROAD AHEAD While much remains to be done, fiscal year 1989 offered a promising view of the road ahead. As a result of recent pension legislation, premium increases, and its strong enforcement activities, the number of terminations declined significantly, re- sulting in pension insurance claims that are manageable within the present premi- um structure. At the same time, PBGC continues to face large potential risks caused by under- funded pension plans. The loss of the LTV case, for example, could double the agen- cy's deficit. Even though defined benefit plans are overfunded by some $250 billion in the aggregate, pension underfunding in specific plans is estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion. This exposure is concentrated in the airline, steel, and automobile in- dustries. The key to PBGC's future will be its ability to prevent these exposures from be- coming claims. Recent pension reforms designed to encourage sponsors to better fund their plans, discourage them from abandoning their plans, and reduce PBGC's losses from a terminated plan will help. The pension insurance program now is stronger with more realistic premiums and less risk of loss. It is PBGC's responsi- bility to ensure that this positive trend continues by taking a proactive approach to litigation, enforcement, and legislation.633 ITEM 28. POSTAL SERVICE DECEMBER 5, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to your October 11 letter to PostmasterGeneral Anthony M. Frank, requesting information from the Postal Service on ac-tivities and programs which assist elderly Americans. The enclosed document describes Postal Service programs which are designed tomeet the mailing needs of older Americans and to prevent them from being victim- ized by mail fraud. The Postal Service is pleased to contribute to this endeavor and will continue todevelop programs to assist in improving the quality of life for the aging.Sincerely, WILLIAM T. JOHNSTONE. PROGRAMS AFFECTING OLDER AMERICANS CARRIER ALERT PROGRAM Carrier Alert is a voluntary community service provided by city and rural deliv-ery letter carriers who watch participants' mailboxes for mail accumulations thatmight signal illness or injury. Accumulations of mail are reported by carriers totheir supervisors, who then notify a sponsoring agency, through locally developedprocedures, for follow-up action. The program completed its seventh year of oper-ation in 1989 and continues to provide a lifeline to thousands of elderly citizens wholive alone. DELIVERY SERVICE POLICY The Postal Service has a long-standing policy of granting case-by-case exceptionsto delivery regulations based on hardship or special need. This policy accommodatesthe special needs of elderly, handicapped, or infirm customers who are unable toobtain mail from a receptacle located some distance from their home. Informationon hardship exceptions to delivery receptacles can be obtained from local postmas-ters. FEDERAL ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS The Postal Service is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. The PostalService is committed to making postal facilities accessible. Over the last 3 years, thePostal Service has inspected and surveyed over 25,000 leased facilities to determineaccessibility problems and develop solutions. When facilities are built or leased tothe minimum standards of accessibility, which are found in the Real Estate Hand-book 4 (RE-4), all customers, especially the elderly, benefit. The minimum standardsinclude designated parking spaces, ramps, handrails, signs, and specific clearancesnear entrance ways and lobbies. MAIL FRAUD AND MAIL THEFT INVESTIGATIONS To many elderly Americans living alone and on fixed incomes, shopping by mailis a convenient way for them to obtain products and services. Unfortunately, theyare also attractive targets for a few individuals who operate mail-order swindles.Through mail fraud and misrepresentation of products and services, unscrupulouspromoters not only cheat the public but also damage the reputation of the legiti-mate mail-order industry. There are several types of fraudulent promotions which, by their nature, tend tofocus on the elderly population. One of the most widespread is the work-at-homescheme. Senior citizens living on fixed incomes and seeking to supplement their in-comes, may be enticed by advertisements promising enormous earnings while work-ing from the convenience of home. The scheme begins with the promoter requiringan initial fee, typically from $5 to $25, before information about the plan is sup-plied. The fraud continues as a pyramid operation, whereby the consumer involvesothers in the scheme, resulting in funds being generated to the promoter and notthe respondents. Individuals approaching retirement or those already retired sometimes respond towhat appear to be attractive land sales deals. The promise of a warmer climate, lowdown payment, and easy monthly installments appears enticing until the purchaserdiscovers that the parcel of land is located in a desert wasteland and cannot beresold for even a fraction of the price paid. Another fraud perpetrated against elderly customers is the mail-order sale ofworthless pills, nostrums, and devices which promise to rid the aged to needless suf-634 fering. Probably the cruelest of these frauds are those that offer hope for cure of cancer, diabetes, and other major illnesses. The ailments and afflictions that are a part of aging will leave the buyer looking for a magical cure to alleviate arthritic pain, restore lost vigor, and improve im- paired sight or hearing. These pills and devices often have not been tested by medi- cal authorities, are not capable of curing, and could even be injurious to one's health. In an effort to heighten public awareness of mail fraud and other postal-related crimes, the Postal Inspection Service maintains across the country a cadre of Postal Inspectors trained as Crime Prevention Specialists. Working with Federal and State agencies and consumer groups, one of their missions is to educate and inform the public. Each year they a ppear on hundreds of television and radio interview pro- grams and prepare articles for numerous newspapers and magazines. They give presentations emphasizing the need for consumer action as well as awareness in fighting crime at health fairs, community action groups, and national prevention conferences. They respond to special requests, often from senior citizens, regarding specific problem areas. Over the past 7 years, the Postal Ipion Service has issued a series of Public Service Announcements alerting the public to fraud schemes operating through the mails. In 1989, the Inspection Service contracted for the production of a Video News Release on fraudulent \"Boiler Room\" operations which often target the elderly. The release was distributed a via satellite to over 600 stations across the country, and in many instances, was customized to parallel local consumer problems. Since 1986, the Postal Inspection Service has participated in the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association Seminars and has worked with this association to combat health care frauds, many of which victimize senior citizens. The Postal In- spection Services has participated in conventions sponsored by the National Council on Aging. At display booths, the Postal Inspection Service highlights various types of fraud schemes which target the elderly. Representatives of the Postal Inspection Service also participate in workshops which furnish information concerning a varie- ty of fraud schemes. Despite the existence of such preventive efforts, the number and variety of mail fraud schemes ensure that many people will continue to be victimized by mail fraud promotions. In dealing with this, the Postal Services uses a two-pronged attack. Criminal prosecution is possible under the Mail Fraud Statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 1341, which provides penalties of up to 5 years in prison and a $1,000 fine for those who use or cause the mail to be used to further a fraudulent scheme. Second, and perhaps more importantly for the consumer, the Postal Service can take action under the False Representations Statute, 39 U.S.C. Section 3005. This statute per- mits the Postal Service, following a full due process hearing before an administra- tive law judge, to return to the sender all mail addressed to a promotion whose ad- vertisements soliciting remittances by mail are proven to contain false representa- tions. In addition, the Postal Services may request the U.S. District Court, in the area where the promotion receives its mail, to issue a temporary restraining order to stop the delivery of mail to that promotion until the administrative law judge renders a decision. A crime which strikes the elderly population particularly hard is mail theft. Many poor and elderly Americans depend on the receipt of a monthly check in the mail as their sole income. These individuals suffer greatly when their checks do not arrive as scheduled. Each year the Postal Service delivers hundreds of millions of Treasury, State, and local benefit checks. Although the number of stolen checks in relation to the number mailed is minute, the Postal Inspection Service considers this a significant problem and recognizes the impact this crime has on the victim, particularly on elderly persons who are dependent upon the checks for subsistence. The Postal Service also delivers millions of personal and commercial checks and other valuable items such as savings bonds, money orders, credit cards, and food stamps, all of which are appealing targets for mail thieves. Two slide presentations, entitled \"Protecting Your Mail\" and \"Fraud By Mail,\" have been developed and are being shown to the public by Crime Prevention Spe- cialists. A Postal Service booklet, A Consumer's Guide to Postal Crime Prevention, has been updated to include new information. It furnishes tips to consumers on how to avoid being victimized by a variety of fraudulent schemes and mail theft. This booklet also includes the addresses of Postal Inspection Service Division throughout the country. A series of investigative programs to combat the problem of mail theft is also in place. Postal Inspectors cooperate with the U.S. Secret Service and local police in- vestigating the forgery of checks believed to have been stolen from the mail. They635 also work with officials of check issuing agencies to improve procedures for the prompt charge-back of checks and referral of information whenever theft from the mail is suspected. The Postal Service has encouraged the development of better photo and signature identification cards and has enlisted the cooperation of public housing authorities to install and maintain more secure mail receptacles and mail- rooms. NATIONAL coNsuMERs' wEE/CoNsuMFRs' PROTEION w The Postal Service has sponsored an annual Consumer Protection Week since 1977. Since 1980 the Postal Service's Consumers Protection Week has been scheduled to coincide with National Consumers' Week. Promotion and publicity kits are prepared and distributed to warn consumers about mail fraud and misrepresentation of prod- ucts and services sold by mail. Additional information about proper addressing of mail, packaging parcels correctly, temporary address changes, sending valuables through the mail, and how to report service problems are also beneficial to senior citizens and are included in the kit. As medical fraud and work-at-home schemes have traditionally ranked at the top of fraudulent promotions, the focus of material distributed has frequently been directed toward alerting senior citizens of such schemes. STAMPS BY MAIL Stamps by Mail (SBM) is one of the Easy Stamp Services that allows postal cus- tomers in city delivery areas to purchase postal products such as booklets, sheets, coils, postal cards, stamped envelopes, and philatelic items by ordering through the mail. The SBM program benefits a wide variety of people and is particularly beneficial to elderly or shut-in customers who cannot travel to the post office. SBM provides order forms incorporated in self-addressed postage-paid envelopes to its customers for their convenience in obtaining products and services without having to visit a USPS retail unit. The form is available in lobbies or from the cus- tomer's carrier. The customer fills out the order form and returns it to the carrier or drops it in a collection box. Orders are normally returned to the customer within 2 or 3 business days. STAMPS BY PHONE Stamps by Phone (SBP) is a convenience program that is intended to target the business, professional, and household customers who are willing to pay a $3 service charge for the convenience of ordering by phone and paying by credit card (VISA or MasterCard) to avoid trips to the post office. The customer calls the (1-800- STAMPS-24) toll-free number, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and orders from a menu of postal products. There is no minimum amount and customers will receive their order within 3 to 5 business days. WINDOW AUTOMATION AT RETAIL FACILITIES The Postal Service is installing automated systems called Integrated Retail Termi- nals (IRTs) at the service windows in retail facilities in all medium to large cities. These terminals use video screens to display information about each transaction for the customer. The screens show some mailing restrictions and required mailing forms, total amount due as well as change from the amount tendered. The display of this type of information is useful to many customers with hearing impairments, in- cluding some older Americans. ITEM 29. RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD DECEMBER 13, 1989. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In response to your letter of October 11, 1989, we are enclos- ing a report summarizing the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board's program activities for the elderly during fiscal year 1989. We look forward to your committee's report, Developments in Aging: 1989. Sincerely, BEATmIc: EzIF=i, Secretary to the Boar& Enclosure. 26-386 0 -90 -21636 U.S. RAILROAD RuruiRmEm BOARD ANNuAL REPORT PRoGRAM AcivBrris FOR THE - .~~~~ELDERSLY The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board is an independent agency in the executive branch of the Federal Government, administering comprehensive retirement-survi- vor and unemployment-sickness benefit programs for the Nation's railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment In- surance Acts. The Board also has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act for certain benefit payments and railroad workers' Medicare coverage. Under the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board pays retirement and disability an- nuities to railroad workers with at least 10 years of service. Annuities based on age are payable at age 62, or at age 60 for employees with 30 years' service. Disability annuities are payable before retirement age on the basis of total or occupational dis- ability. Annuities are also payable by the Board to spouses and divorced spouses of retired workers and to widow(ers, divorced or remarried widow(er)s, children, and parents of deceased railroad workers. Qualified railroad retirement beneficiaries are covered by Medicare in the same way'as Social Security beneficiaries. Under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, the Board pays unemployment benefits to railroad workers who are unemployed but ready, willing, and able to work and pays sickness benefits to railroad workers who are unable to work because of illness or injury. BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARISm During fiscal year 1989, benefits paid under the railroad retirement and railroad unemployment insurance programs totaled more than $7 billion. Retirement and survivor benefits amounted to $6.9 billion, and unemployment and sickness benefits totaled $89 million. The number of beneficiaries on the retirement-survivor rolls on September 30, 1989, totaled- over 900,000. The majority (83 percent) were age 65 or oldfer. At the end of the fiscal year, 400,000 retired employees were being paid a regular annuity averaging $850 a month. In addition, 200,000 of these employees were being paid a supplemental railroad retirement annuity averaging $46 a month. Some 220,000 spouses and divorced spouses of retired employees were receiving average monthly benefits of $355, and, of the 290,000 survivors on the rolls, 250,000 were aged widow(er)s receiving average monthly benefits of $520. Approximately 11,000 retired employees were also receiving spouse or survivor benefits based on their spouses' railroad service. The annuities of 245,000 of the 900,000 beneficiaries included vested dual benefits. These benefits preserve equities of annuitants insured for both railroad retirement and Social Security benefits prior to the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, which provided for a phaseout of dual benefits. Railroad retirement benefits are being increased in January, 1990 to reflect a 4.7 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the 12 months preceding October 1989. Cost-of-living increases are calculated in each of the two tier portions of a railroad retirement annuity. Tier I portions, like Social Security benefits, in- crease in January 1990 by 4.7 percent, which is the percentage of the CPI rise. Tier 11 portions increase by 1.5 percent, which is 32.5 percent of the CPI rise. In 1990, the average regular railroad retirement employee annuity rises about $30 to $880 a month and the average spouse benefit increases about $10 to $365 per month. For aged widow(er)s, the average monthly benefit rises about $20 to $540. Vested dual benefit payments and supplemental annuities also paid by the Board are not adjust- ed for the CPI rise. Almost 800,000 individuals who were receiving or were eligible to receive monthly benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act were covered by hospital insurance under the Medicare program at the end of fiscal year 1989. Of these, 780,000 (98 percent) were also enrolled for supplemental medical insurance. Unemployment and sickness benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insur- ance Act were paid to 60,000 railroad employees during the fiscal year. However, only about $0.3 million (less than 1 percent) of the benefits went to individuals age 65 or older. FINANCING By the end of the 1989 fiscal year, the equity balance in the Railroad Retirement Account had increased from $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion and the Railroad Unemploy- ment Insurance Account's debt to the Railroad Retirement Account had been re- duced to $592.6 million. Recent projections indicate that this debt will be fully repaid by 1998 at the latest.637 The Board's June 1989 railroad retirement actuarial report was generally favor- able and indicated that, barring a sudden, unanticipated, large decrease in railroad employment, the railroad retirement system will not experience any cash-flow prob- lems during the next 20 years. However, the long-term solvency of the railroad re- tirement system is still questionable in view of the system's reliance on payroll taxes for funding and the continuing decline in rail employment. To address this concern, Federal budget legislation enacted on December 22, 1987, increased payroll taxes and established a Commission on Railroad Retirement Reform to conduct a comprehensive study of the issues pertaining to the long-term financing of the rail- road retirement system. The Commission is to report to Congress by October 1, 1990. 1989 LEGISLATION The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 passed by the Congress and sent to the White House after the close of the 1989 fiscal year included a number of rail- road retirement and Social Security provisions which affect benefits and taxes in 1990 and subsequent years. The budget reconciliation legislation increases the amount of earnings subject to Social Security and railroad retirement payroll taxes and specifies 401(k) contribu- tions and some employer-paid life insurance premiums as subject to railroad retire- ment payroll taxes. This legislation also extends for 1 year, until October 1, 1990, the time during which revenues from Federal income taxes on tier II railroad retire- ment benefits may be transferred to the Railroad Retirement Account for use in paying benefits. In addition, it revises prior sequestrations of railroad retirement supplemental annuities and unemployment and sickness benefits under the Gramm/Rudman/Hollings Act. Other legislation repealing the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act affects rail- road retirement beneficiaries in the same way as Social Security beneficiaries. IMPLEMENTATION OF 1988 AMENDMENTS The major program activity of the Railroad Retirement Board during fiscal year 1989 was the implementation of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance and Retire- ment Improvement Act of 1988, enacted in November 1988 as part of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988. While the Act primarily affected railroad unemployment-sickness benefits payable to active railroad employees, it also made substantial revisions affecting railroad retirement benefits paid to retirees. In order to implement the amendments, the Board had to revise its claims proc- essing systems, obtain data from employers, rewrite procedures, retrain personnel and notify all beneficiaries whose benefits might be affected. A letter was issued to all annuitants in September 1989 to explain the major provisions of the railroad re- tirement amendments. Changes affecting current and future railroad retirement an- nuitants are described below: -The amendments eliminated the railroad retirement \"last person service\" pro- vision, which had required the suspension of annuity payments to retired em- ployees and spouses who returned to work for their last pre-retirement nonrail- road employer. Since December 1988, the annuities of employees and spouses who continue in, or return to, last person service are subject to the same earn- ings deductions applied to the Social Security level benefits of other annuitants with post-retirement earnings. But, last person service also reduces railroad re- tirement payments over and above Social Security levels by $1 for each $2 of earnings from last person service, subject to a maximum reduction of 50 per- cent. By the end of fiscal year 1989, some 5,000 of these claims had been devel- oped.-The amendments liberalized the requirements for obtaining railroad retirement credit for service in the Armed Forces between June 15, 1948, and December 15, 1950. Many enlistees in this period had not been allowed service credit because there was not a national state of emergency in force during this period before the Korean War. Railroad retirement credit may now be deemed for such indi- viduals if they meet the general requirement for military service credits by having rendered railroad service in the year of entry into military service, or the preceding year, and, in addition, returned to railroad service immediately after their discharge without working outside the rail industry in the mean- time. About 10,000 claims in current-payment status are being identified, re- viewed for entitlement to additional service credits, and recomputed to reflect such credits. Some of these claims may have had the military service credited as Social Security wages.638 -Separation and severance payments subject to railroad retirement payroll taxes frequently do not yield commensurate railroad retirement service credits be- cause taxes are assessed on the basis of when compensation is paid while earn- ings credits are allocated on the basis of when compensation is earned. The amendments provided that a lump sum, approximating railroad retirement tier II payroll taxes deducted from separation or severance payments, may be paid upon retirement to employees with 10 years of service, or their survivors, ifthe separation or severance payments did not yield additional railroad retirement service credits. The lump-sum provision applies to separation and severance payments made after, 1984. The Railroad Retirement Board is securing data on separation and severance payment back to 1985 from rail employers. Complete implementation of this provision will not occur until 1990, but initial payments were made in 1989. -The amendments changed the amount that employee disability annuitants are allowed to earn before their benefits become subject to earnings deductions from $200 a month to $400. Disability annuitants were advised accordingly in the 1989 mass mailing of notices to all beneficiaries. The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 included Social Security provisions which also affect railroad retirement beneficiaries. The major provisions were as follows: -Social Security benefit deductions for excess earnings in the year. of a benefi- ciary's death, which also apply to railroad retirement tier I benefiti, vested dual benefits, and survivor benefits, were liberalized so that the annual earnings * exempt amount will no longer be prorated on a monthly basis for the year of a beneficiary's death. Under the amendments, benefit deductions for earnings in the year of the beneficiary's death will not be made unless those earnings exceed the annual limit for that year. In addition, for persons who die in the year of their 65th birthday, the higher earnings exempt amount applicable upon attainment of age 65 will also apply to those who die before their 65th birthday. -The amendments liberalized the provisions requiring reductions in the Social Security and tier I railroad retirement benefits of employees awarded certain Federal, State, or local government pensions and certain foreign pensions in. recent years. Under the amendments, lesser benefit reductions apply to employ- -ees with between 21 and. 29 years of substantial railroad retirement or Social Security covered employment, as opposed to 26 to 29 years of such coverage under prior law. The amendments also included a technical provision to apply the reduction in the first month of concurrent entitlement to the two benefit rather than the first month of concurrent eligibility. ;LGAL RULING Jaeb v. Commissioner of Revenue, in the State of Minnesota Tax Court, involved a suit for a refund of taxes paid to Minnesota based on income from railroad retire- ment annuities. The Tax Court held that Minnesota's law imposing a tax on the tier I and tier Il-portions of railroad retirement annuities is unconstitutional and void because it is in violation of the Railroad Retirement Act. Based on ,the Minnesota decision, the State of Ohio's Department of Taxation reversed its position on the taxability of tier I and tier H portions, and is authorizing refunds plus interest for those taxpayers who included such income in Ohio taxable income and who timely file refund applications in accordance with Ohio tax law. MANAGEMENT MPXOVEEMNTS Modernization of its automated claims processing systems has been the Board's foremost management goal in recent years. The Board has adopted an incremental, multi-faceted approach to modernizing its existing systems, which allows flexibility in implementing changes without major disruptions, provides for an early payback and encourages the development of PC-based solutions. Au interbureau planning group of key staff members was established to develop a comprehensive 5-year plan for further automation of retirement claimis processing opaerations. During the 1989 fiscal year, the Board implemented a system to allow unem- ployed raird workers to register for unemployment benefi by mail, rather than in person. The system includes pre-payment and post-payment verification proce- dures, utiizng electronic data exchange to notify railroads about applications and claims and to receive claim information from railroads. Other administrative initiatives included enhanced debt collection activities and, as part of the Board's ongoing program to improve financial management, a new639 program accounts receivable system. The Board also made substantial progress in reviewing and revising the agency's regulations. At the same time that resources are committed to management improvements for greater efficiency and effectiveness of operations, the Board's staff remains very much aware that considerate and courteous service for each and every railroad re- tirement beneficiary is essential to the Board's mission. ITEM 30. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION NovEmiBER 27, 1989. DEAR SENATOR PRYOR: Thank you for your letter of October 11, 1989, concerning The Senate Special Committee on Aging and the preparation of its annual report, Developments in Aging. The Small Business Administration (SBA) does not directly address the needs of older Americans. The varied services and programs sponsored by SBA are available to all citizens and we encourage older Americans to take advantage of them. We do sponsor a particular program which may offer unusually attractive serv- ices to the older citizen. This program, the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), has recently celebrated its 25th year of volunteer service. SCORE is a pro- gram, sponsored and funded through SBA, that provides free counseling and low- cost training to Americans who wish to go into business or who already own small businesses. Because the vast bulk of the 13,000 volunteer members of SCORE are retired, they share a bond of age with older Americans. The program offers two distinct services to these citizens. First, SCORE offers a broad program of advice and train- ing to those who may be interested in a new career. And second, SCORE offers a rewarding outlut for energies and experience to those who may wish to give some- thing back to their country. Over the past year, SCORE has evidenced a growing interest and concern for the older segment of our population and this year we will begin compiling statistics to determine the number of those who currently take advantage of SCORE services. Again, thank you for your letter. I hope that I have been of some help and I ap- preciate your interest in small business. Sincerely, SUwAN ENGELEITER, Administrator. ITEM 31. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS JANUARY 8, 1990. DEAR MR. CHAIMA: I am pleased to respond to your request for a report of the Department of Veterans Affairs activities on behalf of older persons for the calen- dar year 1989. VA has developed a high quality system that provides health care for thousands of elderly veterans every day. Meeting the medical needs of older veterans consti- tutes one of VA's current greatest challenges. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to share this information with you. Sincerely, EDwARD J.

DEPARTMT OF VETERANS BENEFITS Compensation and Pension Vetorana Assistance Service641 ANNUAL REPORT TO SENATE CtOI7TBE ON AGING DBPARnhE 0 VETERANS AFFAIRS VETERANS HALTH SERVICES AmD RESEARCH AlUNISTRATION I. INTRO11CTIOR The Department of V tersns Affairs (VA) has the potential responsibility for a beneficiary population of over 27 million veterans whose median age is 54.9 years. More than twenty five percent of the veteran population is ege 65 and older and will increase to 37% by the year 2000. Nhile the total nunber of veterans will decline, those over the age of 65 dill rise to almost 9 million and by the year 2005 alost four snd a half million will be 75 years or older. This demographic trend will require the VA to redistribute its resources to meet the different needs of this older population. Historically, older persons are greater users of health care facilities. The number of physician visits, short-term hospital stays and number of days in the hospital all increase as the patient moves from the fifth to seventh decade of life. VA has developed a wide rasg of services to provide care in a variety of institutional, non-lnstitutional. and comunity settings to ensure that the physical, psychiatric snd socioeconomic needs of the patient are mt. Special projecte. a variety of innovative, medically proven prograns and individual VA medical center initiatives have been developed end tested that can be used for veteran patients and adapted for use by the general population. VA operates the largest health care system in the Nation, encompassing 172 hospitals, 116 nursing home units, 29 domiciliaries, and 226 outpatient clinics. Veterans are also provided contract care in non-VA hospitals and in comnunity nursing homes, fee-for-service visits by non-VA physicians and dentists for outpatient treatment, and support for car in SS Stete Veterans Somes (see page 7) and 3 annexes in 36 States. As part of a broader VA and non-VA network, affiliation egreements exist between virtually all health care facilities end nearly 1,000 medical, dental, and associated health centers. This affiliation progrm with academic medical centers results in about 100,000 health profession students receiving education and training in VAMC's each year.642 In addition to VA hospital and nursing home prograxms. VA is increasing the number and diversity of non-institutional extended care programs. The dual purpose is to facilitate independent living and keep the patient in a community setting by making available the appropriate supportive medical and human services. These programs include Hospital-Based Home Care. Community Residential Care, Adult Day Health Care and Psychiatric Day Treatment and Mental Hygiene Clinics. The need for both acute and chronic hospitalization will continue to rise as older patients experience a different mix of diseases than younger patients. Cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung diseases, cancers, organic brain disorders, bone and joint diseases, hearing and vision disorders and a variety of other illnesses and disabilities are all more prevalent in those persons age 65 and older. More often the older individual has more than one chronic condition, and the conditions tend to be progressive, degenerative, and permanent, requiring long-term rehabilitation and care. In 1975 the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration (VHS&RA) initiated the Geriatric Research. Education and Clinical Center (GRECC) program. The GRECCs \"ere designed as centers of excellence for the advancement and integration of research, education and clinical achievements in geriatrics and gerontology into the entire VA system. This' year two' ne GRECCa received ' funding to begin development, bringing the total to 12 GNECCs. Finally, to met the challenge of the growing aging population, VA through its long-range planning system is identifying' underutilised hospital heds that can be converted to nursing home care beds for the future demand. II. GERIATRICS ARD EXTENDED CARE PROGRAMS VA Nursing Hone Care The Nursing Home Care Units located in VA medical centers provide skilled nursing care and related medical services. as yell as opportunities for social. diversional. recreational. and spiritual activities. Nursing home patients typically require a prolonged period of nursing home care and supervision, as yell as rehabilitation services to attain and/or maintain optimal functioning.643 In fiscal year 1989, 27,023 veterans were treated in VA nursing homes which had an average daily census of 11.468. Additional new nursing home care uait beds were activated at San Antonio. TX and Xinneapolis, MN. These and other changes resulted in a net increase of 254 operating beds for a total of 12.530. Community Horsing Home Care This 'is a comsmunity-based, contract program for veterans who require skilled or intermediate nursing care when making a transition from a hospital to the community. Veterans who have been hospitalized in a VA facility for treatment, primarily of a service-connected condition. may be placed at VA expense for as long as they need nursing care. Other veterans nay be eligible for placement in community facilities at VA expense for a period not to exceed 6 months. Selection of nursing homes for a VA contract requires the prior assessment of participating facilities. Follow-up visits are wade to veterans by teams from VA medical centers to monitor patient programs and quality of care. In fiscal year 1989, 32,715 veterans were treated in the program. The number of nursing homes under contract was 3.675 in fiscal year 1989. The average daily census in these homes for fiscal year 1989 was 9.305. VA Domiciliary Care Domiciliary care in VA facilities provides necessary medical and other professional care for eligible ambulatory veterans who are disabled by disease, injury, or age and are in need of care but do not require hospitalization or the skilled nursing services of a nursing home. The domiciliary offers specialized interdisciplinary treatment programs that are designed to facilitate the rehabilitation of patients who suffer from head trauma, stroke, mental illness, chronic alcoholism, heart disease and a wide range of other disabling conditions. The domiciliary with increasing fre- quency, is viewed as the treatment setting of choice for many older veterans. Implementation of rehabilitation-oriented programs has provided a better quality of care and life for veterans who require prolonged domiciliary care and has prepared increasing numbers of veterans for return to independent or semi-independent community living.644 Special attention is being given to older veterans in domiciliaries with a goal of keeping them active and productive as well as integrated into the community. The older veterans are encouraged to utilize senior centers and other resources in the community where the domiciliary is located. Patients at several domiciliaries are involved in senior center activities in the community as part of the VA's community integration program. Other specialized programs in which older veterans are involved include Foster Grandparents. Handyman Assistance to senior citizens in the community, and Adopt-A-Vet. In fiscal year 1989. 17.822 veterans were treated in VA domiciliaries with an average daily census of 6,315. (Of these numbers, approximately 3,600 veterans and an average daily census of 969 were admitted to the domiciliaries for specialized care for homelessness. This group has an average age of 42 years, while the overall average age is 59 years.) State Homes The State Home program has grown fron 11 homes in 11 States in 1888 to 55 State homes (one of which has three annexes) in 36 States. Currently a total of 18,939 beds are authorized to provide hospital, nursing home and domiciliary care. VA's relationship to State Veterans Homes is based upon two grant programs. The per die. grant program enables VA to assist the States in providing care to eligible veterans who require domiciliary. nursing home, or hospital care in State home facilities. The other VA grant program provides up to 65 percent Federal funding in the construction or acquisition of new domicili- ary and nursing home care facilities, and the expansion, remodeling, or alteration of existing facilities. In fiscal year 1989. the Secretary recognized a new State home at Southeastern Pennsylvania, and is in the process of recognizing a 150-bed nursing home at Alexander City, Alabama, a 150-bed domiciliary at Lake City, Florida, and a 40-bed nursing home at Caribou. Maine. Construction was started on a 120-bed nursing home in the State of Maine: and a 220-bed nursing home at Anderson, South Carolina. The $49.4 million obligated by VA in fiscal year 1989 for construction and renovation projects also included: new State645 hones in Kentucky for 240 nursing hone and 60 domiciliary beds; a 120-bed nursing home at Murfreesboro. Tennessee, 50-bed nursing hone additions at State hones Tilton, New Hampshire, Marquette. Michigan, and Homelake, replacement facility at Sandusky, Ohio: a 180-bed nursing home at Spring City, Pennsylvania; a 148-bed nursing home at Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania; an 89-bed nursing hone at Silver Say. Minnesota, and four general renovation projects. Palliative Care VA has developed programs which furnish palliative care, supportive counseling, and other medical services to terminally ill veterans, as well as supportive counseling to their families in various service settings. Te hospice concept of care is generally incorporated in VA medical centers' approaches to the care of the terminally ill. Hospital-Based Some Care The program provides primary medical care to veterans with chronic illnesses in their own homes. The family provides the necessary personal care under the coordinated supervision of a hospital-based interdisciplinary treatment team. The team provides the medical, nursing, social, rehabilitation and dietetic regimens, as well as the training of family members and the patient. Seventy-two VA medical centers are providing hospital-based bone care services. More acute beds in hospitals are mads available by providing increased days of care in the home. In fiscal ye&- 1989, 295,559 home visits were made by health professionals. Over 15,710 patients were treated. - Adult Day Health Care Adult Day Health Care (ADSC) is a therapoutically oriented ambulatory program that provides health maintenance and rehabilitation services to veterans in a congregate setting during daytime hours. ADEC in the VA is a medical mdel of services, designed as a substitute for nursing home care, as established by Public Law 98-160. VA continues to operate 15 ADSC centers in rY 1989. The average attendance was 318 and 833 patients were enrolled in fiscal year 1989. VA also continued a program of contracting for ADSC services at 22 VA medical centers. Seventy-si. contracts have been established. The average attendance was 82 and 396 patients wre treated in Fiscal Year 1989.646 Community Residential Care The residential care home program provides residential care, including room, board, personal care. and general health care supervision to veterans who do not require hospital or nursing home care but who, because of health condi- tions, are not able to resume independent living and have no suitable support system (e.g., family. friends) to provide the needed care. All homes are inspected by a VA multidisciplinary team prior to incorporation of the home into the VA program and annually thereafter. Care is provided in private homes that have been selected by VA, at the veteran's oem expense. Veterans receive monthly follow-up visits from VA health care professionals. In Fy d 1989 an average daily census of 11,100 veterans was maintained in this program utilizing approximately 2.900 homes. Geriatric Evaluation Units A Geriatric Evaluation Unit (GEU) is usually a functionally different group of beds (ranging typically in number from 4 to 20) on a Medical Service or an Intermediate Care ward of the hospital where an interdisciplinary health care team performs comprehensive geriatric assessments. The GNU serves to improve the diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and discharge planning of older patients who have functional impairments. multiple acute and chronic diseases, and/or psychosocial problems. In addition to improving care for older patients and preventing their unnecessary institutionalization, a GNU provides geriatric training and research opportunities for physicians and other health care professionals in the medical center. Results from a controlled, randomized study-of GKU efficacy that was conductoo at the VA Medical Center Sp\"_1Wa, CA. showed significant benefits\"such as , _.,~----improvd rehospitalisation rates, functional status, and decreased nursing home placement following admission to the GIU. Currently, there are 87 Geriatric Evaluation Units in the VA medical system. Further expansion of the program is anticipated. Respite Care It is generally recognized that most chronically ill persons who do not need hospital services can be most effectively cared for, if, through the assis- tance of family or other members of the household, they are able to live at home. At the same time, there is recognition that such arrangements for care647 of a patient at home may place severe physical and emotional burdens on the caregiver and the household. The clinical objective of providing institu- tionally-based respite care is to support the caregiver's role in caring for the chronically ill veteran at home. VA may provide respite care which is of limited duration and is provided in VA facilities on an intermittent basis to a veteran who is suffering from a chronic illness and who resides primarily at hone. Respite care is offered for the purpose of helping the veteran to continue residing primarily at home. The respite care program could and should interdigitate and reciprocate with the hospital-based hoae care program at VAMCs in which both services exist. Currently approximately 100 medical centers are providing respite care. Alsheimer's Disease and Related Disorders VA's program for veterans with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders is decentralized throughout the medical care system with coordination and direction from the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care. Veterans with these diagnoses participate in all aspects of the health care system including outpatient programs, acute care programs and extended care programs. Some medical centers have established specialized programs for the treatment of these veterans. In order to advance knowledge about the care for veterans with dementia. VA conducts basic biomedical, applied clinical and health service research through the Office of Research end Development and the Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Centers (GRECCs). Rehabilitation Research and Development Service develops and evaluates new technologies and techniques designed to minimise excess disability associated with dementia. Continuing education for staff is provided through training classes sponsored by Regional Medical Education Centers, GRECCs end Cooperative Health Manpower Education Programs. During FY 1989. VA completed a major revision of the 1985 \"Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia\". which will be widely distributed within and outside VA. A survey of all VA medical centers to collect information on current services for veterans with dementia was also completed in. TY 1989 and a directory is being prepared for VA field staff use. Geriatric Research. Education & Clinical Centers (GRECCs) The Geriatric Research. Education and Clinical Centers (GRECCs) assume an important role in further developing the capability of the VA health care 26-386 0 -90 -22648 system to provide neaimally effective and appropriate care to older veterans. First implemented in 1975. GRECCs are.designed to enhance the system's capability in geriatrics by conducting integrated research. education and clinical care. The goals of the GRECCs are to develop new knowledge regarding aging and geriatrics, to disseminate that knowledge through education and training to health care professionals and students. and to develop and evaluate alternative models of geriatric care. Each GRECC has developed an integrated program of basic, and applied research. education, training and clinical care in select areas of geriatrics. Current focal areas include cardiology; cognitive and motor dysfunction infectious diseases rheunatology: and molecular biology of aging. Using an integrated approach, the GRECCa are developing practitioners, educators, and researchers to help meat the need for training health care professionals in the field of geriatrics: providing information for as well as establishing models on cost-effective approaches to care of the elderly; and researching better and more different methods to diagnose and treat health care problems of the older person as well as finding answers to fundamental questions on the process and consequences of aging. At present there are 12 GRECCs. Ten are fully operational and are located in VA medical centers at Bedford and Brockton/West Rowbury. MA (2 WA (2 divisions); Sepulveda. CA; and West Los Angeles. CA. Two new GRECCs began operation in Fr 1989 at Ann Arbor end San Antonio VA medical centers. Public Law 9i-166. Veterans Administra- tion Health Care Amendments of 1985\". increased 'from 15 to 25 the mandnum number of facilities that the VA Administrator (now Secretary of VA) may designate for GRECCs. III. OFFICE OF CLINICAL AFFAIRS Medical Service The Medical Service' serves as the primary source of physicians for the care of elderly patients. Due to the aging of the population. the Medical Service is increasingly involved in all aspects of the delivery of health care to the aged. Acute and intermediate medical wards, coronary and intensive care units, nursing homes and outpatient clinics are all seeing an increased proportion of elderly patients for acute illnesses.649 Some subspecialty areas are particularly impacted. including cardiology, endocrinology (diabetes)/rheumatology and oncology. The Medical Service provides necessary suhapecialty care in inpatient and outpatient settings in addition to participating in Geriatric Fellowship Training, GRECCC. Geriatric Evaluation Units (GZU's), Hospice, Respite, Hospital-Based Home Care. and Senior Clinicians Programs. The specialized care that is required by the elderly has been recognized by Medical Service at approximately 25 VA medical centers, by their establishment of a Chief of Geriatric Medicine Section, .hich emphasizes clinical care, as well as coordinating research, education efforts related to geriatrics. Age alone is less frequently used as a determinant of an individual patient's care. Geriatric patients increasingly undergo cardiac catheterization and cardiac catheterization laboratories are being established according to demographic need. The sunbelt is experiencing an increasingly heavy catheterization load. Similarly, the average age of patients treated in coronary and intensive care units is increasing, producing a concomitant demand for cardiac rehabilitation and physical fitness programs that are targeted to the frail elderly and the physically handicapped of all ages. Oncology treatment centers are also expanding. The special interest and involvement of Medical Service in geriatrics has also resulted in participation by internists in such programs as Adult Day Health Care, as well as in research problems in nutrition and treatment of hypertension. Smoking cessation has been shown to benefit even elderly patients, thus the role of Preventive Medicine for this patient population has expanded. The Medical Service has been active in implementing preventive strategies in smoking cessation immunisation (influenza and pneumococcal vaccines), and colorectal screening (for cancer). The Medical Service has actively participated in the Intermediate Care Advisory Group. Evaluation and treatment of elderly patients by inter- disciplinary teams during intermediate-length hospital stays will be an increasingly important role for the physicians of the Medical Service. Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences Service (MH&BSS) continues to move forward in efforts to develop clinical programs to meet the needs of the aging veteran population ith behavioral disorders. Geropsychiatric patients650 account for 2.4% of all VAMC 'admissions: however, they consumed almost 23% of the total days of care for this year. Last year 14% of all geriatric patients treated in VAMCs.were admitted primarily for psychiatric disorders: this figure does not include veterans who ware admitted for other reasons while suffering, a long-standing psychiatric disability. Their clinical problems were partly related to age, but also were determined by the presence of simultaneous medical and psychiatric disorders. The presence of a behavioral disorder in an elderly veteran resulted in an increase in length of hospitalization as well as a significant increase in the death rate. This group of patients required more intensive care, and more extensive hospitalization. VA offers a variety of innovative programs to assist geropsychiatric patients. For example, a psychologist at VAMC Coateaville heads a \"Stroke Clinic\" for families of patients with strokes. During the rehabilitation process, families are prepared for limitations in activity and changes in the'- patient's personality and are taught ways to cope with and be supportive to the veteran. Computer-assisted Cognitive Rehabilitation programs at VAMC Lyons. New Jersey; Martinsburg. West Virginia; and Palo Alto, California. among others,.assist' elderly patients showing signs of short-term memory loss associated with early dementia or pseudodementia. A patient who required escort to and from appointments may be able to go unaccompanied after participating in such a program. A number of MN&BSS staff are also involved in Respite programs (see also p. 11) which permit caregivers a few days or weeks of respite from the - demanding care of an elderly veteran living in his or her home by admitting the patient temporarily to a Nursing Home Care Unit (ECU). Ongoing advice and support to the caregiver, most of whom are also elderly. extends the numbers of patients that these NHCUs can treat far beyond their bed capacity.. Elderly veterans living at home with such a caregiver are reportedly often more debilitated than many in the NHCU. VA hospitals provided inpatient psychiatric care to a large number of veterans who reside in VA and community nursing homes. domiciliaries. and with caregivers in the community.651 Recent cooperative efforts by MR&BSS and Medical Service as well as other offices in VHS&RA (e.g.. Geriatrics and Rxtended Care, Academic Affairs. Research and Development, and Regional Directors) have resulted in the development of innovative pilot programs. For instance. Dr. Lissy Jarvik, distinguished physician, psychiatrist and researcher at VAMC West Los Angeles (Brentwood), by discovering dysfunctional microtubules within brain cells of Alzheimer's patients. has created promising research possibilities regarding the cause of that devastating illness. She has also demonstrated that comprehensive, multi-level care for the elderly can significantly improve their quality of life and decrease medical costs. GRAMPS (Geriatric Record and Multidisciplinary Planning System), a provider- interactive computerized medical record system which was designed to support outpatient geriatric practice in VA clinics, was developed and pilot-tested by a VA psychologist now at VAMC American Lake. In a controlled, prospective study involving over 300 geriatric patients at VAMC Loma Linda. physician use of the system -as demonstrated to be associated with a reduction of hospitalization costs ($000 per patient per year). improvement in the quality of care, and better outcomes for patients treated for hypertension. GRAMPS was well accepted by users and was capable of producing legible progress notes, prescriptions and consult requests. The physicians noted better access to clinical information. (e.g.. medication status, weights, blood pressures) and systematic reminders regarding such issues as patient education. With additional testing, GRAMPS offers the possibility of serving as a general medical record system for all VA ambulatory care and has the potential to improve health care while helping control costs. The Director. Western Region, sponsored two pilot programs which involves treating primarily elderly veterans who have combined acute medical and psychiatric problems. VAMCs Portland and West Los Angeles will compare different methods of organizing such programs by using predefined outcome criteria. MHUtSS is revising the patterns of care provided to the elderly veterans and will continue to encourage the development and expansion of the programs which respond to this population's needs. Social Work Service The rapidly increasing population of chronically ill/frail elderly veterans requiring long-term care provides a special challenge to Veterans Health Services & Research Administration and to Social Work Service, a challenge652 that is expected to continue through the 1990's and perhaps beyond. If VA's goal of providing 'high quality care, in the most cost-effective way, with compassion and through centers of excellence\" is to be achieved in the present and projected economic climate, it is essential that a comprehensive range of health and social services be available to ensure that patients are provided with the appropriate level of care, and that continuity of service is achieved along the care continuum. Areas of social work practice essential to ensuring continuity of care include discharge planning, care coordination/case management services, and community services coordination and development. These critical components of the health care continuum have been central to the development of social work programs for older veterans for many years and will continue to assume a major role in the development. expension, and integration of services to prevent or delay institutional care and to promote the well-being of veterans who can be cared for more appropriately in their own homes or in an alternative community setting. Consistent with this framework for action, the following initiatives have been targeted for implementation/expansion during 1989 and beyond: 1. Care Coordination/Case Management Services Care Coordination, or case management, is a service system in which the responsibility for assessing, planning, locating, coordinating, and monitoring groups of services rests with a designated provider and occurs on a case by case basis. Within the VA health care system. a comprehensive approach must be developed which coordinates the interdisciplinary resources of our acute, intermediate, and long-teom care programs with the full range of community health and social services to ensure integration and continuity of care for patients and their families. Already provided to significant categories of patients (long-term psychiatric, visually impaired, spinal cord injured, dialysis, es-POW's, etc.). Care Coordination Services must be expanded to all patients requiring such services to ensure clinically relevant care, conti- nuity, and cost effectiveness. Social Work Service is expanding services and software which will provide a systemwide program for interdisciplinary and VA/community participation and accountability in this important area. 2. Expanding Alternative Levels of Care -Completing the Health Care Continuum Clinical programs continually treat significant numbers of patients who could (and should) be provided care at a lesser levei of clinical resources and expense. However, such services are often unavailable and reflect a \"gap\" in653 the care continuwe. What in needed is a broad range of coordinated, integrated, and managed services, ranging in intensity and complexity on the basis of changieg patient health and functional status. These services involve a spectrum of VA and non-VA services, which are delivered in a wide range of settings, from impatient care units to the home. If VA is to manage the health care of frail elderly/ chronically ill veterans, it will have to enter into expanded partnerships with its health care and social service allies in the community. At all VA medical centers, community services coordinators have been appointed to facilitate the coordination. development, and integration of VA and community services to meat the needs of chronically ill/frail elderly veterans. Numerous initiatives have been reported systenwide whereby VA and the community health and social services network. including the area agencies on aging, work cooperatively to promote the delivery of services to veterans and non-veterans who otherwise eight occupy costly acute medical or nursing care beds, or who would suffer the consequences of unavailable or inaccessible services. 3. Systems for.Supporting the Family Caregiver Clinical experience over the past several years has confirmed that treatment and continued care of chronically impaired veterans oust include the family caregiver. Recognized as a primary and legitimate care provider is Respite. Hospital-Based. Home Care, Palliative Care/Hospice, and Adult Day Health Care programs, the primary caregiver must be involved in education. training, and active participation with the health care team to ensure support in their caregiver role as well as the integrity of the VA health care system. Social Work is drawing from established programs at three medical centers in developing staff training and caregiver teaching materials for systeewide use. 4. Serving the Homeless Veterans While it is difficult to estimate the proportion of older veterans who are homeless, it is reasonable to assume that the number is increasing as the veteran population ages. National studies sad available statistical data clearly indicate that a significant percentage of veterans comprise the population of homeless males nationwide. While services and programs have been substantially expanded or developed through special funding of Chronic Mentally Ill Homeless programs and specialized domiciliaries, approximately two thirds of VAMCs must respond to this growing national problem without additional agency resources. It is imperative that joint planning and development efforts with the community services network be expanded and creative responses developed which use appropriately the expertise and654* resources of each. While recognizing the unique scope of the homeless problem, including the geographic and resource constellation of each VANC, information regarding program developments and experiences is being shared with Social Work Service's community service coordinators. 5. Expanding Health Care Resources Through the Creative Us- of volunteers Community-based volunteers provide a largely untapped potential resource for assisting clinical staff in sustaining patients= in community settings. Experience of Senior Companion Programs at over 30 VANCs, the Older Veterans Assistant Program (OVAP) sponsored by DAV, and a wide range of participation by organized veterans groups and affiliated volunteers have demonstrated the - crucial role volunteers contribute to both-patient and primary caregiver. Social Work and Voluntary Services have undertaken a'joint initiative to recruit and equip this valuable resource for the continued'treatment and community stabilization of veteran patients and-caregivers.' In 1989 at a national health care symposium, Social Work Service chiefs and other key staff developed a consensus document which outlined areas for Social Work Service action and intervention in the' 1990's. while giving specific sanction to the priority areas'noted sbove, special emphasis was placed on community resource development and collaboration as an essential component in' the implementation of a plan to address the specific-needs of ouirgeriatric population. The Social-Work- Service Resource and Program Development Committee is in the process of identifying and publicising creative programs at specific medical centers or outpatient clinics which promote VSSwRA priorities of service coordination, cost containment, and \"improved utilization of VA and community resources. Rehabilitation Research and Development The mission of the Rehabilitation Research and Development (Rehab. R&D) Service is to \"support research for improving the quality of life of impaired, disabled and handicapped veterans, including our aging veterans.\" This is accomplished by conducting a program of research, development and evaluation of new and unique devices, techniques aid concepts of rehabilitation that will allow more functional independence in the activities of daily living of physically disabled and infirm veterans. The Rehabilitation R&D Service has established a significant interest area in the field of aging. The Rehabilitation R&D Service will actively promote this effort through the following655 Stimulate nsw R&D in VA Medical Centers to met the needs of disabled aging veterans. Support a Rehabilitation Research and Development Unit at Decatur, Georgia whose primary focus is the needs of aging veterans. Evaluate in VA medical centers newly developed devices. techniques and concepts on rehabilitation as they pertain to the aged. Promote commercialization of the products of VA-sponsored R&D. Promote the utilization of rehabilitation R&D technological advances developed by our research and that of others by dissemination of the Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development and articles in other professional journals. In addition to the Rehabilitation RED unit at Decatur. Georgia specializing in aging and merit-revi-eed projects at VAMC's throughout the nation, Rehabilita- tion R&D supports two other Rehabilitation R&D Centers which conduct research impacting on aging. One of these centers is located in Palo Alto, Cali- fornia. In collaboration with Stanford University. this center conducts research in orthopedic, biomechanics. and man-machine integration as it relates to robotics, and analytic modeling of disability and devices. Another center is located at Nines, Illinois. with research emphasis in orthopedic surgery and visual deficiencies. One of the unique problems that the elderly experience is that of mobility. Wheelchairs provide mobility for the elderly. In the early 1940's, the wheelchair was revolutionized with the design and manufacture of a portable. lightweight, strong, and maneuverable model. Since then the most important innovation has been the powered chair. Rehabilitation R&D has been support- ing several efforts to make wbeelchairs more useful to those who need then. We have supported the development of standards for wheelchair manufacture and design and these standards have been submitted to and accepted by the American National Institute of Standards. There are approximately 125 wheelchair manufacturers in the United States today, each making a variety of models. Three major problems which wheelchair users experience are: 1) the inability to make the wheelchair go when one or both arms of the individual lacks strength or function to operate the wheelchairj 2) to make the wheelchair go sideways or kittycornered as well as forward and backward, and. 3) to surmount the barriers of stairs, curbs and uneven terrain.656 The Rehabilitation R&D Center at Palo Alto, California has developed an Ultrasonic Head controlled wheelchair. In this design, head movements of the patient activate two Polaroid ultrasonic distance ranging sensors which generate control signals for the operation of the chair. Another researcher at Palo Alto is working on an Optimal Bionechanical Design for the Develop- ment of an Am Powered Mobility Vehicle. The thrust of this work is the search for the most mechanically efficient method of powering wheelchairs with the upper extremities. Another design out of Palo Alto, now commercially available is the onnidirectional wheelchair which can move in any direction. A very sophisticated kind of environmental control which has relevance to the needs of older persons is the family ofrobotic arms -- articulated netal arms that can be programmed for some basic function. The robot can be useful for' assisting in eating. grooming. reaching for a book_ turning a page or i , summoning an attendant. Some respond to voice commands. The Rehabilitation - R&D Service is in the process of commercializing the first generation of robotic arms for use with paraplegics -- who are enthusiastic about the degree - of independence robotic arms provide. Research is being conducted to, - establish the man-machine interface for older persons. -' - Five Federal agencies (the National Institute on Aging.the Administration on Aging, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Institute of Disability Rehabilitation Research) are pooling resources. talent and knowledge to develop a wandering device to assist the elderly in remaining as independent as possible wherever they reside. Under contract in FY 1988, the five agencies continued efforts to design and ; develop a device which alerts a caregiver.that a wanderer has 'left a prey . scribed area and a devicewhich will ,track that wanderer once he/she leaves that prescribed area. , . The Rehabilitation R&D Unit in Decatur, Georgia is pursuing research in the care of individuals who are demented particularly those with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Wandering is a serious problem for both caregivers and elderly persons who engage in the behavior. One of the questions that was posed is whether or not a wanderer's behavior could be changed or modified or redirected. A pilot study being conducted by the Rehabilitation R&D Unit at the VA Medical Center. Decatur. nursing home offers some preliminary results that seem to indicate that it is possible to intervene in the behavior of a wanderer using verbal commands.657 The Rehabilitation R&D Service is in the process of digitizing hearing aids. One of the problems that hearing aid wearers face is the inability of the clinician to adjust the hearing aid to the specific and unique characteristics of the wearer., Rehabilitation R&D is supporting research that is approaching commercialization on the digitized hearing aid, This important developsent involves the use of a computer to fine tune the hearing aid to the specific hearing loss frequencies of an individual. Rehabilitation R&D is also putting computers to use in working with aphasics. communicate, particularly those who have lost the ability to recognize everyday items and to articulate them. A specialized language has been constructed based on flash card technology to assist the aphasic in under- standing the spoken language and communicating. Another example of Rehabilitation R&D-supported research in the area of aging concerns the use of computer-assisted therapy for aphasics. This is an instance where computers have bridged the gap between the availability of trained manpower and individuals who need therapy. In Birmiogham, Alabama research has been completed which has shown that it is possible for a computer to be programmed to conduct speech therapy by telephone. Rehabilitation Medicine Service Rehabilitation Medicine Service (RMS) strives to provide all referred older persons with comprehensive assessment and treatment of physical disability effecting functional independence and quality of life. Through the use of physical agents, therapeutic modalities, and exercises RMS therapists assist the patient in developing and attaining specific goals. RMS therapists and other interdisciplinary professionals led by physicians, usually physiatrists. continue to provide inpatient care in 1,400 beds at 75 medical centers. Growth is scheduled at 8% for the nest five years. Physical, psychosocial, and vocation rehabilitation therapy is also provided to outpatients and to veterans referred from all other bed sections of medical centers. Self-help skills and independent living training. muscle strength- ening, mobility training and prescription and provision of prosthetic and orthotic aids and devices, constitute major traditional therapy offerings.658 Occupational and physical therapists, are developing state-of-the-art delivery in nontraditional settings such as home-bound health care, independent living centers, GEUs, Alsheimer units, and palliative care/hospice care centers. They are working, teaching and receiving education in special programs including GRECCs, and Interdisciplinary Teae Training in Geriatrics (ITTGa) (see p. 55). Pilot projects are being developed, to provide driver, education orientation and evaluation for veterans over 55 years of age. Resources at over 27 esisting handicapped driver training centers would be used to meet-needs ofnging veterans who drive after the average age of safe driving. Classroom education updates in laws and defensive driving techniques would be supported by behind the wheel driver observation from driver training professions. A uniform functional independence measure (FIM) is being prepared for national applica- tion with rehabilitation patients. Eighteen elements of life function will be addressed and changes of performance during treatment quantified and compared. FIN development has been sponsored by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and., Rehabilitation and endorsed or participated in by 11 other national rehabilitation organizations. This multidisciplinary tool will facilitate efforts to assure quality care to all veterans served by RMS. Therapists and students.also staff and/or receive training in GRECCs where - they are participating in research and development of geriatric assessment- tools. A significant number of EMS therapists have received advanced education and training in gerontology which focuses, on new and successful treatment programs for the geriatric population. ,- Nursing Service Nursing care of the elderly veteran is a vital part of the Nursing Service mission and comprises the largest proportion of health services required by this age group. Recognizing the 'rapid increase in the number of aging veterans being admitted for care in all treatment modalities, Nursing Service is making a concerted effort to provide strong leadership in the clinical, administrative, research and educational components of nursing practice. Academic preparation is a high priority of Nursing Service to assure quality programs for treatment and rehabilitation of aged ill, disabled and at risk veterans. Graduate nursing students receive clinical education experience in GEUs. Nursing Rome Care Units and Hospital-Based Home Care programs. While the demand for rehabilitation nurse specialists has been increasing, the659 supply has been diminishing over recent years. due primarily to reduction in nurse traineeship funds for graduate education in this specialty area. Recruitment of highly qualified professional nurses is an on-going priority. One hundred four (104) positions were funded in 1988 by the Clinical Nurse Specialist Program for masters level nursing students in either geriatric/gerontological, rehabilitation or psychiatric/mental health nursing. One hundred eleven (111) were funded in these areas in 1989. Executive development of nurse leaders in long-term care is provided through preceptorship training for the position of Associate Chief or Supervisor, Nursing None Care. Currently. 50 Supervisors of Nursing Home Care have been approved for the discretionary title of Associate Chief. Nursing Service for Nursing Home Care. Preventive care and health promotion incentives are implemented to preserve independence, foster productivity and enhance the quality of life by improving the health status of aging veterans. The \"young old.\" ages 65-74 are relatively healthy and concerned with maintaining their health. Nurses in wellness clinics and other adult care settings provide supervision, screening and health education programs to assist veterans in maintaining healthy life styles. Programs for the physically disabled and cognitively impaired have been established and are administered by nurses in home care, ambulatory care settings and inpatient units. Treatment programs are goal-directed toward physical and psychosocial reconditioning or retraining of patients with biological and psychosocial disturbances. Patient and family teaching is a major part of each program. Family and significant others have a key role in providing support to aging veterans and are assisted in learning and in maintaining appropriate responsibilities. VA nurses are also volunteering their services for health care planning for the elderly in the community-at- large. They participate in self-help and support organizations related to specific diseases such as Aliheimer's, are advisors to local health planning councils, and share VA educational activities and research seminars with other health care professionals. While progress has been made in the care of aging veterans. increasing demands, shortages of critical health care personnel, and cost containment issues require more effective coordination of health care delivery to prevent fragmenting of care and inappropriate institutionalization. Practice models are needed to facilitate the care of aging veterans throughout the health care660 continuum and to assure access to the appropriate level of care in the most cost-effective setting. Professional nurses function as part of interdisci- plinary teams to coordinate and provide care in settings beginning with GZUs and progressing along many care settings including anhulatory care, acute care, intermediate care. long-term care and community agencies. Continuing education is essential to providing quality care to aging veterans. Nursing Service was part of a national task force responsible for a national training program on health care problems of the elderly. The program was presented in two medical districts to an interdisciplinary team from each medical center. Members of the task force continue to serve as consultants to the interdisciplinary team to assure plans are implemented and the impact on care to aging veterans is evaluated. Professional nurses are encouraged and supported in their efforts to conduct research, especially in clinical settings. Research is needed to advance health care for older persons and to improve gerontological nursing practice. Areas in which research are urgently needed to improve the quality of care include: o Urinary incontinence o Falls o Care of AlsheLner's patients o wandering behavior o Dementia o Nutrition o Exercise o Nobility o Psychotropic medication o Health promotion o Frail elderly in the home setting o Alternatives to institutional care Dietetic Service Dietetic Services in all VA medical centers are developing and/or continuing efforts to strengthen the nutritional care of the older veterans. The provision of adequate nutrients in a consumable form is particularly challenging. This past year Dietetic Service in VA evaluated foods developed by the Food Engineering Directorate U.S. Army Natick Research, Development, and Engineering Center which will meet the needs of many661 elderly patients with swallowing or chewing difficulties. These foods are modified consistency products and are presently produced by the Dietetic Services, but they are labor intensive. Over the next year, these foods will he tested in a number of the VA medical centers for future use. National Training Program on Health Care Problems of the Elderly (also see p. 36) was planned and conducted on a limited basis with plans to continue this year. The thrust of the educational program is to promote multidisciplinary care to improve quality and the cost effective utilization of resources. Each health care teem member (7 disciplines) challenges each of the other disciplines to utilize their expertise and become involved in the treatment goals of the other disciplines. The medical centers must send a core team of health care providers to the training program end return to develop an action plan. Follow-up snd evaluation is being provided to improve future programs. Some of the Dietetic Services have been investigating the feeding problems of the elderly patiet. Many of the these patients either cannot, or will not feed themselves when hospitalized. This is a multi-factorial problem. Many of the medical centers have begun to include the evaluatioo of \"adequate nutritional intake\" into their total quality management program. Determining the nutritional care needs and developing a care plan to achieve these goals is very complex when managing an older person. In order to concentrate efforts on this large segment of our population, Geriatric Nutrition Specialist positions are being established in our Nursing Homes and other extended care programs. IV. OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATION Voluntary Service VA continues to address the problems of elderly veterans by developing programs that utilize volunteers, and allow veteran patients to remain in their own communities as an alternative to hospitalization. Examples of these programs include: Telecare, Lifeline, the Senior Companion Program, the Home Assessment Project, Mobile Clinics, Hospital Based Home Care and the Retired Senior Volunteer program. o Telecare as implemented at VAMC Kansas City. MO, involves volunteers calling on a daily basis housebound veteran662 patients who live alone. This assures those veterans they are cared shout and that they. ns communicate daily with someone if they have a problem with their medication or health. o Loma Linda VAMC has an excellent example of Lifeline. In this case volunteer organizations not only fund but volunteers actually install the Lifeline system which enables the veteran patient to summon immediate medical assistance via a transmitter. o The Senior Companion Program, funded by Action Agency, pairs a volunteer with a veteran patient soon to be discharged. This Senior Companion maintains the' relationship with the veteran patient through the discharge process and during readjustment to the community. o The Disabled American Veteranst are presently funding the Home Assessment Project, administered by the GRECC at VAMC Sepulveda, CA. This project coordinates volunteer efforts in assessing the safety and convenience of domiciles to which the veteran patient has returned or is returning. Not only do the volunteers make the assessment, they take appropriate action to correct any housing deficiencies. o Volunteers working dith'mebile clinics sent from VAMCs to distant catcheet areas, make arrangements for appropriate space and supplemental staff for these clinics on wheels. o Volunteers assigned to the Hospital-Based Home Care Program provide both respite care and companionship during their weekly visits to homebound veterans. o Retired Senior Volunteers are part of the medical facilities' efforts to allow elderly veterans to remain in their home environment instead of being returned/admitted to the medical center. These volunteers assist in routine activities with which the veteran may have problems in the home environment. These routine activities may include check writing, food preparation, personal shopping, or light housekeeping.663 There are additional examples of VA medical care facilities where other programs are being developed for the long-term care and/or elderly veteran patient, and have been shared across the country. The Silver Spoon Project, originating at the VANC in Loma Linda, CA, involves volunteers willing to make a monthly comoitment to feed patients who are able to eat but who are unable to feed themselves. Family Day activities at Brooklyn and Dayton VAMCs are sponsored by the volunteers and offer a rare treat to veteran patients who have family living some distance away. Veterans are encouraged to invite family members for a day of fun, entertainment, and good food. The volunteers sponsor the activity and provide the serving of refresh- ments. At the nursing home in St. Albans (a division of VAXC Brooklyn) elderly veterans have the opportunity to invite up to six family members to a special birthday dinner. A separate formal dining room, china and silver are provided by the volunteer organizations who also fund the guests' dinners. Sepulveda VANC, among those health care facilities with a GRECC, remains in the forefront of innovative programs for the elderly veterans. The VIP volunteer program began using older active volunteers on a one-to-one basis with elderly veteran patients. The success of this program has been outstanding and they have since used youth volunteers and family group volunteering with these patients. These types of activities assist hospitalized veterans in maximizing the benefits of VA care, and in eliminating social isolation. V. OFFICE OF DESTISTSRY Dentistry is an integral part of any comprehensive health care program for the elderly. Freedom from tooth-related pain is a primary objective, of course, but there are a number of other major concerns. The incidence of many oral diseases that do not initially cause pain. from periodontitis to cancer, increases significantly with advancing years. Additionally, many older people lose a sufficient number of teeth to interfere with effective mastication, so that nutritional deficiencies and gastrointestinal problems are a common result. Perhaps as important, the ability to enjoy a varied, interesting diet is compromised -- a factor in quality of life. Similarly, the integrity of the dental complex plays a major role in facial appearance and in oral communication, which are so important to self-image and societal function. VA is pledged to \"provide elderly veterans with a range of medical and health services that are designed to restore and/or maintain optimal levels of664 health, foster independent living, and improve overall quality of life.\" With this in mind, the VA Office of Dentistry is involved in a number of initia- tives to cope with the dental health needs of the burgeoning numbers of older veterans. The VA Dentist Geriatric Fellowship Program is now in its eighth year of operation and expanding last year from five training sites to six. The first five dentists who entered this program completed their two-year program in June of 1984. The Office of Dentistry implemented a plan whereby interested VA health care facilities submitted proposals that outline their intended use of such an uniquely trained individual. Facilities with approved programs that successfelly recruited a graduate received- TE and funding for their placement. This mechanism has allowed us to retain the majority of the graduates for service with VA. Twenty-two of them-are currently employed at VA medical centers across the country. In addition, judging by publications. honors, and off ices held. they have taken their places among- the leaders in -.- dental geriatrics both nationally and internationally. At :their individual -their -reoseiblities vary, but mcat these dental riatr. cians have also developed clinical programs at VA facilities within their medical districts: as' well as establishing linkages with community and university endeavors. The, special efforts to employ these individuals allows continuing evaluation of the training programs in geriatric dentistry and an. -opportunity to measure the contributions of graduates against the 'time and -~ ' funding dedicated to the Fellowship Program itself. Although. there is considerable interest.directed at the Geriatric Fellowship .Programs and at the facilities that now, employ dentists who are. especially trained in geriatrics, other VA dental facilities are net without their concerns and programs for the aging veteran. VA dental personnel at all -levels are aware of the rapid aging of the veteran population. Elderly patients are-treated on a daily basis and most facilities now have at least one dentist who has attended a continuing education course in geriatric dentistry or a course in hospital dentistry that emphasised special care for the elderly. Facilities with special expertise in geriatric dentistry are now being encouraged to add a second year to their General Practice Residency (GPR) programs to concentrate on gerontology and clinical care of the older adult. An -area of.particular concern to VA dentistry is the oral health needs of -veteran patients in VA extended care facilities. Often frail and functionally 'impaired, many of these patients have extensive oral health needs and present665 a significant challenge for the dental staff. The Program Guide: OralHealth Guidelines for Lone Term Care Patients, developed several years ago by VA Office of Dentistry, continues to serve as the primary handbook for management of the multidisciplinary efforts required to meet their needs. The VA's impact on geriatric dentistry is not limited to its own health care system, but entends to the national scene as well. The ACMD for Dentistry regularly participates in the RIDS (National Institute for Dental Research) group that is involved in reviewing oral health promotion and disease prevention initiatives throughout the country. VA also has been represented on a Surgeon General's Workshop relating to the same topic. In education, the American Association of Dental Schools (AADS) has an ongoing Geriatric Education Project. Its goal is to enhance the quality of dental services that are available to older people in the U.S. by improving the teaching of geriatric dentistry in dental and dental hygiene schools. VA dentists participate, playing a major role, in the working committees formed to design curriculum and identify resource material for faculty utilization. In research, the VA has been involved in a collaborative project since 1984 with the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institute of Dental Research (RIDS). The project emerged from discussions among the Directors of the NIA and NIDN, Dr. Franklin Williams and Dr. Harold Loe. respectively. and the then Assistant Chief Medical Director for Dentistry. Dr. Robert R. Rhyne. They agreed to pursue a project that would produce three products: a research agenda for oral health and related problems in the elderly, a catalog of relevant resources and activities. and an implementation plan that would recommnod cooperative efforts between the three agencies in response to high priority research questions. A core staff and a Project Advisory Panel that represented the three organizations \"ere appointed, and the project has since begun its implementation phase. An initial venture resulted in the funding of a research center on oral health and aging as a cooperative effort of the VA Medical Center in Gainesville. Florida and the University of Florida College of Dentistry. Currently, a collaboration of the same federal agencies is involved in the design of a five-year fellowship to develop advanced research and clinical skills in oral health for the elderly. The Office of Dentistry staff and consultants have completed the analysis phase of a project that surveyed oral health needs of patients in VA nursing hoes. The results will be used to enhance oral health progres as well as to project present and future needs for sanpower and other resources. Similarly. two former Geriatric Fellows, nos on VA staff, are currently studying the oral health needs of Hospital-Based Rome Care (ORmC) patients.666 VI. OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Health Services Research and Development The Health Services Research and Development (HSRSD) Service supported many HSRSD activities that were related to aging: to clarify options, estimate costs (organizational. human, economic) and to provide information to make rational choices among alternative health care interventions. Each of the Service's three major program areas emphasized HSR&D in aging. The HSEtD Field Program, which implements the Service's mission nationwide and fosters integration of research with practice, continued to conduct many projects related to aging. Those. supported in 1989 addressed such- areas as: evaluation of several elderly care approaches (e.g.. domiciliary, hospital-based home care. nursing homes, geriatric units); the use and impact of social support and helping networks for ill elderly veterans, exploring cost-effectiveness and clinical utility of alternative approaches for caring for dementia patients: alcoholism among the elderly; oral health among older veterans; and homeless veterans in domiciliary care. The Northwest Regional HSR&D Field Program System Wide Resource on Aging continued to provide leadership and technical assistance in this area. Most notably, this program continued collaboration with the VA's Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care to conduct the Congressionally mandated evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of adult day health care (ADHC).. The first phase of this study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate ADHC provided by VA with its own staff. Enrollment for this phase was completed in January 1989. The second phase is a non-randomized evaluation to study ADHC provided by community programs under contract to VA. Patient enrollment in these sites began in September. 1989. Products from the pilot work for this study already are being disseminated, these include method- ological advances in measuring medical efficacy. utilization, and cost. 'Field program editors and authors also published this year a major book. Health Care of the Elderly: An Information Sourcebook.. VA distributed the book to all VA medical centers: it also is available from the publisher. Approximately 34 percent of the Service's ninety 1989 irnvestigator-initiated research projects addressed issues of particular importance to our aging veterans. These projects originated from twenty-two (22) different VA field locations. Research topics includes the effectiveness and efficiency of a caregiver support program; cost-effective post-discharge care for elderly veterans: the use of community volunteers in the rehabilitation of older667 veterans; cost-effectiveness of hospital-based home care; an information synthesis of interventions to improve nursing home care; evaluation of a hospice approach to measurement of Alzheimer patients; periodontitis in aging veterans, and nutrition in health for elderly veterans. XIII. OFFICE OF ACADEMIC AFFAIRS All short and long range plans of VESBRA that addressed health care needs of the Nations growing population of elderly veterans include training activities supported by the Office of Academic Affairs (OAA). bhe training of health care professionals in the area of geriatrice/gerontology is an important component in a variety of programs conducted at VA medical centers in collaboration with affiliated academic institutions. Work with geriatric patients is an integral part of the clinical experience of the nearly 100.000 health trainees including 30,000 resident physicians and 44,000 nursing and associated health students who train in VA medical centers each year as part of an affiliation agreement between the VA and nearly 1,000 health professional schools, colleges and university health science centers. Recognizing the challenges presented by the ever increasing sine of the aging veteran population, the OAA has made great strides in promoting and coordinating interdisciplinary geriatric and gerontological programs in VA medical centers and in their affiliated academic institutions. The Office of Academic Affairs, in the VBSIRA, supports geriatric education and training activities in the following special programs: VA Fellowshig Pronrams in Geriatrics for Physicians. The issue of whether or not geriatrics should be a separate medical specialty or a subspecialty was resolved in September 1987 when the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGMZ) approved Geriatric Medicine as an area of special compe- tence. Effective January 1988. the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Family Practice specified procedures for the certifi- cation of added qualifications in geriatric medicine. VA played a critical role in the development and recognition of geriatric medicine in the United States, and as of AY 1989-90, any VA medical center may conduct fellowship training in geriatrics, providing an ACGME accredited program is in place. The demand for physicians with special training in geriatrics and gerontology continues unabated because of the rapidly advancing numbers of elderly668 veterans and aging Americans. The VA health care system offers clinical. rehabilitation, and follow-up patient care services, as well as education. research, and interdisciplinary programs that constitute the-support elements that are required for the training of physicians in geriatrics. Since 1978-79 this special training has been accomplished through the VA Fellowship Program in Geriatrics conducted at VA medical centers affiliated with medical schools. The 12 initial training sites increased to 20 in 1986 and to 24 in 1989. These fellowships are designed to develop a cadre of physicians who are committed to clinical excellence and to becoming leaders of local and national geriatric medical programs. Their dedication to innovative and thorough geriatric patient care is expected to produce role models for medical students and for residents. The tw-year fellowship curriculum incorporates clinical. pharmacological. psychosocial, education, and research components that are related to the full continuum of treatment and health care of the elderly. A third year for research is available on a competitive baiis. During it's 11-year history, the program has attracted physicians with high quality academic and professional backgrounds in internal medicine. psychiatry. neurology and family practice. Their genuine interest in the nil-being of elderly veterans is apparent from high VA retention rate after completing the fellowship training. Many of the Fellows have published articles on geriatric topics in nationally recognised professional journals, -and several Fellows have authored or edited hooks on geriatric medidine and _medical ethics. The number of recipients of important awards and research grants (AGS/Pfiser. Kaiser. NIA and VA) increases each year. As of June 89: 206 Fellows had completed the program in ten successive groups: 1980 -8: 1981 -12: 1982 -196 1983 -19: 1985 -22: 1986 -27, 1987 -23, 1988 -28, and 1989 -27. About 45 percent remain in the VA system as full or part-time employees. Close to 50 percent of all graduates hold academic appointments. The VA group of 206 fellowship alumni/ae represents the largest single agency contribution to the pool of trained geriatricians in the United States. VA Dentist Geriatric Fellowshin Proram. In July 1982. tn-year Dentist Geriatric Fellowship Programs (see also p. 44) commenced at five medical centers that are affiliated with schools of Dentistry. The goals of this program are similar to those described for the Physician Fellowship Program in Geriatrics. As of June 1989. 30 Dentist Fellows had completed their special669 training. In 1988. the number of training sites increased to six. and beginning in 1990, six dentist fellows per year are expected to graduate. Nearly 90 percent of the program alumni/ae have accepted offers of post fellowship employment in the VA system. Most serve in academically oriented positions mainly in VA district offices. Through their teaching and research activities, they reach large numbers of residents and students and thus influence geriatric dental health care far beyond the confines of the VA health care system. Interdisciplinary Team Training in Geriatrics. Interdisciplinary Team Training in Geriatrics (ITTG) is a systematic educational program that is designed to include didactic and clinical instruction for VA faculty practitioners and affiliated students from three or more health professions such as physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, pharmacists and occupational and physical therapists. The ITTG provides a structured approach to the delivery of health services by emphasising the knowledge and skills needed to work in an interactive group. In addition, the program promotes an understanding of the roles and functions of other members of the team and how their collaborative contributions influence both the delivery and outcome of patient care. The ITTG Program has been activated at 12 VA medical centers. To sites, located at VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) Portland, Oregon. and Sepulveda. California were designated in 1979. Three additional VA sites at Little Rock, Arkansas: Palo Alto, California: and Salt Lake City. Utah, wore selected in 1980; and VAMCs Buffalo. New York; Madison, Wisconsin; Coatesville, Pennsylvania, and Birmingham. Alabama, wore approved in 1982. In the Spring of 1983, three sites were selected at VAMCs Tucson, Arisona) Memphis. Tennessee; and Tampa, Florida. The purposes of the ITTG program are to develop a cadre of health practitioners with the knowledge and competencies that are required to provide interdisciplinary team care to meet the wide spectrum of health care and service needs of the aged veteran; to provide leadership in interdisciplinary team delivery and training to other VA medical centers; and to provide role models for affiliated students in medical and associated health disciplines. Training includes the teaching of staff and students about the nging process; instruction in team teaching and group process skills for clinical core staff; and clinical experiences in team care for affiliated education students with the core team serving ae role models. During FY 1989, 193 students from a variety of health care disciplines wore provided funding support at the 12 model InTT sites.670 Clinical Nurse Specialist. Clinical nurse training is another facet of VA educationsprograsning in geriatrics. The need for specially trained graduate level clinical nurse specialists is evidenced by the sophisticated level of care needed by the VA-aftient population, specifically in the area of geriatrics. Advanced-nurse training is a high priority within the VA because of the shortage of such nursing specialists who are capable of assuming positions in specialised care and leadership. The Clinical Nurse Specialist Program was established in 1981 to attract clinical specialist students to the VA and to help meat requirement needs in the VA priority areas of geriatrics, rehabilitation, and psychiatric/mental health, all of which impact on the care of the elderly veteran. During FY 1988-89 the critical care pathway was added to the program. Direct funding support is provided to master's level nurse specialist students for their clinical practicue at the VA medical centers that are affiliated with the academic institutions in which they are enrolled. In Fiscal Year 1989, 109 master's level clinical nurse specialist student positions were supported at 35 VA medical centersa 31 in geriatrics; 2 in rehabilitation; and 37 in psychiatric =antallhealth, and 39 in critical care. VA Gerontolngical Nurse Fallowahin Progra. Gerontological nursing has been a nursing specialty since the mid-1960s. As society changes, particularly in terms of the demographic trend in aging, more attention is being focused on both the area of gerontological nursing and the education of nurses in this specialty. Doctoral level nurse gerontologists are prepared for advanced clinical practice, teaching, research, administration, and policy formulation in adult development and aging. Effective FT 1989-90, a two-year nurse fellowship program became operational for registered nurses who are doctoral candidates enrolled in doctoral level programs. and whose doctoral dissertations have clinical research foci in geriatrics/gerontology. It is planned to select and fund two nurse fellows each fiscal year at approved VA medical center sites. Initial appointments will he for one-year. Reappointments of one additional year are subject to satisfactory first year's performance evaluations. It is anticipated that at least half of the participants who complete this VA fellowship will be recruited within the VA system. Sawansion for Associated Health In Geriatrics. A special priority for geriatric education and training is recognised in the allocation of associated671 health training positions end funding support to VA medical centers hosting GRECC9, and to VA Medical Centers (non- ITTG/GnECC sites) that offer specific educational and clinical programs for the care of older veterans. In FY 1989, a total of 150 associated health students received funding support at 67 VA facilities in the following disciplines: Social Work; Psychology, Optometry; Audiology/Speech Pathology; Specialist; Occupational Therapy; and Podiatry. Senansion for Medical and Dental Residents in Geriatrics. In order to expand the involvement of medical and dental residents in the care of older veterans. a special program for geriatric education and training was initiated in FT 1983. This program provides residency positions mnd funds to VA medical centers that host GRECCs and to VA medical centers offering specific clinical programs med training experiences for the care of geriatric patients. In FT 1988, 120 medical and dental positions were approved at about 60 VA facilities for the training of residents in the assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of the older veteran. Continuing Education. In support of the VA's mission to provide health care to the aging veteran population, education end training continues to be offered to enhance VA medical center staff skills in the area of geriatrics. These educational activities are designed to respond to the needs of VA health care personnel throughout the entire Veterans Health Services end Research Administration. Annually, Postgraduate and In-Service Training (PIT) funds are distributed to two levels of the organization for support of continuing education activities in priority areas. First. Program 870 (Core PIT) funds are provided to each of the VA medical centers to meet the continuing education needs of its employees. Approxi- mately $152.000 of facility-oriented monies supported training activities in during FT 1989. VACO also allocates funds for VAMC-initiated programs to allow health care facilities, with assistance from a Regional Medical Education Center (RMEC), to conduct education program within the hospital to meet locally identified training needs. Approximately $15.000 of VAMC-initiated funds were used to support 18 separate activities. Second. Continuing Education Field Units (CEFUs), which include seven Regional Medical Education Centers (RSECs). eight Cooperative Health Education programs (CREPe), two Dental Education Centers (DECs), and two Continuing Education Centers (CECs) meet education needs by conducting programs at the regional and local medical center level. Examples of recent programs ares672 o Practical Management of Common Geriatric Problems o Developing-Sensitivity to the Older Patient o Nutritional Reeds of the Elderly o Health Care Issues in the Aging Population o Depression in the Elderly: Is It Different? o Caring for Our Elders:'Mental Health Assessment' o Dental Care and the Elderly o Suicide/Crisis Intervention in the Elderly o Clinical Pharmacology in Dental Practice RMEC programs are also conducted in cooperation with the GRECCs, which received g158,000 in PIT funds to support their identified needs. This collaborative effort ensures the efficient use of esisting resources to meet the increasing demands for training in geriatrics/gerontology. For example, the GRECCs have met some of the training needs identified by RMECs and. RMECs have utilized GRECC staff as faculty for their programs. During FT 1989. the. Continming Education Field' Units conducted 204 education.- activities in the area of geriatrics whieh were attendedhby approximately -6492 VA participants and 2.208 non-VA participants'. IF, FT 1988, the issue of \"Health Care Problems of the Elderly\" was identified as a systeaiide training. need- in-the VA. In response. to; this need, a National Training Program was developed and 'implemented in fiscal year 1989. \"Health Care Problems of the Elderly\" is a multi-year program providing training throughout the VA system. Another multi-year National Training, Program. \"Alternatives to Acute Institutional Care\". Ues initiated in Region III for VANC health care teams. This program will'continue and expand to other VAMCs during 1990. In addition, CORE PIT funds are provided to support continuing education experiences for the Geriatric Fellows and Interdisciplinary Team Training in Geriatrics staff members. Health Professional Scholarship Program The Scholarship Program was established in 1980 and funded from 1982 through 1985 to assist in providing an adequate supply of nurses for the VA and the nation. In 1988 the Scholarship Program was reactivated to provide scholarships to students in full-time nursing and physical therapy baccalaureate and master degree programs in certain specialties specified by the VA. Since the beginning of the program. 38 'awards have been given to students studying for advanced673 master's degrees in gerontological nursing. Of this number, 20 students have completed degrees and fulfilled their two-year service obligations by working as professionals in VA medical centers. Fifteen of these professional nurses are still employed by VA. The remaining students are in the process of completing their degrees, and will be beginning their service obligations in the near future. Learning Resources. The widespread education and training activities in geriatrics have generated a broad spectrum of requirements for learning resources throughout the VA system. Local Library Services performed hundreds of on-line searches on data bases such as AGSLINZ (available through Bibliographic Retrieval Services). and continue to add books, journals. and audiovisuals (AVs) on topics related to geriatrics and aging. Multiple copies of two AV programs \"ere made available nationwide for VA staff uae through the VA Software Delivery System. The VACO Library continues to expend its collection of books, AVs. and journals concerning aging and geriatrics. VIII. DEPARTHMEE OF VETERANS BENEFITS Compensation and Pension Programs Disability and survivor benefits such as pension. compensation. and dependency end indemnity compensation administered by the Department of Veterans Benefits provide all, or part, of the income for 1.836,817 persons age 65 or older. This total includes 1,278,119 veterens. 522,613 surviving spouses, 31,079 mothers, and 5,006 fathers. The Veterans' and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978, effective January 1, 1979. provided for a restructured pension program. Under this program, eligible veterans receive a level of support meeting a national standard of need, Pensioners generally receive benefits equal to the difference between their annual income from other sources and the appropriate income standard. This Act provides for a higher income standard for veterans of World Mar I or the Mexican border period. This provision was in acknowledgement of the special needs of our older veterans. Effective December 1, 1988, an additional 81.461 is added to the basic pension rate. Effective December 1, 1989, the additional allowance will be $1,530. Pensioners receiving bene- fits under the prior program were provided the opportunity to elect to receive benefits under the new program.674 Veterans Assistance Service Veterans Services Division personnel maintain liaison with nursing homes. senior citizen homes, and senior citizen centers in regional office areas. Locations are visited as the need arises. Appropriate pamphlets and application forms are provided to personnel at these homes during visits and frequent use of regular mailings. State and Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) have been identified and are provided information on VA benefits and services through workshops and training sessions. Seminars are conducted for nursing home operators and other service providers that assist and serve this patient population. Regional Office coordinators continue to serve on local and state task forces that deal extensively with the problems of the elderly. The Veterans Assistance Services eshibit, \"Veterans Benefits for Older Americans,\" highlights, by pictures and accompanying test, the various benefits esplained in the pamphlet of the same title (VA Pamphlet 27-80-2). The e hibit, designed to convey the VA' s concern with the aging veteran populations. has been displayed estensively at meetings addressing problems of aging. The pamphlet was given wide distribution at the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities and the National Council on Aging conferences, and by information and referral representatives at field stations. The elderly as a group encounter problems with transportation due to rising costs, limited income, and most importantly, physical ailments. Thus, Veterans Assistance Service continues to emphasize the use of the toll-free telephone service as a means of contacting their offices for information and assistance. A special listing of aged beneficiaries has been fornished to regional office Veterans Services Divisions (VSD's) for individualized outreach use. Veterans and/or dependents are being contacted and provided with information and claims assistance on any additional VA benefits that may be applicable to them. One of the reasons for this outreach prograe.is our concern that large numbers of our older population are \"at riska and, as such, they may be unaware of the higher income limitations available under the pension program, i.e.. housebound status and aid and attendance. Moreover, we are convinced that many are unaware of the impact of unreimbursed medical expenses on pension eligibility.675 In January of 1989, Veterans Assistance Service obtained a national listing of long-term care facilities and updated rosters of State Area Agencies on Aginy (AAks) and Stats Long Tern Care Ombudxmne. These rosters wre formarded to regional office Veterens Services Division .ith a request that a letter be sent to all the nursing hone directors soliciting their support in identifying possible VA beneficiaries in their nursing bore facilities. The State Area Agencies on Aging and Long Term Care Ombudaen ere asked to assist in this identification program. Activity in this program is reported to Veterans Assistance Service on the quarterly narrative report. An outreach program of service to homeless veterans, to include those rho are elderly and ill, has been initiated by Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) in cooperation with Veterans Health Services and Research Administra- tion. Social Work Service, and Vet Center Team Leaders. 26-386 (684) "}
