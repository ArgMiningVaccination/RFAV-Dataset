These are the guid- ing principles of Dutch international co-operation in the field of health, nutrition andpopulation. Over the last two decades, Dutch support in this field has increased, totalling\u20ac 650 million over the period 1995-1999. The Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB) has carried out an independent evaluation of Dutch health, nutrition and population support in Burkina Faso,Mozambique and Y emen over the period 1995-1999. These countries were selected because of their long standing co-operation with the Netherlands in the health sector,involving a substantial Dutch financial contribution to a variety of programmes. Themajor objective of the evaluation was to determine how far health programmes have con-tributed, directly or indirectly, to the reduction of morbidity and mortality, especiallyamong the poor. Therefore, a methodology was developed that emphasises access to andthe quality and use of health services, assuming that good health care contributes to bet-ter health behaviour and to better health. These issues were addressed in a field study inthe three countries, including both the health services and the household level. The evaluation results show a mixed picture. In all cases, positive effects have been achieved in the field of infrastructure and training. The quality of care improved in somesettings, but in others much remains to be done. Among the negative findings are theneglect of the community level and the lack of affordable essential drugs in remote areas.We hope that the evaluation results will provide a basis for discussions on future health sector support. The evaluation was carried out by inspector Marijke Stegeman, in close collaboration with Anita Hardon and Trudie Gerrits from the medical anthropological unit of the University of Amsterdam. The country studies were carried out mainly by teams of locally basedexperts. IOB is grateful to all who contributed by sharing their knowledge, experience andcomments.

Main findings and issues for the future 1.1 Introduction Health is both a fundamental human right and a vital condition for development. These are the basic principles of Dutch international policy in the field of health, nutritionand population. The major variances in morbidity and mortality, between poor and richcountries and between the poor and the rich in the individual countries themselves,clearly show the linkage between poverty and health. A sufficient and balanced diet, safedrinking water, adequate sanitary facilities and education are all preconditions for goodhealth. Action is required in a variety of fields if death and disease are to be reduced.Good quality health care delivery plays a modest but essential role in the improvement of health status, and thus contributes to poverty reduction. The overall goal of the evaluation was to determine to what extent activities in the field of health, nutrition and population have contributed, directly or indirectly, to combatingdisease and death, especially among the poor. Morbidity and mortality are determined by a complex array of factors which make the impact of health programmes on health status hard to measure. In this evaluation, threeassumptions are made. Firstly, that health programmes lead to an improvement in thestructure and performance of the health system, including health promotion, diseaseprevention and curative care. Secondly, that these improvements lead to better healthbehaviour. Thirdly, that better health behaviour contributes to better health status. Assessing these factors required the implementation of a field study and the collection of data from both health services and individual households. The focus of the evaluation was at country level. For logistical reasons, the number of countries was limited to three and the evaluation period to the years 1995-1999. The crite-ria for country selection were the volume and the duration of Dutch support, as well asthe variation in the health programmes. Mozambique, Yemen and Burkina Faso were thecountries selected and they all fall into the low-income category. The whole range ofprogrammes and projects supported by the Netherlands in each country was evaluated, 1health, nutrition and population | Main findings and issues for the futureprovided that the budget exceeded 50.000 Euros and the duration was at least two years. The main findings, except for the first one, relate solely to the health programmes inthese countries. The evaluation started in March 2000 with a preparatory document study, followed by three country studies over the period October 2000-June 2001. In each country, the evalu-ation was carried out in two phases. During the first phase, all programmes and projectsincluded in the evaluation were analysed in terms of relevance, effectiveness, efficiencyand sustainability. This was done on the basis of document review, key person interview-ing and site visits. During the second phase, a field study was then carried out in a chosendistrict. There, for a limited number of programmes, the impact of programmes wasassessed in terms of the improvement in the structure and performance of the healthsystem, as well as the improvement in health behaviour. Health, nutrition and population are important components of Dutch development co- operation. During the 1980's and 1990's, Dutch policy followed international develop-ments. It included support for primary health care, disease control, essential drugs,HIV/AIDS prevention and control, reproductive health, nutrition and health system sup- port. The total volume of Dutch aid to these policy areas during the period 1995-1999 wasabout 650 million Euros. The country allocations for social development accounted forover half of total expenditure. Contributions to multilateral organisations totalled about40 percent. Altogether, the health programmes in Mozambique, Yemen and Burkina Fasoaccounted for about 15 percent of the overall country allocations for health, nutrition andpopulation, with Mozambique and Y emen among the highest receivers. Taken together, the primary health care programmes evaluated account for 36 percent of the total bilateral budget for primary health care in the years 1995-1999; the onesincluded in the field study account for 16 percent of that budget. The essential drugsprogrammes evaluated in the country studies together account for 43 percent of the total country programme budget for essential drugs during the same period. Otherprogrammes, such as disease control, HIV/AIDS prevention or reproductive health,accounted for only a small percentage of the total health expenditure in the policy areasconcerned. The relationship between health care, health behaviour and health status is complex and data on health status in the field study areas was not available. Furthermore, the evalua-health, nutrition and population | Main findings and issues for the future 2tion results of the different programmes varied substantially and it was not always possi- ble to directly attribute the results to Dutch support. These factors ultimately limited thepossibility of determining the programmes' contribution to combating death and diseaseamong the poor. Where appropriate, the findings are related to the health status of thepoor and to poverty reduction. 1.2 Main findings 1. Since the early1980's, Dutch international policy in the field of health, nutrition and population has followed international developments. Dutch policy gradually shifted from support for comprehensive primary health pro- grammes to support for health organisation and health sector reform. The sector-wideapproach became the guiding principle. In addition a number of priorities were defined,such as nutrition, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS prevention and control. No guide-lines were given on how these Dutch priorities could or should guide the Dutch participa-tion in sector wide approaches. 2. The programmes and projects are generally in line both with health policy in the countries and with Dutch policy. They are not, however, based on an in-depth needs analysis nor on a specific co-operation policy between the Netherlands and the country concerned. Almost all programmes and projects in Mozambique, Yemen and Burkina Faso are in direct response to important public health problems. Millennium development goals alsoinclude the reduction of several of these problems. These findings are hardly surprising,as needs are numerous and policies broadly defined. Moreover, the choice of specificareas of health support has predominantly been based on international policy develop-ments in the field of health, nutrition and population, and not on a needs analysis nor ona specific co-operation policy between the Netherlands and the country concerned. 3. In primary health programmes, the shift towards institutional support has led to insufficient support for community health. During the 1980's, both international and Dutch policy focussed on primary health care support, emphasising health promotion and community health. The institutional levelwas neglected. In the 1990's policy changed and gradually more attention was given tothe quality of care at services level and to health system organisation and health finance. 3health, nutrition and population | Main findings and issues for the futureThis development led in turn to the community level being neglected, both in national health policies in the recipient countries and with regards to international and Dutchpolicy. With the move to an approach of sector-wide support, even more emphasis isgiven to the institutional aspects of the health system. Both in Burkina Faso and inMozambique, the field study revealed that community health workers and communitymidwives lack the means to provide adequate services. In both field studies, the popula-tion generally expressed its appreciation for the community health workers, but citedtheir lack of capacity to provide curative care. As health services are located far away andmeans of transport are virtually non-existent, this is a serious problem. In Yemen, the field study was carried out in a city. There, home-based community health is still anintegral part of the health system, though to a lesser extent than when the programmewas being funded by Dutch aid. The insufficient attention paid to community healthlimits the health programmes' contribution to poverty alleviation. 4. The structure of the health system in all three countries has been improved by Dutch support for the construction and rehabilitation of infrastructure and for human resources training. The number of services per head of population increased and thus, too, the accessibility of those services. The services are also better equipped, though in some programmesmaintenance proved to be insufficient. In almost all primary health programmes, trainingwas an important component and a substantial number of health professionals and com-munity health workers have been trained. 5. In most primary health programmes, the institutional strengthening of the public system was included in the objectives, but only two programmes attained this objective. In six of the seven primary health programmes, institutional strengthening was an im- portant objective, either at the outset or subsequent to a mid-term evaluation. In threeprogrammes, serious efforts have been made to realise this objective. The primary healthcare programme in Kaya in Burkina Faso succeeded in improving the organisation andplanning of health services. The Hodeidah urban programme in Yemen also did, but theefforts proved unsustainable. The support for the provincial health office in Nampula,Mozambique, was only successful in some respects, such as the realisation of partici-patory planning. The other three primary health programmes achieved negligiblestrengthening of the public system. health, nutrition and population | Main findings and issues for the future 46. The quality and the utilisation of the health services varied substantially among the settings in the three countries. In Burkina Faso, the field study revealed that Dutch support has led to better preventive and curative services in the health centres. However , the utilisation of the services is far lower than expected given the population size in the target area of the health facilities.This can partially be explained by the fact that large numbers of the target population livein remote areas. In Yemen, the Hodeidah field study revealed that Dutch support led tobetter preventive services, which are much utilised by the population. The programme ledto the introduction of the 'mursh idat', a new type of female health worker, who quickly became key players in health promotion and preventive service delivery. Curative serviceshave also improved in Hodeidah, but are not much used by the general public. In cases ofillness and disease, people give preference to the readily-available private services. InMozambique it was found that the quality of most services was sub-standard. However,service utilisation by the population is high, which indicates that, unlike in Hodeidah, noother services are available. The two programmes that were successful in improving thequality of care were the same as those that were effective in terms of institutionalstrengthening. 7. The fairness of the health systems is a matter of concern. No proper exemption rules are being applied for poor people who cannot afford to pay fees for services and drugs, leading to inequity in access to health. In all three countries included in the evaluation, a 'fee for services' system is being applied. In Burkina Faso, no exemption rules have been established for those who cannotafford to pay for services or drugs. In both Yemen and Mozambique an exemption policyhas been established, though, in Yemen, it is only partially being implemented. InMozambique the fees for services and drugs are very low but the lack of drugs in healthcentre pharmacies forces people to buy them at high market prices. No mechanisms existto assist those who cannot afford these prices. In all three settings, poor people do nothave access to insurance systems. These findings reveal inequities in access to healthcare, which decrease the potential to combat disease and death among the poor and limitthe programmes' contribution to poverty alleviation. 5health, nutrition and population | Main findings and issues for the future8. Essential drugs programmes were effective in the procurement of drugs and in the amendment of drug legislation, but often failed to guarantee the availability of drugs in peripheral healthservices. In Mozambique and Yemen, the procurement and purchase of drugs with Dutch support were met with success, though some delay. In Burkina Faso, other donors financed theprocurement and purchase. In all three countries, amendments to drug legislation wereincluded in the programmes and successfully implemented. The field studies revealed thatin two of the three settings, the programmes failed to guarantee the availability of essen-tial drugs in peripheral health services. As drugs are still scarce and relatively expensive,the risk of corruption and other illegal practices is high. In Mozambique, the field studyrevealed that pharmacies were almost empty. In Yemen, the situation was somewhat bet-ter but still far from acceptable in some centres. Here, doctors appeared both reluctant toprescribe essential drugs and under some pressure from the pharmaceutical industry toprescribe brand products. In Burkina Faso, the drugs were available in the services buthigh prices hampered their utilisation. In all three countries, few efforts have been made to guarantee proper prescription and rational drug use. This seriously limits thelikelihood of essential drugs programmes having a positive effect on health outcomes. 9. The integration of nutrition in health programmes is inadequate. Malnutrition is a serious problem in the three countries included in the evaluation. In spite of this, prevention of malnutrition and treatment of malnourished children isinsufficiently addressed in the basic health services. The field studies revealed that,despite the routine weighing of all children by the health services, mothers are generallynot adequately informed about the nutritional status of their children. No proper nutri-tional education is given and malnourished children do not receive special attention.Dutch policy has formulated clear guidelines for confronting the problem of malnutritionin the context of basic health services. These have not been translated into practice in thethree programmes included in the field study. 10. In the countries studied, a reproductive health policy has been formulated but is only partially being implemented. The field studies revealed that reproductive health had not been fully integrated into the health services. On the positive side, contraceptives are available in health services. health, nutrition and population | Main findings and issues for the future 6On the negative side, an unmet need was detected and reproductive rights were not always respected. Reports from both Yemen and Burkina Faso indicated that contra-ceptives are not provided to women without their husband's consent. Projects inMozambique and Yemen, which focussed specifically on reproductive health and were supported by the Netherlands, did not form part of a comprehensive national reproduc-tive health policy. Evaluation results varied. The census project in Mozambique attainedits objective fully and the midwife training project in Yemen did so partially. In BurkinaFaso, a more comprehensive reproductive health programme was financed but was notsuccessful. In this instance, the lack of a properly defined national reproductive healthpolicy hampered full implementation. 11. Disease control programmes that aim at the detection of patients in health centres are not effective in a setting where the health system is under-utilised. The national tuberculosis control programme in Burkina Faso follows international guidelines. T uberculosis patients are not actively approached but are detected when they visit a health centre (passive case finding). However, despite the clear contribution Dutchsupport made to the improvement of infrastructure, equipment and supplies, the numberof cases detected and then treated properly barely increased. The leprosy control pro-gramme in Mozambique was effective in case detection and proper treatment. Here, thelevel of integration of Dutch support in the national health system can be questioned, asaid only covers the leprosy components of the national Tuberculosis and Leprosy controlprogramme. 1.3 Issues for the future Since 1999 the push towards the sector-wide approach has been intensified. In this frame-work, it is a challenge to include the major evaluation findings in discussions on healthpolicy and on poverty reduction strategy papers in countries. This is especially the case forthose findings that relate to the policy shift. 1. Confronting the neglect of community health : in the 1980's all efforts were directed at pri- mary health care at community level. Isolated primary health care projects proved tobe ineffective and unsustainable if not bolstered by a well functioning health system.As a result, policy shifted to supporting the health system at district or national level,ideally by means of direct budgetary support. Nowadays, all efforts are directed atinstitutional support with the community level receiving much less attention, both in 7health, nutrition and population | Main findings and issues for the futurenational health policies and in donor policy. However, since people living in remote areas do not have access to health services, the challenge remains to retain thoseelements of the primary health approach which function well, including communityhealth, and to integrate these within the health system. 2 Confronting regressive financing systems : the field studies documented that in the three settings patients have to pay user fees for services and/or for the drugs. User fees wereintroduced in many developing countries in the 1980's as a way to mobilise addition-al resources at the local level of health care and in response to inefficiencies in healthcare systems. Those systems provided free health care within a publicly financedhealth care system. Exemption policies were seen to resolve the equity concernsraised by the change in health care financing systems. The field-studies pointed to ageneral lack of existence and/or implementation of such exemption policies. Findings from health financing systems have shown that user-fee systems tend to beregressive and often impede access to health care. 1Prepayment through insurance systems can be used to pool and share risks across the population and thus lead togreater fairness. It is a challenge to develop insurance schemes which broaden parti-cipation to allow inclusion of the poor, who generally do not have regular jobs andincome. 2 3 Confronting the unavailability of drugs and irrational drug use in the periphery : the availability of affordable essential drugs at service level is an absolute condition for a health system that functions well. Drug unavailability is caused by an array of factors, including an absolute shortage, inadequate distribution, leakage andcorruption. Corruption is closely related to the other three factors. Irrational drug use also has multiple causes, such as inadequate prescription, the pressure of private drug companies, and lack of information on drugs. It is a challenge toestablish a proper balance between the various elements of a national drug program-me. This implies: a sufficient supply; appropriate legislation and regulation relatingto quality control; enforcement of the foregoing; and the use of generic drugs. It alsoimplies a good monitoring system to control distribution to the periphery and effortsto enhance rational drug use. These efforts must include the provision of adequateinformation to both drug prescribers and to the general public. Only then willhealth, nutrition and population | Main findings and issues for the future 81 World Health Organisation 2000. 2 Kutzin 1996.successes in the field of procurement and legislation have a positive impact on health status. 4 Considering nutrition and reproductive health : nutrition and reproductive health are impor- tant health policy areas which need to be addressed from both inside and outside thehealth system. It is a challenge to enhance the prevention and treatment of malnou-rished children in the public system by transforming the routine weighing of under-fives into a consultation process in which: children are weighed; mothers are infor-med about their children's nutritional status and advised appropriately; and where, if necessary, malnourished children are treated. With regards to reproductive health,progress has been made in the fields of mother and child care and the availability ofcontraceptives. Here too, the challenge exists to address issues such as sexual health,adolescent health and reproductive rights e.g., the freedom to decide on the use ofcontraceptives. It is also a challenge to include nutrition and reproductive health inother non-health sectors. 9health, nutrition and population | Main findings and issues for the futurehealth, nutrition and population 1011health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach 2 Objectives and approach 2.1 Justification Since the 1970's, health, nutrition and population (HNP) have become important com-ponents of Dutch development co-operation. In 1998, health was defined as a prioritysector in more than half of the countries that were selected for bilateral development co-operation. Over the period 1995-1999 HNP expenditure totalled 650 million Euros.However, since the late 1980's there has only been limited evaluation carried out in this area by the Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB). 3A combination of these factors led to the decision to carry out this evaluation in the field of health, nutrition andpopulation. Over half of Dutch HNP support during the second half of the 1990's was channelled through the budget category 'country programme for social development'. At present, Dutch bilateral policy has a strong country focus in all sectors and areas. These twofactors led to the choice of an evaluation at country level. An additional argument forexcluding the multilateral channel is that multilateral organisations are already beingevaluated on a regular basis, with the participation of several contributors. 4 The health component of the MFO programme has also been evaluated recently. 2.2 Objective and key questions The overall goal of the evaluation of the country programmes is to determine to whatextent HNP activities have contributed directly or indirectly to combating disease anddeath, especially among the poor. The key questions relate to: the basis and the coherence of the country programme; the policy context; the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the programmes and projects 5in the countries. For a limited number of programmes, efforts 3 IOV evaluated the health co-operation from 1975-1984. Findings are summarised in two reports: IOV 1987 and IOV 1988. Health was included in the country evaluations in Egypt (1998) and Bangladesh (1998). Reproductive health was part of the evaluation women and development (1998).4 At present, UNAIDS is being evaluated. Preparations are made for a multi-donor evaluation of UNFPA. 5 We use the term programme to refer to aid which aims at strengthening an existing recipient country structure, such as a dis trict health care programme, or an essential drugs programme, and at i mproving its performance. We use the term project, to refer a s et of activities which take place in a defined place and time period.health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach 12have also been made to assess the impact in terms of the improvement of health status. Basis and coherence of the programme refers to the considerations that influenced the decision to support a programme or project. Policy context refers to the priorities in national policy, as well as to health care organisa- tion, planning and finance in the countries included in the evaluation. The evaluationincludes a description of Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population overthe last two decades, as well as an inventory of money flows in the period 1995-1999. Relevance refers to the extent to which the programme/project addresses the health problems in the country concerned. It also refers to the degree to which the programme/project reflects the priorities formulated in the national health policy and in Dutch policyin the field of HNP. Effectiveness concerns the extent to which the programme/project objectives have been realised. The timelines and adequacy of changes of original objectives on the basis ofmonitoring and evaluation results is included. Efficiency concerns the way in which the programme/project uses the funds to reach its objectives. In assessing cost-effectiveness, the evaluators specifically made an assess-ment of the costs of expatriate technical staff as compared to the alternative of hiringlocal expertise at much lower cost. Efficiency requires adequate management, adequatemonitoring and an adequate and transparent accounting system in order to monitorexpenditures, allow for timely adjustments and avoid leakage of funds and fraud. These issues were also assessed. Sustainability refers to the potential to retain the achievements of health aid after major technical, managerial and financial assistance from the donor has ended. In this evalua-tion it includes an assessment of the extent to which the externally funded activities areembedded in the health system (institutional sustainability); an assessment of the extentto which policy issues have been incorporated in national health policy (sustainability inpolicy terms) and the extent to which programmes have been continued after withdrawalof funds, including the risk of 'brain-drain' of trained health staff (financial sustaina-bility).13health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach Impact refers to improvement of health status. An assessment of impact, in terms of health outcomes6of health programmes, is a methodological challenge. Impact is hard to mea- sure for programmes with a broad range of health objectives and a variety of actors,including the recipient country government. Programmes can be judged as effective andefficient in terms of the objectives set and the resources utilised, without in fact con-tributing to improved health. Moreover, morbidity and mortality are determined by acomplex array of factors in addition to health services. The most important are income,nutritional status, education, the status of women, and the quality of the environment,particularly access to safe water and sanitation. Changes in income, education, or accessto transport and communications can alter attitudes towards health (e.g. breast-feeding,smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, exercise routines) and thereby influence healthstatus even in the absence of health interventions. Furthermore, changes in the macro-economic environment can influence changes in demands for health goods and services,independent of any change in the health system itself. 7As a result, evaluations can usually not prove a causal relation between health programme/project efforts and healthoutcomes. This evaluation aimed to resolve this methodological challenge by assessing the effect of the health programmes on three types of intermediate factors: structure of the health system; performance of the health care system; and health seeking behaviour of the target population. The assumption is that an improved health system structure contributes to a better performance of the health system; that improved performance contributes to betterhealth behaviour; and that better health behaviour contributes to better health. For exam-ple, improved drug supply - an effect of the Dutch funded essential drugs programmes -will only lead to better health, if an appropriate drug distribution system exists, if drugsare available at an affordable price, if health workers prescribe the drugs properly and ifpatients use the drugs as prescribed. Structure of the health system relate sto infrastructure, supply and organisation of services. 6 Impact in this evaluation is measured in terms of a better health status. In public health terminology the term 'health outc ome' is used for 'improved health status'. Therefore, in this evaluation, the term 'outcome' is used in a different way as it is in th e evaluation terminology. 7 Stout 1997. health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach 14Performance of the health system is assessed on the basis of the following criteria: are interventions of proven clinical effectiveness; is the health care system responsive to client needs; is the financing system fair8. If health care is clinically effective, responsive and fair, it is likely to lead to increased utilisation by the population. Below the three aspects of performance are further opera-tionalised for the purpose of this evaluation. Clinical effectiveness involves how effectively and how appropriately health care providers administer medical or preventive procedures and advice. To ensure an appropriate level ofclinical effectiveness, the health system should provide the most cost-effective clinicaland public health interventions. These are defined as interventions with a large potentialimpact on health outcomes. 9For this evaluation we will focus on the following key inter- ventions. KEY INTERVENTIONS10ELEMENTS OF INTERVENTIONS TO BE ASSESSED11 Immunisation BCG at birth OPV at birth DPT at 6,10 and 14 weeks Measles at 9 months TT for women of child-bearing age Maternal health and safe motherhood pre-natal and delivery care interventionsFamily Planning a range of contraceptive methods available information and education correct use of contraceptives Integrated management of childhood case-management of acute respiratoryillness infections case-management of diarrhoea feeding/breast-feeding counselling monitoring of nutritional status, feeding advice/supplementary feeding for malnourished children 8These criteria are put forward in World Health Organisation 2000. 9W orld Health Organisation 2000. 10 These cost-effectiveness interventions was first calculated in the 1993 World Development report; the list in this table was derived from the above cited World Health Report (WHO 2000).11Adapted for each country field study depending on activities of projects evaluated15health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach I EC on the need for immunisation, good nutrition, appropriate self-treatment, and adequate hygiene Responsiveness of the health care system to clients' needs is a measure of how the system responds to perceived health needs including meeting or not meeting a population's expectations of how it should be treated by health staff.12Responsiveness is an important determinant of the degree of the health services' utilisation. Health care can be of excel-lent technical quality, but if interpersonal communication between patients and healthworkers fails, the clinically effective care has little impact on health. Health-seekingbehaviour studies have shown that people avoid health services where they are treatedrudely by health staff. Responsiveness includes respect for human beings as persons,and more objective elements related to how a system meets certain commonly expressedconcerns of patients. Responsiveness can only exist when the health care providers areaware of the target audience's perceived health needs, local terms they use for commonhealth conditions, cultural notions of aetiology and efficacy of treatments. Communityparticipation in health care is a strategy that has proven to be effective in enhancing suchresponsiveness of the health system. Community participation requires and ensures thatthe target audience participates in information, education and communication activities,as well as in formulation, implementation and evaluation of the health care programmes. Fairness. Fair financing in health systems means that the risks each household faces due to the costs of the health system are distributed according to ability to pay rather than tothe risk of illness: a fair financed system ensures financial protection for everyone. Thereshould be no discrimination by ethnicity, class, gender, age or marital status. A healthsystem in which individuals or households are forced into poverty through their purchaseof needed care is unfair. Paying for health can be unfair because families have to payunexpected costs, such as the costs of gloves when in hospital to deliver a baby; orbecause payments are regressive, in that the least able to pay contribute proportionallymore than the better-off. It is now generally accepted that fairness is greater in pre-pay-ment financing systems, such as through taxes, social or voluntary insurance. The reality,however, in most developing countries is that patients pay out-of-pocket when making use of the health system. In fact, this is increasingly so due to the introduction of user-fees in many public health systems, even though there are usually attempts in such 12In defining this criterion we deviate slightly from the de finition given by the WHO (2000). We have added the extent to which the health care meets perceived health needs; the extent to which it enhances community participation as key elements of responsiveness. health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach 16systems to protect the poor by exempting them from payment. In this evaluation, the extent to which patients pay for services and for drugs was used to assess the fairness ofthe health system. Ultimately health outcomes are determined by behaviours of individuals and families. Clinically effective, responsive and fair health care can be expected to enhance demandfor services and improve compliance with medical regimes thus contributing to betterhealth. This is only the case if the health care services, which are strengthened by the pro-gramme/project efforts, are indeed perceived to be of better quality of care and seen asmeeting people's health needs. Most project/programmes aim to strengthen public health care services. These services have, in many developing countries, been in bad shape for along time. Studies on people's health behaviours in developing countries show that theyfrequently self-medicate using medicines from informal drug providers, and that theyvalue the quality of care provided in the private sector where business interests enhancethe responsiveness of providers to clients' needs. The poor are less able to resort to theprivate sector than the rich, and thus more likely to self-medicate conditions of ill health.Good health care should ideally not only increase the utilisation of health services, butalso encourages healthy behaviour, which prevents ill health, and ensure that peoplepractice self-care appropriately. An increase in immunisation is an easily measurableindicator for health behaviour. It is also an important one. As immunised children areprotected against disease, a positive health outcome is likely. Poverty constrains people's capacity to behave in a healthy manner. If people lack resources for food, transport to health facilities and medicines, then even fair, responsive and clinically effective health care has little impact on health. Such situations occur intimes of ethnic conflicts, war, drought, and among segments of the population which areseverely impoverished. Ethnic tensions and civil wars not only affect health behaviour, butalso negatively impact the structure and performance of the health services. Economiccrises affecting many African countries widen the gap between the rich and the poor,leaving the poor more at risk for ill health and less able to pay for care. This evaluation aimed ultimately to link the intermediate factors, as described, to positive health outcomes using a number of key health indicators, for which information is routinely collected in the health services. The relevant indicators were 13: 13 Evaluators judged the value of the data available. Unfortunately the reliable data collected for Demographic and Health Surv eys were not of use for this evaluation as the DHS data are not collected often enough to allow for the measurement of change relat ed to the programme efforts.17health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach Under five and infant mortality rates. Decreases in under-five and infant mortality can reflect improved prevention, including immunisation coverage, and better treat-ment of predominant childhood disorders. It also can reflect better nutritional practi-ces, including breast-feeding. Maternal mortality. Decreases in maternal mortality can reflect improved antenatal care, prompt attention in cases of obstructed labour and other delivery-related emer-gencies. 2.3 Scope For logistical reasons, the number of countries included in the evaluation is limited tothree. Mozambique, Yemen and Burkina Faso were selected on the basis of the followingcriteria: volume of money flow, range of programmes and avoidance of duplication ofrecent evaluations. T ogether, in the period 1995-1999, these countries consumed about 15 % of Dutch bilateral HNP support. In these countries the entire range of health,nutrition and population projects and programmes supported through the bilateral andmulti-bilateral channel have been included in the evaluation, excepting a few projectswhich were either completed too long ago, were too small (< 50.000 Euros) or wereterminated due to external events such as civil unrest. Table 1 gives an overview of theprogrammes and projects included in the evaluation. In each of the three countries, a field study was carried out in one of the districts where a PHC programme operates, enabling focused data collection. Given the time-consumingcharacter of this kind of research, it was decided that in each country only one PHC pro-gramme could be included in the field study: the Angoche programme in Mozambique,the Hodeidah urban PHC programme in Yemen and the Kaya PHC programme in BurkinaFaso. The choice of a focus on three countries implies that the evaluation results reflect the programmes and projects of those countries. The table shows that in all three countries,district level PHC programmes and a range of nation-wide health support programmes,including essential drugs, disease control and reproductive health programmes havebeen funded. These programmes are implemented in a general public health framework,enabling comparisons to be made. The primary health care programmes included in the evaluation represent 36 % of total expenditure in this area; the ones included in the field studies account for 16 % of thathealth, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach 18 Table 1 Overview of the scope of the evaluation by type of programme/project Country PHC Programmes which Nation-wide health Ot her health strengthen district health support programmes projects structure and performance Mozambique Yemen Burkina FasoNampula health sector support (1997-2001) Memisa primary health care project (1997-1999) Health care support gramme in Angoche (1995-2001) HIV/AIDS control (1995- 2001) Leprosy control in Northern Mozambique(1995-1997) Pooling agreement for technical assistance inthe health sector inMozambique (1995-2000) Yemen drug action pro- gramme (1996-2001) Community midwife (1997-2001) Central agency of drugs purchase(CAMEG) (1995-1998) National tuberculosis control programme(1995-2000) reproductive health projects (1993-1997) Integration of reproduc- tive health in the curri-culum of weaning food(1991-1998) Mozambique (1996-2000) Mentally ill patients kept in Yemeni prisons(1996-2000) Study into sexual health needs (1996-1998)expenditure. The essential drugs programmes account for 43 % of total expenditure in this health policy area. The other policy areas represent a much smaller part of totalexpenditure and results cannot be generalised. 2.4 Methods In each country, the evaluation has been carried out in two phases. The first or appraisal phase included a description of national health policy and a description of the origins of the Dutch programmes and projects in the field of health, nutrition and population.Then, all the above programmes and projects were assessed in terms of their policy rele-vance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. Methods used were document reviewand key informant interviews. The contribution of these projects and programmes in terms of combating disease and death among the poor required a further assessment in terms of their so-called impact,that is health outcomes. This, in turn, required a population-based study and an assess-ment of the quality of health care provision, which was done during the second phase of the evaluation. The implementation of nation-wide essential drugs programmes in the areasconcerned was also assessed in the field study. 2.4.1 Methods for the first phase Methods used in the appraisals included:A review of policy documents. This review included documents on the health situ- ation and on policy developments over the last decade. A desk review of all project/programme documents. For each of the projects and programmes, timelines were developed, and overviews of available projectmemoranda, proposals, and reports. The evaluation teams analysed these docu-ments using the criteria mentioned above. Interviews with key informants were done to further evaluate donor support and pro- gramme and project efforts, in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability,and congruence with national and donor policy. Key informants were technicalexperts and administrators in the Dutch embassy, relevant health staff in the Ministryof Health of the recipient country, other health and development agencies includinglocal UN offices, staff involved in the implementation of the project/programme, and experts in the field of health and health care working in Universities and NGOs,as well as organisations which represent the interests of the target populations of theprojects/programmes. 19health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approachhealth, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach 20 Review of secondary literature on the health-seeking behaviour and health status of the population.

Key informant interviews with district health planners, staff of health centres and hospitals, community leaders, and leaders of community organisations and NGOs. Focus group discussions with mothers of pre-school children and other relevant population groups (depending on the interventions to be evaluated), such asadolescents. 2021health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach Structured observations in the health centres to assess health system structure and performance.

In most cases, it was not possible to relate the findings to theDutch donor support provided. In the field studies, it proved feasible to measure the intermediate factors: health system structure, health system performance and health behaviour. It proved impossible to mea-sure changes in these factors and to relate them to changes in health outcome because: No baseline data existed for most health care performance and health behaviour indicators. We could only measure changes in the utilisation of health services. Infant mortality, under-five child mortality and maternal mortality rates had not been documented systematically over time in the districts studied. These limitations demonstrate the difficulty in measuring changes in health outcomes and relating them to donor inputs, which aim at strengthening health system structureand performance. 2.5.2 Representativeness The field study in Hodeidah covers all the health centres and is considered representativefor the city. It is important to note here that, for pragmatic reasons, the field studies inthe other two countries could not cover all of the programme areas. In Burkina Faso, thefield study was carried out in one of the four districts of the sanitary region of Kaya. Here,one third of the health centres, selected at random, were included in the study. InAngoche, one of the four districts where the programme was carried out was included inthe field study. The health centres were selected on a weighted basis of geographical dis-tribution and levels of health facilities provided. In the selection of households though,random selection procedures were followed in all three studies. 23health, nutrition and population | Objectives and approach health, nutrition and population 2425health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population 3 Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population1980-2000 3.1 Introduction This chapter contains an overview of Dutch policy and budget allocations in the field ofhealth, nutrition and population. Policy memoranda, parliamentary documents, ministe-rial speeches, Budgets 15, instructions for conferences, additional literature and the minis- terial management and information system have provided the background information.Paragraph two outlines a succinct history of international and Dutch health policy sincethe 1980's. Paragraph three describes Dutch policy guidelines for the major health policyareas and is followed, in paragraph four, by an overview of money flows in the period1995-1999. Paragraph five describes the decision-making process at the Ministry ofForeign Affairs with respect to health programme support. The chapter concludes with acritical analysis of Dutch policy and money flows. 3.2 History3.2.1 International policy In the 1970's, the awareness was growing that health and disease were related to livingconditions. Many of the poor, especially in remote rural areas, did not, and still do not,have access to food, education, safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and healthfacilities. As a consequence, they suffer from diseases that could have been prevented ortreated at an early stage. 16International aid and the national health budget in developing countries went mainly to fund hospital care and were not beneficial to the poor. The international WHO/UNICEF health conference in Alma Ata in 1979 was a turningpoint and 'Health for All by the year 2000' became the objective. Based on experienceswith village health workers in China and Latin America, a strategy was developed to reach 15Each year, the Budget is accompanied by informative memorandums (memorie van toelichting). 16Bergstrom, S. 1994: 3-13. health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population 26this target: the primary health care (PHC) strategy. This aimed at providing preventive and elementary curative services in those areas where the poor were living. The overallstrategy was elaborated in the declaration of Alma Ata. 17 By the late 1980's, international health policy started to change, with more emphasisbeing given to the organisation and financing of the health system. Several factorscontributed to this shift, but at its source lay a number of studies showing that publicresources in health were not used efficiently. 18Primary health care proved to be not as cost-effective as initially foreseen. The programmes were donor-driven and not sustain-able. In 1987, a WHO/UNICEF conference in Bamako determined that health systems, inorder to be sustainable, should introduce cost-recovery mechanisms. The organisation ofhealth care soon came to mean the re-organisation of the system, with health reform thewatchword. The World Bank played an important role in this process and donors werehenceforth encouraged to support Health Ministries in developing countries carry outhealth reform. In 1993 the World Bank issued the World Development Report 'Investing in Health'. 19 This report introduced the concept of 'disability adjusted life years' (Daly), which enabled the different health burdens exacted by various diseases and disorders to be calculatedand the cost-effectiveness of curative and preventive interventions to be assessed. It thusprovided important criteria for priority setting in public health. This also marked theintroduction of the 'minimal package of essential care' concept, which defined a mini-mum number of cost-effective services that public health authorities should guarantee tothe poor. Other services could be delivered through private care providers, with healthcare involving both public and private sectors. The sector-wide approach was introducedas the organising principle. In addition to these developments, a number of important conferences which took place during the 1990's also influenced international policy in the HNP field. The WorldSummit for Children in 1990 reiterated the need for child survival and development. The International Conference on Nutrition (ICN) in 1992 made clear that malnutritionwas still a major problem, and that a multisectoral approach was needed to tackle the 17 World Health Organisation 1981. 18 Stout 1997: 32-33. 19 The World Bank 1993. 27health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population problem. In 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) pointed to the need to include reproductive health and gender equality in internationalhealth policy. The Social Summit in 1995 stressed the importance of basic social servicesfor the well-being and development of the poor. In addition to these high level events,ministerial conferences were convened on malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/ AIDS. All these summits and conferences concluded with declarations, listing numerous priorities andproviding guidelines for their implementation. 3.2.2 Dutch policy Dutch HNP policy also followed these trends, with primary health care becoming theguiding principle in the 1980's. A policy memorandum was drafted in 1986, providingguidelines for the implementation of health programmes and projects. 20Though it was acknowledged that there was no blueprint for implementation, to be eligible for supporta programme had to include the basic principles and components of primary health care,with due attention to intersectoral issues, like nutrition, hygiene and reproductive health.The 1991 general policy memorandum, 'A World of Difference', endorsed the emphasis onPHC and at the same time recognised the importance of health care organisation and theneed for cost-recovery. It was explicitly stated that the introduction of cost-recoveryshould be accompanied by exemption mechanisms for the poor. 21Gradually a tendency developed towards district level support for the health system, which included the institu-tional strengthening of public institutions. This focus on the district level was a logicalstep in countries where a decentralisation process was underway. Indeed, sectoral decen-tralisation often paved the way for political and administrative decentralisation. As from1997, succeeding Budgets give informative indications of these changes. In that very year,a speech given by the Minister for Development Co-operation included programme sup-port for Ministries of Health as one of the options in international health co-operation. 22 In 1998, following new overall policy guidelines in Dutch bilateral co-operation, the sec-tor-wide approach started to predominate. With its emphasis on the appropriate bud-getary support of the recipient Ministry of Health, this approach responded both to thelack of ownership of the recipient country and to the problems posed by different individ-ual donor regulations. 20 195-203.22 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1997. health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population 28A general policy memorandum was then drafted, pointing to the need for ownership, policy coherence and donor co-ordination. Though it did not contain specific healthissues as such, it nonetheless encouraged responsible health programme officers intomaking efforts to reschedule previous projects and programmes within a framework ofsector-wide support. 23Zambia and Ghana provided successful illustrations of this process and served as examples as the approach became a part of overall Dutch policy.Key persons reported that the Netherlands also very actively promoted the sector-wideapproach in international health fora. In the 1999 Budget, the emphasis on preventiveand curative basic health care was reiterated, and sector support and donor co-ordinationwere mentioned as important contributions. Some of the international summits and conferences which took place in the 1990's were followed by specific Dutch policy memoranda; these will be listed and summarised in thenext paragraph. The ICPD was followed by a parliamentary decision to allocate 4 % of thebudget to reproductive health. The Social Summit was followed by a policy decision toearmark 20 % of the budget for basic social services. From 1990-1999, these themes arementioned as a priority in most Budgets. 3.3 Major health policy areas 3.3.1 Primary health care (PHC) The principles and components of PHC are summarised in box 1. Equity is a key compo-nent of overall PHC strategy and, as diseases are caused by many factors outside thehealth system, emphasis was given to prevention and to intersectoral co-operation.Appropriate technology was another requirement, given the importance of communityinvolvement in the provision of primary health care. Village health committees were con-sidered an important vehicle to communicate health problems to the health authorities,and village health workers, persons living in the community who had received someelementary health training, were considered key players in the provision of PHC services.Ideally they were to be selected and remunerated by the community itself, and for people living in remote areas, they were indeed the first resort when health problemsarose. 23 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2000. 29health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population Box 1 Primary Health Care Basic principles Key components Equity Mother and child care, including nutrition and family planning Community participation Essential drugs Prevention Water and sanitation Appropriate technology Immunisation Inter-sectoral approach Health promotion Elementary curative care Soon after the PHC programmes started to get underway, opinions began to differ as to how to implement the strategy: comprehensively or selectively. The comprehensiveapproach includes all components of primary health care, whereas the selective approachpromotes intervention in one area, such as vaccination or family planning. These principles were endorsed in a Dutch policy memorandum issued in 1986 and led to the comprehensive PHC approach being adopted. The importance of women as healthcare providers, both in the family and in the community, was also emphasised, especiallyas the inferior status of women in many societies negatively influences health and ham-pers development. Primary health care activities tended to either be implemented as sep-arate projects or as components of integrated rural development projects. In the 1990Budget however, the instruction came for PHC programmes to be increasingly supportedindependently, separate from rural development programmes. Over the period 1995-1999, all PHC programmes and projects were financed through the bilateral channel. During the implementation of some PHC projects, a number of major problems occurred. 24The community sometimes seemed to have less confidence in village health workers than did the donors giving financial support. The essential precondition forhealth promotion, namely good quality curative care at services level and preventive ser-vices at village level, was sometimes forgotten in the first burst of enthusiasm over thenew health strategy. 24 Examples provided in: Streefland & Chabot 1990. health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population 303.3.2 Disease control Support for disease control programmes has a long history, both in bilateral and in multi-lateral co-operation. The most important programmes relate to the development, supplyand distribution of vaccines, tuberculosis control, malaria control and river blindnesscontrol. With the exception of malaria control, no special guidelines have been drafted fordisease control programmes. 25In general, the recommendation is to integrate disease control within basic health services, though implicitly it is recognised that vertical struc-tures are justified when the health services are weak. 26 Within the framework of bilateral co-operation, tuberculosis control receives mostsupport. These programmes follow international WHO guidelines concerning directlyobserved treatment with short course therapy (DOTS). For the other disease controlprogrammes, support includes research into vaccines and drugs. From 1995-1999, this support was financed both through multilateral organisations and the countryprogramme for social development. Instructions for the board meetings of researchprogrammes contain statements on the need for research results to be beneficial to thepoor and for products to be available at affordable prices. They also include a plea foroperational and applied research. 3.3.3 Essential drugs programmes Over the past twenty years, providing support to essential drugs programmes has been animportant component of Dutch development aid. There are, however, no specific policyguidelines. In general policy documents and in speeches given by the Minister forDevelopment Co-operation, it has been emphasised that the availability and rational useof essential drugs is a prerequisite for a well-functioning health system. Assistance hasbeen provided for both commodity supply and for the implementation of an essentialdrugs policy. The Essential Drugs Policy programme of WHO (EDM) provides countrieswith the necessary technical support to implement these policies. Box 2 shows the variouscomponents of a national essential drugs policy. In the implementation of essential drugs programmes, there has to be a balance between various components. In practice, the emphasis is often placed on procurement and sup- 25 Notitie malaria, 202. 31health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population ply; and yet without training in the rational use of drugs, the programmes are not likely to have positive health outcomes. In international fora, the Netherlands has always argued in favour of the essential drugs concept, including the promotion of legal procedures to prohibit unfair drug advertising.Safeguarding the quality of drug donations has also been a policy issue since 1996. In 1999, the Minister for Development Co-operation made a plea for better private andpublic sector co-operation in the twin fields of vaccine and drug research and productdistribution with a view to affordable pricing. 27 Financial support is mainly channelled through the country programme for social devel-opment and to a lesser extent through multilateral organisations. The WHO essentialdrugs programme has received both a core contribution and a contribution earmarked forspecific countries.

The memorandum points to thedramatic effects of the epidemic for developing countries. The decrease in the number ofproductive survivors leads to lower food production, which can be the start of a viciouscircle of malnutrition, disease and even lower food production. It is self-evident that theconsequences of the epidemic for health expenditure are also disastrous. Policy measures aim at the emancipation of the poor, with special attention for women. A multi-sector approach is encouraged in the policy memorandum, including awarenessraising, education and promotion of condom use. Support for biomedical and socialscience research is also recommended. Other components of AIDS prevention and controlare: capacity building in developing countries and care for people with AIDS and AIDSorphans. A pragmatic approach is advocated, including the utilisation of existing struc-tures, both governmental and non-governmental. Progress relating to HIV/AIDS prevention and control, including the financial flows to these areas, has been reported to Parliament on a number of occasions. The budget hasincreased substantially since 1995 and is channelled both through bilateral co-operationand through multilateral organisations. The Netherlands has been the major donor toUNAIDS, which was set up in 1996. In instructions for board meetings, it has been con-stantly emphasised that AIDS is not a health problem but a development problem. 3.3.5 Reproductive health During the 1970's and 1980's, Dutch co-operation in the field of reproductive health wasonly channelled through multilateral organisations, specifically in the form of support tofamily planning programmes. The policy memorandum, 'A World of Difference', encour- aged bilateral population and family planning programmes for the first time, with theMinister for Development Co-operation confirming the importance of these programmes 28Aids en ontwikkelingssamenwerking, 1992-1993. 33health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population in a speech in 1992.29During the preparations of the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994, the Netherlands played a very active role inthe negotiations on the final declaration. Prior to the conference a policy memorandumwas drafted, pointing to the objectives of Dutch policy in the field of reproductive healthand providing guidelines for their implementation. 30 The most important objective of Dutch population policy is to make population issuesand reproductive health an integral part of Dutch development efforts and to help devel-oping countries better understand the effects of population factors on the developmentprocess. A number of underlying principles have been formulated, such as the recogni-tion of men and women's basic human right to decide how many children to have andwhen to have them, the importance of women's education and the recognition ofwomen's physical, economic, cultural and social autonomy. The memorandum also outlines which programmes are eligible for support. These include: activities to reinforce basic health care- of which family planning and reproduc-tive health should be an integral part; programmes for those groups that are neglected inregular health services; information, education and communication activities; activitiesaimed at improving safe motherhood; prevention and control of sexually transmitted dis-eases; and supply and production of contraceptives. Training and research programmesalso qualify for support. In 1999, the Minister for Development Co-operation addressed 'The Hague Forum', organised five years after the ICPD, in order to review what had been accomplished andhow to move forward. She mentioned several successes but warned that, though progresshad been made, the implementation of the action plan of was still lagging behind. In herown words: \"Women's and girls' right to health is still flagrantly disregarded from the cradle to the grave\". The Minister confirmed that reproductive health would continue tobe an important part of Dutch policy and indicated that she considered the role of non-governmental organisations especially important when it came to advocacy and reachingyoung people. Parliamentarians were encouraged to bring sexual and reproductive healthissues into the public debate and to fight for proper legislation to give women access toland, economic resources and protection against violence. 31 29 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1992. 30 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1994.31 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1999a.health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population 34The overwhelming majority of the reproductive health budget is made up of a contribu- tion to UNFPA. Less than 20 % spent through the bilateral channel. 3.3.6 Nutrition The International Conference on Nutrition (ICN) in 1992 made clear that malnutrition isstill a major problem; 20% of the world's children under five are malnourished.Malnutrition is caused by a complex array of factors, such as deficient food production oraccess to food, unequal distribution of available food at household level, poor food quali-ty and inadequate (health) care. These multiple causes make nutrition everybody's con-cern and yet nobody's responsibility. The ICN gave a new input to the development of a policy on nutrition in the Netherlands, which was formalised in the 1995 policy memorandum 'Nutrition: Interaction of Food,Health and Care'. 32The title already points to the fact that an adequate nutrition policy includes interventions in several areas and, indeed, to ensure good nutritional status,three conditions do have to be fulfilled: food, health and care. The most important objec-tives are: improving food security, particularly at household level; improving the totalrange of food produced for consumption; improving the quality of (emergency) food aid; promoting breast-feeding; promoting the local production of weaning food and;devoting increased attention to nutrition in health care. Health care should, of itself,promote breast-feeding, infant and child nutrition, nutrition during and after sickness,micronutrients, women's nutrition, reproductive health, and education and information. 32 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1995.Box 3 Reproductive health, ICPD 1994 Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely theabsence of disease or infirm in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions andprocesses. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sexlife and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often todo so. Implicit in this last condition is the right of men and women to be informed and to have accessto safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as othermethods of their choice for regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the right of accessto appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and child-birth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. 35health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population The memorandum provides guidelines for programme implementation. Informed knowledge of both the local food and nutrition situation and national food and nutritionpolicies is required before the choice of a particular intervention can be made and pro-gramme support start. The recommended approach is a flexible one, which takes bothshort and long term effects into consideration. Carefully planned and implemented inter-ventions will contribute to make nutrition everybody's responsibility. Support is channelled both through bilateral co-operation and to an increasing extent through multilateral organisations. Internationally, the Netherlands has strongly pro-moted and supported breast-feeding and sought to prevent the advertising of breast-milksubstitutes. 3.3.7 Health policy, basket funding and budget support The policy memorandum 'A World of Difference' noted that results of primary health care programmes were disappointing. Bad economic conditions and low health budgetsin developing countries were considered a major root cause of this disappointment andaccordingly, a differentiated approach was recommended which took cultural aspectsinto consideration. The document endorsed the primary health care principles, butemphasised the need to invest in the improvement of the quality of care. As a conse-quence, recommendations were made to include training, health management andfinance, logistics and the monitoring of services in future health support. In the 1990's, health system organisation and health reform were given increased impor- tance in Dutch policy. The 1993 World Development Report gave a further impetus in thesame direction. In 1998, with the formalisation of the sectoral approach in bilateral co-operation, ownership, policy coherence and donor co-ordination became the watchwords,implicitly denying the need for specific Dutch HNP policy guidelines in bilateral co-opera-tion. In 1999 at a meeting with health experts and programme officers responsible forhealth programmes at Dutch Embassies, the introduction of the sector-wide approachwas discussed. This meeting was followed by a publication that elaborated the conceptsused in this approach and presented the state of the art in the countries receiving Dutchsupport for health, nutrition and population. 33Though this was not an official policy memorandum, it nonetheless became an important policy reference.

Annex four provides information on data selection and processing and presents more details. channel accounts for almost all budgetary spending for health policy, basket funding and budget support. 3.4 Money flows 1995 -1999 Total HNP expenditure was 650 million Euros.34Over half was spent in the budget catego- ry 'country programme for social development' that mainly relates to bilateral co-opera-tion. About 40 % went to multilateral organisations and the remainder to various otherbudgetary lines. Table 4 summarises the expenditure per policy area and per budget cate-gory. Activities on health, nutrition and population that are an integrated part of otherprogrammes, such as rural development programmes, are not included in the table.

The exception is reproductive health, where the budget is largely spent on acore contribution to UNFP A (1995-1999 = 192.4 million Euros.) For the HIV/AIDS policy area, the multilateral channel is also important with UNAIDS receiving 21.8 million Eurosin the period 1996-1999. The policy area 'other' includes research and training that is not related to another policy area, for example support for a research institute. In the policy area 'disease control' 17 %of the budget was spent on research and in HIV/AIDS 23 %. In all other policy areas, only a minor percentage of the budget was spent on research. For all policy areas, training as aseparate activity accounted for less than 5 % of the budget. Expenditure in the budget category \"other\" goes mainly to the health programme in Surinam. The policy area 'other' accounts for a large part of this category. The reason isthat the programme in Surinam has a special character, as costs for the treatment ofpatients with severe diseases as well as hospitals investments are included. 35Figure 1 and 2 illustrate the relative importance of the respective policy areas for the overall budgetand for the country programme for social development.

In thebilateral country programme on social development, the major policy areas of primaryhealth care, disease control, essential drugs and reproductive health are almost equallyrepresented, with 15-20 % of overall expendit ure.

From 1995-1999 total expenditure increased by about one third. From 1995-1997 there was a steady increase, followed by adip in 1998 and then by 1999 the budget had once again reached the 1997 level. If infla-tion over the years is taken into account, the budget has decreased in real terms in thethree year period ending in 1999. The figure shows that since 1997 the relative importanceof the multilateral channel has increased, whereas the relative importance of the countryprogramme for social development has decreased. Figure 4 Total expenditure in country programme social development per policy area; changes over the period 1995-1999 Source: MIDAS Figure 4 shows expenditure changes for the different policy areas in country programme social development. The lines reveal that expenditure may vary considerably from year toyear. Primary health care is rather stable and expenditure follows the general pattern shown in figure 3. Most other policy areas follow the general pattern, but show greaterups and downs and dips in years where expenditure is very low. Essential drugs expendi-ture increased from 1995 to 1997 and has dropped since 1997. The overall budgetaryincrease over the period 1995-1999 was mainly allocated to the policy areas 'health policy,basket funding and budget support', nutrition and HIV/AIDS. Expenditure in the field of reproductive health showed a slight decrease. For other categories, expenditure in 1999was broadly equivalent to 1995. 02468101214161820 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999million eurosdisease control HIV/AIDprimary health careessential drugsreproductive health nutrition health policy, basket funding, budget supportotherhealth, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population 40Figure 5 shows the regional distribution.36Over half of the expenditure in health, nutrition and population went to sub-Saharan Africa.

Previous to the reorganisation within the Dutch Ministry of ForeignAffairs in 1996 (\"Herijking\"), the decision-making power was at country desk level in The Hague, where the regional desk officers were responsible for bilateral support pro-grammes. They were supported by an independent Technical Advice Unit, which included health expertise. Usually at the request of the Embassy in the countries concerned, a country desk commissioned missions to identify support areas, to formulate proposalsfor support and monitor and review implementation. In order to be better able to respond to the demand and needs in developing countries, health experts were hired to reinforce Embassy staff, with the first health expert taking uphis post in 1990 in the south of Africa. As from 1992, the number has gradually increasedand by the end of the 1990's, almost all countries receiving health sector support had ahealth expert in the Dutch Embassy. As from 1991, the Technical Advice Unit in the Hague was extended to include health, nutrition, reproductive health and AIDS expertise. They had an independent advisory rolein the identification and formulation phase and an -obligatory - say in the approvalFigure 6 Country programme social development; total HNP expenditure and HNP expenditure for the least developed countries; changes in the period 1995-1999 Source: MIDAS 0102030405060708090 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999million eurosLDC'sTotalphase. Decision-making power for multilateral contributions in the field of HNP was at the level of the multilateral desk, with HNP experts in an advisory role. In 1997 the situation changed and the Embassies were made responsible for the process of identification and approval of bilateral support programmes. Overall approval of yearlyplans and budget allocation remained in the hands of the Ministry in The Hague. The independent Technical Advice Unit was abolished and the HNP experts transferred to a social policy division, which was responsible for, inter alia, health, nutrition, repro-ductive health, water/sanitation and AIDS. This division originally had the power to takedecisions vis-\u00e0-vis the total thematic budget allocations and the overall process of yearplan approval. The HNP experts remained as advisors, if asked, and as 'sparring-partners'for the health experts at the Embassies on the one hand, and for the multilateral deskofficers on the other. 3.6 Analysis Dutch HNP policy has followed in the footsteps of international policy, with the relevanthealth policy areas addressing the major public health problems of poor countries. For anumber of health policy areas, policy memoranda have been drafted which include imple-mentation guidelines. However, there are no decisions on how to assess the relativeimportance of one area in relation to another and only two written statements were foundon money flows to the different areas. In the first, Parliament required that 4 % of devel-opment aid be spent on reproductive health; in the second, the Social Summit was fol-lowed by a decision to spend 20 % on basic social services. Since 1998 there has been anoverall policy decision to either go for a sector-wide approach and budget support inbilateral co-operation provided certain conditions are met. This decision has not beentranslated in financial terms. The impact of the 1986 PHC policy memorandum was considerable. Over the period 1995- 1999 primary health care, and the closely-related area of essential drugs, continued toreceive more bilateral funds than any other health policy area. Over the years, the focus ofPHC programmes tended to shift towards the institutional level, including health systemorganisation and finance, and away from the provision of assistance in remote areas. Thischange has been referred to on occasion in a ministerial speech and in the relevantBudget, but no new guidelines have been developed for its implementation nor have pre-vious guidelines been revised or renounced. The 1990 general policy memorandum is theonly one to contain some remarks on this development, which include a clear statementhealth, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population 42about cost recovery and the need for exemption rules for the poor. This policy has never been made operational. The importance of the disease control and essential drugs programmes was described in the 1990 general policy memoranda and reiterated in later Budgets and ministerialspeeches. No separate guidelines exist for them, with the sole exception of a 1992 policypaper on malaria, though implicitly, general WHO policy guidelines are followed. Themoney flow to disease control in bilateral co-operation has decreased since 1996. The money flow to essential drugs increased from 1995 to 1997 and has dropped since1997. Most international HNP conferences held during the 1990's were either accompanied, or followed, by Dutch policy memoranda; and they all point to the importance of this healthpolicy area. In the memoranda on nutrition and reproductive health, encouragement isgiven to both the integration of these areas within general health programmes and to thesupport for separate activities. The HIV/AIDS memoranda advocate a practical approach,using the channels most appropriate to the circumstances. Expenditure on nutrition andHIV/AIDS increased over the period 1995-1999, though the budget on nutrition remains low. From 1995-1999 reproductive health expenditure varied considerably on a year-to-year basis. No explanation could be found for this variation. The money flow to the cluster 'health policy issues, basket funding and budget support' shows a steady increase from 1995-1998, followed by a rapid increase in 1999. This wasdue to the general policy decision to concentrate bilateral co-operation to a limited num-ber of countries and to a limited number of sectors within these countries. In 1999 thefigure was still low, with only 13 % of overall HNP expenditure in bilateral co-operation. The general policy changes of 1998 were accompanied by two further changes in money flows to HNP programmes. Firstly, the budget for multilateral organisations increased atthe expense of the bilateral co-operation budget. Secondly, health expenditure in theleast developed countries decreased. The 2000 general policy memorandum on the sector-wide approach provides general guidelines that also relate to health. This memorandum does not contain any informa-tion on the content of health programmes and was not accompanied by new health policyguidelines. The former guidelines were not retracted and no directives exist concerning 43health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and populationthe integration of priority areas such as primary health care, reproductive health and nutrition in the sector-wide approach. Emphasis is given to form and process, highlighting the importance of ownership, policy coherence and donor co-ordination. The understanding is implicit that, in the countriesconcerned, government policy should be followed, though the precise meaning of 'coher-ence' in health policy is not explicitly documented. Neither is it clear to what extent policyareas, such as nutrition, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS, should be integrated into thenational health policies in developing countries as a yardstick for 'coherence' . Summarising the findings, this review of policy documents and financial flows highlights the following: Dutch HNP policy documents address the major public health problems of the poor. From the mid-1980's to the late 1990's a gradual policy shift has been observed. Thecontent of health policy and service accessibility were prominent in the 1980's, whilethe institutional level was neglected. The late 1990's, in contrast, saw greater empha-sis given to the institutional level and the introduction of the sector-wide approach asa guiding principle. Policy guidelines on newly-introduced health policy areas have been added to exis- ting ones, without clear guidance either on priority setting or on how to integratethem into existing policy. As the priority of any given health policy area varies sub-stantially according to the circumstances, it is obvious that no specific financialdirectives are made. However, guidelines on how to weigh circumstances and priori- ties would facilitate choices. With respect to the country programme for social development, the budget allocation to most health policy areas shows considerable variations over the period 1995-1999.Except for the budgetary increase for the cluster 'health policy, basket funding andbudget support' from 1998-1999, no explanations for these variations can be found inpolicy memoranda. health, nutrition and population | Dutch policy in the field of health, nutrition and population 4445health, nutrition and population | Mozambique 37 UNDP 2001, UNICEF 2001. 4M ozambique 4.1 Health situation and health policy Mozambique is a country that, since its civil war ended in 1992, has received relativelylarge amounts of support from a wide range of donors, including the Netherlands. The country is located in the south-eastern part of Africa and has about 17 million in-habitants, 60 % living in rural areas. It has a tropical climate. In 1999 and 2000 extremerainfall caused severe floods that seriously damaged the country's infrastructure. In thepost-war years after 1992, the peace process has brought stability and economic growth.The country experienced major changes, such as a process of liberalisation and, followinggeneral elections, the establishment of a democratic government. On the human development index, Mozambique is located in the group of countries with low human development. It ranks number 157 on a list of 162 countries. The GDP per capita is US$ 230 per year, with an estimated 70 % of the population living in extremepoverty. The literacy rate is about 25 % for women and 50 % for men. About 60 % of thepopulation use an improved drinking water source and 43 % have access to adequatesanitary facilities. Life expectancy is only 43 years. The major health indicators, sum-marised in table 5, are extremely unfavourable. 37 Table 5 Health indicators in Mozambique Indicator Mozambique Year Infant mortality rate (/1000 live births) 127 1999 Under five mortality rate(/1000 live births) 203 1999 Maternal mortality rate (/100.000 live births) 1100 1996 Total fertility rate (amount of children per women) 6.1 1999 Percentage under-fives with underweight (< 2 SD median) 26% 1995-2000Percentage infants with low birth weight 12% 1995-2000Annual population 3.4% 1990-1999 Contraceptive prevalence rate 10% 1999 Source: UNICEF, The state of the world's children, 2001 Upon independence in 1975, the health system was in deplorable shape and health care in rural areas almost non-existent. The government then defined a health policy based onprimary health care(PHC) principles; health services were expanded and special emphasisgiven to health promotion and prevention, including a number of vaccination campaigns.The control of endemic diseases became a priority and to counter the woeful state of the health system, particular attention was given to human resources development. The health system was nationalised and as a result, the planning and administration of services became highly centralised. Private practice and traditional medicine wereforbidden by law. The civil war in the 1980's forced many people to leave their homes and destroyed much of the health system. After 1992, displaced people were resettled and the soldiers demo-bilised. Since then, much of the health service has been rehabilitated, mainly with exter-nal financial support, and now an estimated 50% of the population has access to thehealth system. The aim has been to increase access to basic facilities to 70% by 2002, butachieving this target has been hampered by a shortage of well-trained staff, low salariesand unfavourable working conditions. The period of general economic liberalisation which took place in the 1990's also affected the health system, with both the private sector and civil society coming to play a role. In rural areas though, it is the public health system which still remains by far the mostimportant provider. A process of health sector reform was subsequently initiated toimprove the quality of care and rationalise available means. The policies and strategiesare developed at central level and their implementation at district level is supported bythe provincial health offices. However, the role of community health has not been subjectto policy definition. A 'fee for services' system has been established with very low fees.Traditional medicine is no longer forbidden and clients consider it important. Many external agencies were involved in the rehabilitation of the health system when the civil war ended. The World Bank, the ADB and the Islamic Bank provided loans for therehabilitation of the infrastructure and the training of human resources. Several bilateraldonors also support the health sector: Switzerland, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Italy, theUnited Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands. USAID mainly providessupport through international NGOs. The European Union is a major donor as well.WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA also provide assistance. In the period 1997-2001, the aggre-gate donor contribution to the health sector totalled almost US$ 300 billion. Co-opera-health, nutrition and population | Mozambique 46tion with some donor countries has been going on a long time, resulting in the co- financing of a number of programmes, such as the essential drugs programme and thepooling of technical assistance. About hundred NGOs, both international and national,are also active in the field of health, nutrition and population (HNP). In the 1990's it was decided that, over and above providing support for national pro- grammes, each of the major donor agencies should also be active in a different provinceof the country. By the end of the decade, this policy had changed and at present, mostbilateral donors are moving in the direction of sector-wide support, with basket fundingfor several programmes. This support is channelled through the Ministry of Health, withwhom donors meet on a regular basis. 4.2 Dutch support for health, nutrition and population With the success of the peace process, Dutch support in the field of health moved fromhumanitarian assistance to the strengthening of the health system. In the period coveredby the evaluation, 25.8 million Euros were spent on HNP. The Netherlands were the fifthlargest donor in the period 1997-2001.

Figure 7 Mozambique; HNP expenditure; distribution over main areas of support Source: MIDAS 47health, nutrition and population | Mozambique Essential drugsDisease controlOther expenditure; timeline 1995 - 1999 Source: MIDAS Two remnants of the post-war emergency consumed a large part of the budget during the period 1995-1999. The first of these was drug supply- in response to the drug shortage-and accounted for almost two thirds of the budget. This programme, though changed, is still ongoing and receives support from various other donors. It aims at improving theavailability of essential drugs in Mozambique health services. The second remnant wasthe pooling agreement for technical assistance- in response to the severe staff shortage-and this accounts for slightly over 10% of the budget. This budgetary line has financedthe salaries and related costs of foreign doctors and paramedical staff as well as a certainamount of training. In addition to these post-emergency programmes, 8% of the budget has gone to a national HIV/ AIDS prevention and control programme which has received support since 1994. HIV/AIDS awareness and increased availability and use of condoms are the major objectives of this programme. The implementing agency formulated a proposal on therequest of the Ministry of Health and submitted it, among others, to the Netherlands. At national level, support was also given to the census. As the reliable population data needed for proper planning were not available in the post-war period, Mozambiquerequested support for a census. The national statistical institute carried out the census in1997 and UNFPA managed the funds. 37474582 Total 25.8 million eurosEuro x 10007133 6077 4230 010002000300040005000600070008000 1995 1996 1997 1998 199949health, nutrition and population | Mozambique Early on in the 1990's, Mozambican foreign aid policy was to concentrate the support of each of the major donors in different provinces in the country. The Netherlands started a programme in Nampula province aimed at poverty alleviation, which included ruraldevelopment, drinking water and sanitation, urban development and health. Other bi-lateral donors and a considerable number of national and international NGO's alsoprovided support in this province and co-ordinated their efforts on an ad-hoc basis. The health component of the Nampula programme started with the support of several NGO's and technical assistance. As from 1996, preparations were made for long-termsupport and since absorption capacity was felt to be limited, the choice was made for aslow start and a gradual expansion. The idea was that the institutional strengthening ofthe provincial health office should be the core of the programme and that ownership ofthe programme should increasingly devolve to Mozambique. In the evaluation, we have included four health programmes and projects implemented in Nampula province. Prindesa aimed mainly at institutional strengthening and was imple-mented by the provincial health office and DGIS, with the latter being responsible for theadministration of funds. The health programme in Angoche, implemented by Health Net International, was a fol- low-up to emergency assistance by MSF in the same area. The implementing agency sub-mitted a request for funding. The Memisa project and the leprosy control programme forthe Northern Region were also submitted by the implementing agencies. The budget forthese four programmes accounted for about 10% of the 1995-1999 budget. One project included in the evaluation, the Probeira weaning food production, is a bit an outsider. It has been carried out in Beira. It was a response to the high percentage of mal-nutrition and it has a long history of deliberations on the need of a local production ofweaning food. The initiative was Dutch. Table 6 summarises the projects and pro-grammes included in the evaluation. It could not be ascertained whether other, different,areas of support might have been initially considered as an alternative to the packagethat received support in the end. Since 1998, policy changes in the Netherlands in favour of sector-wide approach have led to a policy of direct budgetary support for the Ministry of Health's health sector reformprogramme. This support is channelled through several pooling mechanisms; the drughealth, nutrition and population Mozambique 5038 Societ\u00e9 General de Segurance 39 Nederlands inkoopcentrale (Dutch agency for purchase of goods)40 The total amount is similar to the budget 1995-1999 in figure.

The plan is for the Ministry of Health to continue receiving support in 2002.41It should be pointed out that since, over the period 1995-1999, less then 1% of funding went to budgetsupport, it did not meet the criteria to be included in this evaluation. Despite the initiallong-term plans for Nampula, at the time of the evaluation support for the Nampula pro-grammes had either ended, or was about to end after the conclusion of ongoing activi-ties. Further support for the province is foreseen, but it will take a different form and asyet, this has not been determined. In conclusion, the programmes and projects are either targeted at directly improving the performance of the health system or at creating the necessary conditions for good perfor-mance. Thus the programmes and projects are complementary and make up a coherentpackage of health system support, when the input of other actors is taken into considera-tion. The implementation of such a package has the real potential to contribute to pover-ty alleviation. 4.3 Relevance Programmes are considered relevant if they meet the needs defined in Mozambique'shealth policy. In general terms, all the programmes and projects were responses to themost urgent prevailing health problems and most were initiated at the request of theMozambican authorities. The drug supply programme, the pooling for technical assis-tance, the census and the Nampula health support programme were all integrated intoalready defined government development plans. None of these programmes though,were directly administrated through government structures. The AIDS prevention andcontrol programme was an initiative of the implementing agency (HIV/AIDS prevention isdefined as a priority in the national health agenda). The national programmes also received financial support from other donors and/or inter- national agencies. The leprosy control programme in the northern region and the twoPHC projects in Nampula were implemented by international NGOs. Though they wereconceived and carried out in a cadre defined by the Mozambican health authorities.However, the degree to which the leprosy control programme is integrated within the national health system can be questioned, as support covers only the leprosy componentof the national tuberculosis and leprosy control programme. 41 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2001, Yearplan Mozambique. health, nutrition and population | Mozambique 52The weaning food production was relevant at the time it was conceived. However, as both the socio-economic situation and Mozambican policy changed over time, this activity nolonger corresponded to the new situation and lost its relevance. Eight of the nine programmes and projects responded to priority needs and plans, as defined by the Mozambican government; hence they were relevant. Most programmeswere also in line with Dutch HNP aid policy, with the exception of the pooling agreementfor technical assistance. Here, most of the experts work at hospital level, which is nolonger a priority in Dutch co-operation. Support has nonetheless been maintained over along period at the request of the Mozambican authorities. 4.4 Effectiveness Effectiveness was assessed by analysing to what extent the programmes' and projects'objectives have been realised. Where necessary, the feasibility of the objectives and theway in which they changed over time was also assessed. Lack of baseline data, the factthat the objectives were not always measurable and that result indicators were not speci-fied, limited the possibility to assess effectiveness. Further constraints included weak ornon-existent progress monitoring. Only some programmes and projects were indepen-dently evaluated. Most programmes also received support from other donors. In such cases it is hard to assess the specific effectiveness of the Dutch support component. In principle, the three PHC projects in Nampula province which received Dutch support were complementary; one (Prindesa) directed at institutional development at provinciallevel and the other two (Angoche and Memisa) directed at care quality improvement atdistrict and community level. The Memisa project which aimed at providing technicalassistance at district hospital level and implementing mother and child care, was termi-nated far ahead of plans, mainly due to management problems at the implementingagency. The objectives were not achieved; the project was not effective. Prindesa, which aimed at the institutional strengthening of the Nampula health office (HO), started in 1998. At that time, the plan was for long-term assistance to the provincewith direct support to the provincial HO at the core of the programme. However, the pro-gramme had a separate staff. By 1999, after a delay in implementation that led to under-expenditure, and subsequent to a Dutch policy shift in favour of the sectoral approach,the first signs started to appear that the whole continuation of the programme was indoubt. A period of uncertainty followed, finally leading to a decision by the Netherlandsat the end of 2000 to not continue the programme. This uncertainty and the later changeof plan both negatively impacted the programme's effectiveness. A number of studieswere carried out in the field of human resources, infrastructure, gender and communityparticipation and their quality is good. However, the atmosphere of doubt and the falseexpectations of the district HO hampered the utilisation of their results. Several missionswere also commissioned to discuss the future of the programme; as there was no future,these missions came to nought. Other activities within the Prindesa programme areconsidered to have contributed in a positive way to the functioning of the health system. The provincial HO received assis-tance in planning and supervision, which resulted in a system of integrated supervisionbeing set up and implemented. A strategic health plan was formulated. Several trainingcourses, both at management level and at elementary health worker level, were carriedout with funds from the project. The purchase of 19 cars and 20 motor vehicles greatlyimproved the transportation system. To sum up: some improvements were achieved in the health system, such as better plan- ning and the implementation of integrated supervision. Though the studies were of high 53health, nutrition and population | Mozambiquequality, they were less effective because of lack of follow-up. Neither the missions, nor the frequent discussions, managed to lead to acceptable proposals in favour ofcontinuing the programme. But they did raise expectations at the Provincial Health Office that support would be continued. The overall effectiveness of the Angoche health programme was limited. In the first phase the objectives were too ambitious and too broadly defined; they included im-proving both the health management and the planning and resolving capacity of thehealth services. These objectives were not achieved. The most positive results were in thearea of training. The training of health workers at elementary and community level wascarried out according to plan and key informants expressed their satisfaction with it. Data on the performance of the trainees is not however available. Health committees were also set up with support from the project, though only one is still functioning.During the first phase, health system research activities were carried out but with notangible results. After a mid term review in 1997, the objectives were more clearly defined and their num- ber reduced. Infrastructure improvements have been successfully achieved and trainingactivities continued. The effectiveness of the village health workers' and traditional birthattendants' training was hampered by the lack of a clear national policy on communityhealth. During the second phase of the programme, an emergency fund for unforeseen activities was established. This has been used by the district health authorities to resolveurgent problems such as guaranteeing vaccine supply in times of shortage. Key infor-mants expressed their satisfaction about the fund. An initiative was also taken toestablish community health committees. To sum up: with the exception of the training component, only a few tangible effects are visible. The results of the field study, summarised under the item 'impact', confirm thesefindings. Given that the health services are still sub-standard, it is clear that the majorobjective of the programme to improve the quality of care has not been obtained. The leprosy control programme in the northern region was effective. It is a relatively small programme with well-defined aims that did not change over time. The detection of lep-rosy patients, their treatment with multi-drug therapy and the cure rate increased. But,lack of an adequate information system prevented us from verifying whether the 75%percent treatment compliance objective had been reached by 1997. It was found in thehealth, nutrition and population | Mozambique 5455health, nutrition and population | Mozambique field study that leprosy drugs were always available even in the health services which generally lacked supplies of essential drugs. The effectiveness of the national programmes varied. The drugs supply programme, the pooling agreement for medical technical assistance, the AIDS prevention programmeand the census project all responded to urgent needs. Of these programmes, the censusand the AIDS prevention programme are the most effective. The drug supply programmeand the technical assistance programme all made some positive contributions, in spite ofthe major shortcomings which were identified. The drugs supply programme made funds available for the purchase of essential drugs (defined by the government). In 1999 the Netherlands financed around 10% of governmentdrug expenditure and thus contributed to the potential availability of drugs for the gener-al population. Another positive effect was the strengthening of institutional capacity atboth the Health Ministry and the distribution agency, where procedures were improvedand a management and audit system set up. On the downside, the availability of essen-tial drugs in the periphery was, and still is, far from adequate. Systematic research intothe availability of drugs throughout the country could not be done for logistical reasons,though the findings of the Angoche district field study, presented in the paragraph onimpact, are illustrative. There are problems with the distribution system and leakage atdifferent levels. Another weakness in the drug supply programme was the lack of atten-tion paid to rational drug use. Prindesa organised a course targeting this issue. The AIDS prevention programme succeeded in increasing the availability, sale and use of condoms at national level; in Angoche, however, usage still remained low. A practicalplan of work was developed and carried out as scheduled and training, promotion andresearch activities implemented according to plan. The programme developed a monitor-ing system, with statistical data on the distribution and sale of condoms compiled inmonthly and three-monthly reports. The household survey in Angoche did not confirm anincrease of condom use at national level; although awareness of HIV/AIDS and the ways toprevent it was high, condom use was still very low. The census data were summarised in readily accessible documents and distributed to the provinces. This census led to an improvement in the capacity of the executing agency(INE) as well as meeting the clearly defined, gender-related, objective of involving womenin the process and giving them training. The pooling agreement for medical and non-medical technical assistance was successful in the sense that the provincial reference hospitals had medical teams at their disposal inorder to meet local needs. However a further programme objective, aimed at increasinglocal capacity through training, was not achieved. After identifying some major problemsin the course of implementation, the objectives were adapted and appropriationschanged to include the salaries of national and provincial health managers. However, the programme did not manage to increase institutional capacity at the Ministry ofHealth, nor to achieve proper planning of human resources utilisation. For these reasons,support has been discontinued. The objectives of the local weaning food production project, known as Probeira, were formulated in a socio-economic context different to the one prevailing at the time ofimplementation. In spite of this, the objectives were not changed. As a result, there wereno buyers for the food finally produced and at a certain stage severe problems and mis-understandings occurred between the project and the Ministry of Health. This project wasineffective. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the programmes varied. In the census project and the HIV/AIDS programme the objectives were attained. In most other programmes, the objec- tives have been partially attained. In two projects, the objectives have not been attained. 4.5 Efficiency The efficiency of the programmes and projects have been assessed using three main crite-ria: cost-effectiveness, programme management and the transparency of the financialadministration. One of the items under the cost-effectiveness heading concerns how ade-quately expatriate personnel were used. The objectives and the scope of the projects andprogrammes vary substantially and as a consequence the comparison of expenditure inthe different budgetary lines also shows great variations. Looking first at the programmes implemented in Nampula, and starting with Prindesa, a relatively large part of their budget was spent on personnel, infrastructure and vehicles.The programme had a Dutch co-director and employed two foreign architects and a train-ing advisor. It is not clear if the project tried to find Mozambican staff for other vacancies,but it did try in vain to employ Mozambican architects. Staff at the national health insti-tute complained that an expatriate was selected for a training consultant vacancy.Besides international staff, the project also employed Mozambican technical and supporthealth, nutrition and population | Mozambique 56personnel. The justification for such a high number of project staff was the lack of institu- tional capacity at the health office, a situation that was supposed to change in the courseof the programme. As there will be no follow-up phase, the employment of such a highnumber of persons has not been cost-effective. This is even more the case for severalinternational missions that were specifically commissioned to formulate the follow-upphase. Delays in implementation, especially at the start of the programme, also negative-ly influenced overall efficiency. The financial administration is transparent and no seriouscases of abuse have been detected. The health programme in Angoche had only limited tangible results and thus low cost- effectiveness. A relatively large part of the budget (40 %) was spent on expatriate staff.Problems with the recruitment of staff, both international and national, occurred duringthe first phase. As a consequence the staff changed frequently, which further influencedthe cost-effectiveness in a negative way. During the first phase the project had two offices,one in Nampula and one in Angoche. Considering the scope of the programme, this wasnot necessary and therefore not efficient. The financial administration is transparent andno irregularities have been detected. The district health project in Erati, Memba and Nacaroa came to a close far earlier than planned, due mainly to serious management problems at the Memisa office. The initialinvestments did thus not bear fruit and the project was not cost-effective. Some technicalexperts continued working for the district after the project was closed down, and theywere financed directly by the Netherlands. The financial administration was transparentand no major problems were revealed. With a relatively limited amount of money, the leprosy programme succeeded in increas- ing the detection and treatment of leprosy patients; it is therefore cost-effective. Thefinancial administration is transparent, providing regular financial reports. However,Mozambican counterparts mentioned a lack of transparency. At local level, there was areport of funds being abused but this could not be verified. Monitoring is done via theyearly visit of a representative from the Dutch implementing NGO- NSL - and a represen-tative of the national tuberculosis and leprosy control programme. Health workers per-ceived this supervision as very supportive. In the drug supply programme, international companies were used for procurement and quality control. We were unable to make a comparison between the costs involved in 57health, nutrition and population | Mozambiqueusing these companies and those that would have resulted from following mechanisms already established in Mozambique and accepted by other donors. At the start of the pro-gramme institutional capacity building was not incorporated in the programme and thishad negative consequences in terms of efficiency. However, at a later stage this compo-nent was introduced successfully. Serious cases of abuse were detected in 1997, especially concerning the distribution of drugs that are not distributed in kits, the so-called 'viaclassica'. A portion of these drugs, which were intended for use in the public sector,ended up in the private sector. In 2000 serious problems with drug distribution in Nampula were detected and staff had to be changed as a consequence. The field study inAngoche showed that essential drugs are not available at health centre level. Abuse stillclearly exists, although the evaluation could not assess at what scale it took place on anational level. The AIDS prevention programme succeeded in gradually decreasing indirect costs for per- sonnel from 50% in the pilot phase to somewhat less than 40% by 1999. By then, only oneexpatriate staff member was employed. As condoms are free and do not figure in the bud-get, it is not possible to estimate the real percentage of personnel costs. The stock andsale of condoms are monitored on a regular basis. The financial administration is trans-parent and yearly audit reports are available. In 1997 a serious case of fraud was detectedby the implementing agency PSI, involving employees of the implementing agency andbank personnel. Adequate measures were taken to avoid repetition. The census project attained its objectives with the funds available. In the provinces reports came in that funds had been used for activities other than planned. An auditreport, issued in May 1999, considered these expenses justified. As the weaning food production programme was not effective, it was not cost-effective either. A large amount of the budget was spent on technical assistance. Various missions were commissioned to modify the plans but failed to take into sufficient considerationthe changing political environment. No problems were apparently detected in the finan-cial administration. The pooling agreement for technical assistance also faced efficiency problems, though of a different order. As the important human resources development component of the pro- gramme was never realised, cost-effectiveness was perforce limited. Although a trust fundaccount existed, UNDP reported separately to the different donors, as per donor require-health, nutrition and population | Mozambique 58ments. This is not an efficient procedure. No irregularities were detected in the financial administration. In conclusion, only a few general observations can be made on the efficiency of the programmes due to their great variation. Three programmes were efficient. Most otherprogrammes and projects showed weaknesses either in cost-effectiveness, management,financial administration transparency or in all of these elements. In some cases the merelack of results influenced the cost-effectiveness. The budget of the programmes and pro-jects was generally sufficient for the activities planned; but these same activities were notalways actualised. In some programmes/projects, funds were made available after a longdelay with negative consequences for cost-effectiveness. In some programmes seriousmanagement problems occurred and in others abuse of funds was detected. 4.6 Sustainability Sustainability has been defined as the potential to retain what has been achieved in theprojects and programmes after withd rawal of the d onor's technical and financial assis- tance. In order to be sustainable, a programme should be integrated into the health sys-tem, be viable and also contribute to the improvement of the system. However, taking thesocio-economic situation of the country into consideration, it is not realistic to expectthat the health system to function without external support in the near future. So, one hasto distinguish between financial sustainability, institutional sustainability and sustain-ability in terms of long term viability. What was remarkable, was that none of the pro-grammes/projects included a strategy for phasing out after the withdrawal of externalfunds. Only two of the nine programmes and projects included in the evaluation were still being implemented when the evaluation was carried out: the drug supply programme and theAIDS prevention programme. Changes in Dutch development co-operation in favour of asector-wide approach influenced the decision not to continue support for the Prindesa,Angoche and the leprosy control programmes. Support for the pooling for technical assis-tance was supposed to be integrated in the sector-wide approach, but at the time of theevaluation this had not yet been realised. Support for the census was temporary by defini-tion and stopped when the census had been concluded. Lack of results led to the termina-tion of two projects: the Memisa district health programme and the local production ofweaning food. 59health, nutrition and population | Mozambiquehealth, nutrition and population | Mozambique 60The sustainability of the basic health programmes and the leprosy programme in Nampula was limited. Prindesa aimed at the institutional strengthening of the healthoffice and attained some sustainable results, such as the realisation of integrated super-vision and the development of participatory planning. On the other hand, in spite of thefirst phase initially being seen as a preparatory one, many investments were not subse-quently given any follow-up. As expectations had been raised that this was a programmeof long-term support to the health sector, no other funding had been sought and no exitstrategy included in the proposal. The financial sustainability: low. The health programme in Angoche faced a similar situation. When it became clear that the programme would not be continued, the implementing agency started to look forother funding- without success. In institutional terms, sustainability varied. The profes-sional capacity of health workers improved; yet lack of a clear Ministry of Health policy oncommunity health prevented the best use being made of village health workers' knowl-edge. Drug supply is inadequate and no proper remuneration is provided to the villagehealth workers, which limits their role in community health. These factors led to adecrease in sustainability. For traditional birth attendants the situation is somewhat dif-ferent, as they are able to apply the knowledge acquired during training. Some of the pro-gramme activities have been incorporated into the district health system or at communitylevel. Others have not, as they were not defined as priorities by the community or byhealth workers. An example of this is health system research. The Memisa district healthproject ended long ago. Some elements are reported to be integrated in the health sys-tem. The overall sustainability though is very low. The leprosy programme contributed to the implementation of a national health pro- gramme and in that sense, sustainability at policy level is guaranteed. It also increasedthe institutional capacity of the health services. In financial terms though, the pro-gramme is not sustainable. After withdrawal of Dutch bilateral funding, the implement-ing agency continued its support to the national programme with its own funds. Given the socio-economic situation, it is not realistic to foresee an adequate drug supply without external funding. However, the Mozambican government has increased its partic-ipation in the procurement and purchase of drugs. In other words the financial sustain-ability of the programme has improved. Attention has been paid to the improvement ofprocedures and mechanisms for administration in the later stages of the programme,contributing to institutional sustainability.61health, nutrition and population | Mozambique The AIDS prevention programme has contributed to increase the importance of HIV/ AIDS in the health and development agenda. The programme is part of the national strategyfor AIDS prevention and control. From a financial point of view though, the programme isnot, and does not aim to be sustainable. As the census is an event that will not be repeated over the short term, financial sustain- ability is not an issue. Mozambique contributed about 10% to the whole exercise. A largenumber of technicians have been trained and they carry out surveys on more specificissues: institutional sustainability is therefore high. For the pooling agreement the situa-tion is less positive. A human resources development plan has never been made and con-sequently the institutional sustainability is low. As yet there has been no transition offunds for technical assistance into the sector-wide approach. 4.7 Impact In this evaluation, impact is defined in terms of likely impact. It is assumed that improve-ments in the structure and performance of the health system, as well as in the healthbehaviour of the population concerned, will lead to a better health status. Health systemstructure is measured by: infrastructure, supplies and the organisation of health care.Health system performance is measured by: the clinical effectiveness of the interventions,the responsiveness of the system and the fairness of the system. Health behaviour is mea-sured by: service utilisation and health practises. For a limited number of programmes included in the evaluation, these issues have been researched in a field study in the Angoche district. Here the international NGO, HealthNet International (HNI), has been implementing a health programme at both servicesand community level over the last five years aimed at improving the quality of care. TheAids prevention programme, the national drug supply programme, the regional leprosycontrol programme and the Nampula health support programme have also beenassessed in the field study. Given that those programmes are of a much wider scope, theresults of the field study are only illustrative for the findings of the document appraisaland key person interviews. As was pointed out before, hardly any baseline data exists andit was therefore difficult to trace changes. The field study is based on: the inspection of the health services interviews with the staff of five health centres and posts i nterviews with community health workers 61 client exit interviews a survey among 101 households. Infrastructure, equipment and organisation of services In very general terms, the structure of the health system in Angoche has been improvedover the last five years. As HNI supported the rehabilitation of some of the health centresand also supplied equipment and means of transport, some of these improvements aredue to their input. However, inspections of the health centres showed that no systematicmaintenance activities are being carried out. Part of the equipment was not functionaland the cleanliness of most centres was found to be sub-standard. The programme'scontribution of one car and two motorbikes has slightly improved the transport picture,but taken overall, the situation is still far from desirable. Maintenance is insufficient and,given the distances that need to be travelled in the district, lack of means of transport andcommunication remains a serious problem. Drug supply at the health centre and community health worker level is weak. On paper, a well-defined system has been worked out for the distribution from the port to Nampula,from Nampula to the districts and from the districts to the health centres and communityhealth workers. However, this is theory and in reality the system is far from working smoothly. At health centre level most pharmacies were empty, with even aspirin andchloroquine not being available. Vaccine availability was also inadequate. The following findings are illustrative: Provision of drugs at Nacala harbour (a coastal town in Nampula province where drugs arrive by boat from Maputo) is rarely on time - this is the first delay in drugprovision to the districts, with further delays occurring at each step in the system.Systematic delay in provision makes control and planning all the more difficult. The quantity of drugs provided is always insufficient; 'reserve' stocks hardly exist at any level of health care. The distribution of drugs to the districts does not function well - mainly due to trans- port problems. There is only one vehicle available for this and it is also used for otherpurposes. This explains the irregular distribution of drugs from the district centre toperipheral health units. When drugs are not supplied, health workers at times takeprivate transport to the district town to fetch the drugs. Recently, a batch of kits was withdrawn because drug quality had deteriorated during transport: Kanamicina with fungus contamination was detected; and the medicineshealth, nutrition and population | Mozambique 6263health, nutrition and population | Mozambique were delivered in different dosages to those specified by the Mozambican health sys- tem. The fact that this failure was detected in timely fashion points to good qualitycontrol. However, the consequences were severe, as kit distribution was suspended. Due to the problems in drug supply and quality, there have been regular interruptions in drug availability over the past four years. During the period of field observation (30May- 5 June 2001), all the health centre pharmacies were virtually empty; even chloro-quine and aspirin were not available. The following matrix summarises the observationsmade. Box 4 Availability of drugs in health centres Rural Hospital of Angoche In April/May 2001, there were ruptures in drug supply lasting at least one week for chloroquine, aspirin, paracetamol and penicillin Health Centre Namitoria In April/May 2001, the health centre only had aspirin and choroqui- ne available, nothing else Health Centre Inguri In February/May 2001 and April/May 2001, for periods of one to two months, only vitamins and ORS were available Health Centre Namaponde In April/May 2001, for the period of two months, only ORS and ferrous sulphate was available The drug supply situation in Angoche seemed to worsen rather than improve over the period 1998-2001; the timeframe during which the Mozambique Essential Drugs pro-gramme received support from Dutch Development co-operation. Community healthworkers reported that on average they received six to eight kits in 1998; only three kits in1999; and only one kit in 2000 and another one in 2001. The last kit supplied in 2001 wasempty after 45 days. A substantial number of training courses for health professionals and community health workers were organised with the support of HNI, Prindesa and the leprosy control pro-gramme. The training materials were adapted to the local situation and made available inthe health facilities; apparently they were barely used. An integrated supervision systemhas been established and some supervision carried out during the last year, though to alesser extent than planned. Health workers appreciate the training and the supervisionand are of the opinion that both their motivation and the quality of their work hashealth, nutrition and population | Mozambique 64improved. However, the lack of equipment, drugs and transport means that they are not getting the most out of their training. The number of consultations and the vaccination coverage are registered at health ser- vices level. Data is provided to the district office but is not used for monitoring. Clinical effectiveness of interventions In the health centres there is hardly any health promotion material available. Preventiveservices for antenatal care and childcare are provided, but as only a few of their clientswere interviewed, the quality of these services could not be assessed. The quality of cura-tive services could be assessed. As a general rule, health workers follow the treatmentnorms and prescribe essential drugs. However, clinical effectiveness is dramatically less- ened by the frequent unavailability of these drugs. Lack of transport hamstrings adequateand timely reactions to obstetric urgencies. Data from a previous survey was used toassess the village health workers' performance at community level. In general terms thisstudy revealed that village health workers do indeed implement the knowledge obtainedduring training and that their role in the community is much appreciated. At the time ofthe evaluation, the absence of a community health policy coupled with a lack of supplieshampered their performance. Responsiveness of the system Clients reported that health workers both approached and treated them with respect. Half of the clients said that they had to wait less than half an hour before being attendedto. The evaluation team had their doubts about these positive results, feeling that anelement of bias might have been introduced by conducting the client interviews at thehealth centres. Fairness of the system Fairness was assessed looking into the prices clients have to pay for consultation and fordrugs. Preventive consultations are free; for curative consultations a symbolic fee has tobe paid. Drugs should be sold at low, established and uniform prices. In general, the fieldstudy revealed that if drugs were available, they could be obtained at the fixed price.However, as drugs hardly ever were available at the health centres, they had to be obtained elsewhere at high cost, either from private pharmacies or on the black market.There are no exemption mechanisms for those who cannot afford to pay the high marketprices. Health behaviour The household survey revealed that the utilisation of public health services among thepopulation is high, a finding that has been confirmed during the visits to the centres.One major reason for this is the relative absence of private sector health care facilities inrural areas of Nampula province. As compiled data was not available, changes over timecould not be ascertained. The majority of women interviewed had their last delivery in a health centre, assisted by a trained midwife. About 40% of the mothers (40/101) expressed the wish for birth spacingand half of them (21/40) used modern contraceptives. Mothers exclusively breastfed their babies until the age of four months, in line with national guidelines. They take their children to the centres for vaccination. However,except for BCG, a large number of children were not completely immunised. In 75 of the 101 household interviews, at least one of the under-fives was found to have been ill in the month preceding the interview. Malaria, cough and diarrhoea were mostfrequently mentioned and some children had more than one illness. The aggregate totalwas 115 episodes of illness. For all children, treatment was sought at the health centre and 73 children received a pre- scription. For two thirds of the children drugs were purchased; only 21 of the 53 house-holds that bought drugs for their children could buy them in the health unit. For adultsthe numbers are somewhat different. Twenty-three adults had been ill during the monthbefore the interview, 22 received a prescription; 21 bought drugs, ten at the health unit. The data on health behaviour confirms the findings of the exit interviews. The population frequents both the health units and the village health workers. Weaknesses in the healthsystem though, especially the lack of drugs and equipment, prevent the provision ofproper quality care. Despite this people continue to visit the health services. The advicegiven is apparently valued and they have few other options. 65health, nutrition and population | Mozambiquehealth, nutrition and population | Mozambique 66Turning to HIV/AIDS, Angoche has been one of the priority areas of the Population Services International (PSI) programme. The extent of preventive knowledge and practicewas assessed in the household survey. Almost all persons interviewed had heard about HIV/AIDS, mostly by radio. Only one per- son interviewed had actually attended the theatre play promoted by PSI as an advocacytool. Knowledge about ways to prevent the disease was rather limited. Slightly more thanhalf the people interviewed recalled preventive means; of which condom use and stayingwith only one partner were most frequently mentioned. Out of the 101 persons inter-viewed, 76 had heard about condoms, 46 knew where to obtain them and 5 had condomsat home at the time of the interview. Focus group discussions confirmed the two elementsof widespread knowledge about HIV prevention and low use of condoms. Men said thatwomen did not want to use condoms and women said the opposite. Utilisation amongthe young is somewhat higher than among older people. Data on health outcomes are not available. Failures in the health system structure, such as lack of drugs and vaccines at services level, hamper the clinical effectiveness of theinterventions and thus the entire performance of the Angoche health system. Given thegenerally weak performance of the health system, it is not likely that programme effortshave led to much progress in this field. 4.8 Conclusion The overall picture of this evaluation is a diverse one. Almost all the programmes met thehealth needs defined by Mozambique and thus potentially contribute to poverty reduc-tion. At the time of their conception, the programmes were also in line with MozambicanBox 5 Health care utilisation, drugs prescription and drug consumption in 101 households Under-fives Adults Sick 75 23 Health centre consulted 75 22 Prescription 73 22 Drugs bought 53 21 Drugs bought in health centre 22 10 67health, nutrition and population | Mozambique health policy and therefore relevant. With regard to effectiveness, most programmes and programmes showed both weaknesses and positive results. Highlights of the national health programmes are: the improved drug management capacity at national level a growing awareness of HIV/AIDS and increased availability of condoms the publication of census results. Highlights in Nampula province are: the improved planning capacity at the provincial health office the improved case management of leprosy patients. Weak points in the national health programmes are: drug leakage in the distribution pipeline and the absence of a human resource development plan. The most importantweakness in the Nampula programmes was that despite serious efforts to improve them,the quality of services still leaves a great deal to be desired. With regard to efficiency, a number of programmes showed but little cost-effectiveness and a few had problems with transparency. As far as sustainability was concerned, someprogrammes- such as the drug supply programme and the Nampula health support pro-gramme- contributed to improved institutional capacity and are considered sustainablein institutional terms. In financial terms, due to the socio-economic situation in thecountry, the situation is less positive. The findings on likely impact, as measured by changes in the structure and performance of the health system performance together with health behaviour, showed some positiveresults. However the health system is still weak, both at services and community level,with lack of drugs remaining the major problem. Impact in terms of improved health out-comes is likely to be very limited.

The Republic of Yemen, as it is knowntoday, was founded in 1990 after the re-unification of the southern and northern parts ofthe country. After a rapid population increase in the early 1990's due to the forced returnof many Yemeni, the country now has about 17 million inhabitants with 75 % of them liv-ing in rural areas. In 1994, a period of civil unrest wrought serious damage on economicand social development nation-wide. After a reconciliation, various administrative, eco-nomic and political reforms were introduced, resulting inter alia in a process of decentral-isation. On the human development index, Yemen is number 133 on a list of 162 countries. In other words, it has a low level of human development. GDP per capita is 350 US$ per yearand over the 1990's, the number of people living in poverty has increased. The literacy rateis about one third for women and two thirds for men. Slightly over two thirds of the popu-lation uses an improved drinking water source and 45 % has access to adequate sanitaryfacilities. 42The major health indicators, summarised in table 8, are unfavourable. Life expectancy is 57 years. Yemen adopted the primary health care approach in 1978, though at the time the country was still divided into South Yemen and North Yemen. In the South, the public health sys-tem was important, whereas in the North, the state was less present in the health sectorand private health providers played an important role. After re-unification in 1990, theprimary health strategy remained in place for several years, however the results itobtained were less than expected. In the 1990's, following the trend in internationalhealth, the need for health sector reform was discussed and in 1998 a health sector reformstrategy was accepted. The health sector document reported a gradual expansion of nation-wide health service coverage from 10 % in 1970 to 50 % in 1998. This was accompanied by a proportional 42 UNDP 2001. health, nutrition and population | Yemen 70 increase in health manpower. However, a number of major problems were observed: deficient service quality, low utilisation of services, low staff morale, lack of essentialdrugs, lack of equity in the distribution of health resources and poor efficiency of organi-sational and managerial structures. 43 Health sector reform takes place within the overall context of government reform,including democratisation, decentralisation, civil service reform and financial restruc-turing. This process will support, and in turn be supported by the health sector reform.The long term objectives of health sector reform are: universal access to health services,equity in both the delivery and financing of health care, improved technical efficiency of the service delivery system, improved quality of health services and the future sustain-ability of the system. Key elements of health sector reform include: decentralisation redefining the public sector's role in a health system environment where the private sector is an important player a district health system approach community co-management of the health system cost sharing an essential drugs policyTable 8 Health indicators Yemen IInnddiiccaattoorr YYeemmeenn YYeeaarr Infant mortality rate (/1000 live births) 86 1999 Under five mortality rate(/1000 live births) 119 1999 Maternal mortality rate (/100.000 live births) 350* 1996 Total fertility rate (amount of children per women) 7,3 1999 Percentage under-fives with underweight (< 2 SD median) 46% 1995-2000 Percentage infants with low birth weight 19% 1995-2000 Annual population grow th 4,6% 1990-1999 Contraceptive prevalence rate 21% 1999 * Data on maternal mortality vary substantially in different sources.

These NGOs are active at local level in the HNP field and include both profit and non-profit models. Their co-ordination apparently takes place on an ad hoc basis. 5.2 Dutch support for health, nutrition and population The Netherlands' support to health, nutrition and population in Yemen has a longhistory, starting in 1978 with the construction of a hospital in Dhamar . Over the period 1995-1999, total aid expenditure amounted to 21.1 million Euros. The Netherlands isamong the three largest bilateral donors in the field of health, nutrition and population.The policy area distribution and the timeline are shown in figures 9 and 10 respectively. Figure 9 Yemen; health, nutrition and population expenditure; distribution over health policy areas Source: MIDAS Primary health care consumes the major part of the aid budget. Since the late 1970's, various health programmes have been supported in rural areas of what was formerlyNorth Yemen, which aim at increasing both the access to and the quality of the health 44 Ministry of Public Health Yemen 1998. 52% 35%9%4% Primary health care Essential drugsReproductive healthOtherhealth, nutrition and population | Yemen 72services. Neither the key person interviews nor the document review allowed for systematic retrospective analysis of the extent to which the Yemeni authorities wereinvolved in developing the programmes' objectives and activity plans. Most programmeswere initiated more than two years before the evaluation and the responsible publichealth officials have since changed jobs. Long negotiations took place prior to mostprogrammes and these were mainly related to procedures. Consequently, it was not possible to analyse if support to other health policy areas or health related areas had been considered as an alternative. Three primary health programmes, two urban and one rural, were implemented in the period 1995-1999 and thus met the criteria for inclusion in the evaluation. The majorobjective of these programmes was to improve the health system, with a special emphasison mother and child care. Activities included the construction and rehabilitation ofhealth infrastructure, mother and child care, the training of health workers and the insti-tutional strengthening of the Health Office. The programmes in Hodeidah and Dhamarwere a follow-up of previous programmes. In the period that these programmes were con-ceived, Dutch policy strongly emphasised the need for comprehensive primary health careprojects in remote areas. A key informant suggested that a health expert of the Ministry ofForeign Affairs take the initiative for these programmes. With respect to the third pro-gramme, the primary health project in Aden, documents on the yearly bilateral negotia-tions between Yemen and the Netherlands indicate that health support for this city hadFigure 10 Yemen; health, nutrition and population expenditure; 4400 Total 21.1 x 1000 010002000300040005000600070008000 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999been under consideration since 1994. However, it was only actually started in 1996. The implementing agency submitted a proposal for funding. Since 1996, the Yemen drug action programme (YEMDAP) has received both technical and financial support, aimed at increasing the availability and rational use of essential drugs.To attain these objectives, interventions included the purchase and distribution of drugs as well as a revision of legal procedures relating to drug supply and consumption. TheYemeni Ministry of Public Health requested Dutch support for the pharmaceutical sector. A long period of negotiations and preparations preceded the actual start-up of the pro-gramme and its subsequent implementation led to a rapid increase in Dutch aid expendi-ture in 1997. GTZ and the World Bank are the other donors to YEMDAP. Since late 1997, a midwife training programme implemented by UNFPA has received Dutch support. The programme has a clear objective, the increase of the number oftrained midwifes. Activities include the development of training material and the trainingitself. Among the other programmes, only one met the criteria for inclusion in the evaluation, namely the support given to mentally ill kept in Yemeni prisons. The objective is theimprovement of their living conditions. Interventions include the rehabilitation ofpremises and the assistance and treatment of patients. Faced with the very poor circum-stances in which the mentally ill are detained in Yemeni prisons, the implementingagency submitted a proposal for funding. None of the programmes and projects included in the evaluation have been implemented under the complete and sole responsibility of the Yemeni authorities. With the exceptionof the midwife training project, there is a strong presence of expatriate technical assis-tance in all programmes and projects. The Hodeidah urban primary health project is afollow-up of a previous project that had been implemented directly by the Dutch bilateraldevelopment co-operation and the same modality was chosen for the second phase.Selection of the private company that has implemented the Dhamar rural health projectwas the result of a bidding procedure. In the Aden urban primary health project, theimplementing agency M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors without Borders) was already inthe area and requested funding. The selection of the private company that is the imple-menting agency in the drug action programme is also the result of a bidding procedure.Long discussions preceded the selection of this procedure, as in 1993 the World Health 73health, nutrition and population | Yemenhealth, nutrition and population | Yemen 74Organisation had already presented a project proposal, including the formulation of a national essential drugs policy, to the Yemeni authorities, the World Bank and theNetherlands. Back then, the Netherlands had expressed their willingness to support it onthe condition that the policy was adopted. However, after a period of negotiations it wasfinally decided not to support the WHO project, but to start a bidding procedure.Eurohealth subsequently became the implementing agency. The midwife training projectis being implemented by UNFPA and the support for the mentally ill prison detainees bythe ICRC. Table 9 summarises the description of the programmes and projects included in the evaluation. 75health, nutrition and population | Yemen 5.3 Relevance All programmes, with the exception of the support for mentally ill detainees in Yemeniprisons, are congruent with the Yemen national health policy in terms of their objectives.They are also congruent with Dutch development co-operation policy in the field ofhealth, nutrition and population. This finding is not surprising, as both policies are verycomprehensive. A change in focus can be observed, which follows policy trends at bothDutch and at international levels. Examples of this are: the importance of cost recovery in 45 The budget is 8 million Euros higher than the amount mentioned in figure 10. In the table expenditure in 1993, 1994 and 2000 is included.

With Dutch development policy moving in the direction of a sector-wide approach, PHC programmeshave been encouraged to integrate their activities within the relevant government healthoffices. The Hodeidah project is a follow-up to a previous project of limited scope, which had been implemented in two neighbourhoods only. Its extension to the whole city was aresponse to the dramatic population increase in Hodeidah, due to the forced re-migrationof Yemenis living abroad. The Dhamar project is also a follow-up to a prior Dutch pro-gramme supporting the Governorate. Informants related that the Yemeni Health Officerequest to include support to the hospital had been denied as this was no longer in linewith Dutch policy. The Aden project was a response to the worsened health structure inAden after the civil unrest in 1994. It was assumed that the project would follow theHodeidah example. YEMDAP was established to address high drug expenditure and the programme integrated into the Yemeni public health care system from the start. Co-operation with other donors has been problematic, with each agency using its own drug supplymechanism. The Community Midwives project was also integrated into the Yemeni public health system from the outset. It meets health needs defined as a priority in the national healthpolicy. The project reflects Dutch commitment to supporting reproductive health careprogrammes. The PHC programmes have also contributed to the improvement of theposition of women and children, in line with Dutch policy on women and development. 5.4 Effectiveness The primary health care programmes had ambitious objectives, which are not easy toimplement in the public health system of a newly-formed State. All programmes are welldocumented with progress reports that could have allowed for adjustments. However, theobjectives were only changed into more feasible ones after an external evaluation hadbeen carried out. The urban PHC project in Hodeidah City has a long history and here the programme has proved to be very effective in increasing access to both basic mother and child care andcurative services. Infrastructure has been upgraded according to plan. Curative serviceshealth, nutrition and population | Yemen 76have been introduced, efforts to make essential drugs available were partially successful and a cost recovery system was put in place. Through the programme a new type of healthworker has been introduced in the health system: the Murshidat, a female health workerwith elementary training. They deliver MCH services at the health centres and pay homevisits to families defined as risk groups. The programme has contributed to the trainingof the Murshidat and, in general terms, the employment of the Murshidat has in turncontributed to the improvement of the quality of services. The efforts to integrate theprogramme in the Hodeidah Health Office met with some success, at least during theperiod of implementation. The HHO was given support for the introduction of planningtools, such as a health information system. Overall the effectiveness of the Hodeidah pro-gramme was good. The details on health system performance presented in the paragraphon impact confirm this finding. The other two PHC programmes have been less successful in terms of strengthening the health system. In Dhamar, the programme did not result in the improvement of the ruralhealth system, its major objective. Various factors impeded the realisation of the objec-tives and the implementation of planned activities. In 1994, not long after the effectivestart of the programme, civil unrest hampered further implementation and only after rec-onciliation could the activities start anew. During the first phase, too much emphasis wasplaced on applied research and on the introduction of new concepts with the result thatservice quality did not much improve. After a midterm evaluation in 1996, it was decidedto reduce the number of districts and to focus on more tangible health interventions,including the introduction of a 'fee for services' system at local level. Support for repro-ductive health was also strengthened by a series of measures which included the con-struction and fitting-out of a centre for reproductive health and a Women's Union centrein Dhamar City. Document review, key person interviewing, a visit to a rural health centre, a rural health post, the Dhamar reproductive health centre and the Women's Centre in Dhamar revealeda mixed picture. On the positive side, a substantial number of female health workers(Murshidat) and other health professionals have been trained. The reproductive healthcentre is working very well and, with about 300 clients per day, utilisation is high. Thepolitical participation of women has increased. The Women's Union centre receives over one hundred women per day for training activities. The major weakness is the inadequatequality of care in rural areas and the failure of efforts to co-operate with the Health Office.Clients' utilisation of rural health centres is very low, with a mean of three persons per 77health, nutrition and population | Yemenhealth, nutrition and population | Yemen 78day per centre. The local 'fee for services' system is not functioning as it should, nor is the national drug policy yet being properly implemented in the health centres. In conclusion, the overall effectiveness of the Dhamar rural health programme is low, with some important positive exceptions. The major objective of the programme, theimprovement of the health system in rural areas, has not been attained. However, in thetwin fields of reproductive health and the empowerment of women, important resultshave been obtained in Dhamar city. In Aden the programme has completed the rehabilitation of all but two health centres according to plan. All polyclinics and health centres are functioning normally. An exemp-tion system has been established and is functioning effectively. However, key person interviews revealed that the foregoing efforts have not been adequately co-ordinated withexisting health care structures and this hampers overall effectiveness. For example, theimplementing agency is providing drugs through its own mechanism, which impedes aproper implementation of the drug policy established at national level. This lack of inte-gration in the health system is all the more noteworthy given that it occurred at a timewhen Dutch health and development policy had already shifted towards a sector-wideapproach. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the Aden programme is limited. Other programmes and projects supported by the Netherlands include YEMDAP, the training of community midwives, and the assisting of mentally ill detainees in prisons.Generally the overall objectives were too ambitious. All programmes and projects are welldocumented with progress reports allowing for plan adjustment. In the Yemen Drug Action Programme (YEMDAP), there was a lack of balance in the objectives, with too much emphasis on drug procurement, legislation and distributionand too little on rational drug use. A national drug policy has since been formulated andan essential drugs list and treatment guidelines published and distributed. In January1999 three key decrees were adopted relating to the drug fund, cost sharing and hospitalautonomy. A mechanism for drug procurement was set up and a first batch of drugsworth 4.1 million Euros distributed to regional warehouses. However, problems thenoccurred further down the line which led to inadequate distribution to the health centresthemselves. In part, this was due to implementation delays and to a budgetary reductionin the World Bank contribution. 79health, nutrition and population | Yemen The evaluation team was unable to systematically verify the proper and successful distri- bution of drugs to the periphery. The field study in Hodeidah however, revealed that theavailability of essential drugs in the main centres was good but inadequate in the sub-centres. In the rural health centre visited in Dhamar, the pharmacy was not well-organ-ised nor was the national essential drugs policy being implemented properly. A second batch of drugs also worth 4.1 million Euros was used as start-up 'capital' for the newly established revolving drug fund. This fund decentralises the overall drugs budgetand specifies the budget for each level of care by region. Health centres are then able touse their budget to buy drugs which they then sell on to recover the costs. Key personinterviewing revealed that the successful implementation of the drug fund will be a diffi-cult process. Relatively little attention has been paid to rational drug use activities. Educational interventions included a course on rational pharmaceutical therapy for university staff.Schoolbooks on rational drug use were published and public information materialsdeveloped on drug use in pregnancy. Despite these efforts, inadequate drug prescriptionamong health providers and over-spending on non-essential drugs, especially in theprivate sector, are still common. To summarise the findings: in the area of procurement and legislation YEMDAP has been effective; in the area of distribution and rational drug use, the effectiveness has beenlimited. With respect to the community midwives, by February 2001 all the curricula had been pre- pared and 724 midwives were undergoing training. Specific training material had beendeveloped for both the teachers and the trainees, though a midterm evaluation revealedsome weaknesses in it. It was considered too complex and too theoretical and a revisionof the content was recommended. Another weakness of the programme resided in thefact that the newly-trained midwives are not guaranteed employment. Only one third ofthe midwives trained in 1999 subsequently found a job in the public sector. Finally, theproject would have been more effective had it included the strengthening of nationalinstitutions in charge of health professionals' training. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the project varied. The project aiming at the improvement of living conditions for mentally ill patients kept in the Yemeni prisons of Sana'a, Taiz and Ibbs had well defined objectives, which havegenerally been attained. Document review, key person interviewing and a visit to Sana'aprison revealed that the living conditions in the wards for mentally ill detainees hadindeed improved. A number of Red Crescent volunteers are accompanying the mentally illand providing care on a daily basis. Most patients receive medical treatment, though notalways with the drugs best suited to their individual condition, and most of them have re-established contact with their families. As the project largely achieved its objectives, it was considered effective. Summarising the findings: in the urban primary health care programme in Hodeidah and in the project for the mentally ill detainees in prison, most objectives were attained.These programmes have thus been effective. The Yemen Drug Action Programme achieved considerable results. However, due to the difficult political environment created by the importance of the private sector, the objective of rational drug use was far frombeing met. The other three programmes have shown some positive results and somemajor weaknesses. 5.5 Efficiency Efficiency is to be understood on the basis of three criteria: cost-effectiveness, manage-ment and the transparency of the financial administration. Included in the assessment ofcost-effectiveness are the budgetary lines allocated to cover expatriate and national pro-jects staff costs. The Hodeidah programme has led to a sustainable upgrading of the primary health care system at a cost of about 2.5 US$ per person per year, if the whole population is taken as beneficiaries. About 20 % of the budget was spent on expatriate staff and about 4 % onlocal staff. No major problems have been reported regarding programme management.The financial administration was transparent and no irregularities were detected. TheHodeidah programme can thus be seen to have been efficient. The Dhamar health programme had work plans that were neither feasible nor directly targeted at the major objectives of the programme. This can partly be explained by themore difficult rural environment in which this programme operated. In comparison withthe Hodeidah and Aden programmes, a higher proportion of the budget was spent onstaff and missions in this programme: 40-50 % during the first phase of implementationhealth, nutrition and population | Yemen 80and 30% during the second phase. Considerable difficulties were reported in programme management, including high staff turnover and a serious problem was detected in thefinancial administration during the first phase of implementation. This led to staff being replaced. Adding up these factors, the Dhamar programme was found to beinefficient. The Aden PHC programme appeared to have missed opportunities to build on experience and expertise in the existing health system, thus limiting the cost-effectiveness. 20 % ofthe budget was spent on expatriate staff. Greater use of local resources would haveenhanced the efficiency of the programme. The financial administration was transparentand no irregularities were revealed. Overall, a programme of limited efficiency. The budget for YEMDAP can be split into two parts: work programme (20%) and drug pur- chase (80%). The funds earmarked for the work programme have been used for a widerange of activities that by and large were carried out according to plan. The remainder ofthe budget was spent buying two batches of drugs. YEMDAP documents do not provide information on the efficiency of drug distribution. Key informants suggested that there were logistical problems. The second batch of drugswas used as an initial investment in the newly created revolving drug fund, which has thepotential to encourage a more efficient use of donor support. As the fund has only recent-ly started, its efficiency could not be assessed. Expatriate staff and related costs accountfor approximately 60 % of the budget for the work programme. This relatively high pro-portion is felt to be justified, given that the implementation of an essential drugs pro-gramme is a complex and difficult undertaking, with many stakeholders in the pharma-ceutical sector having a material interest in impeding the prescription and use ofessential drugs. In the words of one key informant: \"Many people are working hard to getthe drug fund functioning, and as many are working hard to impede its implementation\".Programme management was good and the financial administration transparent. In con-clusion, though weaknesses in cost-effectiveness were revealed, the programme is con-sidered efficient. In the Community Midwife Training programme the funds have been used to implement the planned activities. However, past experience acquired in the field of midwife trainingwas not sufficiently taken into consideration. Objective and adequate analysis of thatexperience could have led to a different approach that would have strengthened the 81health, nutrition and population | Yemenhealth, nutrition and population | Yemen 82capacities in the national Health Manpower Institutes. Such an approach would have been more efficient. Management and supervision guidelines have been prepared and asuccessful monitoring system has been established. The financial administration waswell organised and did not reveal problems. In conclusion, the efficiency of this pro-gramme is limited. The budget for the project to support mentally ill detainees in Yemeni prisons was also spent according to plan. Project management was good, the financial administrationtransparent and no problems were revealed. The project was efficient. In summary, three programmes- the Hodeidah urban primary health programme, the drug action programme and the mentally ill support programme- were seen to be effi-cient. The Dhamar rural health programme was judged inefficient and the efficiency ofthe Aden primary health programme and the midwife training programme was felt to belimited. 5.6 Sustainability The Hodeidah urban primary health care project ended in September 2000. Evaluation isthus revelatory of how sustainable project-initiated improvements in the health systemwere, eight months after the withdrawal of external funding. In general, health improve-ments in the functioning of the health system are still visible, though the budget for run-ning costs has diminished rapidly. The programme had theoretically developed a good'exit strategy' involving the integration of the programme into Hodeidah Health Office(HHO). However, most of the well-paid staff moved to other jobs when this planned inte- gration actually took place. At present, a new project is being implemented by a privatecompany that was selected after a bidding procedure. This project aims at healthimprovement in the rural environment. Key persons are of the opinion that the projectdoes not sufficiently build upon the experience acquired in the Hodeidah urban pro-gramme. In summary, the sustainability at institutional and financial level is limited. In terms of service delivery, sustainability at policy level is high. The Dhamar programme had also ended by the time of this evaluation. At present the health office in the Governorate is receiving budgetary support. The sustainability of theprogramme varies by component. New elements introduced by the programme havebarely proved sustainable, even if introduced within the framework of health reforms. On the other hand, the empowerment of women and their increased participation inpublic services and local policy have proved to be sustainable, though only in policy and institutional terms, not in financial terms. The Aden PHC programme is still ongoing. It has contributed to a better organisation of the health system, ensuring sustainability. On the other hand, key informants reveal alack of co-ordination with the Aden Health Office, thus reducing sustainability. A recentmid-term evaluation recommended better integration within the AHO. YEMDAP's financial sustainability depends on the effective operations of the drug fund and the enhanced training of health workers. It cannot therefore be assessed. The intro-duction of reforms in drug legislation point to sustainability at policy and institutionallevel. The midwife training programme has opted for rural training centres attached to commu- nity health centres. These training facilities are not formally recognised by the Yemen health care system. As long as these centres are not linked to the Health ManpowerInstitutes, the sustainability of the programme has to be questioned. After its conclusion, the mentally ill Y emeni prison detainees project has received other external funding. The involvement of the Yemeni authorities in the improvement of thedetainees' living conditions is still rather limited, which reduces sustainability at policyand institutional level. Summarising the findings, none of the programmes or projects that have come to an end are felt to be fully sustainable either in institutional or financial terms. In policy termsthough, Hodeidah has been sustainable. YEMDAP is potentially sustainable, both ininstitutional and financial terms. The ADEN primary health programme and the midwifetraining programme at present do not have potential to become sustainable in institu-tional or financial terms. However, the implementation of recent midterm evaluationrecommendations might make them more sustainable. 5.7 Impact As health is defined by an array of different factors, it is not possible to precisely deter-mine the impact of the health programmes and projects in terms of the prevention anddecline of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, for the purposes of this evaluation, theirlikely impact is being interpreted through intermediate and associated factors: the effects 83health, nutrition and population | Yemenon the structure and the performance of the health system and the effects on health behaviour. A field study to this end was carried out in Hodeidah. Results refer only to the Hodeidah Urban Primary Health Project and to the Yemen Drug Action Programme. Thefindings though, be they positive or negative, may not necessarily be directly due to theprogrammes/projects. Other players in the health system doubtless exert an influence,such as the private sector that plays such a dominant role. The study is based on inspection and interviews with the staff of thirteen of Hodeidah's fifteen health centres, 140 client exit interviews and consultation observations, and a sur-vey among 120 households. Infrastructure, equipment and organisation of services Primary health care in Hodeidah City is provided through a network of fifteen healthcentres, with this study dealing with thirteen of them (three main and ten sub-centres).These centres cover the entire city and they were all upgraded during phase II of the pro-gramme, which targeted the setting-up of this city-wide health service coverage. Two tofour sub-centres are linked to each main centre, which provides supervision and technicalsupport to the sub-centres and act as a referral point for them. The total population ofHodeidah City - over 330 thousand inhabitants - is the catchment population for thisnetwork of health centres. The overall hygienic and physical conditions of the health centres are adequate. Basic medical equipment and furniture, fans and air conditions are available and well main-tained. Almost all clients have expressed their satisfaction with cleanliness and ventila-tion. All health centres are sufficiently equipped with refrigerators for the storage ofvaccine as well as iceboxes. Vaccination protocols, cards and records are available in allcentres and have been adequately used in all observed consultations. Essential drugs areavailable in the main health centres. In general, drug availability is inadequate in thesub-centres the (see box 6 on essential drugs). The impact of efforts to establish a health information system was reflected in the well- structured system of data recording, processing and reporting that is still functioning inall health centres. However, inadequacy and inaccuracy in reporting and feed back havebeen observed. health, nutrition and population | Yemen 8485health, nutrition and population | Yemen Clinical effectiveness of interventions The services provided by the health centres cover health promotion and preventive andcurative services. Female health workers, trained by the project, are the main providers ofPHC in health centres and at the same time provide a link between the health system andthe community. A total of 132 Murshidat have been trained throughout the period of theprogramme. Home visiting is a unique feature of the Hodeidah urban PHC project. A monthly schedule is planned for home visits in the catchment area around each health centre.During the visit, the Murshidat give information to the family about the health servicesprovided at the health centre and encourage them to appropriately utilise the availableservices. At the same time they identify families at risk according to specified criteria andprovide suitable advice. Visiting has continued after the end of the project, though not asregularly as before. Observations revealed that all children under five are weighed at every visit. However, growth monitoring cards are often not available and the nutritional status of the childand its implications are not sufficien tly well explained to the mother. Observations of consultations also revealed that protocols for treatment are available, but that they arenot used. Though essential drugs are available in the main health centres, these drugsare not much prescribed. Trade marks are much more used than generic drugs. The find-ings on essential drugs are summarised in box 6.

However, patient observations revealed that manyhealth workers lack communication skills. Key person interviewing revealed that contraceptives are only given to women accompa- nied by their husbands. This behaviour on the part of health workers is not in line with theconcept of reproductive rights, as defined at the International Conference on Populationand Development. Fairness of the system Community participation in the management of health resources is an importantcontribution of the Hodeidah urban PHC project. It started in 1995 through the formationof Local Health Committees (LHCs). At present, the LHCs are actively involved in themanagement of fee-for-service revenues in all health centres and finance around 75 % ofthe running costs, with the exception of the salary costs of the professional and technicalstaff. The remaining 25 % are covered by the health office. All clients have to pay fees forservices, as well as the cost of drugs and laboratory tests, irrespective of their socio-eco-nomic status. The absence of an exemption system constitutes a real threat for manyhouseholds and restricts their access to primary health care. This situation deterioratedafter the programme ended. With decreasing home visits by the murshidat, there was cor-respondingly less detection of families at risk. Health behaviour Breastfeeding is a common practice among mothers in Hodeidah and it is encouraged bythe health education programme. There are various supplementary or weaning foodsavailable in Hodeidah, with most women choosing to give additional liquids to their chil-dren in the form of juices, soup and/or yoghurt. The household survey indicated the pop-ularity of health centre services among mothers of pre-school children. Weighing and vaccination are usually provided in the same visit, showing similar utilisation figures(94%) for the youngest child in the household. In general, people's attitude towards vac-cination is positive, and not one mother was found who did not have her child vaccinatedagainst the major preventable child diseases. Even if she was afraid of injections, and may87health, nutrition and population | Yemen Table 10 Vaccination coverage 1996-2000 Years BCG DPT /Polio M easles Absolute % Absolute % Absolute % 1996 7450 47 HHO, statistics department, 2000 thus choose to forego a TT vaccination for herself, she still brought her child to the health centre for immunisation. The household survey revealed very high vaccination coverageamong children under five, ranging from 82 to 100 %. Table 10 shows the vaccination coverage in the period of implementation of the second phase of the Hodeidah programme. Vaccination coverage had increased substantiallyduring the first phase. The levels have been sustained and even somewhat improved dur-ing the second phase. Of the respondent mothers, 100 out of 120 (84 %) had been to the health centres for ante- natal care during their last pregnancy; and 104 (87 %) of them have had tetanus toxoidvaccine. The majority of the mothers (98/120) expressed the wish for birth spacing andabout one third of these women (31/98) used modern contraceptives. The health centresare the main source for contraceptive methods with 27 out of 31 (87 %) women who usedcontraceptives obtaining them from the health centres. In contrast to the high utilisation of preventive services, the utilisation of curative services is rather low. Most respondents in the household survey perceived public services as infe-rior in this respect. Furthermore, mothers often did not follow the health worker's advice.Box 7 presents an overview of the health seeking behaviour of the mothers included in thehousehold survey.health, nutrition and population | Yemen 88Box 7 Health seeking behaviour in Hodeidah City: public health centres are one of several treatment options Most commonly reported childhood illnesses in the household studies were respiratory infections/cough (34 percent of total episodes reported in the past two weeks), diarrhoea (28 percent of episodes), andmalaria (6 percent of episodes). Women rated the condition as being severe/dangerous or not severe,and described their health seeking behaviour. From their illness recalls, various treatment choices mani-fest themselves and were categorised. In below table the percentage episodes treated using the differenttreatment options are summarised for the most common childhood disorders: malaria, diarrhoea, andARI.

The table shows that overall self-care is the predominant form of treatment. Home remedies are often used. Public health centres are visited inabout the same percentage of the episodes as private health providers. There are differences in treatmentseeking behaviour for the different types of illness problems. To assess impact of improved quality ofcare on public health centres on health seeking behaviour it is useful to present the observed patterns indetail: Sixteen of the above recorded 34 diarrhoea cases were perceived to be non-severe by the mothers; the stu- dies showed that non-pharmaceutical, non-medical home treatment consisting of specific foods (starchor rice with yoghurt or water), and an increase in liquids and/or breast feeding are common treatmentsfor these non-severe diarrhoea cases. The mothers do not mention pre-packaged ORS as therapy. Onlyone out of 16 respondents whose child reportedly had non-severe diarrhoea went to see the doctor of thepublic health centre. The doctor did not prescribe ORS, and requested a stool test for amoeba.Serious cases of diarrhoea show an even wider array of home treatments (variety of juices, teas, cumin, mareimara against fever), along with pharmaceuticals (including ready-made ORS and antibiotics). It is popular to have some pharmaceuticals at home for the treatment of diarrhoea. These are obtainedwithout prescription from local groceries. They are taken according to perceived need unrelated to visi-ting professional health care providers. In cases perceived serious, people tend to visit both public healthcentres and private providers and spend an additional amount in buying pharmaceuticals, generallyfrom private pharmacies, costing YER 600-1000. For cough cases home treatments are plenty, ranging from warmth therapy (wax cream/henna on hair, additional clothing, covering child, hot drinks) to specific drink and balm treatments (tamr hindi,murr, sesame syrup). Home treatment with pharmaceuticals is used in severe and non-severe cases. A variety of pharmaceutical cough drugs are stocked in most households (vicks balm, cough drops, cough syrup, analgesic syrup). They are obtained from local pharmacies or they are leftovers of anearlier prescription. Cough symptoms (continuos cough, sound coming from chest) are a trigger formothers to seek help of professional health providers. Treatment choice in these severe cases includevisiting the public health centre and paying a maximum of YER450 for drugs (purchased from aprivate pharmacy), and visiting hospitals and private providers with a drug expenditure of YER 150-2000. The seven recorded cases of Malaria, were all perceived serious; four were brought to public health centres or private practitioners at an early stage for a confirmation of diagnosis (malaria test). Drugtreatment is relatively cheaper than for other predominant child diseases (350-500 YER), because ofthe low cost of chloroquine, the preferred treatment. Waiting to see if the condition persisted is another type of health seeking behaviour. In FGD they explained that, at times, children get better without any treatment (including home treatment), andthat in general people have little money to afford expensive treatment (professional health care). If thefinancial situation is very poor, and their health seeking behaviour is limited to free or inexpensivetreatment options, it occurs that children die from untreated complications of the condition. Earlytreatment is one of the health efforts specified by mothers, yet it is also dependent on the accessibility ofhealth care providers. Poor people perceive themselves as being excluded from care at the health centres,because they cannot afford the user-fees. Rational drug use is indeed impeded by the general poor economic situation in the area. Given rational drug prescriptions, the clients may decide to purchase only some of the drugs on the prescription, 89health, nutrition and population | Yemenhealth, nutrition and population | Yemen 90depending on their resources. There is not enough understanding among consumers that rational thera- py may necessitate the combination of drugs prescribed, and their use according to prescription.Informal observation confirmed the practice that mothers did not comply to the health provider's adviceto e.g. finish the prescribed amount of drugs even if symptoms disappear meanwhile, or to administerthe drugs at times specified. Rational drug use also involves good communication between health pro-vider and client which, as shown throughout the Hodeidah field study, is not always the case. The afternoon curative sessions in the public health centres denote an improvement for patients, and an additional option for treatment. However, in case of emergency, health centres are of limited accessibili-ty. Nowadays, health centres are considered a first stop for treatment, compared to other health optionsthey are still perceived of inferior quality. In spite of the health centre's accessibility and their expertiseon MCH services, people tend to seek the (additional) advice of paediatricians, or other private healthproviders. Going to a private health provider or hospital denotes greater effort and cost, and is particu-larly set out in severe cases requiring immediate action. General customer satisfaction also is higherafter such visit as most recall that the child recovered shortly after the therapy, while visiting publichealth centre did not show an immediate, significant change in the child condition. Health outcomes Data on health outcomes are not available. It is likely that the improved use of preventiveservices have had some positive effects. Summarising the findings from the field study: positive results were observed in terms of the strengthening of the health system structure. The performance of the system, mea-sured by the criteria of clinical effectiveness, responsiveness and fairness, varies. The clin-ical effectiveness of preventive services is satisfactory but that of the curative services isnot. Responsiveness is good. Fairness was felt to be adequate during the implementationof the programme but was not sustained. Health behaviour also varies. Mothers under-take considerable efforts to prevent death and disease among their young children.However, once these children do fall ill, their subsequent treatment is not adequate. 5.8 Conclusion The overall picture of the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the pro-grammes and projects included in the evaluation is mixed. The Hodeidah urban healthproject had positive results on almost all criteria. However, the institutional strengthen- ing of the health office proved not to be sustainable. The support for mentally ill patients91health, nutrition and population | Yemen kept in Yemeni prisons, a bit of an outsider compared to the other programmes, also showed good results. The other projects and programmes varied. YEMDAP was verysuccessful in the procurement of drugs and in the adaptation of drug legislation. Thedistribution of drugs though was much less successful and rational drug use was notadequately addressed. Dhamar was neither effective, efficient nor sustainable. However,some very positive results were obtained in the fields of reproductive health and empow-erment of women. The Aden urban primary health project and the midwife training pro-ject both lacked good integration with existing structures, limiting their effectiveness,efficiency and sustainability. Health impact has been only assessed in Hodeidah, and thisthrough a number of intermediate factors. In the areas of health promotion, preventionand community participation, major positive results have been obtained. Curative carethough is not adequately provided in the public system and drugs are not used rationally.The overall conclusion is summarised in the following table.health, nutrition and population | Yemen 92 Table 11 Summary of evaluation results in Yemen Programme Highlights Relevance Effectiveness Efficiency Sustainability Impact and weak points Hodeidah sIncreased access to and use ++ ++ urban health of preventive MCH servicesproject sIntroduction of female community health worker tInstitutional strengthening not sustained Dhamar rural sConstruction of reproductive ++ NA primary health health centreproject tInadequate quality of care in rural areas tInadequate integration in health office Aden urban sRehabilitation of infrastructure ++ \u00b1 \u00b1 ? * NA primary health tCo-ordination with public care project health authorities Yemen drug sDrug supply and legislation ++ \u00b1 + ? ** \u00b1*** action tInadequate drug distribution programme and irrational drug use Community sMidwives trained ++ \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 NA midwife tTraining material Support for sLiving conditions and ++ ++ \u00b1 NA mentally ill treat ment improved in Yemeni tNo institutional support prisons * The rating is a question mark because it depends on the implementation of the results of a recent mid-term evaluation ** The rating is a question mark, because it depends on the functioning of the recently installed drug fund *** Impact only measured in HodeidahNA: not applicable93health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 6 Burkina Faso 6.1 Health situation and health policy Burkina Faso is located in the Sahel zone. The country has about 10 million inhabitants,with over 80% living in rural areas. The climate is unfavourable and the recurrent periodsof severe drought seriously hamper agricultural production. On the human development index, Burkina Faso ranks number 159 on a list of 162 coun- tries. GDP per capita is US$ 240 per year and an estimated 60% of the population live inextreme poverty. The literacy rate for men is 34% and for women only 10%. Data is lackingon what percentage of the population have access to an improved drinking water sourcein rural areas. About 33% of the population have adequate sanitary facilities. Average life expectancy is 54 years. The most important health indicators, summarised below in table12, are unfavourable.

Since 1979, primary health care (PHC) has been the cornerstone of the national health policy. A ten year plan (1980-1990) was drawn up to develop a network of facilities, but itfaced numerous problems during implementation, such as: the identification of villagehealth workers to staff the health posts in the periphery (PSP), a lack of essential drugsand difficulties with the integration of vertical health programmes in the basic healthservice. health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 94In 1992 a number of health reforms were introduced and, as of 1993, emphasis was placed on decentralised district health care. By 1996, fifty-three sanitary districts hadbeen established around a hospital or a health centre with surgical facilities. The overallprocess of health reform aimed at strengthening the peripheral health services andinvolving the community in their management. To this end, the necessary legal proce- dures were adopted to allow for the districts' autonomy in planning and management. At the same time, considerable efforts have been undertaken to improve general healthservice performance. A list of drugs was established that should normally be available ateach health service level. Clients were to pay fees for services and for essential drugs. The primary health posts were no longer considered part of the health system. In 1998 the Ministry of Health launched a process which sought to formulate a national health policy. By the end of 2000, two health policy documents were completed, definingthe priorities for 2001-2003: disease control, improvement of the quality of care and insti-tutional strengthening of the Ministry of Health. By mid 2001, these documents wereadopted. 46 The budget of the Ministry of Health, including external financing, accounts for about10% of total public expenditure. 47The most important external donors in the area of health, nutrition and population (HNP) are the European Union, France, Belgium,Germany and the Netherlands. The World Bank supports a HIV/AIDS programme andWHO, UNICEF and UNFPA are also represented. In addition, a number of internationalNGOs are active in the field of health or related areas. At national level, co-ordinationmechanisms have been established, such as the yearly conference for the health partnersof the Ministry of Health. Bilateral donors are active in different regions. Some nationalprogrammes, such as the tuberculosis control programme, receive support from variousdonors. 6.2 Dutch support fot health, nutrition and population Dutch bilateral development co-operation in Burkina Faso has a 25-year history. Untilrecently, integrated rural development in several areas of the country formed the corner-stone of this co-operation. At present, bilateral co-operation is concentrated in threeareas: rural development, basic education and health. 46 Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 Burkina Faso 2001. 47 Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 Burkina Faso 2001. Specific support for health, nutrition and population started with selective primary health care interventions implemented by NGOs. There were no formal co-ordination mecha-nisms between the programmes that received support. During the 1990's, the basichealth interventions became more comprehensive and increasingly integrated in govern-mental structures. Since 1998, a sector-wide approach has become the guiding principlefor bilateral co-operation. At the time of the evaluation, Dutch support for the Kaya pro-gramme was coming to an end and it had not yet been decided if, and in which form, sup-port should be continued. A number of national health programmes also received sup-port. In the period covered by this evaluation, 5.8 million Euros was spent. The Netherlands are among the three most important bilateral donors. Figures 11 and 12 show the distributionamong the different policy areas and the changes over time. Figure 11 Burkina Faso; HNP expenditure; distribution of Dutch bilateral aid over policy areas, 1995-1999 Source: Midas A basic health programme in Kaya (PASSK), implemented by a Dutch NGO, accounts for 40% of the budget. This programme started in the 1980's as a small project aimed at increasing vaccination coverage in three districts (Bam, Yatenga and Sanmantenga). A key informant suggested that the choice of these districts was probably not a coinci-dence, because at the time, a Dutch priest was running a number of small social develop-ment projects in the area. 95health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 24%13%11%14% 38%Primary health care Essential drugsDisease controlReproductive healthOtherhealth, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 96Gradually the project expanded to become a basic health programme for the whole Kaya sanitary region and the focus took on a more institutional nature, aiming at both thestrengthening of planning and management at district level, and community participa-tion in periphery health centre management. Some elements of the programme, such ascommunity involvement in services management, have set an example for national healthreform. Special attention is given to mother and childcare. The Dutch NGO started as the implementing agency and it now provides technical assis- tance when so requested by the district health authorities. The NGO still administratesthe project budget. The national tuberculosis programme (PNLT) has been receiving Dutch financial support since 1995. France is another donor to the programme. Its twofold aim is to increasetuberculosis case finding and directly observed multi-drug treatment (DOTS). It shouldbe recalled that in 1994, the Ministry of Health was confronted with a situation analysisthat pointed to inadequate detection and treatment of the disease. This was a threateningsituation- as the tuberculosis prevalence was itself due to an increase in HIV infections-and thus led to the Ministry of Health requesting support for the programme. At the timeof the evaluation preparations were underway for its continuation.

In addition to Dutch support, it has receivedfinancial contributions from the World Bank, the European Union and France. Burkina Faso contributed in kind. The programme aims at increasing the availability of essentialdrugs in the periphery at a reasonable price. As the availability of drugs is a necessarycondition for basic health care to function properly, this programme tends to support theKaya initiative. In the field of reproductive health, three programmes met the criteria for inclusion in the evaluation. Two are smaller projects, implemented by NGOs. One of these projects was a study in reproductive health needs and the executing agency, a Burkinab\u00e9 NGO linked toIPPF, requested the funding. The other project aimed at introducing reproductive health into the curriculum of the National School of Public Health. Document review and keyperson interviewing could not reveal who took the initiative for this project. The third pro-gramme relates to the national UNFPA programme and is more comprehensive. Startingin 1993, it included three different projects aimed respectively at: the decentralisation ofreproductive health services, the promotion of socio-sanitary activities, and information,education and communication. This was a follow-up to previous support given to UNFPA. In meetings with the Ministry of Health, the Netherlands expressed a strong interest to continue support in the field of reproductive health. At the time of the evaluation, prepa-rations were being made to support an HIV/AIDS prevention and control programme. The programmes included in the evaluation were conceived and initiated several years before this evaluation. Document review and key person interviewing were unable toreveal whether consideration had ever been given to provide support to alternative healthpolicy or related areas.

They are also in ine with Dutch international co-operationpolicy in the field of HNP. This finding should not surprise, as both policies are very com-prehensive. Each programme is assessed to the extent in which it relates to Burkina Fasohealth policy. The support for basic health care in Kaya has been instrumental to the development of the district health concept throughout the whole country. Important principles, such asdecentralisation, the autonomy of health districts, community participation and cost-recovery, have all been applied in the Kaya programme. Over time, the programme hassmoothly adapted to changes in the administrative organisation of the country. Key in-formants reported that Kaya serves as an example to other health regions. Both the tuberculosis control programme and the support given to the central agency for drug supply are national programmes- and as such in line with national policy. Reproductive health is also listed as a priority in the national health policy. However, when Dutch support for UNFPA started in 1992, a strategy for reproductive health had notyet been determined; UNFPA was a major contributor to its development when the time came. A key informant at the Ministry of Health subsequently told us that though severalstrategies for policy implementation had been defined, they had never led to properimplementation. The two smaller reproductive health projects relate to research and training and hence are potentially supportive of policy implementation at national level. However, we were unable to verify if this really was the case or not. Several key informants reported a lack ofcommunication between the public sector and private organisations in the field of repro-ductive health. 6.4 Effectiveness Effectiveness was assessed by analysing to what extent the objectives of the programmesand projects were attained. The support to the Kaya primary health programme (P ASSK) led to a considerable improvement in accessibility to, and in the quality of, the health ser-vices. However, client utilisation of these services is still very low. 99health, nutrition and population | Burkina FasoDue to the construction and the rehabilitation of infrastructure, more people have access to health services. Health facilities increased from one per 16 thousand inhabitants in1995 to one per 13 thousand inhabitants in 1999. The Kaya programme has also con-tributed to a better organisation of the health system. At district level, operational plansare made every four months and generally the activities have been carried out accordingto plan. A minimal packet of basic health services has been defined and treatment guide-lines distributed. Monitoring and supervision of the health services is done on a regularbasis. At health centre level, a structure has been established for community involvementin health facility management. Despite all these improvements, observations indicated only a slight increase in take-up of the health facilities (CSPS) by the local population. When one takes into considerationthe target population of a health care facility and the expected morbidity, client utilisa-tion is seen to be very low. The household survey revealed that people in remote villageswere satisfied with the quality of the health services. However, due to the long distancesinvolved and lack of means of transport, the truth is that they hardly ever use them. In thevillages, a village health worker is generally available and sometimes a peripheral healthpost (PSP). These structures are remnants from the previous health policy and no longerpart of the official health system. The Kaya programme does not provide support to thesestructures and the quality of care is very low. The paragraph about impact will providemore details. By the distribution of proper technical guidelines and the training of personnel, the NPLT programme contributed to tuberculosis control becoming better organised. However itdid not lead to the expected increase in case finding and treatment. The original objectivein 1995 was to increase case finding from 25% to 50% by 1997. This objective proved tooambitious and was reduced several times. Currently, for the period 2000-2004, the aim isa yearly increase of 10%. From 1996-1999, case detection showed only a slight increase,from 26.8% to 28.2%. The target for directly observed case treatment (DOTS) was (andstill is) 75%, somewhat lower than the 85% recommended by WHO. From 1998-1999 noimprovement was found in this area. These results are disappointing, because NPLT is well-organised and uses the proper guidelines. The technical guidelines used for laboratory research and for case manage-ment, including the drug treatment schedule, are coherent with international recommen-health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 100dations. Several technicians underwent training and a monitoring and information sys- tem was set up. Two major causes for the disappointing results could be identified: The first was coinci- dental and linked to a severe meningitis epidemic that broke out in 1996. This resulted inan emergency drain on available health personnel and frustrated the proper implementa-tion of foreseen NPL T activities. The second cause was structural in nature. In line with WHO recommendations, this programme relies on passive case finding. However,because the utilisation of the public health services is so very low all over the country (a fact confirmed in the Kaya region), few tuberculosis patients will ever reach the healthfacilities. The support to the central agency for essential drugs supply ( CAMEG) has fully attained its objectives. It contributed to the availability of reasonably priced essential drugs in thehealth facilities, and to the implementation of a drug cost-recovery system. However,although drugs are available, their use is limited for two reasons. Firstly, the healthfacilities are under-utilised, and secondly, drug prices are high compared to other coun-tries in West Africa. The Ministry of Health has implemented a system of decentraliseddistribution and quality control, which appears to be functioning adequately. In 1999,there were hardly any reports of stocks running out, a finding that the Kaya field studyconfirmed. However, these positive results were not achieved overnight. In the first years of its existence CAMEG faced considerable problems and stock ruptures occurredregularly. The three programmes in the field of reproductive health did not all have the same level of effectiveness. The support to the UNFPA programme did not lead to tangible results. Document review revealed that, the lack of success relating to the UNFPA three projectprogramme, was mainly due to the absence of an institutional cadre. In addition, seriousmanagement problems hampered the proper implementation of the programme. This will be further discussed in paragraph 6.5. The study on sexual health needs in a rural environment carried out by ABBEF met its objectives. The quality of the study was good and the results have been used for thedesign of a follow-up project, that aims at meeting the needs identified. This project hadjust started at the time of the evaluation and so was not included in it. 101health, nutrition and population | Burkina Fasohealth, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 102The national School of Public Health (ENSP) has introduced the subject of reproductive health into its curriculum and the work plan has been adapted in order to include practi-cal experience. The quality of the training programme is good. The project's objective hasbeen realised. To sum up: the findings on effectiveness give a varied picture. With one exception, all the programmes managed positive results in terms of the realisation of their objectives. The objectives of the programmes and projects range from broadly defined and ambi-tious, to well defined and limited. The health support to the Kaya region is comprehensive and its broadly defined objectives were partially achieved. The tuberculosis control programme had clearly defined objectives that were only very partially achieved. The support for the essential drugs programme had clearly defined objectives that were almost fully realised. However, during the first years the programme faced anumber of problems. The two small projects in the field of reproductive health had clearly defined objecti- ves and attained them. The support for the UNFP A programme was not successful. Hardly any tangible results could be found. 6.5 Efficiency To assess efficiency, three criteria are taken into consideration: cost-effectiveness, the quality of programme management, and the transparency of the financial administra-tion. The support given to the Kaya health region succeeded in bringing about considerable positive changes to the health system for a budget of about 2200 Francs CFA (3.18 Euros) per person per year. Compared to other interventions, this is considered efficient. However, when one takes into consideration the low level of health facility utilisation, it is clear that the number of beneficiaries was considerable lower than the number ofinhabitants in the region. Technical assistance consumed 12% of the budget and overhead costs another 12%. The programme management has changed over time. At the beginning, the implement-ing agency took the initiative for carrying out activities; whereas at present, its role is that103health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso of an advisor to the health authorities. Key persons expressed their satisfaction with this move. A system for the financial administration was set up and responsible administra-tors have been trained to use it. However, high personnel turnover made it necessary tohire external audit companies. In the financial administration department, several errorswere reported, but no major irregularities. The tuberculosis programme was not cost-effective. During the period 1996-1999, average costs per person treated were about 108.9 Euros, twice the amount recommended byWHO. One reason for this is that considerable investment was necessary before the pro-gramme could take off and expand. Another reason is that administrative procedures,concerning both the transfer of the budget and the purchase of necessary equipment,caused serious delays in the implementation of the programme. The programme is ade-quately managed. The financial administration of PNLT is transparent and no irregulari-ties were found. For CAMEG, the situation is the other way around. Here, the programme was cost-effec- tive but irregularities were revealed in the financial administration. Dutch support of 1.2million Euros contributed substantially to the availability of drugs all over the country.However, in 1995 and 1996 serious problems were detected in both the stock manage- ment and in the financial administration. Bad selection of suppliers, stock rupture andexcessive drug prices are all documented in reports from the administrative board. Keyinformants from CAMEG however tell a different story and relate these problems to diffi-culties with complicated donor procedures. The situation finally got to the point wherethe funds were blocked. In 1996 an outside company drew up a list of the problems and atthat juncture, serious measures for improvement were introduced. The support for the UNFPA was not efficient at all. The budget was sufficient to imple- ment the activities planned, however only a few of them were actually carried out and sothe budget absorption rate was low. There are many reasons to explain this, includinglack of clarity in responsibilities and complex administrative procedures. The decentralisation of the maternal and child services project was implemented by the Ministry of Health; the social action project by the Ministry of Social Affairs. It was fore-seen that these two projects would eventually be integrated, but this never happened. Theinformation, education and communication project had a late start and only carried out afew of its intended activities. Lack of proper communication between the ministrieshealth, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 104involved, the NGO providing technical assistance, the UNFPA, and the Dutch Embassy also thwarted proper implementation. As support to UNFPA had stopped almost threeyears before the present evaluation, it was not possible to verify these findings during keyperson interviews. The administrative procedures were opaque and there was no adequatebudget control. The administrative capacity of the implementing agencies at nationaland district level was also inadequate. The cost-effectiveness of the ABBEF study relates to the utilisation of the study results, an issue that could not be evaluated. The ENSP project is considered to be cost-effectivein that the planned integration of reproductive health within the curriculum has beenachieved with a limited budget. Document review of both of these projects did not revealany problems or irregularities in management or financial administration. Summarising the findings: the efficiency of the programmes varied, with most having both strong and weak points. Overall, the Kaya programme was efficient, but it had someadministrative problems. The NTLP was not that cost-effective, though on the positiveside, the financial administration was very transparent. For CAMEG, the reverse was true;it was very cost-effective, but some irregularities in the financial administration weredetected at the start of the programme. 6.6 Sustainability To assess sustainability a distinction has been made between financial sustainability, institutional sustainability and sustainability in terms of policy. In the Kaya programme, a number of planning and cost-recovery measures were intro- duced that are now part and parcel of the national health policy, making the programmehighly sustainable in policy and institutional terms. However, key informants reported that the financial input from the implementing agency is still very important to sustainsome of these measures. So there is some question about the programme's financialsustainability. The tuberculosis control programme is a national health programme and thus sustain- able in policy and institutional terms. In financial terms the programme is not (yet) sus-tainable. Withdrawal of external finance would decrease training, supervision and labora-tory tests, and consequently influence case finding and treatment negatively. ThereforeDutch support for NLTP has been continued.105health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso The support to CAMEG was highly sustainable. CAMEG has become an association that does not receive any external support. The findings from the field study (see paragraph6.7) point to a programme that is still functioning well. The sustainability of the support for UNFPA is difficult to assess. In policy and institution- al terms, the projects contributed to the awareness of the need for a national reproductivehealth policy to be formulated. However, reproductive health policy is still a long wayfrom being implemented. The continuity of the special project activities after the with-drawal of Dutch financial support could not be assessed. For the study in reproductive rights, the sustainability criterion is not applicable. The introduction of reproductive health in the ENSP curriculum is sustainable ininstitutional and financial terms. Summarising the findings: The support for the Kaya region, the tuberculosis control and the central agency for essential drugs are all sustainable in policy and institutional terms. The support for CAMEG has proved to be sustainable in financial terms, the other programmes not. The sustainability of support for UNFPA could not be assessed. The criterion sustainability is not applicable to the ABBEF study. The ENSP project is sustainable. 6.7 Impact In Kaya district, one of the four districts of the Kaya region, a field study has been carriedout to assess the intermediate factors defined as preconditions for the impact of thehealth programmes. These are the improvements in the structure and performance of thehealth system and changes in health behaviour. The results of the field study are relatedto the Kaya PHC programme and to the support for CAMEG. The study design did notallow for the results of the tuberculosis programme to be measured. With respect to reproductive health, various issues were assessed. These relate to national reproductive health guidelines and not to Dutch support for the programmes included inthe evaluation, as these were implemented in another geographical area. health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 106Visits were carried out to nine randomly selected health facilities ( CSPS). Among the vil- lages covered by the health centre visited, four were selected following a stratified sam-pling procedure. Two villages were randomly selected among those situated less than fivekilometres from the CSPS; and two villages among those situated more than five kilome-tres from the CSPS. Field study results are based on: key informant interviews with health workers and village leaders a hundred consultation observations and exit interviews a household survey among 100 households, including interviews with the head of the household and with the mother of a young child five focus group discussions. The findings give a general picture of the health system and health behaviour. Only someof the findings can be directly related to Dutch support to the Kaya region. Infrastructure, equipment and organisation of services Health infrastructure and equipment have been improved thanks to the Kaya programme. All centres have access to radio equipment and in most, an ambulance is available foremergency cases. All centres were clean. Part of the medical-technical equipment was not functional and consumables such as disposable needles were almost non-existent.Only two out of the nine health centres heads had put in a request for the replacement ofnon-functional equipment. Recently the Burkinab\u00e9 authorities allocated funds for main-tenance. However procedures for their use had not yet been established at the time of theevaluation. Drug supply was adequate in all health centres (CSPS). The pharmacies were well organ- ised and stocks were well documented. In eight of the nine centres no stock rupture hadoccurred in the year previous to the evaluation. At village level, the opposite was found.There, hardly any drugs are available. The village health workers are supposed to buydrugs at the CSPS and resell them to clients in the villages. Interviews in the villagesrevealed that this system did not function. Vaccines were not always available in the CSPS. In only one centre had all necessary vac- cines been available throughout the entire year previous to the evaluation. Shortages ofvaccines against tuberculosis, tetanus and yellow fever were reported from time to time inthe other centres. 107health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso Almost all CSPS health workers reported that facilities provided through the Kaya pro- gramme had increased their motivation to work in the area. Among the advantages men-tioned were: training, supervision, better equipment and housing, and transportationfacilities. The programme facilitated numerous training courses in a variety of areas, suchas nutrition, disease prevention and management and information. Almost all healthworkers, including the persons responsible for the pharmacies, stated that they hadattended several of these courses. At village level, most health workers had received basictraining but hardly any follow-up to it. In a CSPS the services are well organised and planned. Curative care and emergency care is provided every day and preventive services on specific days only. A community healthcommittee (COGES) is involved in the management of a CSPS, including the use of thebudget. Though this committee should represent the target population of a CSPS, keyinformants in remote villages were not even informed about its existence let alone its role.Data on health care utilisation is collected and sent to the district health office and since1997, the health information system has been improved. In many health centres, informa-tive graphs were shown, for example about the population size in the target area and onvaccination coverage over time. Clinical effectiveness of interventions Health promotion has been reinforced over the last three years. Health educationmaterials and the choice of issues are defined at central level. Prevention of HIV/ AIDS is an important theme. The household survey revealed that 60% of women and 50% of heads of household had attended at least once a health information session. The material is adequate. The quality of the sessions could not be assessed. Preventive consultation for under-fives and antenatal care are given during special ses- sions, twice or three times a week. Under-fives are weighed and the health worker notesthe weight on the growth monitoring chart. Only very general advice on feeding is givento the mothers. Consultation observations and exit interviews revealed that none of theundernourished children received any special attention or treatment. Previously, a foodprovision programme had been running in the area, but as, apparently, the food did notgo to the children in need, the programme was stopped. It was never subsequentlyreplaced by better-targeted measures for undernourished children. Generally, antenatalcare was carried out according the guidelines. All pregnant women received proper anti-malaria prophylactics. Concerning curative care, therapy guidelines for the most important diseases are avail- able in all the CSPS but these instruments are not used on a regular basis. Nonetheless,client observations and exit interviews revealed that most drug prescriptions (26 out of33) were rational. Responsiveness of the system Client exit interviews revealed that most people were satisfied with the health workers'performance. Clients reported that they were treated with respect and that the healthworker carefully listened to them. The majority of the health workers explained what theywere doing. However, only once was the patient's opinion asked for. Consultation obser- vations confirm these positive findings. Fairness of the system Fairness is inadequate as fees are charged and there are no formal exemption mecha-nisms. In four of the nine CSPS, a 'fee for services system' is applied and in all nine,essential drugs are being sold. At national level, no guidelines exist for exemption frompayment for those who cannot afford to pay. At local level, several informal mechanismsdo exist, such as the provision of donated drugs, or drugs on credit, which are reimbursedhealth, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 108109health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso in instalments. At village level, people often help one another, collecting money in order to provide the poor with the necessary treatment. Health behaviour Vaccination coverage in the Kaya district increased from 1997-1999. Despite the consider-able increase, it is still very low. Table 14 shows the findings. Table 14 Evolution of vaccination coverage of under ones given in percentages; 1994-1999 Year BCG DTP Polio3 Measles Yellow fever 1994 64 41 45 45 1995 74 47 56 561996 53 37 55 281997 46 28 33 271998 52 31 38 331999 60 42 53 502000 79 56 58 55 Obstetric care has increased substantially. Health office data reveal that despite a reduc- tion in trained personnel, deliveries assisted by health workers or trained village midwifesincreased from 13% of expected deliveries in 1997 to 40% by 1999. For contraceptiveprevalence, only national data is available. It increased slightly from 8% in 1993 to 12% in 1999. Midwives in the health services and in the villages indicated that more and more women are using contraceptives. From 1997-1999, health services utilisation for curativecare in the Kaya district increased from 0.12 to 0.22 new contacts per person per year. This number is still very low, compared with an estimated 'need' of at least two new con-tacts per person per year. Findings from the household survey revealed that, during their last pregnancy, more than half of the mothers visited a CSPS for antenatal care. Three-quarters had their babyaccompanied by a village midwife and about a quarter had their baby at the CSPS. Thesenumbers are substantially higher than the data from the health office. The discrepancycan be explained by the fact that not all the midwives, mentioned by the mothers, weretrained midwifes. These 'untrained' midwives do not report to the health office. Almost three-quarters of the mothers (72/104) expressed the wish for birth spacing andhealth, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 11028 mothers used modern contraceptives. About 70% of the under-fives were brought at least once a year to a CSPS for preventive consultation. In case of sickness, 40% of the mothers went to a CSPS during the last illness episode of a child. Rational drug use could not be assessed in the household interviews, although itcould in the exit interviews, where it proved to be low. Out of 33 clients receiving a pre-scription, only 14 could explain how to use the drugs. In other words, though the healthworkers explained what they were doing, the patients did not retain the information thatthey received about drugs. Key informants in two health centres attributed the increase of curative consultations to the availability of drugs at a reduced price, to intensified promotion and to improvedquality of care. Nonetheless, in their view several factors impeded a further increase. Inthe rainy season health centres are not accessible, and even in the dry season access isdifficult due to lack of transport. Though available at a reduced price, many people stillcannot afford to pay for drugs. Health workers are relatively young, there is a highturnover amongst them and hardly any women work in the CSPS. None the above factorsbuild confidence among the population. Finally many patients practice self-treatment orgo to traditional healers. Interviews with community leaders and the household survey confirmed these findings. Most people in the households expressed their appreciation for the health services (CSPS)and only a few voiced complaints, such as long waiting times or absence of a water sourcein the CSPS. Most people felt that the distance to the centre was too great, especially inthe rainy season. The great majority of the villagers interviewed were of the opinion thatthe health post (PSP) in their village was not functioning well. The health worker did nothave the necessary drugs nor sufficient training. This explains why traditional healers arewidely consulted as a first resort. People consider them as the only ones able to heal cer-tain diseases, such as epilepsy, impotency and sickness caused by the 'evil eye'. Theirtreatment is not considered adequate for other diseases, such as meningitis, tetanus orAIDS. The healers themselves confirmed these attitudes. Out of 20 traditional healersinterviewed, 15 stated that people consulted them first. All healers indicated that some-times they refer the patient, either to a CSPS or to a colleague. Health outcome Due to lack of data on child and maternal mortality at district level, health outcome could111health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso not be measured. Improved vaccination coverage makes a slight improvement likely. At national level, a decrease in maternal mortality has been observed in the period 1997-1999. Summarising the findings: the field study identified strengths and weaknesses in both the health system and health behaviour. The support to the Kaya health region has thuspotentially made a positive impact on the health situation, though on a limited scale. 6.8 Conclusion The overall evaluation results give a varied picture. Highlights are the Kaya primaryhealth programme, CAMEG and the two smaller projects in the field of reproductivehealth. The tuberculosis programme had limited results. The UNFPA projects were notsuccessful. The Kaya primary health programme obtained important improvements in the orga- nisation of the health system. Major weaknesses are the continuing low service utili-sation at CSPS level, the low level of fairness in the system and the low quality of carein the villages. CAMEG led to the increased availability of essential drugs in the periphery. However, due to the low utilisation of services, these drugs are not always used. In addition,CAMEG initially faced major problems in stock rupture and financial administration. Major investments were made through the tuberculosis control programme, which aimed at better case detection and treatment. However, the number of patientsdetected and treated properly hardly increased and remained well below target. In the field of reproductive health, the evaluation could not reveal any tangible results of the projects supported through UNFPA. The ABBEF study into sexual and reproductive health needs was carried out properly and the study results have been used in the design of a project in the field of repro-ductive health. The project aimed at the incorporation of reproductive health in the curriculum of the National School of Public Health and has reached its objective. The support to the Kaya sanitary region, CAMEG, ENSP and the ABBEF study are judged efficient. The efficiency of the other programmes was limited. Except for the UNFPA pro-jects, all programmes were sustainable at institutional and policy level. CAMEG alsoproved sustainable in financial terms. health, nutrition and population | Burkina Faso 112 With respect to health outcome in Kaya district, lack of data makes judgement difficult. The increased immunisation coverage has potentially led to a slight improvement inhealth outcome. The overall conclusion is summarised in the following table.

In total almost40% (20.4 of 52.6 million Euros) of total Dutch development co-operation in the area ofhealth in the three countries has been spent on these PHC programmes. On the basis ofdocument review, key person interviewing and site visits, all these programmes have beenassessed in terms of policy relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. In addition, in each country one of the PHC programmes has been assessed in more detail in a field study: Angoche in Mozambique; Hodeidah in Yemen; and Kaya in BurkinaFaso. These studies focused on the structure and performance of the health system, aswell as on the health behaviour of the population. As explained in chapter 2, the assump-tion is that positive effects in these areas together will be likely to have a positive impactin terms of a better health status of the population. The primary health care approach is an essential component of the respective health poli- cies of the three receiving countries and of development co-operation in the Netherlands.Generally speaking the seven PHC programmes aim to improve access to, and the qualityof, primary health care. With the move of Dutch development policy towards a sector-wide approach, the emphasis has shifted gradually from community health to institution-al strengthening. As we have seen in the previous chapters, specific objectives and thescope of the various programmes differ substantially. In the country chapters we havealso seen that the PHC programmes differ in terms of results obtained. We now turn to acomparative assessment of the programmes in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. For the programmes assessed in the field studies, the effects on the structure and perfor-mance of the health system and on health behaviour are also compared. health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 1147.1.2 Effectiveness Effectiveness in this evaluation is assessed by analysing to what extent the programmes'and projects' objectives have been realised. In the preceding chapters, we have seen thateffectiveness of two PHC programmes (PASSPK Kaya and Hodeidah) is evaluated as good;the effectiveness of three other PHC programmes (Aden, Prindesa and Angoche) is foundto be limited; and the effectiveness of the two remaining PHC programmes (Dhamar andMemisa) is judged weak. A comparison of the effectiveness of these programmes result-ed in the following key-findings: Ambitious objectives : A frequent conclusion in the country evaluations is \"the initial objec- tives were too ambitious\". This was the evaluation teams' conclusion with particularregard to the PHC programmes in Yemen and the two programmes in Mozambique(Angoche and Prindesa). In the three Yemen programmes and in the programme inAngoche, the objectives were changed over time into more feasible ones and the strategies were adapted too. The Angoche programme for example focused more directly on improv-ing basic health services, including community based health care. And the Dhamar pro-gramme limited the number of districts. The fact that these changes were made after amidterm review or evaluation, underlines the importance of timely assessments. Focus on hardware : The current evaluation findings show that most of the PHC programmes evaluated have been successful in achieving objectives which improve the health systemstructure, such as: the building of new health centres and the rehabilitation of existingfacilities; improvements in equipment and transport; and strengthening the supply ofessential medicines. Training activities were also successfully accomplished. Fewerresults were obtained in the areas of care quality enhancement, equity, community par-ticipation, and inter-sectoral collaboration. This was also found in the evaluation ofDutch PHC programmes in 1988. 52 Improvements in infrastructure form an essential part of efforts to improve health andhealth care. However, without improvements in the quality of care, these investments are not likely to have any impact on health outcome. There are, though, some positive find-ings in this area. A highlight is the introduction and training of murshidat by the healthprogrammes in Dhamar and Hodeidah. The murshidat is a female health worker who 52 IOV 1988.provides preventive services both in health facilities and at community level. The intro- duction of these health workers enhanced the accessibility to, and the quality of, motherand child care and reproductive health. Another positive example is the inter-sectoral col-laboration in Hodeidah and Dhamar. PHC programmes here have been successfully work- ing together with a non-health organisation, the Yemenite Women's Union. Many womenwere found to be participating in various training activities, and the political participa-tion of women has increased. Varied success in institutional strengthening : Institutional strengthening is considered a pre- condition for improving both the health system structure and the quality of care. It was anobjective of all but one of the PHC programmes. The extent to which this objective hasbeen achieved, varied substantially among the programmes. The Prindesa programme inNampula (Mozambique) had an institutional focus from the very start. It carried outsome very good studies at provincial level, whose results could have been applied toimprove planning. At the time of the evaluation this had not yet happened. Angoche, the other programme in Mozambique, only very partially succeeded in the strengtheningof the district health offices. In Yemen, the picture is varied. In Hodeidah, the co-operation with the health office was good and led to improvements in the organisation of the services and in the health information system. However, the successes proved not to be sustained after external financing was withdrawn. In Aden, successes werenegligible and in Dhamar, hardly any results were observed. In the Kaya programme in Burkina Faso, various mechanisms for improved planning of services were put in place,and here the institutional strengthening is considered successful. 7.1.3 Efficiency Efficiency in this evaluation has been considered in terms of both cost-effectiveness andappropriate management (which is taken to include a good monitoring system and trans-parent financial administration). Ideally, efficiency means making an assessment of thecosts of alternative approaches, and then taking an informed decision based on the mostcost-effective of these. This has, however, not been the case for any of the PHC pro-grammes. In general terms, the efficiency of the evaluated PHC programmes varies widely. The PASSPK in Burkina Faso and the Hodeidah programme in Yemen are found to be the most efficient, though even these two programmes reveal failures in efficiency. Three of thePHC programmes - Angoche, Memisa and Dhamar - were found to be lacking in efficien- 115health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issuescy. In Dhamar, Angoche and Memisa, the objectives could not be achieved and activities were not implemented according to plan, hence these programmes were not cost-effec-tive. The Aden and Prindesa programmes can be placed somewhere in between the twoextremes. The limited efficiency of the Prindesa programme is mainly due to external fac-tors, i.e. the fact that the planned second phase will not be carried out, makes some ofthe implemented programme activities inefficient. The two most effective programmes are found to be the most efficient as well. Both the Hodeidah programme and the PASSPK have been able to achieve their main objectives -increasing access to, and quality of, PHC services - within their allocated budget. A com-bination of the appropriate technical approach allied to adequately functioning manage-rial mechanisms plays an important role in these successes. In Hodeidah, for example,the training of the female health workers is considered to have been a very cost-effectiveapproach. Training of higher-level health professionals would have taken much moretime, and hence would have been much more expensive. Comparison resulted in the following key-findings:Huge variations in appropriateness of management : In Hodeidah, project management was appropriate. However, two managerial mechanisms were identified, which clearly dimin- ished the efficiency of the programme. These were: the requirement for the RNE to tenderinternationally for building activities; and the difficulties involved in accessing moneyrecovered through a cost-sharing policy. According to some informants, money disap-peared as a consequence of this. In the case of PASSPK, in Burkina Faso, the management of the project was adequate. A high organisational level allowed the programme to discover its own limited financialmanagement capability, and to find a solution for this in the form of contracting anexternal office for its financial administration. Weak programme cost-effectiveness was found to be associated with two factors: organi- sational and managerial problems within the project; and problems in the articulation ofthe projects with existing state health care institutions in the area. All Mozambican programmes and projects suffered from managerial problems. The Memisa project in Mozambique was even ended early because of managementhealth, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 116problems within the implementing agency. And for the Angoche programme in Mozambique, late availability of funds in the first phase of the programme, and difficul-ties in recruiting personnel (local and foreign) were important factors limiting pro-gramme implementation. The limited efficiency of the Prindesa programme inMozambique is related to discontinuities in donor support. The Prindesa programme was defined as a preparatory phase to be followed by a comprehensive co-operationprogramme. But the decision process on the continuation of the programme took so long that it led to uncertainties, which influenced efficiency in a negative way. In Yemen, mismanagement was reported in the Dhamar PHC programme, resulting in a failure to implement the rural primary health programme. In both the Aden and Dhamarprogrammes in Yemen, insufficient co-ordination with the public health office was foundto be a major factor impeding the execution of planned activities. Limited adequacy of monitoring systems : The evaluated PHC programmes had different moni- toring systems and approaches, and most of them did not function very adequately. ThePASSPK in Burkina Faso forms a positive exception to this general statement. This pro- gramme was also subject to an external evaluation, which led to the work programmebeing adapted. In Yemen all programmes are well documented with progress reports, which in principal allow for both plan adjustment and accountability to the donor. However, these progress reports were superfluous and descriptive, and did not lead to modifications in the workplans. The same goes for the progress reports of the three Mozambican PHC pro-grammes. Midterm evaluations though didlead to major adaptations in the objectives and the work plans of the three programmes in Yemen and in Angoche. T wo programmes were never evaluated: Prindesa's request to have a final evaluation was not approved by the RNE inMozambique; Memisa stopped long before planned. Programmes predominantly transparent : Efficient programme implementation requires an adequate accounting system to monitor expenditure and to avoid fund leakage andfraud. Five of the seven PHC programmes (the three Mozambican, P ASSPK and Aden) were found to be transparent and no irregularities were detected. In the Hodeidahprogramme, some problems occurred regarding the management of the drug fund, 117health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issueshealth, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 118but besides this, the general accountability of the programme was found to be good. In the Dhamar programme, a serious case of fraud was detected in 1995 and staffchanged as a consequence. The financial administration has not been sufficientlytransparent. In 1999, a new audit revealed that some procedures were still not appro-priate. 7.1.4 Impact Impact has been studied in the following areas only: in the city of Hodeidah in Yemen; inthe Kaya district in Burkina Faso; and in the Angoche district in Mozambique. At the timeof the evaluation, the primary health programmes with Dutch support had been imple-mented in these locations for at least four years. As explained previously, impact in thisstudy has to be understood to mean 'likely impact'. It is measured by an appraisal of thefollowing intermediate factors: improvements in the structure and performance of thehealth system and in the health behaviour of the population. The health system has beenassessed using observation and interviewing at services level. A household survey andfocus group discussions aimed at gathering information on health behaviour. In addi-tion, health statistics have been researched to check health services utilisation and healthstatus. However, it transpired that reliable statistics on health outcome at district level were not available. Below we review the results of the field studies for each of the interme-diate factors. Effects on structure of the health care systemAll PHC programmes aimed at improving the health system structure. In the field studies, the following improvements were reported: Successful rehabilitation of facilities, equipment, and means of transport : In all three PHC pro- grammes, improvements were achieved in infrastructure, equipment, means of transportand in maintenance. Between the three programmes, there is a huge variation in the levelthat has been reached. This is understandable given the very different individual situa-tions which prevailed at the beginning of the respective programmes. The situation inAngoche is the least favoured all round, with lack of transport and communications facili-ties posing major problems, especially in the case of (obstetric) emergencies. In Kaya dis-trict, the health posts in the villages were found to not be equipped; they were thereforenot functional either. 119health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues Successful training of health workers and/or community health workers : Training was an important element of all three programmes and it led to the improvement of servicedelivery. In Hodeidah and Angoche, the training of (female) community-based healthworkers contributed to increasing access to basic health services in peripheral zones.However, in neither Mozambique nor Yemen is the national policy on community health workers properly defined. Community health workers, in practice, are not remuneratedproperly and do not have the basic means to provide adequate services. This seriouslylimits the effectiveness, and subsequently the sustainability, of training efforts. In theKaya programme, training of community-based health workers has been neglected. Thisreflects national policy in Burkina Faso, where services at community level are no longerpart of the public health system. Supervision improved : All three PHC programmes have introduced or reintroduced a super- vision schedule. In Kaya, the village health committee has come to play an important rolein the supervision; in Angoche, 'integrated supervision' has been introduced; inHodeidah an elaborate system for quality assurance was set up. After the programmesended, supervision in the Hodeidah and Angoche programmes deteriorated, due to lackof money to pay related costs. Motivation of staff generally improved : The variation in motivation level in the three pro- gramme areas and among different types of health workers, clearly reflects the 'incen-tives' they received. When working and living conditions are substantially improved - as was the case for the health staff in Burkina Faso and for the murshidat in Hodeidah -health workers are motivated. When this is not the case, or barely so - as for the commu-nity-based health workers in Kaya and most of the health staff, village health workers(VHW) and traditional birth attendants (TBA) in Angoche - health workers are less moti- vated. In these latter examples, it is vital that appreciation for their work be expressed,either by the population or by senior staff during supervision, in order to prevent a stateof complete de-motivation. Inadequate supply of drugs and vaccines : The supply of drugs at district level is found to be irregular across the board in Angoche and Hodeidah, and almost non-existent at thehealth posts in Kaya (reflecting Kaya's neglect for this lowest level of health care). Vaccinesupply is irregular in Kaya and Angoche and stock ruptures were reported. The supply inHodeidah is regular. Details on drug availability, drug funds and rational drug use areprovided in next paragraph, which deals with the essential drugs programmes. Results relating to health services management varied : In Kaya district, adequate management procedures and tools are in place and are reasonably used. In Hodeidah, this has onlypartially been achieved. In the Angoche programme, this objective was not systematicallypursued, although some of the Angoche health staff followed management-trainingcourses facilitated by Prindesa. In Kaya, Hodeidah and Angoche, community health committees have been set up to assist in the management of the health centres. In Kaya and Hodeidah, these committeeswere given responsibility in planning and (financial) management. An important task ofthese village health committees is the management of revolving drug funds. However, noteverything is functioning smoothly. In Burkina Faso, village health committee membersall lived locally and thus were unrepresentative of the Kaya health centres' catchmentarea population. In Hodeidah, the committees were found to be limited by administrativeprocedures in their capacity to use the funds, and there was an apparent unwillingness,on the part of the finance officers responsible, to make the resources available to thecommunity. In Angoche district, community committees no longer existed by the timethe evaluation was carried out. Health information system improved : In Kaya and Hodeidah, the health information system (HIS) has been improved. This is not the case in Mozambique. In Kaya, the informationhas been used for improved planning in the field of drugs. In Hodeidah, the improved HIShas not been used either for monitoring or for evaluation. Effects in terms of performance of the health systemThe performance of the health system was assessed by looking into the clinical effective- ness, the responsiveness and the fairness of the system. Clinical effectiveness in this evaluation refers to how appropriately health care providers administer health promotion and preventive and curative care. Curative care has beenmeasured by the way health workers use curative guidelines and prescribe essential drugsfor predominant health conditions. Neglect of nutrition : All three programmes have almost fully neglected the nutrition issue. Weight control of children under the age of five is commonly done in all health centres. However, growth-monitoring cards are often not available, and if they are available, theyhealth, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 120121health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues are not properly used. The growth curve is often not completed. Feedback and advice given to mothers is minimal and very general. Health workers do not inform mothersabout vaccination. No clear policy guidelines exist on how to treat undernourishedchildren. Quality of curative care varied . In all three PHC programmes therapeutic guidelines had been developed or adapted. Quality of curative care was studied in the health centres by look-ing to see whether these guidelines were applied in the treatment of diarrhoea and acuterespiratory infections. Observations and interviews revealed a different picture among thethree PHC settings. In Kaya and Angoche it was found that the treatment guidelines werehardly ever used, but, in spite of this, drug prescription still remained predominantly inline with clinical guidelines. In Hodeidah, the reverse was true: guidelines were used andessential drugs were available, but prescription of drugs was by trade name, which led tounnecessary extra costs for the patients. Responsiveness of the health system to clients is a measure of how the system responds to perceived health needs, including needs at the interpersonal and communicational level.Responsiveness is an important determinant of health services utilisation. If people donot feel well treated, they will be reluctant to return. Responsiveness good: In all three settings, the majority of clients expressed their satisfaction - in exit interviews - with the way they were treated by health personnel. The latter showrespect and adequate concern for their clients; they listen well and give opportunities toask questions. Consultations (with the exception of the weighing sessions) are said totake place in private and clean places, and adequate information is provided about treat-ment. In Kaya, the evaluation team confirmed these findings: relational skills were foundto be rather good. In Hodeidah however , the evaluation team - in a finding also based on consultation observation - gave a negative judgement on the inter-relational and com-munication skills of the health staff. In Angoche, the health centres were found to not beclean, and even though no consultation observations were carried out, the evaluationteam questioned the accuracy of the rather too positive judgement of the health staff 'sinter-relational skills. 53Waiting time, another indicator for respect, was short in Hodeidah and Kaya (hardly ever more than 30 minutes), and reasonable in Angoche(about one third of the clients waited more than an hour). 53Both the Mozambican and Yemen evaluation teams note that clients - when answering these questions - might be influenced by the interview setting (close to the health centres) and feel inclined not to speak negatively about the health workers.Another element of responsiveness is that there should be no discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, class, gender, age or marital status. In Yemen and Burkina Faso,health workers indicated that they do not provide contraception to women without theirhusband's consent. Fairness of the health system means that the risks each household faces, due to the costs of the health system, should be distributed according to the ability to pay rather than tothe risk of illness. The introduction of user fees and fees for drugs in public health sys-tems can make the system less fair. Exemption policies and the correct implementation ofsuch policies have the potential to restore the fairness of the system and protect the poor.A fair finance system ensures financial protection for everyone. Fairness varied but generally low: In all three countries, fees for both services and for drugs were introduced in the 1990's. However, equity concerns were dealt with differently. In Kaya, no exemption policy has been defined. In Hodeidah, an exemption policy with a setof indicators has been developed and implemented during the project period; this identi-fies risk families who are then exempted from paying for services and drugs. At the timeof the evaluation however, these criteria were no longer in use. In Mozambique, peoplecan get an exemption if they show an ' atestado de pobreza'( statement of poverty ), a docu- ment which can be obtained from the local administration. In practice however, healthpersonnel in all three settings act in a very similar way when confronted with patients whocannot pay the 'doctor's bill': they search for an ad hoc solution. Though this is a veryfriendly gesture to the individual patient who profits from it, such ad hoc solutions createa situation of dependence on the good will of health personnel, and cannot be consideredfair. It might be suspected - though this has not been systematically studied in this evalu-ation- that people do not visit the public health centres because they cannot afford to. Ifthis is true, user fees may increase inequity in access to health. Health behaviourUltimately, health is determined by the health behaviour of individuals and families. Good health care - clinically effective, responsive, and fair - should lead to increased util-isation of the health services and encourage healthy behaviour to prevent ill-health. Thisevaluation has studied how people use the health services and what they do to preventdisease.health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 122123health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues Utilisation of health services varied: Data was collected on the utilisation of immunisation, family planning, antenatal care, curative services and delivery care, which are key areas ofPHC. Utilisation of the public health services differs among the three evaluation settings.In Angoche, almost all the women interviewed in the household survey visited the nearestpublic health centre for curative and/or preventive services, both for themselves and fortheir children. For the population in Angoche, few alternative health care facilities areavailable besides traditional healers, who are also popular. In Hodeidah, there arealternative health facilities available in addition to the public health centres: private clinics, hospitals, charity clinics, and a range of traditional heal-ers. In the majority of the households, the public services - which have been strengthenedwith Dutch support - are used by mothers and their children for preventive care. For cura-tive care, however, they hardly ever visit public health centres. Especially in cases of seri- ous childhood illness, mothers prefer to take their children to the private health caresector. When they are themselves ill, women rarely seek any professional help, opting instead for home treatment and self-medication. In Kaya, most women use the preventive services of the public health centres. Utilisation of public services for curative reasons is low: only 39% of women interviewed visited thehealth centre for the last episode of illness in their family. One reason mentioned for notusing the centres was the long distances that had to be travelled to get to them. The gen-eral preference was for self-care and traditional medicine. In all three settings mothers highly appreciate vaccinations as a preventive health service. Vaccinations are nearly always obtained from the public health system and not from pri-vate services. Still, coverage levels are not uniformly high in the three settings. TheHodeidah household survey shows very good coverage; data that is not confirmed byhealth office statistics. In Angoche, the picture is different and vaccination coverage islow. Strikingly, seven recently-born children had not received any vaccination whatsoever.Their mothers claimed that they had visited the health centres, but that at the time vac- cines were not available. This story was later confirmed by other sources. In Kaya, statis-tics indicated that coverage had increased over the last five years, but was still low. Thisfinding was subsequently confirmed in the household survey. The household surveys also collected data about women's wishes regarding birth spacing and use of contraceptives (table 16). health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 124 Table 16 Birth spacing and use of contraceptives Contraceptive Yem en Bukina Faso Mozambique demand/use (%) ( spacing 81.7 (n=120) 69.2 (n=104) 39.6 (n=72) 52.5 (n=40) (% of demand) The number of women who do not want to become pregnant during the next two-year period is highest in Hodeidah, followed respectively by Kaya and Angoche. Use of contra-ceptives varies considerably among the three study settings: in Angoche, half the womenwho do not want to become pregnant use modern contraceptives; while in Kaya andHodeidah the percentage is considerably lower. In other words, in these locations there isa high unmet need for contraceptives. In all settings, contraceptives are generally obtained from the public health centres. In Hodeidah, the women give several reasons to explain the 'unmet need': natural spacingapplied (breastfeeding, menstruation not yet returned), non-approval of husband, reli-gious objections, and/or perceived side effects. In Kaya, some VHWs say that the demandfor contraceptives has increased, but that contraceptive use is still low. As reasons for thislow use, they cite: the husband's resistance (marital consent is required by health work-ers); the lack of female staff at the health centres; and the frequent presence there of localdignitaries, which hinders health staff in communicating freely with their clients. InAngoche, some women used 'natural spacing' and others said that they needed the per-mission of their husband (and in some cases of another relative, as well) to use moderncontraceptives. The proportion of women who reported visiting antenatal care services in a public health cen- tre at least once during their last pregnancy is high: Angoche 99%, Hodeidah 84 % andKaya 62%. Information on where and with whom the last delivery took place gives a differ-ent picture. In Kaya 75% of women delivered with the assistance of a TBA, and 25% in ahealth centre. In Hodeidah home-delivery is also the rule: 78% of women delivered athome, assisted in almost half of the cases by a community midwife. The murshidat rarelyassist deliveries. In Angoche, women usually deliver in a health unit (reported by 70 out of101 deliveries), 8 (of 101) women delivered with a TBA. Almost one quarter of the women delivered at home without trained assistance. 7.1.5 Concluding remarks Seven programmes were assessed on the basis of documents, key person interviewing andsight visits. Three of these programmes were studied in more detail, on the basis of ahealth services inspection and a household survey. The structure of the public health sys-tem and the capacity of public health staff has improved due to programme intervention.In terms of strengthening the public health institutions, only two programmes obtainedgood results and only one good and sustainable results. The quality of care could be measured for the three programmes studied in detail. Two of these programmes have contributed to better health system performance. The clinicaleffectiveness of the interventions is generally good for most preventive programmes. It isalso these programmes which are most used by the population. However, nutrition is notadequately addressed in the preventive services for the under-fives. Responsiveness isgenerally good. Fairness is a problem in all programmes and leads to the conclusion thatthe PHC programmes have not specifically focused on improving the situation of thepoorest in the programme areas. Health system performance is better in Yemen and Burkina Faso, but health care utilisa- tion is highest in Mozambique. This is partly explained by the fact that, in Burkina Fasoand Yemen, people can go to the private sector for what is generally believed to be better health care. In the Angoche district in Mozambique, this is hardly an option. Peopledepend on the public sector and seem to value whatever it has to offer. In all field study areas, preventive services utilisation has increased. By implementing primary health care in a distinct geographical area, the PHC pro- grammes not only reinforced existing PHC policies, they also provided lessons to therespective Ministries of Health, which inform and influence future health policies andstrategies in the receiving countries. In Yemen, the Hodeidah programme contributed tothe formulation of the Yemen health reform policy regarding cost-sharing mechanisms,the home visiting strategy of the murshidat and the Essential Drugs Programme. In Burkina Faso, a number of mechanisms for planning and cost control, as implemented by the PASSPK, are nowadays integrated elements of the national health policy. InMozambique, the Provincial Strategic Health Plan, formulated by the Nampula health 125health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issuesdirectorate and Prindesa, is referred to as an example of how a 'swap' can be prepared at provincial level. This move to strengthen the health system is considered a necessary condition to improve its structure and performance, and thus promote better health behaviour too. However,the downside was that it went hand-in-hand with a neglect of community health. As amajor part of the population, especially those living in rural areas, does not have accessto public health facilities, this neglect of the community level is a policy failure. 7.2 Review of country level support to Essential Drugs Programmes 7.2.1 Introduction Support to essential drugs programmes has been an important component of DutchDevelopment Aid over the past ten years. Though, as we have seen, there are no separatepolicy guidelines on support in this sub-sector, those guidelines developed by WHO arefollowed. As described in chapter 2, a national drug policy (NDP) includes: legislation, regulation and guidelines for the pharmaceutical sector; selection of essential drugs; supplymechanisms; pharmaceutical quality assurance; rational use of drugs; and sustainablefinancing. In the implementation of essential drugs programmes, there has to be abalance between these various components. In practice, it is often procurement andsupply that are emphasised. However , without training in the rational use of drugs, the programmes are not likely to have positive health outcomes. Support for essential drugs differs in the countries included in this evaluation. In Yemen, support is given to the implementation of the Yemen National Drug Policy, including allthe NDP components mentioned above. The NDP is implemented by the Yemen DrugAction Programme (YEMDAP). In Mozambique, the support is mainly for the purchasingof essential drugs. Other major donors include Ireland, Denmark, Switzerland, UnitedKingdom and Norway. The bulk of Dutch funding is used to buy drug kits, which aredirectly distributed to peripheral health units. Another part is used to supply drugs (not in kits) to referral health centres and hospitals. Institutional strengthening is alsoincluded in the programme's objectives. In Burkina Faso support has been given toCAMEG (la Centrale d'Achat de M\u00e9dicaments Essentiels G\u00e9n\u00e9riques). CAMEG is anautonomous agency that aims at making essential generic drugs accessible at 'social'health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 126prices and guaranteeing the availability of high quality drugs. It has been operating as a non profit-making company since 1998. Support to CAMEG was not for drugs, in contrastto that in the other countries. Support to essential drugs programmes accounts for around 50% of total Dutch health- related development co-operation support to the three countries (52.6 million Euros inthe period 1995-1999). Most of this money has been spent on drugs - only around 10% oncapacity building to strengthen supply systems and encourage rational use of drugs. Support for essential drugs is congruent with the aim to strengthen basic health services. Health services without drugs are not likely to be used by the population. The support isalso congruent with the national essential drugs policies in the three countries. The find-ings are based on document review and key person interviewing. The field study allowedfor assessing the availability of drugs in health services and their rational use among thepopulation in the districts where the study was carried out. 7.2.2 Effectiveness Within the pharmaceutical s ub-sector, effectiveness of the Dutch Development Co-opera- tion support is greatest in Burkina Faso. Here, focused support to capacity building hascontributed to a well-run, autonomous agency which ensures a regular supply of afford-able essential drugs in the country. The objectives of the Dutch-funded work programmewere realistic and have been met. In Yemen and Mozambique, the bulk of the funds wasspent on the procurement of essential drugs. Procurement support has proved effective in both countries. The effectiveness of the capacity building components of these pro-grammes is also good. The capacity of health administrators in the different HealthMinistries has improved; legislative amendments and procedures have been put in place;and monitoring and evaluation systems have been improved. The distribution of drugs tohealth centres in the periphery in these two countries, however, proved to be problemat-ic. And, in all countries included in the evaluation, the issue of rational drug use was notadequately addressed. The field study in Burkina Faso revealed that in peripheral health centres, generic drugs are generally available at fixed prices. However, prices are high compared to othercountries in the region. The supply of essential drugs was regular during the past 12months in 8 out of the 9 health centres included in the Kaya district study. Manuals onhow to treat predominant diseases, such as malaria, diarrhoea, ARI and sexually trans- 127health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issueshealth, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 128mitted diseases, are available in nearly all health centres, and 26 out of 33 curative con- sultations observed were treated in accordance with the guidelines. Exit interviews indi-cated however, that only 14 of the 33 patients bought medicines in compliance with the prescription, indicating possibly that the costs of the medicines were too high. In BurkinaFaso, people pay a fee for each medicine obtained in the health centres. Household inter-views demonstrate that people value the availability of essential drugs in the health cen-tres at affordable prices; however only 39% of respondents answered that they would goto the health centre as a first resort in case of illness. In Mozambique, the multi-donor support programme has contributed to improving drug logistics. The planning of drug supply for the districts is based on recent consumption ofmedicines. The provincial drug store is supposed to supply drugs to the districts everythree months. Drugs are then supplied to the different health centres in the district by thedistrict drug store. The drugs are supplied in kits, whose contents depend on the level ofthe health centre/community health worker. There is a control system for stocks of drugsand vaccines, which, though simple and manual, seems to be effective. Despite the improvements in planning and the existence of a control system, drug distri- bution to the periphery is still a major problem. The Mozambique team reported thatmost essential drugs were not available in the health centres. Partly this is caused by theshortfalls in the overall budget for drugs: only 50%of the drug requirements are coveredby the budget. The field study in the Angoche district in Mozambique revealed how the drug supply sys- tem works in practice: delays in provision, insufficient quantities supplied, transportproblems, and problems with drug quality are reported. Due to the problems in drug sup-ply and quality, there have been regular ruptures in supply in the past four years. Duringthe period of field observation, all health centre pharmacies were almost empty; evenchloroquine and aspirin were not available. Observations of drug prescription practices indicate that when the drugs are available, the quality of prescribing is relatively good. Regarding the implementation of the essential drugs programme in Yemen, YEMDAP, progress has been made in the drafting of legislation, contributing to the setting up of adrug fund which will operate as a semi-autonomous revolving drug fund. A national drugpolicy has been formulated and essential drugs lists and treatment guides published and distributed. A mechanism for procuring drugs has been set up, and a first batch of drugsworth 4.1 million Euros distributed to regional warehouses. However, here too, problemsoccurred further down the pipeline. Key persons indicated that it was unlikely that thesedrugs ever reached the health centres. The second batch of drugs, also worth 4.1 millionEuros, served as the start-up 'capital' for the Drug Fund. At the time of the evaluation, itwas impossible to judge to what extent these drug had reached peripheral health centres.The field study revealed that most essential drugs were available in the main centres, butnot in the sub-centres. Even when available, essential drugs were not prescribed by healthworkers, indicating a degree of neglect in the training of health workers on rational druguse in the essential drugs programme. The main problem concerning the rational use of drugs in the health centres in Hodeidah, was that the physicians on duty during the curative service hours, distrust the essential drugs supplied to the health centres by generic name. Physicians tend toprescribe pharmaceuticals by trade names. Private pharmacists around the health centre,and pharmaceutical representatives visiting physicians on duty, encourage this practice.Physicians sometimes even instruct patients to go to the pharmacy to buy a specific tradename, and to return to them in order to check whether this has happened. This practicecontradicts their protocols. As a consequence, people are paying unnecessarily highprices for drugs which can also be obtained as generics from health centres. The negative findings on rational drug prescription in the field studies in Hodeidah and Kaya, can be explained in part by the fact that the national essential drugs programmeshave neglected this issue. Some educational initiatives were developed in Yemen, where YEMDAP included a course on teaching rational pharmacotherapy for teaching staff atuniversities and health manpower institutes. Also, public information materials havebeen developed on drug use during pregnancy and schoolbooks published on the rationaluse of drugs. However, in terms of reaching out to the prescribing health worker and the general public, coverage of this issue is limited. Thus, while overall the supply of essentialdrugs has improved, the positive effects of the intervention are likely to be limited due toproblems linked to distribution and the irrational use of drugs. 7.2.3 Efficiency The efficiency of Dutch development co-operation support to CAMEG in Burkina Faso is judged to be good. With a relatively small amount of support, the institution was 129health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issueshealth, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 130strengthened and it is now a self-financing NGO. However, efficiency problems were reported at the beginning of the programme. An audit identified the following problemsin the management of the drug supply: delays in the supply of drugs, expiry of drugs andinadequate amounts supplied. In Yemen and Mozambique, 80% and 90% respectively ofthe funds are spent on drug procurement. In Yemen, procurement is conducted efficient-ly by the Ministry of Health; in the Mozambique programme, drug procurement wasimplemented by the Dutch company \"Nederlands Inkoop Centrum\". This is surprising, asthe other donors who have pooled their contributions for drugs, have assigned this respon-sibility to the Mozambique Ministry of Health, which has set up an autonomous agency todeal with procurement (CMAM). It seems inefficient to utilise two different procurement mechanisms to provide support to the Mozambique essential drugs programme. In both Yemen and Mozambique, problems are reported in the drug distribution system. In Mozambique, drugs are distributed to the peripheral level in drug kits. A kit-relatedefficiency problem is that drugs differ from kit to kit, and shortages of some drugs canoccur before the next batch of kits arrive, as illustrated by the data from the Angoche fieldstudy and presented above. In 1997, an external evaluation revealed that only a fraction ofthe drugs that are not distributed as kits reached the districts. In Yemen, there is no data from YEMDAP on the efficiency of supply of the first batch of drugs sent to the health centres. Key informants suggested that there were distributionproblems, as the logistical system of the essential drugs programme still needed to bestrengthened. This is partly due to delays in implementation and partly to reductions inbudget (from US$9 million to US$2 million) of the World Bank programme for improvingthe storage and supply of drugs. The use of the second batch of drugs as starting capital in the newly set up revolving drug fund, can potentially encourage a more efficient use of donor support. The policy of thisnew Drug Fund, consistent with the Health Reform policy of the Ministry of Health,entails health centres receiving a budget for drugs, that they then purchase from regionalwarehouses. The health centres then have to sell these drugs, in order to have resourcesavailable for the next supply of drugs. The Drug Fund has only started and its efficiencywill need to be monitored and evaluated. For logistical reasons, the evaluation teams could not collect primary data on the drug distribution system in the whole country. Key informant interviews, and the field-observa-tions presented above, point to the following efficiency problems in the drug distribution system: delays in the supply of drugs; these are reported in Angoche district. Delays occur at every step in the drug distribution system. poor storage and management of drug inventories, leading to expiry of drugs or quality deterioration. Expired drugs were reported in the Nampula store inMozambique and observed in the Hodeidah health centres. theft of drugs during transport to health centres. It is very hard to find proof of such practices. Key informant interviews in Mozambique and Yemen indicated that thismight be a problem. Moreover the 1996/7 external evaluation report on the distribu-tion of drugs (not kits) in Mozambique determined that drugs 'disappear'. lack of appropriate estimates of drug requirements leading to shortages of some drugs and excesses of others. This is likely to occur in Yemen where no system toestimate drug requirements has yet been set up. drug kits do not meet the drug needs in the district; as a result shortages of some drugs occur before the next kit arrives. In all three countries studied, patients pay user-fees to the health services. In Mozam- bique, patients pay a fixed fee for treatment, which is very low and is unlikely to limit poorpeople's access to treatment. In Burkina Faso and Yemen, people pay a fixed fee for theconsultation and a variable fee for drugs. The more drugs required, the more they pay. In such schemes, problems occur regarding regime compliance because of people's(in)capacity to pay. To be successful, user fee mechanisms must generally be accompanied by perceived improvements in the quality of services. This implies that improved supply mechanismsfor drugs are simultaneously prerequisites and outputs of successful programmes. A recent review of experiences with revolving drug funds and community drug schemes,concluded that the following factors are necessary to improve drug availability, equity ofaccess and efficiency. These include: local retention and control of revenue (as is planned in the Drug Fund programme in Yemen) reliable supply of low-cost, good quality drugs continued public subsidy for the poor and other target groups a businesslike orientation to personnel, financial and supply management 131health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issueshealth, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 132Assessments of the efficiency of drug supply should take the private sector into consider- ation as well. In Yemen and Burkina Faso, the fact is that people mostly buy drugs fromthe private sector (accounting for 90 and 80% respectively of expenditures on pharmaceu-ticals.) They pay relatively large amounts of money out of pocket, in comparison to whatthey would pay in the public sector for essential drugs. A good deal of this unnecessaryexpenditure could be prevented, if people understood (via education on rational druguse) that the generics supplied in the public sector offer better value for money. As wehave seen above, public health workers in Yemen continue to prescribe brand name drugsdespite the availability of essential drugs in their health centres. The efficiency of essen-tial drugs programmes could be greatly enhanced, were more attention to be paid totraining and educating health workers and consumers on rational drug use. 7.2.4 Concluding remarks The evaluation results confirm that implementation of a comprehensive, essential drugsprogramme is not an easy task. The programmes included in the evaluation in the threecountries all still have difficulties in ensuring a regular supply of drugs to health facili-ties. In Burkina Faso drug supply functions relatively well, but in Mozambique and Yemen it is deficient. The drug supply system is managed differently in the three countries. In Mozambique and Yemen, it is still a purely public sector responsibility. But in Burkina Faso, anautonomous non-profit agency has been set up, whose main objective is to increase thepopulation's access to affordable generic drugs. The advantages of this kind autonomoussupply system over a central medical store in the Ministry of Health are as follows: flexible management of resources and personnel the supply system is easily monitored the agency can operate a revolving fund mechanism the non-profit status of the organisation means that it can concentrate on promoting 'social' equity in access to drugs, rather than pursuing commercial aims A disadvantage, compared to the private sector, is that there is no competition. The agency is the sole provider of essential drugs to the public sector. It operates as a monop-oly. Revolving drug funds that rely on systems of user fees are being implemented in Yemen and Burkina Faso. While increasing the sustainability of the essential drugs programmes,133health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues a problem with user fees is that they are unaccompanied by exemption mechanisms for the poorest. This compromises equity. Both systems are decentralised, with revenues col-lected at the local level, and this allows the management of both funds and drugs to takeplace closer to the end-users. Strong supervisory mechanisms and other forms ofaccountability, such as community health committees, are essential to prevent efficiencyproblems. Rational drug use education in all countries has not been implemented well, severely limiting the effectiveness of the essential drugs programmes in making drugs accessibleto people who need them. Access to essential drugs has become an important issue in theglobal health policy arena in response to the problems identified in the treatment ofmajor infectious diseases: malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS. To control these infectious diseases new medicines are needed, which are often still too expensive to be included in essentialdrugs programmes, as they are still covered by patent protection and the manufacturerscan set the price. Since the late 1990's, various global public-private partnerships havebeen set up with an aim increasing access to these newer types of drugs and making themaccessible to populations in need. Strong essential drugs programmes, integrated in thepublic health system, are needed to make such drugs accessible to people in countrieslike Yemen, Burkina Faso and Mozambique. With the lion's share of attention beingdevoted to the drug access issue in the global health arena, there is a risk that the ratio-nal use of drugs will continue to receive too little attention in the implementation ofessential drugs programmes. In providing support to essential drugs programmes, anappropriate balance between supply activities, and training to enhance the rational use ofdrugs, is essential. 7.3 Support to disease control programmes 7.3.1 Introduction Dutch health-related development co-operation has been used to support two nationaldisease control programmes in the three countries selected for the evaluation. These are:assistance to the leprosy component of the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control(NTLC) programme in Mozambique, and support to the National Tuberculosis ControlProgramme in Burkina Faso. The programme in Mozambique aims at supporting the NTLC programme in the reduc- tion of leprosy prevalence and incidence. The short-term objective is to provide multi-drug treatment to all registered leprosy patients. The programme is carried out in three provinces in the northern region: Nampula, Niassa and Cabo Delgado, where 80% of theleprosy patients live. The implementing agency is a Dutch NGO, the Netherlands LeprosyControl Society. Dutch support is primarily for technical assistance and improved casedetection and treatment. In Burkina Faso, the tuberculosis control programme has nation-wide coverage and is implemented by the Ministry of Health. Support to the programme responded to the re-emergence of TB related to the AIDS epidemic. The programme aims at the detection andproper treatment of tuberculosis cases. It involves the training of personnel, structuralimprovements in the health services including support for diagnostic equipment, and theimplementation of direct observed treatment with short course treatment scheme(DOTS). Both these programmes are set up as vertical programmes. They are relevant in terms of targeting diseases that are prevalent in Mozambique and Burkina Faso. The respectiveMinistries of Health have developed national policies and programmes. DutchDevelopment Co-operation does not have a specific policy for the control of these infec-tious diseases. The main policy aim is towards integration of such 'vertical' programmesin PHC. In line with health reform policies, integration tends to be sought at the district levels of health care. A fully integrated programme at this level means that district health teamsplan, implement and co-ordinate all health programmes. This is not the case for the TBand leprosy programmes evaluated, which have separate resource flows, objectives andwork plans. Here, integration takes place at the level of the public health centres, wherehealth staff carry out the case-detection and treatment of leprosy (in Mozambique) andTB (in Burkina Faso), in addition to their other health-related tasks. In Mozambique, thelevel to which Dutch support is integrated in the national health system is open to ques-tion, as it only covers the leprosy component of the NTLC programme. 7.3.2 Effectiveness For both leprosy and TB control, the problem is that good case-detection is a prerequisitefor control. Without that, transmission continues in households and communities.Passive case-detection, where patients are diagnosed when they come to clinics, is notefficient in health systems where the public health services are under-utilised. Active casehealth, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 134finding however, is expensive. For both infectious diseases, multi-drug treatment regimes exist which are highly effective if taken appropriately. The treatment has to be taken overa period of six months for leprosy in Mozambique, and eight months for Tuberculosis inBurkina Faso. Health services need to ensure compliance with such long treatmentregimes. For TB, DOTS has been introduced to enhance compliance. Patients have tocome to the health centre to obtain their medicines. In Burkina Faso, the National Tuberculosis Control Programme has contributed to an increased recognition of the number of TB patients, and adequate treatment practicesusing the DOTS regime. However, the planned objectives were not realistic. The aim todouble the detection-rate of TB patients, from 25% to 50% in the period 1995-1997, wasnot achieved. The objective was subsequently reformulated to target a 20% annualincrease in cases detected. Low detection rates are caused by the low utilisation of thehealth services by the population. It must also be admitted that the programme did notsufficiently realise how much time would be needed to strengthen the capacity of the TBcontrol staff. The eight months treatment method selected in the programme is highlyeffective. However, the number of TB patients who actually complete the treatment is still relatively low. During the period 1996-1999, only about one quarter of the estimated pop-ulation of TB patients were detected and started treatment. In Mozambique, the leprosy programme is relatively small and it has well-defined aims and activities that did not change over time. Hence the original plans were realistic. Thedetection and cure rates increased, but lack of an adequate information system makes ithard to verify if the aim of 75% treatment compliance had been reached in 1997, when theprogramme ended. In the field study, it was found that in the health centres which gener-ally lacked supplies of essential drugs, leprosy drugs were always available. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the disease control programmes varies with health facility utilisation. In Burkina Faso, utilisation is low, and thus the TB control programmedid not succeed in its objectives. In Mozambique, utilisation is higher and the leprosycontrol programme increased case detection and treatment. 7.3.3 Efficiency The targeted nature of vertical disease control programmes enhances their effectiveness,because a relatively large amount of technical support and resources are given to meetclearly-defined objectives. However, efficiency and sustainability can be compromised as 135health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issuescompared to a more integrated implementation of the programme. The limited efficiency of the Burkina Faso programme is due to the low number of patients treated. InMozambique, support for the leprosy programme is relatively limited, and the pro-gramme is judged as cost-effective. The administration of both programmes was trans-parent, and no irregularities in fund use were detected. 7.3.4 Concluding remarks Development co-operation donors increasingly intend to support integrated health pro-grammes rather than focused disease control programmes. The results of the evaluationshow that with targeted support, short term objectives can be met. But, as was the case inBurkina Faso, programme effectiveness is highly dependent on the extent to which peopleutilise the health services, participate in public health campaigns and comply with treat-ment regimes. A well-functioning public health system, with strong mechanisms forcommunity participation, and a regular supply of essential drugs, is a prerequisite forsustainable disease control programmes. Efficiency issues, related to the targeted disease control programmes, need to be viewed in the context of other major diseases suffered by the population. There are serious dilem-mas here which have to be faced. Can paying 97US$ per case of TB cured, be justified in acontext where children die unnecessarily of diarrhoea and pneumonia? One must takeinto consideration that diseases like leprosy and TB are infectious, and untreated caseslead to increased transmission. Treatment not only benefits the individuals who arecured, it also limits the further spread of the disease. In health reform programmes, pri-ority setting in public health is decentralised. Ideally, such planning allows for prioritiesto be set in line with the local needs of the population. With limited resources, choicesneed to be made. 7.4 Comparative assessment of support to reproductive health programmes, including HIV/AIDS 7.4.1 Introduction The country studies included an evaluation of six different reproductive health pro-grammes. Their objectives, activities, and scope vary strongly. All programmes concen-trate on a more or less specific activity or area: census, reproductive health study, curricu-lum development, MCH/FP, HIV /AIDS, and training of community midwives. health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 136Reproductive health is a priority of both Dutch development co-operation in the area of Health, Women and Development, and of the three countries involved. The principlesadopted at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development have beenunderlined in Dutch policy, but no operational guidelines nor common framework existon how to implement reproductive health care programmes at national level. The diversi-ty in objectives and scope of the programmes found in the country studies reflects this. All three countries adhered to the principles of, and the rights to, reproductive health care. However, it seems that plans to integrate reproductive health into the primary health care systems have not yet been formulated, and that reproductive health pro-grammes are not - explicitly - connected to PHC programmes. The identification andformulation of Reproductive Health Programmes, with support funded from the DutchHealth, Nutrition and Population budgets, was not based on a comprehensive analysis ofreproductive health problems and subsequent priority setting in the three countries. 7.4.2 Effectiveness Four of the six reproductive health programmes have been rather successful in achievingtheir objectives. Three of these programmes had clearly-defined objectives, and a relative-ly short period to attain them. These are: the census-project in Mozambique; the repro-ductive health study in Burkina Faso; and the development of a reproductive health cur-riculum for the public health training institute (ENSP) in the same country. The fourtheffective programme (AIDS/PSI in Mozambique) also has clearly defined objectives, but itis not short term. Document review and key person interviewing revealed that the pro-gramme improved awareness on HIV/AIDS and increased condom use. In the field studyin Angoche, the increased awareness on HIV/AIDS was confirmed. However, condom usewas very low. The effectiveness of the midwife training programme in Yemen was limited,as training materials were considered too theoretical. The UNFPA projects in Burkina Faso were not effective. 7.4.3 Efficiency The four reproductive health programmes that were most effective, were also efficient.These four programmes had/have good monitoring systems in common, which allowedfor objectives and work plans to be adapted to the reality on the ground. The leasteffective programme, the UNFPA programme in Burkina Faso, was also very inefficient. A number of management problems were reported. An inadequate institutional frame- 137health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issueswork, communication problems between the donor, the executing agency and local partners, and inappropriately functioning monitoring systems (internal and external)compounded the difficulties. In the community midwife training programme, pastexperiences were insufficiently taken into consideration. 7.4.4 Concluding remarks The reproductive health programmes cannot be compared, because there is no commonframework to them. In the evaluation, it became clear that the Dutch policy of support forreproductive health is reflected in the support given to a variety of reproductive healthprogrammes. The main problem is, that the identification of support is not based on agood analysis of the reproductive health problems in the country, nor on appropriate pri-ority settings at national level. There is also no framework for integrating the concept ofreproductive health in existing primary health care programmes. Despite these limitations in relevance of the projects, the assessment makes clear that the effectiveness and efficiency of the projects that have been supported, isrelatively good. Four of the six projects appear to be achieving the objectives that were set in arelatively efficient way.health, nutrition and population | Synthesis of findings and emerging issues 138Annex 1 Policy and Operations Evaluation Department The Policy and Operations Evaluation Department, in Dutch the Inspectie Ontwikkelings- samenwerking en Beleidsevaluatie (IOB), is responsible for conducting evaluations of Dutch foreign policy. IOB is part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is an independent unit which reports directly either to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Minister of Development Co-opera- tion. The Minister concerned submits IOB reports to Parliament, where they are discussed by the Permanent Committee on Foreign Affairs with respect to follow up actions. IOB was established in 1977 with a mandate that was restricted to the evaluation of aid programmes. Following the reassessment of Dutch foreign policy in 1996, IOB\u00d5s mandate was broadened to include other fields of foreign policy. From 1977 to mid-1980s, IOB\u00d5s emphasis was on individual project evaluations, the status of which was then confidential. Since the mid-1980s, emphasis has shifted to comprehen- sive thematic studies, focusing on policies and modalities of implementation and cover- ing sectors, themes or programmes. External independent experts participate in the vari- ous phases of the research, under responsibility of IOB. Increasingly, institutions or experts in recipient countries are invited to participate in the fieldwork. A reference group consisting of independent experts and Ministry staff is appointed for each study to advise on the methodology and approach of the evaluation. The final reports, based on various field and desk studies, are written by IOB\u00d5s own staff and published under its responsibility. Examples of recent studies include PalestinianTerritories, Hulp door Handel (Aid through trade), Oret/Miliev review 1994- 1999, Institutional Development, Revue de la coop\u008eration entre le Mali et Les Pays-Bas (review of the co-operation between Mali and the Netherlands), and De Kunst van het Internationaal Cultuurbeleid (International Policy on Culture). 139health, nutrition and population | Annex 1IOB also participates in multi-donor evaluations. Examples of this include the evaluation of: the World Food Programme, the European Union Food Aid Programme, Emergency Assistance to Rwanda, European Union Aid: ACP, MED, ALA Programmes and Humanitarian Aid, and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF).health, nutrition and population | Annex 1 140Annex 2 Terms of Reference for the evaluation of health, nutrition and population 28 July 2000 1 Introduction The Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB)\u00d5s programme for 2000 includes an evaluation of Dutch co-operation in the field of health, nutrition and population, with- in the poverty reduction cluster. Evaluations in this cluster should focus more than in the past on the perspective and situation of the poor themselves when addressing the rele- vance, effectiveness, efficiency and impact of interventions. The approach will involve: preliminary studies in the countries selected for evaluation and input from investigating teams to help provide a basis for the methodology of the investigations. This means that, following extensive preliminary studies, separate terms of reference will be drawn up for each country evaluation. These general terms of reference will contain background infor- mation, objectives, general issues to be addressed, the plan of action, a definition of the scope of the investigation, a general methodological framework and information about the way the activities will be organised, the expected product and the budget. They will also define and delimit the scope of the evaluation. 2 Rationale Health has been an important element of Dutch development co-operation since the 1970s. Thanks in part to international trends, a policy on health emerged and was adapt- ed over time. At first, the emphasis was on improving curative treatment in hospitals. Later, it shifted to prevention and primary health care. During the 1990s, the organisation and financing of health care came into the foreground. In addition, Dutch policy began to devote more attention to nutrition and reproductive health. Since 1998, policy has aimed at a sector-wide approach that in the long run will ideally lead to sectoral budget support. In more than half of the countries in which multi-sectoral bilateral co-operation is to con- tinue, health has been chosen as a priority sector. 141health, nutrition and population | Annex 2IOV, IOB\u00d5s forerunner, evaluated health care co-operation in the period from 1975 to 1984. The results are contained in a 1987 report on hospital care and a 1988 report on primary health care. Health was also one topic covered in 1998 country evaluations of Egypt and Bangladesh. Reproductive health figured in the 1998 evaluation on women and develop- ment. The above-mentioned changes in policy, the fact that the last programme evaluation in the health field took place over ten years ago, the importance of health within develop- ment co-operation and a request from the relevant policy theme department form the rationale for evaluating the programme. 3 Background 3.1 Health and poverty Morbidity and mortality rates in poor countries have fallen dramatically in the past thirty years, thanks in part to economic growth and improved basic services. However, the divide between rich and poor countries and between rich and poor social groups within countries remains enormous. For instance, in the least developed countries child mortali- ty is twenty times as high as in the industrial world and maternal mortality almost eighty times as high (according to the 1999 HDR). Poverty, in the form of inadequate income and inadequate access to important services like drinking water, sanitary facilities, education and health care, is at the root of many diseases, infectious or otherwise, and is therefore to blame for the deaths that these diseases cause. However, it is not possible to indicate exactly how much influence each aspect of poverty has on health and disease. This is first of all because the terms health and disease cover a wide range of phenomena and have different meanings in relation to different age groups. Still, the main underlying cause of a specific disease often can be traced. Secondly, the above-mentioned aspects of poverty are interconnected. This makes it difficult to determine the role of individual factors, such as health care. Nonetheless, it has been clearly shown that poor people are more often sick, that they die earlier and that the quality of health care is a factor. Disease stands in the way of productivity and thereby perpetuates poverty. Disease can sap a household\u00d5s budget and leave inadequate resources to meet other basic needs. It can also lead to debt, which can in turn plunge people into a lifetime of crushing povertyhealth, nutrition and population | Annex 2 142at the minimum subsistence level. So, investment in health means investment in poverty reduction. Investing in health , a 1993 World Bank report, considers at length the link between disease and poverty. However, because poverty itself is caused by the interplay of many factors, the extent to which disease leads to poverty cannot be determined precise- ly. Accordingly, it is impossible to say just how much disease prevention contributes to poverty reduction. In short, good health care contributes to good health and good health contributes to poverty reduction. Still, the extent of the contribution and the exact role of health care are not entirely clear. 3.2 Development policy in the field of health, nutrition and population Dutch policy on health, nutrition and population has evolved more or less in step with international trends. In the 1960s and 1970s, aid went largely to hospital construction, equipment, medicine, staff and support for vertical programmes. At that time the World Bank mainly provided loans for vertical family planning programmes. Co-operation efforts did not take sufficient account of the morbidity pattern among the bulk of the population in poor countries. The international WHO conference in Alma-Ata in 1978 was a turning point. Universal access to health care became the rallying cry and attention shifted towards primary health care. Prevention, participation by the recipient population and co-operation with other sectors, such as water and sanitation, became key notions. According to this new perspective, village health workers were to take responsibility for a large share of preven- tive and simple curative medical care. In the Netherlands, this policy was set down in 1986 in a policy memorandum on health care. In 1991, the policy document \u00d2 Een wereld van verschil\u00d3 (A world of difference) and a speech by the Minister for Development Co-oper- ation confirmed this stance. The emphasis on access to health care pushed quality of care out of the spotlight. Slowly but surely, it became clear that this was a mistake. Awareness grew that prevention could only succeed when complemented by good curative care. Health care financing also began to receive more attention. The starting point was UNICEF\u00d5s Bamako initiative, in which the recipient population contributed to the cost of medicine. The result is that the focus of the international donor community has shifted to the organisation of health care. This generally includes support for health care reform initiatives, often as part of 143health, nutrition and population | Annex 2health, nutrition and population | Annex 2 144 more general public sector reform. The World Bank is instrumental in this process. In the Netherlands, the new focus on the organisation of health care was confirmed in 1997 in a speech by the Minister for Development Co-operation. Since 1998, policy has aimed at a sector-wide approach, ideally leading to sectoral budget support. Along with this new focus on organisation and reorganisation, a series of conferences in which the Netherlands participated in the 1990s raised new issues. The World Summit for Children breathed new life into mother and childcare programmes. The International Conference on Nutrition and the World Food Summit drew attention to the importance of nutrition. The International Conference on Population and Development introduced the term reproductive health and the International Conference on Women and Development confirmed its importance. At the same time, it was recognised that women\u00d5s health is dependent on women\u00d5s social status. Specific diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and later AIDS continued to receive attention throughout this period. In a number of memo- randa (on nutrition, family planning and reproductive health, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and children) the Netherlands set out its policy in specific fields and provided guidelines for its implementation. 3.3 Inventory of activities in the field of health, nutrition and population Table 1 Expenditures on health, nutrition and population 1995-1999 Health policy Sub-area Number of Expenditure per sub- Expenditure per health % area activities area (x 1000) policy area (x 1000) NLG Euro NLG Euro Basic health 131.376 59.616 9.2 services General 93 126.057 5720 Research 919 Training 9 3393 168.933 76.659 General Research 27 12.902 Training 4 1487 675 AIDS prevention 145.190 65.884 10.1 and control General 124 112.421 51.014 Research 21 32.584 14.786 Training 2 185 84145health, nutrition and population | Annex 2 Health policy Sub-area Number of Expenditure per sub- Expenditure per health % area activities area (x 1000) policy area (x 1000) NLG Euro NLG Euro Essential drugs 178.561 81.028 12.5 General 65 178.225 80.875 Research 2 336 153 Training Reproductive 604.546 274.331 42.2 health General 123 587.624 265.291 Research Training 95.271 43.232 6.5 General 110 85.257 9 1845 Training- 818 1.433.241 650.376 MIDAS KBE (smallest administrative unit) 737, 803, 804, 805, 917 and 782 (relevant activities) as well as CRS 93108, 93109, 93210 and 93350 (relevant activities that do not fall under the above-mentioned KBEs).4 Goal of the evaluation and key questions The overall goal of the evaluation is to determine how much activities in the field of health, nutrition and population have contributed, directly or indirectly, to combating disease and death, especially among the poor. As section 3.1 explains, health and disease are consequences of many related factors. The role of health care and improvements in it cannot be quantified. Nor is it usually possible to quantify the extent to which the activities supported by the Netherlands improve health care. However, figures can be given for certain indicators, both in the field of health, nutrition and population and in service provision. If an activity takes place in a limited geographical area and has a clearly defined target group, several of these indicators can be used to estimate the extent to which it contributes to the general goal. The potential contribution of other activities to reducing morbidity and mortality rates will have to be determined on the basis of their compatibility with policy and their effectiveness. Key questions are classified by theme below. Note that they are not presented in order of priority. I Basis and coherence of the programme \u00a5 What considerations led to the current programme of activities in the field of health, nutrition and population and where did the initiative come from? \u00a5 How do the activities compare to efforts in other sectors by the Netherlands and other actors, particularly in areas that have a strong impact on health (often stronger than the influence of health care), such as water and sanitation, income improvement and education? \u00a5 What considerations led to the selection of specific activities within the programme? In the light of other actors\u00d5 efforts, is the programme coherent? II Policy context \u00a5 How is national health policy, including the allocation of the budget, determined? Key issues: drafting, planning and participation. \u00a5 Policy priorities: are the health problems of the poor a policy priority? If so, in what way do they receive priority? Key issues: prevention and education, nutrition, infec- tious disease, reproductive health, women\u00d5s issues and budget allocation.health, nutrition and population | Annex 2 146\u00a5 Organisation of health care: Do the poor have access to health services? Key issues: reorganisation, decentralisation, the role of the private sector, the insurance system and safety nets. \u00a5 How do national authorities in public health and other areas co-ordinate internation- al co-operation in the field of health, nutrition and population? III Compatibility with policy, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact Compatibility with policy \u00a5 To what extent is the programme of activities supported by the Netherlands compati- ble with national health policy? \u00a5 What are the similarities or differences between national health policy and Dutch development policy in the field of health, nutrition and population? Effectiveness \u00a5 Were the objectives feasible and workable? \u00a5 How much did potential clients use the services provided via the activity? Key issues: accessibility, in both the physical and the social/cultural sense, and the quality of ser- vice. Efficiency \u00a5 How much of the Dutch budget, the recipient country\u00d5s budget and the implement- ing partner\u00d5s budget was spent on a given activity? \u00a5 Did the activity proceed as planned? Key issues: sources of delay and overheads. \u00a5 Did monitoring take place? Key issues: quality of monitoring and changes made in response to monitoring. Sustainability \u00a5 How deeply is a given activity embedded in the health care system? Key issues: sus- tainability within national policy (coverage of costs and financing), capacity build- ing, percentage of people trained staying in health care jobs. Impact (case studies) \u00a5 What changes have there been in key health and health care indicators? Key issues: child mortality, malnourished children under five, the incidence of common dis- eases, vaccination rate and use of health services. 147health, nutrition and population | Annex 2health, nutrition and population | Annex 2 148 \u00a5 Are there indications that interventions financed by the Netherlands have con- tributed to any changes noted? \u00a5 How does the public rate health services? Key issues: satisfaction, frequency of use and reasons given. Side effects \u00a5 What side effects has a given activity or package of activities had? Key issues: personnel diverted from health care system, funding diverted from national budget and vertical programmes. 5 Scope of the investigation The range of activities in the field of health, nutrition and population is so wide that it is impossible to analyse all of them. A selection has thus been made. The evaluation will be limited to three countries. The first criterion for selection is that the country must be one of the 17+ 4 (seventeen plus four) countries and it must have chosen the health sector as a priority. Other criteria are the total amount of aid to the sector in the past five years, the amount of aid per capi- ta, whether the programme is varied, whether it is possible to carry out a case study and whether an evaluation has taken place recently or is scheduled to take place in the near future. Ethiopia has been excluded because it has not been decided whether co-operation will continue. Ghana because the relationship has not existed long enough to be evaluat- ed.

This overview includes some general information about population, the health situation and health care, as well as a brief description of the programme receiving Dutch aid. On the basis of the above criteria, Yemen, Mozambique and Burkina Faso have been selected. The entire range of health, nutrition and population activities in these countries will be evaluated. This means that the programme will be described, and 149health, nutrition and population | Annex 2 activities that ended in the period 1995-1999 and current activities that have been in progress for at least two years will be evaluated. Furthermore, an in-depth case study of a single district health care or primary health care programme will be carried out in each country. Finally, projects in the countries selected that receive Dutch financing but fall outside the bilateral programme will also be included in the evaluation. The chief activities in this category are those of the co-financing organisations and the SNV (the Netherlands Development Organisation), as well as personnel services. Evaluations of these activities will mainly be based on their compatibility with national health policy and the extent to which they supplement the bilateral programme. The effectiveness and efficiency of these programmes will not be considered in the evaluation. The International Education programme (which includes scholarships and regional edu- cation programmes) and all activities with a total expenditure of less than NLG 100.000 (45.378 Euros) will not be included in the evaluation. The duration of the evaluation will be one and a half years. Fieldwork will take two months in each country. 6 Approach and methodology 6.1 Approach The evaluation will take place in four stages. The first stage, in which relevant policy doc- uments were analysed and the activities were inventoried, is now complete. The terms of reference are partly based on the findings of this exploratory stage. The second stage involves a large-scale preliminary investigation of the countries select- ed. This investigation will: \u00a5 describe the health situation and health policy in each country; \u00a5 analyse files (activity numbers) in the field of health, nutrition and population; \u00a5 identify evaluation teams; \u00a5 inventory the evaluations carried out by other organisations or donors in the coun- tries selected; and \u00a5 develop a detailed methodological proposal for the studies within each country.health, nutrition and population | Annex 2 150At the end of this stage, the evaluation teams will meet to finalise the methodology they are to apply. Specific terms of reference for the evaluations within each country will be based on the results of this meeting. The third stage comprises fieldwork, which will lead to individual country reports. The fourth and final stage comprises: \u00a5 the revision of the country reports; \u00a5 the drafting of a comprehensive report; and the presentation of the results. 6.2 Methodology To answer the key questions of the evaluation, a variety of strategies and methods will be needed. A brief description of these methods follows, arranged by theme. Preliminary studies will result in specific methodological proposals for each country evaluation, including the methods of compiling data. 6.3 Basis of policy The evaluation will take the form of a situation analysis. The role of each partner in deci- sion-making will be investigated. Data will be compiled by means of a literature review (including unofficial sources), an examination of the files and interviews with key figures. 6.4 Policy context This part of the evaluation involves reconstructing policy. Most of the data will be com- piled by means of a literature review (including unofficial sources). Interviews with key figures will provide supplementary information. 6.5 Policy relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact A logical framework analysis will be employed for this part of the evaluation. Case studies (of district programmes) will examine indicators of impact, such as child mortality and vaccination rates, and use of services. Data will be compiled by means of a semi-struc- tured survey of a random sample of the population. Other methods will include observa- tion of health services and interviews with health workers. More detailed information about indicators, sources and methods of compiling data will be incorporated into the terms of reference of the individual country evaluations. 151health, nutrition and population | Annex 2For the other activities, indicators of use and quality of services will be examined. Data will be compiled by means of a literature review, observation of health services and interviews with health workers using a structured questionnaire. Where possible, these activities will be incorporated into the questionnaires for the case studies. More detailed information about indicators, sources and methods of compiling data for each activity will be incorporated into the terms of reference of the individual country evaluations. 7 Organisation IOB inspector Marijke Stegeman is responsible for organising and co-ordinating the implementation of the evaluation. In stage 2, junior investigator Sabine Ravestijn will be involved in the inventory of activities and examination of the files in preparation for the fieldwork. The medical anthropology unit at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) will assist with stages 2, 3 and 4, with Anita Hardon heading the investigation. This department, in collaboration with the IOB, will produce a methodological proposal and organise a train- ing seminar on methods of investigation. It will also supervise fieldwork, draft country reports and produce a comprehensive report based on the country reports, together with the inspector. If necessary, other outside experts will be called in. Investigating teams from the recipient countries will carry out the fieldwork (stage 3), after taking part in the methodological seminar (stage 2). An internal focus group will be assembled. This group will comprise the relevant country desks and the Ministry\u00d5s divi- sions concerned with poverty reduction and social policy. Other outside experts, at national and international level, will be asked to submit written suggestions concerning the terms of reference of the country evaluations and, if desired, on the progress of the evaluation as a whole. 8 Products The following publications are anticipated: \u00a5 a discussion paper on methodology for the evaluation of health programmes \u00a5 a report on the Burkina Faso country evaluation \u00a5 a report on the Yemen country evaluation \u00a5 a report on the Mozambique country evaluation \u00a5 a comprehensive final reporthealth, nutrition and population | Annex 2 1529 Schedule Stage 1 complete (January-April 2000) Stage 2 May-October 2000 Stage 3 October 2000-April 2001 Stage 4 April-August 2001 10 Budget NLG Euro 1. staff senior investigators (UvA) stage 2 (25-day preliminary investigation) 30.000 13.613 (3-day seminar) 5.000 2.269 stage 3 (3 x days) 80.000 36.302 stage 4 (25 days) 30.000 13.613 junior investigator (stage 1 en 2) 60.000 27.227 country teams (stage 3) 240.000 108.907 (2 senior or 1 senior plus 2 junior investigators per team; in total, NLG 2000 (Euro 908) per day x 40 days x 3 countries) other outside expertise to be determined 2. travel expenses stage 2 24.000 10.890 (estimate based on 9 x NLG 2000 (Euro 908) for seminar plus 3 x NLG 2000 (Euro 908) for junior investigators) stage 3 18.000 8.168 (estimate, 3 x NLG 6000 ( Euro 2.723) for senior investigators) DSA (Daily Subsistence Allowance) stage 2 16.000 7.260 stage 3 48.000 21.782 (based on NLG 400 (Euro 182) per day plus 153health, nutrition and population | Annex 2seminar (9 x NLG 400 (Euro 182)) plus junior investigators (30 x NLG 400 (Euro 182)) plus senior investigators (120 x NLG 400 ( Euro182)) 3. seminar in the Netherlands 20.000 9.076 (estimate) 4. local expenses workshops in countries selected 45.000 20.420 local transport; administration 30.000 13.613 5. production costs for country reports and final report (incl. translation) 100.000 population | Annex 2 154Annex 3 Organisation of the study 1 Preparations The first step was to create an inventory of relevant policy documents and money flows. Then, after the country selection, all files of aid activities in the field of health, nutrition and population in Mozambique, Yemen and Burkina Faso both at the department and in the embassies, were scrutinised. Important documents with respect to programme and project objectives and implementation were summarised and copied. This work was car- ried out by Ms Sabine Ravestijn, MA, in the period February through August 2000. In addition, the medical anthropological of the University of Amsterdam reviewed relevant health evaluation literature. 2 Country studies Ms Prof. Dr. Anita Hardon, head of the medical anthropological unit of the University of Amsterdam, elaborated an evaluation framework for the country studies. This model was discussed and finalised at a seminar with the country evaluation teams in October 2000. The country study in Burkina Faso was carried out from November 2000 until January 2001 by Prof. Dr. Blaise Sondo (University of Ouagadougou, team leader), Dr. Dominique Kyelem and Ms Dr. Suzanne Sobela. A team of four interviewers and one supervisor assist- ed in carrying out the field study. At a seminar in Kaya, Ms Jeanet van de Korput, MA, (University of Amsterdam) trained the field team in the use of the data collection meth- ods. These were also pre-tested. During the evaluation, Jeanet van de Korput and Ms Dr. Marijke Stegeman (IOB) provided technical assistance. The country study in Yemen was conducted from March 2001 until May 2001 by Dr. Ali Mohamed Assabri (University of Sana\u00d5a) and Prof. Dr. Abdulla Saeed Hattab (University of Aden). A field team of four interviewers, a statistician and a supervisor assisted in carry- ing out the field study. They were trained at a seminar in Hodeidah by Ms Elisabetta El- Karimy, MA, (University of Amsterdam), who co-ordinated and supervised the fieldwork. Anita Hardon and Marijke Stegeman provided technical assistance. 155health, nutrition and population | Annex 3health, nutrition and population | Annex 3 156Ms Irae Lundin, MA, Ms Fernanda Farinha, MA, Dr. Jorge de Barreto and Dr. Ricardo Barradas (consultants) conducted the country study in Mozambique from April 2001 until June 2001. A team of one supervisor and two interviewers assisted in carrying out the field study. Irae Lundin trained the team in the use of the data collection methods at a seminar in Nampula. Ms Trudie Gerrits, MA, (University of Amsterdam) and Marijke Stegeman provided technical assistance. Country study reports were submitted to relevant stakeholders in the countries con- cerned, to the desk officers and technical experts at the department and to some external advisors. Comments were analysed and, if applicable, incorporated in the final version of the country studies. 3 Synthesis report The final report was written by Marijke Stegeman, Anita Hardon and Trudie Gerrits. A draft version of the report was discussed with relevant stakeholders at the department and sent to relevant stakeholders in the countries concerned, for written comments. The comments, if applicable, were incorporated in the final version. Ms Helene Pulles, MA, assisted in the finalisation of the report and Mr. Jeff Lewis edited the report. 4 Co-ordination The study has been co-ordinated by Marijke Stegeman of the Policy and Operations Evaluation Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Anita Hardon, Trudie Gerrits and Jeanet van de Korput of the medical anthropological unit of the University of Amsterdam provided technical assistance. An internal advisory group composed of the desk officer of the Yemen desk, (Ir. Dick van Ginhoven), head of the social policy depart- ment (Ms Dr. Aagje Papineau Salm), experts of the social policy department (Dr. Harry van Schooten and Ms. Ir. Reina Buijs), deputy director IOB (Dr. Henri Jorritsma ) and one inspector IOB (Dr. Alex Bartelink) commented on the terms of reference, the findings of the field studies and the final report. External advice was given by Mr Erik Heydelberg, MA. 157health, nutrition and population | Annex 4 Annex 4 Detailed information on money flows 1 Procedure The inventory of money flows is based on the information system of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. First, relevant budget categories were selected. These were: Kbe 737, the country programme for social development. Kbe 803 (support to UNAIDS), 804 (support to UNFPA) and 805 (special multilateral pro- grammes). Kbe 917, subsidies to organisations. This category exists only since 1998. Kbe 782, aid to Surinam. In addition, a number of CRS codes relating to health were reviewed. A small number of activities did not fall in the budget categories mentioned above. They were mainly related to medical research and training. For these activities, a budget category \u00d4other\u00d5 was creat- ed. Then, a number of health policy areas were defined on the basis of major policy issues: primary health care, disease control, essential drugs, reproductive health, nutrition, an area including policy, basket funding and budget support and an area \u00d2other\u00d3. For each health policy area two sub-areas were created: research and training. Then, two policy areas were added, research and training, for research and training activities that are not related to one of the major policy areas. All activities in the budget categories mentioned were reviewed and on the basis of the title and the description of the objectives either skipped or placed in one of the health policy areas or sub-areas. If necessary, the project file was studied. To give some exam- ples: a malaria research project was placed in the policy area disease control, sub-area research. An inventory of the institutional capacity of a Ministry of Health was placed in the area: policy, basket funding and budget support. A rural water project, financed through budget category 737, was skipped.health, nutrition and population | Annex 4 158 158 2 Details on money flows Table 1 provides overall information on the distribution of money flows by budget category and by policy area.

and the second phase of the country studies are presented. The annex includes also an example of a ques- tionnaire. As the Burkina Faso and the Mozambique data collection tools are only avail- able in French and Portuguese respectively, the choice is made to present a Yemen data collection tool that is bilingual. Many data collection tools were elaborated, including checklists for key person interviewing; checklists for focus group discussions; question- naires for exit interviews; questionnaires for consultation observation; and questionnaires for the household survey. Here, the last one, as an example, will be presented. Evaluation questions The evaluation questions are given below for each of the six components in the evaluation framework. Note that only the questions related to components 1 and 2 were applied to all evaluated projects/programmes in the three countries. The questions for components 3-6 were only to be applied in the district field studies. 1 Donor health support a What considerations led to the current programme of activities in the field of health, nutrition and population? What was the rationale for supporting the activities? b To what extent is the Dutch support coherent with the health policy of the recipient country? c To what extent is the Dutch support complementary to activities supported by other donors; Do mechanisms exist for co-ordination with other donors? d Are there mechanisms to encourage multi-sectoral co-ordination with other health- related projects funded with Dutch Aid (for example with sanitation and income-gen- erating projects)? 2 Programme/project efforts a What is the justification for the project/programme and how is the situation analysed? Are the justification and situation analysis appropriate and relevant? b Is the project/programme coherent with the health policy of the recipient country? 165health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 Describe how it supports the policy, or fails to do so? Is it compatible with the Dutch health-aid policy? Specifically, has health reform been initiated, and if yes, is the activity coherent with the changes in health care structure resulting from health reform? c Were the objectives and work plans feasible? Did the objectives change over time? Were the changes justified? d Were the activities implemented according to plan? e Is an adequate monitoring system in place; is it used to adjust plans of activities? f Has the Ministry of Health in the recipient country developed guidelines that are relevant for the intervention? Is the intervention in coherence with these guidelines? Is it likely to result in improved guidelines? g Are funds efficiently used to meet the objectives? Specifically, is there an adequate balance between expatriate technical staff input and use of local expertise; and between investment costs and recurrent costs? Is an adequate accounting system in place? Have any problems in financial management been identified? h Is the programme/project sustainable, as reflected in contributions of the recipient country/population? Does the programme/project strengthen the institutional capaci- ty of the health services, and build capacity of staff. Are trained health workers likely to leave the health services? 3 Effects on structure of the health system a Has the project/programme led to improvements in health facilities and equipment? b Has the project/programme enhanced the technical skills and/or interpersonal skills of staff by means of training? c Are training materials and methods appropriate? Do treatment guidelines exist in the health facilities on how to prescribe the essential drugs? d Has the programme or project led to a regular supply of essential drugs and vaccines? Are essential drugs and vaccine-need calculated adequately? Have logistical prob- lems, which cause shortages of drugs, been resolved? Does leakage of essential drugs occur? e Has the programme /project improved motivation of staff? Are salaries paid regularly? f Has the financial accountability of the health services been improved? Do managers have the flexibility to adjust budget if required? g Does the programme /project result in an improved health information system? Does the information system capture at least immunisation coverage, contraceptive preva- lence, and utilisation of health services by health condition?health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 1664 Effects on performance of the health system a Does health personnel prescribe adequately for childhood ARI and diarrhoea? Are prescriptions in accordance with treatment guidelines? b Are there improvements in ante-natal care and delivery care? c Did the project/programme lead to increased responsiveness: \u00a5 do health personnel show respect for dignity of the person? \u00a5 do they respect autonomy of the client to participate in choices about one\u00d5s own health? \u00a5 are amenities of adequate quality, such as cleanliness, and is there private space for the consultation? \u00a5 are IEC activities strengthened? \u00a5 is community participation enhanced? d Are mechanisms in place to ensure that the poor have access to services? If the government has implemented a system of user-fees, what are the exemption criteria? How are the criteria implemented in practice? e Is there any evidence of discrimination on grounds of sex, age, marital status, ethnicity of class? 5 Changes in health behaviour a Did the activities result in increased utilisation of services? What other factors have affected utilisation of services? b Has perceived quality of care of the health services improved; how does it now com- pare with perceived quality of care in the private sector? Are the health premises per- ceived to be adequately clean? Is privacy sufficiently ensured? Are people\u00d5s perceived health needs met? c Has knowledge on good nutrition, appropriate treatment of childhood diseases and hygiene increased? d Do patients use medicines in accordance with the advice given in the health services (special attention for ARI/Diarrhoea)? To what extent do people go to public health services for these conditions? What other factors influence the rational treatment of these predominant health conditions? e Has the percentage of fully immunised children increased due to the improved responsiveness of the health services? f Has unmet need for family planning services decreased due to the improved respon- siveness of the health services? Has the use of contraceptives been affected negatively by changes in payment structure? g Has the use of condoms increased due to IEC efforts? 167health, nutrition and population | Annex 5health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 1686 Health outcomes a Have under-five and infant mortality rates decreased? Which factors can be related to these changes? Has improved performance of the health services contributed to any change? What is the impact of AIDS on these mortality figures? Can changes in the macro-economic environment or other societal changes explain the changes in health outcomes? b Has maternal mortality in the region decreased? What factors account for changes? Has improved performance of the health service contributed to any change? c Has fertility in the region decreased? Is this related to increased contraceptive preva- lence? Has improved performance of the health service contributed to any change? Have other factors, such as the AIDS epidemic, or changes in the economic environ- ment influenced fertility patterns?169health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 170 171health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 172 173health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 174 175health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 176 177health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 178 179health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 health, nutrition and population | Annex 5 180 181health, nutrition and population | Annex 6 Annex 6 Summary of the field studieshealth, nutrition and population | Annex 6 182 183health, nutrition and population | Annex 6 health, nutrition and population | Annex 6 184 185health, nutrition and population | Annex 6 health, nutrition and population | Annex 6 186 187health, nutrition and population | Annex 6 health, nutrition and population | Annex 6 188 189health, nutrition and population | Annex 6 Abbreviation List ABBEF Association Burkinab\u008e pour le Bien \u00e6tre Familial (Burkinabe associa- tion for family welfare) ADB African Development Bank AHO Aden Health Office ARI Acute respiratory infections BCG Bacille Calmette-Gu\u008erin CAMEG La Centrale d\u00d5Achat de Medicaments Essentiels of generic essential drugs purchase) CFA Communaut\u008e Financi\u008fre Africain (French financial community) CMAM Central de Medicamentos e Artigos M\u008edicos (Central agency for drugs and medical supplies) COGES Comit\u008e de gestion (Management Committee) CSPS Centre de sant\u008e et de promotion sociale (Health and social promotion centre) CRS-code Creditor reporting system Daly Disability adjusted life years DHS Demographic and health surveys DGIS Directoraat-Generaal Internationale Samenwerking (Directorate General International Co-operation) DOTS Directly observed treatment with short course therapy DPT Diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus DVL Directie Voorlichting (Information Service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) EDM Essential Drugs Management (Programme of WHO) ENSP \u0083cole Nationale de la Sant\u008e Publique (National School of Public Health) FGD Focus group discussions FNUAP Fonds des Nations Unies pour la Population (United Nations Population Fund) GDP Gross domestic product GTZ Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Technical Co- operation) 191health, nutrition and population | Abbreviation ListHHO Hodeidah Health Office HIS Health information system HNP Health, nutrition and population HNI Health Net International ICN International Conference on Nutrition ICPD International Conference on Population and Development ICRC International Committee of the Red Cross (and Red Crescent Movement) IEC Information education communication INE Instituto Nacional de Estad\u0092stica (National Statistical Institute) IOB Inspectie Ontwikkelingssamenwerking en Beleidsevaluatie Operations Evaluation Department) IOV Inspectie Ontwikkelingssamenwerking te Velde (Operation Review Unit) LDC Least developed country LCH Local health committee MCH/FP Mother and child health/family planning MIDAS Management Inhoudelijk Documentair Activiteiten Systeem (Management and Information System of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) MFO Medefinancieringsorganisatie (Co-financing Organisation) NDP National drug policy NGO Non-governmental Organisation NIC Nederlandse Inkoop Centrale (Dutch Agency for purchase of goods) NSL Nederlandse Stichting Leprabestrijding (Netherlands Leprosy Control Society) NTLCP National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme OPV Oral poliomyelitis ORS Sanitaire for health care in the Kaya sanitary region project) PATA Pooling Agreement on Technical Assistance PHC Primary health care PNLT Programme National de Lutte contre la Tuberculose (National tubercu- losis control programme) 192health, nutrition and population | Abbreviation ListPSI Population Service International PSP Poste de post) RLA Regeling Laag Frequente Aandoeningen (Arrangement for diseases occuring with low frequency) RNE Royal Netherlands Embassy SGS Societ\u008e General de S\u008egurance (General quality control company) TBA Traditional birth attendant TT Tetanus toxo\u0095d UN United Nations UNAIDS United Nations Programme on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome UNDP United Nation Development Programme UNFPA United Nation Population Fund UNICEF United Nations International Children\u00d5s Emergency Fund USAID United States Agency for International Development VHW Village health worker WHO World Health Organisation WOZ West Oost Zuid (West East South) YEMDAP Yemen Drug Action Programme YER Yemeni rial 193health, nutrition and population | Abbreviation List195health, nutrition and population | References of poverty.
