Increasingly, supplements as natural multivitamins and vegan multivitamins used to support the normal diet. If your company wants to make an active contribution to a sporty and healthy lifestyle, Vehgro is the right address for you. You can be assured that Vehgro supplements are not processed and are 100% natural. What do you have to think about? When you think of natural supplements, you initially think of capsules, superfood capsules and tablets. But natural supplements are also available in powder form. You can use them when exercising, or as a meal support. Our supplements, such as pea protein powder, help the body to recover. An active, fit lifestyle Organic multivitamin is a cornerstone in the diet of every sportsman. You do not have the time every day to cook and to ensure that you get enough of each nutrient. That is why you can rely on our organic supplements. The Puori vitamin capsules contain numerous healthy natural ingredients mixed with coconut oil. The capsules help support the athlete's body during exercise. Nutrients tailored to your needs . Natural supplements contribute to health, athletic performance and diet. Whoever wants to be at his healthiest (and most beautiful) needs the right dose of healthy substances. Wholesaler Vehgro is ready for any starter who wants to specialise in the field of healthy food and healthy supplements. The popularity of organic and sustainable is enormous. The very best vitamins Vitamins are an indispensable building block for the human body. Everybody needs them, not only sportsmen. Vehgro is a wholesaler of vitamins. Our organic products contain high vitamin concentrations. We have easy to swallow capsules and powders. The advantage: you can sell them under your own private label and buy them in bulk from us. The power of protein powder Buying protein powder is highly recommended for anyone who wants to fill up on extra protein every day. You can easily add the protein to yoghurt, a glass of water, a smoothie or to your baking recipe. The protein powder ensures that you get your prescribed amount of protein on a daily basis, or even a little more. Especially athletes need protein. It is also possible that you do not get enough protein with your regular diet. Powder is also an option in that case. The advantage of protein powder Protein powder is ideal for supplementing a less varied diet. Do you keep to a vegetarian diet? Then you will soon run short of protein, because it mainly occurs in meat and animal products, less in vegetables. One option is to supplement your diet with seeds and nuts, but protein powder is just as easy. Why organic protein powder? The main advantage of organic protein powder is that it does not contain unnecessary flavouring, aromatic substances or colourings. The less additives, the less junk. At Vehgro, you can count on an affordable price for a more than decent quality. What is [Acai](https://www.vehgroshop.com/acai-powder-freeze-dried-organic.html) powder? [Acai](https://www.vehgroshop.com/acai-powder-freeze-dried-organic.html) comes from South American palm trees. Small purple berries grow on these trees: the Acai berry. The fruit is mainly grown in Brazil. The taste is like a cross between cocoa and red berries. That sounds exciting doesn't it? For the taste alone it is highly recommended to buy Acai. But Acai is more than just delicious: this purple berry gives you the important nutrients to get you through the day. Nutrients in the Acai berry The Acai berry is one of the best natural supplements. The Acai contains calcium and iron, several vitamins and the Omega fatty acids 3 & 6. In addition to that, the striking berry is a treasure trove of antioxidants, including polyphenols. Substances such as anthocyanins and flavonoids can combat external skin aging. These are also very attractive properties. Acai? Of course you can buy it from Vehgro. We offer Acai in different quantities of powder and capsules. Harvesting of the Acai Acai berries are often harvested by hand. Then a selection process takes place in which the pulp is separated from the nut. Only the very best Acai fruits are harvested. By pulling the water out of the fruit, it can be kept longer, while all its good qualities are preserved. A modest dose of 2 teaspoons is needed per day. [Spirulina](https://www.vehgroshop.com/superfoods/spirulina): what is it? Spirulina is a blue-green algae. It is usually presented in the form of Spirulina pills. The word Spirulina is Latin and means 'small spiral'. This is how the algae looks like, like a little spiral. Did you know that Spirulina is very old? Almost as old as the earth: 3.5 billion years. In short: this algae is indestructible. If you regularly take a Spirulina pill, then perhaps you will too. Spirulina comes from mineral-rich water and lakes. What is Camu Camu? It sounds exotic and it is: the Camu Camu shrub, or \"Myrciaria dubia\" occurs naturally in the wet regions of South America, or: the Amazon. The berries on this shrub are yellow/purple in colour. What is remarkable is the fact that they were not eaten by the original inhabitants. This is undoubtedly due to its particularly sour taste. Do you like it sour? Then you are in the right place: buying Camu Camu is highly recommended - it is full of nutrients. "}
