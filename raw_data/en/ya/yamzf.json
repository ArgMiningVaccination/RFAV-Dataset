Countries around the world worked together to fight the epidemic. Now the world has entered the \"post-epidemic era.\" In the prevention and control of the epidemic in China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has exerted its unique advantages and contributed to the effective containment of the epidemic, which has attracted the attention of the WHO and the world. However, there are still many problems in the translation and foreign exchange of TCM, and there is a great lack of effective translation theories for guidance. To this end, this paper conducts an in-depth study of the English translation of Diagnosis and Treatment protocol for COVID-19 in Traditional Chinese medicine (Trial Version 7), and combines the translation examples of TCM in the epidemic, such as the translation of five-character syndrome types, drug names, and prescription names. Under the guidance of Skopos theory, it explains the translation strategies of TCM translation, and puts forward some thoughts and suggestions for the future TCM translation and external communication, so as to promote the TCM culture to the world better. - Copyright - \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
