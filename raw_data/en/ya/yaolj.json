In some form or other, this belief can be seen to occur throughout what is now labeled as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). To help understand its enduring power, this chapter first con - siders how we experience and think about the phenome - non of being alive, then traces the historical development of vitalism. A selection of healing practices is described in terms of their fundamental propositions and the ontological status that they confer on the vital principle. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the vitalist dialectics of CAM and an attempt to delineate the most significant characteristics of vitalism in the context of twenty-first-century medicine. An expanded review of these topics and themes is also available in book form (Mayor, 2011; Mayor & Micozzi, 2011). TIME AND LIFE\u2014THE BASIC QUESTIONS What is life? How do we even know that we ourselves are alive, or that others are? What connects us to the living, and what differentiates the living from the nonliving? How much of our world is alive? Why do some of us appear more vital than others? Are we born with a certain amount Vitalism DAVID F . MAYOR of vitality that we can dissipate and that runs out when we die, or does it fluctuate so that we feel more alive at certain times than others? Are there ways we can enhance our \"aliveness,\" and are there situations that can injure it and lead to what Chinese medicine terms \"taxation fatigue\" of qi, another name for this vital energy (such as from drug abuse, illness, many childbirths, too much sex)? If and when we are fortunate enough to have time for reflection and self-awareness, such questions may arise for all of us\u2014perhaps in wonderment as children, or more exis - tentially as adolescents before the business of life sweeps us along, or during illness, or as oldsters with leisure time or illness and increasing levels of pain, or fleetingly as lovers entwined temporarily outside of time. It is not really sur - prising, given our shared humanity, that answers sug - gested over the centuries are based upon and expressed with only few basic metaphors (Boers, 1999; Johnson, 2007), from wherever we hail. Whether our sense of being alive comes from inner awareness or outer attention, we appear to recognize life in similar ways (Kuriyama, 1995). But we do need to set aside time for this consideration. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) described the natural state of humankind as \"solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short\" (Hobbes, 1651). In his version of prehistory, based on struggle and competition, time for anything but staying alive would be available only for a favored few. A more Romantic view, as expressed in the following century (which was arguably less chaotic by sociocultural standards) by the Genevan philosopher Jean- Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), might be that the prehis - toric world was some kind of primitive, harmonious paradise in which awareness of life could flourish, before being despoiled by civilization and its conventions and limitations. In reality, significant leisure time to explore the deeper questions of life, at least in a manner accessible e2 fundamentals of complementary and alternative medicine Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.immaterial aspects of a person, was both symbol and source of the transmission of life from the gods to men and was depicted as two arms extended in embrace, indicating the imparting of vital essence. The flow of this essence from the divine could be hindered by wrongdoing (Clark, 1978). By the axial age, described by Karl Jaspers (1883-1969) as \"a pause for liberty\" between ages of empire, \"a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness\" (Jaspers, 1953), similar breath-souls were of fundamental importance in the philosophies of the three great civiliza - tions of India, China, and Greece, present both in the world about us and in our inner worlds. In India, the cosmic breath-soul was, and still is, known as prana . The Atharvaveda , one of the earliest Vedic hymns, dating back to before 800 BC, is entirely devoted to prana and the somewhat later literature of Ayurveda, the traditional medi - cine of India (see Chapter 31), the physiology of prana as breath is emphasized (Zysk, 1995), whereas one of the main limbs of postclassical yoga (see Chapter 21) is pranayama , or \"breath \"pranayama . . . is an attention directed on one's organic life . . . a calm and lucid entrance into the very essence of life\" (Eliade, 1958, p 58). In both Ayurveda and yoga, prana (particularly vyana ) moves, or is moved, through fine chan - nels in the body known as nadi (Zysk, 1995). Vyana is also responsible for the circulation of the blood (Singh, 2004). The three principle nadi of yoga\u2014 susumna, ida, and pingala \u2014 are sometimes seen as corresponding to the three great mythological rivers of India, the Sarasvati, the Ganga (Ganges), and the Yamuna (Jumna) (White, 1996). In traditional Chinese thought, there is a close relation - ship between wind ( feng, ) and what is termed qi ( or in modern, simplified characters) (Kuriyama, 1995). At times qi \"means the spirit or breath of life in living crea - tures, at other times the air or ether filling the sky and sur - rounding the universe, while in some contexts it denotes the basic substance of all creation\" (de Bary et al, 1960, p 193n). In a broad sense, qi pervades and sustains the uni - verse (Kuen, 2000), moving and flowing in all directions (de Bary et al, 1960). The concept of qi is thus a multidimen - sional concept (Matsumoto & Birch, 1988), referring to anything that cannot be observed directly (Birch & Felt, 1999) or that is perceptible (in its effects) but intangible (Wiseman, 1990). \"It is both a principle of unity and coher - ence that connects all things and a potential, an immanent life force in the world that is knowable only in the various changing aspects it assumes\" (Robinet, 1997; p 8). In a narrower sense, qi can be considered as a breath- soul, like prana in Ayurveda (although as Chinese medicine became more formalized, the nutritive-materialist aspect of gu qi , , was emphasized rather than the respiratory- shamanic; Hayashi, Qi also \"begets movement and heat\" (Beinfield & Korngold, 1991). As with pranayama in Indian yoga, working with the qi is fundamental to the self-cultivation practices of qigong ( ) (see Chapter 28), in which qi and the related jing (, essence, sometimes to Western civilization, may not have ever been available, even among a favored few, until the \"axial age\" of classical antiquity (ca. 800 to 200 BC) (Kuriyama, 1995). PRECURSORS I: THE LIFE-BREATH A scientist may say that the study of life is the study of living organisms, and so it is necessarily about how they maintain their organization and structure. However, the lived body (embodied life) as experienced in feeling is very different from the \"structural corpus\" (Ots, 1994), the body as conceived in thought (Hall, 1975b; Lowen, 1976; Sandner, 1986). On a very simple level, we sense and feel and move. Even at the cellular level, life is about these dynamic processes, as well as about organization and structure (Lipton, 2005). If we take our attention within the body, we may sense many movements\u2014flows, pulsations, vibrations, expan - sions and contractions, changing balances of heat and cold. In particular, we breathe, and we soon become aware that to cease breathing is threatening to life. The entering breath brings life; breath leaving may even signal its end. We also need food and drink to live, of course, in par - ticular to fuel the visible, tangible, physical body. But the breath remains somehow more mysterious, more difficult to grasp, less tangible, and so has been taken as a key to life in many cultures (\"an almost visual, tangible image of the fluidly conceived life flowing through the body\"; Hult - krantz, 1953, p. 180 [my italics]). It connects us with the world, the inner and outer, what is above and what is below. But what happens to it inside us, or outside us? Are there purely inner breaths, \"breath-souls\"? Is breath indeed a form of the winds we can feel outside of ourselves in nature (Kuriyama, 1995), or is our understanding of such outer winds derived from our experience of breath (Rank, 1968)? Is there indeed one all-embracing wind of nature, a \"life-breath\" that connects all things? For many native North American peoples, for example, there is but one word to denote life, breath, and wind (Reichard, 1974) (see Chapter 37). For many indigenous peoples around the world, illness is carried literally on the wind, such as the angin , or wind sickness, of the Malaysian Archipelago (Laderman 1993). In fact, it appears Laderman may have partially misattributed causation to the element of wind or air insofar as a more complete reading of the Malay tradi - tional health system acknowledges the role of the other three elements, earth, fire, and water, as well. Classical Antiquity Historically, there are many examples of the breath-soul in Africa (Mayor, 2011). In ancient Egypt, the ka was the vital force, housing the more subtle soul ( ba) and distinguishing the living from the dead (Budge, 1899). Breathed into us by the goddess of childbirth when (or possibly even before) we are born, leaving the body at death but remaining earth - bound, it required sustenance through incense as well as food and drink in the afterlife. The ka, one of several Vitalism e3 Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.intermediary between psyche , (prime mover of the breath) and soma, \u00b5 (Hall, 1975a). For Aristotle, matter was not inert, but \"in a way all things are full of soul\" (Solmsen, 1957). Again in the fourth century BC, Diocles of Karystos dis - tinguished between outer and inner (psychic) pneuma, the latter arising from the exhalations of the blood (Kuen, 2000); Praxagoras (b. ca. 340 BC) then differentiated pneuma from blood, the heart being the seat of pneuma, whence it was distributed throughout the body via the arteries and nerves, with blood being carried by the veins (Kuriyama, 1999). For the later Stoics, pneuma both was immanent in the universe (Lloyd & Sivin, 2002) and pervaded the body (French, 1969), although Kuriyama has argued that for the Stoics pneuma was based on \"the experience of an active life driven not by outer winds or divine influence, but by changes interior to and defining the self \" (Kuriyama, 1995, p 27). In late antiquity, for Galen (129 to ca. 201), the smooth coursing of pneuma throughout the body was essential to consciousness, perception, and action, and disruptions in its flow accounted for afflictions ranging from minor twitches and dizziness to epilepsy and paraly - sis (Kuriyama, 1995). In Latin, the life-breath was known as spiritus or anima , the consciousness or rational soul as animus (Lewis, 1904). However, for the Epicurean Lucretius (ca. 99-55 BC), anima and animus were still part of the same breath (French, 1969). Epikouros (Epicurus) himself (341-270 BC) thought the breath-soul was distributed throughout the body, with a central animus in the chest (Konstan, 2005) governing a more widely distributed anima (Hall, 1975b). There are long Indian and Chinese traditions of self- cultivation practices, based upon awareness or direction of the prana or qi within the body, but not apparently practiced in ancient Greece or Rome (Yamada, 1995). Despite this, and other, cultural differences, there are some striking basic similarities between prana , qi, and pneuma: They are neither completely immaterial nor material. They are similar to but differ from both wind and breath, and are in some sense more than either. They are considered to flow along ducts within the body. They act as a connecting medium between the body and the outer world, and between different parts of the body, or between body and mind. Illness or dysfunction will occur if flow is uneven or blocked, diverted or reversed (Fields, Unschuld, 1985). Other Cultures and Some Generalizations Throughout history there have been comparable, although not identical, concepts in many cultures. Some examples translated as semen or \"configurative potential\"; Milburn, 2001, Robinet, 1997) are conserved with awareness and intention, rather than spent through the wear and tear of life and its attendant \"taxation fatigue.\" One modern com - mentator has even defined qi as \"nothing else than my bodily awareness of being alive\" (Ots, 2006). Such aware - ness may be heightened in illness or pain (Boers, 1999; He & Lo, 1996), perhaps as part of the homeostatic process of healing. A full discussion of qi can be found in Mayor and Micozzi (2011), where the present author has characterized qi as \"the dynamic, moving and transforming life force both within and around us, originally sensed in and then metaphorized as breath (Air), warmth (Fire), and flow (Water)\" (Mayor, 2011, p 28). Corresponding to some extent to the Indian nadi are the jingluo (, channels) of Chinese medicine (see Chapter 28), along which some forms of qi travel. Indeed, it is quite possible that some of the ideas underpinning acupuncture (see Chapter 29) and qigong derived in part from earlier Indian developments (Filliozat, 1991; Miura, 1995), because the earliest references to qi occur only in the writings of Confucius (Kong Fuzi, 551-479 BC) (Kuriyama, 1995) and the first known descriptions of vessels ( mai, ) in Chinese medicine are found in the Zuo Zhan of around 310 BC (Sivin, 1995). The mai (based more on a multidimensional subjec - tive experience of the body than objective investigation; Lo, 2001) carry both qi and blood, and are still relatively undif - ferentiated compared to the later, more elaborated jingluo of the medical classics (Lo, 1998). As with the inner-outer correspondence of nadi and rivers, much has been made of that correspondence between the jingluo and the canals and roads of Han dynasty imperial China (Allan, 1997; Ots, 2006; Unschuld, 1985), so that they are sometimes con - strued as a way of bringing the body under control (Mayor, 2011). And as with prana , qi can be divided into functional subcategories within the body ( zong qi [], zhen qi [], ying qi [], wei qi [], and so forth; Maciocia, 1989). A shift toward such systematization of knowledge and away from patients' perceptions of pain, illness, and the move - ments of qi is already evident in the Lingshu , a classic text on acupuncture dating back to around 70 BC (Hsu, 2001). In Greece as in Egypt, India, and China, the breath-soul, the pneuma (\u00b5), evolved over time and so has many overlapping meanings. For Homer, around 800 BC, the breath of life or pnoie (, cognate with pneuma) vivified the body, and was inhaled with the air and passed to the blood and heart (French, 1969). The body of Homeric man was thus permeable to winds and drives, emotions were \"breathed into him by a god\" (Vernant, 1989). For Hip - pocrates (ca. 460-377 BC), pneuma was taken in from food and drink as well as air (Kuen, 2000). Around 440 BC, Dio - genes of Apollonia would write of life as pneuma moving like warm currents through the vessels ( phlebes, ) of the body (Yoke, 2000). For Plato (420-340 BC) almost a century later, both blood ( aima, \u00b5) and breath moved through the same channels (Mendelsohn, 1964). A little later Aristotle (384-322 BC) considered pneuma to act as e4 fundamentals of complementary and alternative medicine Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc.

However, it should be noted that this life-soul, present in and connecting all things, is distinct from concepts of nonordinary (or supernatural) power such as sekhem (ancient Table 6-1. A fuller discussion of \"soul\" and its relationship to qi is given elsewhere (Mayor, 2011). Soul is usually multiple, often dual, encompassing both free-soul(s) and body-soul(s) (Hultkrantz, 1953; VanStone, 1974). The free-soul, relatively immaterial, is experienced in trance states or associated with thoughts and memories. The body-soul, relatively material, arises from observation and inner sensation. Among the Netsilik Eskimo and Western D\u00e9n\u00e9, for example, the \"general life-soul . . . seems to flow through the body as a uniform energy.\" Dif - ferent body-souls may also inhabit different organs (heart, kidney, liver) (Hultkrantz, 1953) as in the cases of both Indian (Zysk, 1995) and Chinese Medicine (Maciocia, 1989), for instance. Both free- and body-souls may derive originally from the breath-soul, as with the hun (\"cloud soul,\" soul,\" ) in Taiwanese Daoism (Schipper, 1993). There is often such a polarization of souls, with the free-soul considered \"pure\" or \"good\" and the body-soul \"impure\" or \"bad\" (Levy, 1998), or the free- soul \"white\" and the body-soul or flesh \"black\" (Shoko, 2007). In many cultures, including our own, there is also an intimate connection between blood and the breath of life. Blood-soul (Frazer, 1911) and breath-soul may not be dis - tinguished, they may be complementary, or one may pre - dominate over the other.Shigehisa Kuriyama has proposed that the breath-soul developed as an internalization of the experience of exter - nal winds (Kuriyama, 1995). In this he is supported by the \"experiential realism\" of philosophers George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999), who consider that \"the core of our conceptual systems is directly grounded in perception, body movement, and experience of a physical and social character\" (Lakoff, 1987, p xiv). In other words, the metaphors and metonymies in which we think are based on our sensory and motor interactions with the outer world: we transfer them from outside to inside (e.g., from wind to the breath within). The inner world of the body is difficult to access, even experientially. It is hard to find words to describe inner sensations or movements, or even to localize them (Lewis & Kellgren, 1939). This is a world of process, of continuity and connection, of flow and streaming, wave and gurgle, rather than of isolated parts, concepts, bits and bytes, a \"land of natural anarchy and inner harmony\" as against \"the exterior, fragmented view of things\" (Schipper, 1993). Awareness here is at a more primitive, even preverbal, level, the level of anima rather than animus. It is tempting to speculate on the profound effect of intrauterine life on our later ability to feel our way into our own bodies (as well as conceptualize the world about us). It Vitalism e5 Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.aither ) (Cantor & Hodge, 1981b) with the vital heat of the world-soul (Fraser, 1871). For Galen, too, there was \"innate heat,\" a \"vital flame\" in living matter (Porter, 2003), and in this he was followed by Avicenna (ca. 979-1037) (Mendelsohn, 1964) and other Unani practitioners (see Chapter 32). Even for Paracelsus (Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombast von Hohen - his rejection of the Aristotelian elements (Pagel, 1958) and much of Galenic medicine, fire and life were fundamentally equivalent (Bachelard, 1949). \"Vital heat\" moved further toward center stage following publication of the Physiologia of Jean Fernel (1497-1558) (Sherrington 1946), in which he distinguished it from ele - mental heat. Francis Bacon (1561-1626), for example, described the vital spirit of the body as flamelike (Pagel, 1935), \"a mysterious combination of flammeous and aerial nature\" (Bacon, 1623). For Marcus Marci (1595-1667), too, the life principle was flame-like and distributed throughout the body (Pagel, 1935). In alchemy, such fire retained a central role (Jung, 1968). More matter of factly, the British surgeon-general John Hunter (1728-1793), who first elucidated the circula - tory system, considered life to be the \"animal fire\" released from food as the result of respiration (French, 1969) and as being particularly active in the blood (Levere, 1981). \"Natural heat\" later played a pivotal part in Thomsonian herbalism (see later and Chapter 22). PRECURSORS III: ANIMAL SPIRITS With Saint Augustine (354-430), spiritus as breath-soul became completely disengaged from matter (Kuen, 2000), a \"mind-soul\" (animus) rather than a \"body-mind-soul\" (anima). This early division would have profound influ - ences on many developments throughout history in the West (see Chapter 1). Until the Renaissance, however, Western medicine remained based on the teachings of Galen, for whom pneuma-like \"animal brain between and connecting will and muscle (Duffin, 2000; French, 1981). Other spirits included the vital spirit (or pneuma zoticon ) in the heart, and the natural spirit in the liver (University of Virginia Health System: Galen, n.d.). Galen based his animal spirits and vital spirit on those of the rationalist Eristratos of Chios (310-250 BC) (Wheeler, 1939). Virtually identical spirits were also described in the Greco-Arabic system of Unani medicine (see Chapter 32). Thus pneuma still served as a common denominator of all phenomena and allowed all forms of being\u2014from human to minerals\u2014to maintain their cohesiveness and growth and to transform into other forms of being. In Elizabethan times, Galen's three types of spirit continued to mediate between the vital heat gener - ated from food and the body itself: natural spirits (vapor- like and carried in the veins), vital spirits (transmitting heat through the arteries), and animal spirits (still, as with Galen, acting through the nerves, and partaking of both may be no coincidence that some self-cultivation methods in qigong utilize what is called \"embryonic breathing\" (Huang & Wurmbrand, 1987). At some level, this intrauter - ine life, with its sense of a participation mystique (L\u00e9vy-Bruhl, 1926) with our enfolding world, continues within as we develop, although it is rapidly overlaid by an education that emphasizes consciousness (predominantly externally directed and visual), rather than intuition and imagina - tion, inner-directed, tactile, and proprioceptive. For certain people, involvement in CAM may, at least in part, satisfy a need for re-contacting this powerful \"mystical\" part of life. As will become evident here, there are certainly parallels between the mystical experience itself and the experience of qi (Mayor, 2011). PRECURSORS II: THE FIRE OF LIFE After the first breath we take, the warmth of human contact and embrace is our earliest experience in life (Lakoff & N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 2000). Even when imagining mental contact with another, the most common felt experience is one of warmth and touch (Reed, 1996). Throughout the world, and throughout history, vital processes have been associated with warmth, heat, fire, or flame (Hall, 1975b), whereas absence of heat is associated with death (Hufford, 1988). (Excess heat, as in fever, may be viewed as dangerous to life, or as healing in itself; Lohff, 2001.) Fire, the quintessence of movement, is the most active of the elements (fire, air, water, earth) that make up the life of the organism and of our emotions (Omori, 2008). World literature is full of references to the fire of life, and in particular to the \"felt\" fires of love, lust, feeling, and passion in general (Soueif, 1977). Fire was also often a central metaphor for the divine in nature\u2014\"ever moving, self-moving, moving other things,\" in the words of Dionysius the Areopagite (Peter the Iberian, 452-491?) (Dionysius the Areopagite, 1894), although this sort of fire was considered ethereal or \"pure\" and so distinguished from visible or \"vulgar\" elemental fire (Pagel, 1958; Schaf - fer, 1978). A cooking or furnace fire at the core of the body is a central metaphor in many forms of yoga and tantra (Child, 2007; Fields, 2001), as well as in Chinese medicine (Macio - cia, 1989) and mystical practices (Robinet, 1997). The asso - ciation of fire with life was taken up by the Greek Pythagoreans (Berkeley, [1744] 1871) and Heraclitus (ca. 500-460 BC) (Hall, 1975a), was present in the writings of Hippocrates (Lloyd, 1966) and Democritus (ca. 480-370 BC), for whom body-soul or vital principle was composed of atoms of fire (French, 1969); in Plato (420-340 BC), for whom fire was the \"animal spirit\" of both microcosm and macrocosm (Mendelsohn, 1964); in Aristotle (Hall, 1975a), for whom \"animal heat\" connected soul and body (Fraser, 1871); and also in Epicurus and Lucretius (French, 1969), who embellished on Democritus in their understanding of soul as atomic fire. The Stoics went one further, identifying both pneuma and Aristotle's superlunary \"ether\" ( , e6 fundamentals of complementary and alternative medicine Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.thinker of the Enlightenment, as well as the philosopher Friedrich von Schelling (1775-1854), similarly identified fire or ether as the original \"world-spirit\" (Schaffer, 1978; Tatar, 1978). Earlier, Newton (1642-1727) had specu - lated that the ether is in some sense the source of matter, and matter but a lower form of ether\u2014both being perme - ated by Spirit (Grabo, 1930). Further, he surmised that an \"electric spirit\" allied to fire and \"more subtile than common Air or Vapour\" might maintain life and prevent decay (Home, 1993). As investigations on electricity gathered momentum in the eighteenth century, there were those who moved beyond machinery and identified it with the Anima Mundi or flamma vitalis (Millburn, 1976) or, like John Wesley (1703-1791), with God's spirit of love made manifest (Wakefield, 1976) or with the ether (Heimann, 1973, 1981; William Watson, the first electrical-chemical polymath, con - sidered electricity to be both a manifestation of the immor - tal soul (Bragg, 2004) and a form of \"phlogiston\" (PJH, 1968) (yet another hypothetical substance\u2014without color, odor, taste, or weight, but supposedly liberated in burning). Nineteenth-century Romantic scientists continued to describe electricity as itself the life force (Brandis, 1795; Oken, 1809-1811; Hall, 1975b), as its essence (the link between spirit and matter) (Segala, 2001), or as the agent of the vital principle (Prout, 1816). Even today, scientist pop - ularizers like Brian Cox in the UK (b. 1968) talk of the \"spark of life\" as essentially electrical (\"proton pumps\") (Cox, 2013). Vitalism arose as a conservative, more measured re - sponse to mechanism and atomistic physicochemical re - ductionism (Lain Entralgo, 1948). A key figure here was the prominent chemist-cum-physician Georg Ernst Stahl (1660-1734) (also one of the originators of the phlogiston theory). He dispensed with (animal) spirits as intermediary between material and immaterial, and, influenced by Para - celsus and van Helmont, he suggested instead that the im- material soul (anima) or \"moving principle\" acts directly upon inert matter by means of motion (not necessarily flow) (French, 1969). This soul gives life to matter, although not itself alive (Hall, 1975a). Furthermore, for Stahl, the \"organizing energy\" or order implicit in \"organism\" is what distinguishes living from dead bodies (Cheung, 2008). Thus in Germany, the \"vital force\" ( Lebenskraft ) devel - oped as a to a \"rational plan\" (M\u00fcller, 1833-1834). The abstract nature of this concept did not prevent doctors such as Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland (1762-1836), in his influential 1797 book Macrobiotics, or the Art of Prolonging Human Life , from putting forward the view that medicine should be based on cultivation of the vital force rather than its depletion (Hufeland & Lejeune, 1958). In France, Stahl's philosophy was reinterpreted at the influential medical faculty in Montpellier, first by the more body and soul) (Tillyard, 1963). Francis Bacon, for example, considered the latter, animal spirits, as aspects of the irra - tional or sensible soul (as opposed to the animus). In main - land Europe, Paracelsus and Jan Baptist van Helmont (1577-1644) proposed a multiplicity of souls and archaei to fulfill a variety of functions (Hall, 1975a). With Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650), soul and body were finally\u2014and, seemingly still, irrevocably in Western biomedicine\u2014torn asunder (Hall, 1975a), as were mind (res cognitans ) and matter (res extensa ). Animal spirits within the nerves became merely rapidly moving particles, flame-like yet of \"a certain very fine air or wind\" (Mendelsohn, 1964), without any inner activity of their own. Descartes' mechan - ical model of the workings of muscle has been compared with the hydraulic system of the French King Louis's garden with its water-driven machinery (Jackson, 1970) and the Cartesian ether was but the by-product of the mutual abrasion of particles (Hall, 1975a). Following Des - cartes, in the eighteenth century the body was seen by many as a form of clockwork (Bajollet, 1735; Borelli, 1680), with the living being differentiated from the nonliving just by the presence of more organized movement (Hall, 1975b). The clockwork, body as a machine was envisioned based upon human mechanical inventions, and this unfortunate metaphor remains in full force with, for example, National Geographic 's breathless and popular des criptions of the human body as the \"incredible human machine\" (Rosten, [1975] 2007). Meanwhile, animal spirits were reduced to an epiphenomenon of the blood for anatomists such as William Harvey (1578-1657) and Thomas Willis (1621- 1675) (Hall, 1975a; Mendelsohn, 1964). Although, for their French colleague Raymond de Vieussens (1641-1715), blood remained the main seat of the vital spirit (Allen & Debus, 1984). Nature had ceased to be an organic being that matured through self-development. However, in alchemy\u2014a relatively \"hidden\" (\"mystical\") tradition in the West that emphasized the centrality of experiential or sensed living reality\u2014\"the spirit of the world and of matter\" still guaranteed that the world \"is alive and full of life\" (Amadou, 1953). RISE AND FALL OF MAINSTREAM VITALISM At the beginning of the eighteenth century there was a tension in the West between Cartesian mechanists like Joseph Addison (1672-1719), for whom the body was \"a Bundle of Pipes and Strainers, fitted to one another after so wonderful a manner as to make a proper Engine for the Soul to work with\" (Addison, 1711) and others such as George Berkeley (1685-1753), for whom the animal spirits of the nerves corresponded to the \"net of fire, and rays of fire in the human body\" in Plato's Timaeus (Berkeley, 1709), and the \"vital spirit of the world\" was identified with pure fire, ether, light, and even the Chinese tian (, heaven) (Berkeley, [1744] 1973). This view was not as unusual as it may seem now: Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), a foremost Vitalism e7 Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.heat derives solely from the chemical processes of oxida - tion and combustion (Liebig, 1843), although in many ways he was also a vitalist (Benton, 1974; Lipman, 1967; Wheeler, 1939). Eduard Pfl\u00fcger (1829-1910) went on to reduce all life to the \"intramolecular warmth\" of oxidation (Hall, 1975b), bringing together the two traditional prin - ciples of life, its breath and fire (see also Chapters 1 and 2 for general discussions of these concepts). William Benja - min Carpenter (1813-1885) (Carpenter, 1850) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) (Hall, 1975b) again reduced \"vital\" \"cell-force\" to chemical and physical forces. And in 1897, Wilbur O. Atwater (1844-1907) and Edward B. Rosa (1873-1921) showed that the laws of thermody - namics apply to life as well as to inorganic matter (although the argument that life has some negentropic property has persisted; Wheeler, 1939). Even \"neovitalist\" Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) defined life as \"nothing but a connected chain of very complicated material phenomena of motion\" (Haeckel, 1868) or \"a physicochemical process\" (Haeckel, 1899). \"The entire internal process of feeling experience\" was discounted (Conger, 1988). The life-breath has become, simply, oxygen (Amri & Abu-Asab, 2011; Abu-Asab et al, 2013). Vitalism was weakened and retreated before each new scientific discovery, and, as Kaptchuk (2006) has argued, effectively migrated to an alternative medical worldview that was being created in the nineteenth century, where it was welcomed and eventually merged with other impor - tant forms of vitalism. This shift was accentuated in the twentieth century, with the emphasis in mainstream medi - cine on biomedical diagnosis of disease labels rather than the individual's state of illness. MESMER'S FLUIDUM In the eighteenth century, there were many attempts to group together different forms of energy (heat, light, elec - tricity, magnetism) as forms or modifications of an under - lying universal ether. In 1775, the Viennese physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815) announced the existence of what he called \"animal magnetism,\" a universal fluid bring - ing together aspects of the \"universal gravity,\" in his medical dissertation (Carlson, 1960). Magnetism, light, and the Hippocratic ignis subtilissimus (Zweig, 1933) were seen as responsible for the properties of both organic and inorganic matter, and were to be found within \"the sub - stance of the nerves\" (Wyckoff, 1975). The previous year he had treated a Fra\u00fclein \u00d6sterlin with magnets and an iron- based drink, whereupon she experienced the sensation of a stream flowing down through her body (and was then cured of her various\u2014possibly hysterical\u2014ailments) (Palfre - man, 1977). Mesmer went on to develop a controversial therapy on the basis of this case, his own \"rapture\" when alone in nature, and his theory of animal magnetism (Benz, 1989). He taught that health is simply a state of harmony with the cosmic fluid and that all disease is due to an unequal distribution of or \"obstacles\" to the flow of the mechanistic Fran\u00e7ois Boissier Sauvages de la Croix (1706- 1767), using the word \u00e2me (\"soul\") rather than anima, and then by his student Paul Joseph Barthez (1734-1806), later one of Napoleon's physicians, who preferred principe vitale , or \"vital principle\" (Haigh, 1975; Wheeler, 1939). principle was expressed in the collaboration of \"forces sensitives\" and \"forces motrices\" working together in the body, and was distinct from both rational soul and the body itself (Haigh, 1977), although Barthez held that it is single and on death becomes one with the animating \"principe universel\" of God's universe (Hall, 1975b). His Guillaume Grimaud (1750-1789) subdivided the holistic principe vitale once more, into external and internal motor forces ( forces motri - ces) and an internal vital sense ( sens vital int\u00e9rieur ), \"lower\" and centered in Barthez's near-contemporary Xavier creator of the modern science of histology, life was not one fundamental force, nor yet threefold, but the \"col - lection of those functions which resist death\" (Bichat, 1800). These propri\u00e9t\u00e9s vitales he considered as similar to gravity and other physical forces (Wheeler, 1939). During the nineteenth century, the mechanistic physical-chemical view gained complete ascendancy in biology and medicine. Harvey's description of the circula - tion of the blood had already long undermined traditional accounts of the vital and natural spirits (Wheeler, 1939), and gradually the intimate connection that had held since Galen's time between pneumatic animal spirits that flow, and particular structures within which they flow, was superseded by (or amalgamated with) other models of flow, within nerves (Hillman, 1999). The flow or obstruc - tion of electricity in nerves, for example, was considered by many to uphold or undermine health (Wilson, 1750), and this understanding led in turn to the use of electrical stimulation to effect cure (Cloquet, 1826; Molenier, 1768; Philip, 1817). Oxygen was discovered in 1774 by Priestley, and although the vivifying air was still considered as a univer - sal \"vital force\" by the Romantic writer Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg, 1772-1801) (Tatar, 1978), it also lost much of its mystique. In 1811, Gottlieb Sigismund (Kon - stantin Sigizmundovich) Kirchoff (1764-1833) presented his findings on the extraction of glucose from starch to the academy of sciences in St. Petersburg (Gillespie, 1973), furthering the demystification of the body's heat and energy. In the early 1800s, biologist-natural scientist Jean- Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) tary, ubiquitous, and ethereal \"fire\" as responsible for the movements of living organisms (French, 1981). However, from 1828, when Friedrich W\u00f6hler (1800-1882) first syn - thesized organic material (urea), there was a gradual elimi - nation of any need to believe in a vital principle, or life force, to make good perceived inadequacies of physical- chemical explanations (Needham, 2005). In mid-century, Justus von Liebig (1803-1873) demonstrated that body e8 fundamentals of complementary and alternative medicine Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.practices, from phrenology to clairvoyant medical diagno - sis, spiritualism (Darnton, 1968). Between the fluidist and animist poles were various intermediate versions, each spawning its complex lineage yet all sharing the distinctive mesmeric view that life's agency and healing potential can be found in something\u2014whether a vital energy or in the mind\u2014distinct from the ordinary phy- sicochemical forces of Victorian science. Mesmerism thus became an inspiration for many unconventional therapies. \"FLUIDISM\" MODERNIZED Spiritualism, with its levitations, ectoplasmic emissions, table turning, spirit rapping, and spirit photographs, became a mass phenomenon in the nineteenth century (Braude, 1989; Goldsmith, 1999; Moore, 1977; Oppen - heim, 1988). In keeping with the times, and perhaps to avoid the stigma of association with what was now excom - municated from official science, attempts were made to explain these manifestations in terms of force (rather than fluidum ), with one spiritualist and magnetic healer (mes - merist), John Murray Spear (1804-1887), even construct - ing a spirit-designed mechanical messiah designed to be powered by the life force (Moore, 1977). In 1844, Karl Ludwig von Reichenbach (1788-1869), retired discoverer of creosote and paraffin, published his findings on what he called \"odic force\" (allied to electricity, magnetism, and heat), to which he found certain people were particularly sensitive (Reichenbach, 1977). In 1853, Robert Hare (1781-1858), inventor of the oxy- hydrogen blowpipe at the age of 20 and then a professor of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania for over thirty years, felt it his duty during retirement \"to stem the tide of popular madness which, in defiance of reason and science, was fast setting in favor of the gross delusion called spiri - tualism,\" but the following year became a convert himself, later even acting as a medium (Answers.com: Robert Hare, n.d.; Hare, [1855] 1963). He coined the scientific-sounding term psychic force , developing a spirit-scope to measure mes - meric and spiritual presences (McClenon, 1984; Moore, 1977). The prominent physicist William Crookes (1832- 1919) used the same term slightly later (Kottler, 1974). \"Astral force\" was one of several related terms used by theosophists such as Charles W. Leadbeater (1847-1934) to describe forces\" involved in alist s\u00e9ances (Leadbeater, 1900). Electricity, only recently tamed by science, was co-opted by Madame Helena Petro - vna Blavatsky (1831-1891), cofounder of the Theosophical Society, for whom \"electric vital fluid\" or \"soul-electricity\" was produced by the cerebral pile of man (Blavatsky, 1888), just as Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) had once suggested for electricity itself (Pancaldi 1990). Mysterious forces have also featured prominently in science fiction, from the \"Vril\" of Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873) in Wars.fluidum . The fluidum can be manipulated by healers to restore equilibrium and therefore health (Mesmer, 1980). In 1778 Mesmer relocated to Paris, where his methods became both popular and controversial (Darnton, 1968). Seven years later, \"mesmerism\" was investigated by a com - mission of the French Royal Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences under Louis XVI, which included such prestigious figures as the new American ambassador Benjamin Franklin (1706- 1790), the chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794), the and the astronomer Jean-Sylvain Bailly (1736-1793). They ignored Mesmer's request for an investigation based on clinical outcomes and concluded that the fluidum , invisible and intangible, is inexplicable \"on purely rationalistic terms\" and so nonexistent, with the crises provoked in his patients due principally to \"imagination\" (Zweig, 1933). The French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de M\u00e9decine concurred in a separate report, advising prospective members against using mesmerism (Commissaires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de M\u00e9decine, 1784); however, its committee members, botanist Antoine- Laurent de Jussieu (1748-1836), did acknowledge that Mesmer's methods were effective (even curative) and agreed with him that some kind of subtle fluid (\"animal heat\") may play a significant role in maintaining health (Jussieu, 1784). Even before these investigations, Franklin had written of animal magnetism: \"I . . . must doubt its Existence till I can see or feel some Effect of it\" (Begelow, 1904). They were thus almost bound to fail in their investigations of mes - merism, and banished it to the fringes of the conventional medical world. Here, however, it flourished. Many of Mes - mer's ideas were paralleled by developments in the \"Roman - tic science\" of the early nineteenth century (which, like alchemy, emphasized a self-investigational approach to gaining knowledge) and became a critical component of allied currents in medical thought (Fuller, 1982). In par - ticular, the view that flow dissolves petrifaction has been considered the point of departure for all \"Romantic medi - cine\" (\"flow is the counterpart to reification\") (Asendorf, 1993). Interestingly, there may be a parallel to this perspec - tive in central African therapeutics (Taylor, 2011). Mesmer's followers were divided. The \"fluidists\" under - stood the fluidum as analogous to a physical electromag - netic vibration that resembled more recognized scientific energies. The \"animists\" interpreted the fluidum as ethereal, reducing it to an epiphenomenon of little consequence, will or thought being more important. For the novelist Charles Dickens (1812-1870), for example, as well as many of his contemporary fellow mesmerists, the operator was no longer just a mediator for magnetic fluid, but har - nessed, focused, and transmitted it using will power (Kaplan, 1975), whereas Honor\u00e9 de Balzac (1799-1850) described thought or will as an \"imponderable fluid\" flowing like electricity through the body (Balzac, 1837). By the mid-nineteenth century, mesmerism had inter - mingled with several mystical and occult traditions and became allied to a range of unconventional therapies and Vitalism e9 Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.Gordon (b. 1948) (Gordon, 1999). More recent methods include the syncretist \"pranic healing\" of Choa Kok Sui (b. 1952) (Sui, 2004), seichim (a reiki add-on devised by Patrick Zeigler after spending a night in the Great Pyramid) (Shewmaker, 2000), and countless other idiosyncratic variants. Although sometimes unaware of their heritage, methods of \"spiritual healing\" bear the characteristic mesmeric style of manipulating unseen and refined vital forces that evade biomedical detection, and some explicitly speak of \"an elec - tromagnetic dimension which can become depleted or unbalanced . . . [causing) the blockage of energy flow, requiring physical or spiritual cleaning in order for healing to occur\" (Glik, 1988, p 1201). There may be a moralizing dimension to this (as in ancient Egypt, mentioned earlier, or in \"New Thought,\" later). Thus healers Ambrose and Olga Worrall (1899-1972 and 1906-1985, respectively) believed that we can \"insulate ourselves by wrong thinking or wrong living\" from the supply of life energy around us. In this situation, \"we are like batteries that need recharg - ing,\" and the healer acts \"as a conductor between the source of supply and the patient\" (Worrall & Worrall, 1969). (Ambrose Worrall coined the term paraelectricity for the energy of healing [Beltzer 1986].) Others query whether the energy manipulated is \"channelled\" through the healer, originates in the healer, or originates within the patient (Benor, 2001; McClean, 2006). Whatever the model adopted, successful healing is considered to provide \"proof \" of the force or energy involved, with secondary evidence in the sensations of heat, tingling, or vibration frequently reported by healees (Fuller, 1989; Krieger, 1979). Despite the suspicions\u2014and even hostility\u2014of colleagues, more and more researchers from conventional science hover on the edge of this type of healing and continue to investigate the phenomenon (Benor, 2001; Beutler et al, 1988; Schwartz & Simon, 2007). OSTEOPATHY, CHIROPRACTIC, AND MASSAGE Osteopathy (see Chapter 18) was founded by Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917), who in 1874 abandoned his career as a self-taught physician to become a magnetic (mesmeric) healer and a few years later a bone setter (Gevitz, 1988b). In addition to experiencing episodes of clairvoyance and channeling, Still had connections to metaphysical, \"Mind Cure,\" and spiritualist groups (Gevitz, 1988c). In 1874, he discovered that misaligned bones impede the flow of fluids and blood, and so developed the system of osteopathy. He wrote that \"all diseases are mere effects, the cause being a partial or complete failure of the nerves to properly conduct the fluids of life,\" more gener - ally that \"it is necessary that there be liberty of blood, nerves, and arteries from the generating-point to its destination.\" For Still, health depended on the uncon - gested free play of \"life-giving current\" through the system (Still, 1897). In the United States, the mesmeric influence The ether too was respectably mechanized and then described in mathematical terms by Victorian science (Cantor & Hodge, 1981a) and often referenced. Crookes, for example, wrote that \"ether vibrations\" might be respon - sible for telepathy (Wilson, 1971). Physicists Balfour Stewart (1828-1887) and Peter Guthrie Tait (1831-1901) described a hierarchy of ever more energetic ethers between gross matter and God (Stewart & Tait, 1875). Even as late as the 1930s, physicist Oliver Lodge (1851-1940) believed that an \"ethereal body\" might mediate between body and mind (Lodge, 1933). \"Etheric force\" and \"etheric currents\" in the body were claimed as the basis of the induction reso - nance motion devices of John Worrell Keely (1827-1898) (Paijmans, 1998). However, with publication by Albert Ein - stein (1879-1955) of the special theory of relativity in 1905, the ether fell out of scientific fashion, although variants are still alive and well in twenty-first-century quantum physics (Duffy & Levy, 2008). Since the 1980s\u2014perhaps partly in reaction to the notoriety of Einstein's e = mc2\u2014many CAM writers have favored the phrase subtle energy . Such name substitutions indicate a concern for keep - ing the vital fluidum on a par with the currently accepted terms of science. In 1975, Fritjof Capra (b. 1939) pub - lished his influential book The Tao of Physics , comparing qi with the quantum field of modern physics (Capra, 1975). Partly as a result, in addition to \"subtle energy,\" a par- ticularly tenacious label in recent decades has been the term quantum , popularized by Deepak Chopra (b. 1946) (Chopra, 1989), although already in the mid-1980s con- sidered overused or employed so vaguely as to be mean - ingless (\"quantum silliness\") by those critical of CAM (Stalker et al, 1985). Quantum fields have been evoked since to explain healing (Rein, 1998), particularly nonlocal healing (Schwartz & Simon, 2007), or \"para-physical\" phenomena (King, 1990), and writers such as Mae-Wan Ho and James Oschman continue to explore the place of quantum physics as an explanatory model for CAM prac - tices (Ho, 1993; Oschman, 2000, 2003). Quantum \"bio - field\" of \"information\" interpretations of vitalism are covered in some detail elsewhere (Chapters 14 and 15; Mayor & Micozzi, 2011). HEALING ENERGY Many \"new\" methods of healing appeared in the twentieth century, the best-known early survival being reiki (), developed in his johrei () method shortly after. These were followed by the \"polarity therapy\" of Randolph Stone (Rudolph Bautsch, 1890- 1981) in the late 1940s (Sills, 1989), unorthodox or \"para - normal\" healing in the 1950s (Rose, 1954), and \"therapeutic touch,\" devised by Dolores Krieger (b. 1935) in the early 1970s. Krieger's method is aimed at restoring the free flow of prana within the patient (Krieger et al, 1979). It was further developed as \"healing touch\" by Janet Mentgen (b. 1938) and \"quantum-touch\" by polarity therapist Richard e10 fundamentals of complementary and alternative medicine Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.than an esoteric \"laying on of hands\" (magnetic activity administered from a distance). Others have suggested that Palmer probably borrowed some of his ideas from Still (Baer, 1987; Fuller, 1989). As with Still, even 20 years after Palmer abandoned his magnetic clinical work, a mesmeric heritage is readily evident in his writings: \"Disease is a manifestation of too much or not enough energy. Energy is liberated force; in the living being it is known as vital force. . . . It is an intel - ligent force, which I saw fit to name Innate, usually known as spirit\" (Beck, 1991). Disease is a disruption in this \"Innate\" or \"intelligent force,\" for which the nervous system is the conduit. Through alignment of the spine, the nerves are freed so that the force can move without inter - ference and produce healing. Vital energy is guided and shaped by the structure of the body, and the noncorporeal agency of life is housed in the nerves and guarded by the spinal vertebrae. D.D. Palmer's son Bartlett Joshua Palmer (1882-1961) at first marketed his father's emphasis on the Innate, or Universal Intelligence, inherent in all, and on the single cause of \"dis-ease\" as \"interference with the supply of mental impulse\": \"The Chiropractor removes the obstruction, adjusts the cause, and there are going to be effects\" (Palmer, 1911). Many later chiropractors have tended (at least outwardly) to distance themselves from such potentially contentious statements (Fuller, 1989). Naprapathy, for example, developed by chiropractor Oakley Smith in 1907, emphasizes work on the spine and its connective tissue rather than anything more subtle (National College of Naprapathic Medicine, 2008). Massage (see Chapter 17) is one of the earliest and most pervasive varieties of healing (Sigerist, 1961). In the West, \"Swedish massage\" has been the best-known approach for nearly 200 years, developed originally by Per Henrik Ling (1776-1839) and based on the techniques used in the Chinese method of tui na (although without any acknowl - edgement of the role of qi) (Maanum & Montgomery, 1985). Over the last century, many unconventional massage therapies practiced in the West have increasingly found their rationale in vital energy theory. Examples of methods derived in part from the yoga model include Ayurvedic massage (Douillard, 2004), breema (Frey, 2001), Narendra Mehta's champissage (Indian head massage) (McGuinness, 2007), Thai massage (Gold, 2007), and rolfing (Rolf, 1977), with its own offshoots such as Aston-Patterning (Aston, 1998) and Hellerwork (Heller & Henkin, 2004). More numerous are those that hold some concepts in common with the acupuncture model: acupressure (Kolster, 2007), chi nei tsang (qi Namikoshi, 1969; see subtle seiki soho of Akinobu Kishi (b. 1945) (Davies, 1998), watsu (Dull, 1993), jin shin jyutsu (Burmeister, 1997), and jin shin do () (Teeguarden, 2002); and even Balinese traditional has since been bred out of osteopathy, which renders it practically indistinguishable from mainstream medicine (Baer, 1987; Gevitz, 2004). The system of cranial osteopathy, however, created by Still's student, the osteopathic physician William Garner Sutherland (1873-1954) (Sutherland, 1990), is still contro - versial, as are its offspring, the \"light-touch therapies\" of osteopath John E. Upledger (1932-2012). Foremost of these is craniosacral therapy, developed between 1975 and 1983 very much in accordance with Still's original ideas (albeit to release restrictions in the craniosacral system and so improve the functioning of the central nervous system), and often used by nonosteopaths (Upledger, 2008). From 1977 to 1980, Upledger, with Zvi Karni, also developed the methods of somato-emotional release, focusing on the release of trauma-induced holding patterns (somatic and emotional) and \"energy cysts\" within the tissue (Upledger, 2002). The biodynamic craniosacral therapy of Franklyn Sills (b. 1947) has grown in a slightly different direction, bringing together the \"implicate order\" of quantum physi - intelligence\" and the \"breath of life\" in an ordering or \"biodynamic\" principle or life force (Sills, 2001-2004). Sills emphasizes the importance of a state of \"dynamic stillness\" and inner awareness in his method of craniosacral biodynamics (Sills, 2011). A quite different, gentle, noninvasive, osteopathically based form of body therapy is Ortho-Bionomy or \"the correct application of the laws of life,\" developed in the 1970s by Arthur Lincoln Pauls (1929-1997). Pauls fre - quently quoted Still's \"rule of the artery,\" believing that blockages in blood flow should be corrected (Patel, 2007). As with craniosacral methods, Ortho-Bionomy fosters inner awareness in both patient and practitioner (Over - myer, 2008). Another innovator who originally called himself an osteopath (although he never trained as such officially) was Tom Bowen (1916-1982) (Baker, 2001). He began his practice of the Bowen technique in the 1950s (Albrecht & Edmonds, 2000). Some Bowen practitioners write about the method as a \"method of moving blocked energy\" (Olafimihan & Hall, 2002), and this is something he apparently talked about informally with his students (Burgess, 2008). Mesmeric vital energy took a somatic and even mechani - cal twist in the creation of chiropractic (see Chapter 19), currently the third largest doctoral-level health care profes - sion, after medicine and dentistry, in North America (Wardwell, 1992). Created in 1895 by Daniel David Palmer (1845-1913), chiropractic in origin is another marriage of the indigenous healing craft of bone setting (Cooter, 1987) and the American tradition of mesmeric healing (Beck, 1991). For 10 years before his discovery of chiropractic, Palmer worked (like Still) as a magnetic healer, occasion - ally using hand passes and magnetic rubbings of the spine (Fuller, 1982). In an intuitive flash (or, some say, clairvoy - ant communication; Beck, 1991), he realized that \"putting down your hands\" (mechanical adjustment) worked better Vitalism e11 Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.tional notions or methods such as qi and the jingluo or pulse taking. Some have equated the jingluo with blood vessels (Kendall, 2002; Schnorrenberger, 2006). Others have made some connection between qi and electricity, and\u2014sometimes in line with the electrodynamic field theory of Harold Saxton Burr (1889-1973) (Burr, 1973; Crane, 1950) or the direct current perineural transmission conjectures of Robert O. Becker (1923-2008) (Becker & Selden, 1985)\u2014use electronic equipment to measure bio - electrical activity at acupuncture points and/or to stimu - late them, for instance with electrical, electromagnetic, or laser devices (Mayor, 2007). At the other end of the spectrum, the complex and mul - tidimensional concept of qi has been hijacked by Western concepts of \"vital energy.\" It is overly simplistic to equate qi and \"energy\" (Porkert, 1983), just as it is to discard it altogether or equate it with bioelectricity, but such atti - tudes have even percolated back to China (Kendall, 2002; Kuen, 2000). In the words of one standard Chinese text - book, \"Qi is energy that moves\" (Shuai, 1992). Although Stahl used the term energia , \"energy\" only came into general use in science in the mid-nineteenth century, as a more precise substitute for the ambiguous term force (Martin, 1981; Tait, 1876). Many contemporary acupuncturists glibly use the word energy and talk of \"vital energy\" (Motoyama, 1981) and of \"energy circulat - ing\" through meridians (Motoyama & Brown, 1978). However, qi is neither \"substance\" nor \"energy\" (Wiseman & Ellis, 1995). \"Qi = energy is an equation that does not compute\" (Birch & Felt, 1999). The translation of qi as \"matter-energy\" is also inexact (Sivin, 1987), except for a handful of texts written since the eleventh century (Robinet, 1997). This is not to deny the value of a model of acupuncture based on the bodily experience and mental concepts of flow. Patients do indeed frequently report sensations of movement in the body (along the channels) during acu - puncture treatment (Buck, 1986), and sensing qi is a key part of practice for many acupuncturists (Cassidy, 2011). We must, however, tread cautiously whenever we are tempted to reduce the statements of one medical system to those of another, even (or perhaps especially) if we find notions derived from fluid anatomy or the physics of energy attractive because of our unconscious cultural bias. Both \"subtle\" and gross anatomy have their place in acupuncture. As with osteopathy, chiropractic, and massage, there is a spectrum of acupuncture needling methods, from the vig - orous intramuscular stimulation method discovered by Chan Gunn in 1973 (Gunn, 1996) to the palpatory subtle - ties of toyohari , developed by Kodo Fukushima (1910- 1995?) and others in the 1950s (Fukushima, 1991). In general, it is probably fair to say that practitioners of the gentler approaches have more sympathy with the concept of qi. Both \"touchy-feely\" traditional acupuncturists and those who practice medical acupuncture and do not want to stray outside the bounds of conventional science are massage (see Chapters 35 and 36). Others with a partial energy focus include Esalen massage, based among other sources on Swedish massage and the sensory awareness methods of Charlotte Selver (1901-2003); reflexology (Carter, 1969; Keet, 2008; Norman 20); and its offshoot, metamorphic technique (Saint-Pierre & Boater, 1989). Methods such as the approach (or \"Trager psychophysical integration\") of Milton Trager (1908-1997) may not explicitly refer to energy, but (like Ortho-Bionomy) emphasize the freeing of \"blocks\" within the body and the enhanced sensitivity of both client and therapist in their shared experience (Liskin, 1996). ACUPUNCTURE AND ITS OFFSHOOTS The first detailed accounts of acupuncture reached Europe in the 1680s, although it was not actually practiced here for nearly another 140 years, in France. Stripped of any references to qi or the jingluo , it was medically fashionable from 1825 until 1832, before being replaced by mesmerism as the latest fad (Mayor, 2007). In the United States, in the 1820s acupuncture was brought to the attention of the Philadelphia medical community with the publication of a translation by Benjamin Franklin's great-grandson, physi - cian Franklin Bache (1792-1864), of a French textbook on the subject (Morand 1825). For the remainder of the nine - teenth century, acupuncture was reduced to a technique for local pain relief, often confused with simple puncture for anasarca or late as the tenth edition of the influential Textbook of Medicine by Sir William Osler (1849-1919), acupuncture was referenced as an effective treatment for lumbago, or low back pain (Osler, 1919, p 101), before being removed in subsequent editions after Osler's death by those who thought they knew better than him. In the late 1920s, acupuncture resurfaced, again in France, when George Souli\u00e9 de Morant (1878-1955), influ - enced Bergson (1859-1941) (Bergson, 1914), qi \"energy,\" \"for want of anything better\" (Souli\u00e9 de Morant, 1985), despite the qualms of his colleagues (Needham & Wang, 1956). Since the 1960s, acupuncture has enjoyed increasing success in Europe and North America, so providing an important ideological boost and infusion of credibility for CAM in general. It is now one of the most rapidly growing health care professions, supported by a considerable research effort (Han, 1987; MacPherson et al, 2007). This success has come at a price, however. As with their nineteenth-century predecessors, many acupuncturists with conventional medical training use acupuncture as a purely physical technique (e.g., \"dry needling\" of \"myofas - cial trigger points\"; Seem, 1993) based on physiological principles (Sato et al, 2002), with little regard for tradi -e12 fundamentals of complementary and alternative medicine Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.Trubo, 2001). In 1995, one of those he had trained, Gary Craig, launched \"emotional freedom techniques,\" a sim - plified version of thought field therapy that eliminates muscle testing, substituting instead a standard algorithm of tapping on all the meridians. In 2000, Fred Gallo published a textbook on his own energy diagnostic and treatment methods (Gallo, 2000). More recently, Phil Mollon has designed \"psychoanalytic energy psychother - apy\" for practitioners whose background is in more tradi - tional psychotherapies (Mollon, 2008, 2011). All these approaches now make up the field of \"energy psychology\" (Gallo, 2005). \"Quantum mysticism\" has raised its head here too, with authors such as Johnjoe McFadden and Arnold Mindell exploring in depth the quantum nature of the mind (McFadden, 2000, 2002; Mindell, 2000) and others such as Peter Fraser, Bruce Lipton, Lynne McTaggart, and Dean Radin describing how fields or flow of information or intention may be involved in healing or other \"paranor - mal\" phenomena (Fraser et al, 2008; Jonas & 2005; McTaggart, 2003, 2007; Radin, 2006). Acupuncture-Derived Methods\u2014the Machine as Intermediary Apart from devices that stimulate acupuncture points with measurable, physical energy, there are many types of equip - ment that purport in some way to detect, harness, amplify, balance, or otherwise alter the energies of the jingluo or related systems of the body to improve health. Most of these are based on methods created in the 1950s: ryodoraku (Yoshio Nakatani), electroacupuncture auricular medicine (Paul Nogier, 1908-1996). Related methods from the 1970s include the \"apparatus for mea - suring the function of the meridians and the correspond - ing internal organs,\" or AMI (1972; Hiroshi Motoyama, b. 1925), MORA therapy (created in 1975 by Franz Morell and Erich Rasche), and the VEGAtest (developed in 1978 by Helmut W. Schimmel, 1928-2003, and known origi - nally as the \"vegetative reflex test\"). Most of these and their derivatives now employ complex computerized systems that bear little resemblance to the traditional practice of acupuncture (Mayor, 2007). OTHER \"ENERGY\" TECHNOLOGY Methods such as AK, the BDORT, Nogier's \"vascular auto - nomic signal\" and their numerous progeny, as well as EAV and the VEGAtest, have much in common with the earlier technologies of dowsing (Weaver, 1978), radiesthesia (Mermet, 1959), and radionics (Tansley, 1975). There have been attempts to explain these precursors in terms of con - ventional science (Tromp, 1949), whereas, in order to encourage acceptability, the VEGAtest and other EAV- related devices have sometimes been described as methods of biofeedback (Mayor, 2007). However, they are still caught in the mesmeric trap: they either involve some kind slowly learning to accept that each point of view has its merits and that there is plenty of room for different types and traditions of acupuncture. Methods derived from acupuncture but not using needles divide into those in which there is direct contact between patient and practitioner and those in which some technical device comes between them. Acupuncture-Derived Methods Involving Patient Contact \"Zero balancing,\" or \"ZB,\" is a gentle system of bodywork developed in the early 1970s by Fritz Smith (b. 1929), a doctor, osteopath, and acupuncturist, on the basis of his studies of rolfing, yoga, and meditation, among other methods. Smith considers qi as \"energy,\" its main charac - teristic being movement, whether in currents or as an undefined field. ZB treatment aims to restore a smooth flow of energy throughout the body, but in the context of body structure. During treatment, there may be involun - tary responses (as in other body-centered therapies) \"caused by resistance to the passage of energy through a dense or congested area of the body\" (Smith, 1986, 2005). One experienced ZB practitioner, Tim Newman, has given an amusing (but also instructive) account of con - fronting Edzard Ernst (b. 1948), one of the most intransi - gent and obtuse critics of CAM in the UK, on the existence of this \"energy.\" Ernst, not believing in such a possibility, was also unable to experience it subjectively for himself (Newman, 2011). In 1964, chiropractor George Goodheart (1918-2008) invented the system of \"applied kinesiology\" (AK) based on muscle-strength testing (Kendall & Kendall, 1949). Good - heart found that many factors can positively or negatively affect muscle strength, and his system evolved rapidly. He soon claimed to be able to evaluate the activity (over-energy or under-energy) of the acupuncture channels with AK (Walther, 1976). A simplified version was popularized as \"touch for health\" by John F. Thie (1933-2005) in the 1970s (Thie & Marks, 1973), and a description of another simple muscle-testing procedure, the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test (BDORT), was published by Yoshiaki Omura (b. 1934) in 1981 (Yamamoto, 2008). Both AK and the BDORT have been used to test many different aspects of body (and mind) function, and both\u2014like so many other forms of CAM rooted in vitalism\u2014have frequently been attacked as pseudoscientific quackery. John Diamond (b. 1934) was the first to attempt an integration of AK with psychotherapy (Diamond, 1979). In 1979, Roger Callahan (b. 1925), a clinical psychologist, studied with Diamond and found that simple stimulation (tapping) at an acupuncture point on the Stomach channel was able to release a patient from severe, lifelong phobia. On the basis of this experience he developed \"thought field therapy\"\u2014so called because thoughts held in the mind appeared to him to have an informational expression in the energy field of the body (Callahan & Vitalism e13 Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.explorations are best undertaken under the guidance of an experienced teacher (see, e.g., Tweedie, 1979). LIFE AND GRAVITY Whereas Mesmer considered gravity to be an aspect of the vital fluidum , for other eighteenth-century physicians such (Schaffer, 1978) and Fran\u00e7ois Boissier Sauvages de la Croix (de la Croix, 1763), life is what overcomes the deadening force of gravity. Movement and the interplay with gravity is an essential attribute of life, and a sense of kinesthetic flow is at the very core of dance. Thus, it is surprising that apart from the 5Rhythms movement meditation practice first devised in the 1960s by Gabrielle Roth (1941-2012) (Roth, 1998; 1999), other CAM movement, dance, and posture therapies rarely mention any sort of life force or energy. Rolando Toro Mario Araneda (1924-2010), for example, founder of the Biodanza system (\"dance with life\" or \"dance of life\"\u2014 originally called \"Psicodanza\"), writes about a relearning of life's primordial functions based on instinct to counter the repressive structures fostered by consumer society and totalitarian ideologies, but not about the life energy as such (Araneda, 2008). However, most movement, dance, and posture approaches certainly do emphasize self- awareness as a key. This is true for instance of the Felden - krais method of Mosh\u00e9 Feldenkrais (1904-1984) (Feldenkrais, 1990) and the Alexander technique of F. Mat - thias Alexander (1869-1955) (Jones, 1997). THE MIND, TRANCE, AND CHANNELING The animist position that the mind, rather than any subtle force or energy, is the primary arbiter of health, was taken up by many of Mesmer's followers. One in particular was very influential in America. Phineas P. Quimby (1802- 1866) first worked as a magnetizer or magnetic healer (reconstituted names for a mesmerist) in Portland, Maine, but soon came to believe that disease follows from \"a wrong direction given to the mind\" and healing corre - spondingly from changes in mental state (Dresser 1969). His student Warren F. Evans (1817-1889) published the first book on \"Mind Cure\" or \"New Thought,\" in which he advocated cultivating deep meditative states to contact the divine healing energy within (Evans, 1869), \"a battery and reservoir of magnetic life and vital force\" (Evans, 1874). Quimby's other notable student was Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1919), a former patient who went on to found the system of Christian Science. More radical and doctrinaire than Evans, she declared that all disease, pain, misfortune, and evil are illusion, Divine (rather than individual) Mind being the only reality. The illusion of illness thus can be overcome through prayer, which leads to healing. Eddy denied any relations with Mind Cure, mesmerism, or other methods of healing, but her venomous denuncia - tions of Quimby, forbidding of \"laying on of hands,\" and of nonphysical energy (with considerable self-training required to become proficient, or perhaps sensitive to the body states or energy involved), or they are dependent on intention or the mental state of the operator-practitioner and/or patient (certainly they also require at least a \"sus - pension of disbelief \" to be used effectively). In either case, their results are difficult to replicate, so that they remain controversial, if intriguing. There are other technologies that are claimed to reveal life energy dysfunctions within the body but remain con - troversial. Examples are Kirlian photography (a serendipi - tous Khrisanthovna Kirlian, d. 1971) & Rubin, 1973), with its echoes of spirit photog - raphy, and electro-crystal therapy (developed in 1988 by Harry Oldfield) (Niblock & Petre, 2000), whose anteced - ents include shamanic practices (Eliade, 1964) and bach's investigations into the odic force (Reichenbach, [1851] 1965). Crystals on their own have been used both to detect and to treat energetic imbalances within the body, and may be associated with methods using color or sound (McClean, 2006). T'ai Chi, Qigong, and Yoga Acupuncture, Oriental massage, and healing methods were not the only significant imports to the West in the second half of the twentieth century. Yoga, with its emphasis on prana was long established (see Chapter 21), with a prolif - eration of approaches under the influence of Theosophy earlier in the century. A number of \"soft\" martial arts (using the opponent's force, rather than meeting force with force) soon became popular as well, in particular t'ai chi (taiji, quan) (Frantzis, 2006) and ki aikido () (Tohei, 1976), both qi-based arts. These, together with yoga and the Pilates method (\"contrology\") of Joseph Pilates (1880-1967), based in part on yoga postures and breathing (Robinson et al, 2000), have contributed to a ready accep - tance of qigong (see Chapter 28), as well as various spin- offs such as Jun Konno's ai chi (Adami, 2002), and countless \"new\" forms of meditation (often formulated in nineteenth- century vitalist terms; Miura, 1989) (see Chapter 7). Although the physical aspects of yoga have become readily established in the West, the traditional theories of the nadi and prana that underpin both hatha yoga and tantra yoga are less accepted (Dazey, 2005). There are those, however, who have explored the byways of tantra and related practices (such as the \"interior alchemy\" of Daoism, as distinct from qigong; Robinet, 1997), and in particular kundalini , the (usually) unconscious or instinctive corpo - real energy envisaged as a sleeping serpent coiled at the base of the spine ( susumna channel) (Flood, 1996). Rousing the kundalini , whether wittingly or unwittingly, can lead to dramatic experiences of \"energy-sensation\" or \"currents\" when \"blocks\" in the susumna or other nadi are encoun - tered, and these may be accompanied by psychological disturbance (Krishna, 1971; Sannella, 1976). Such e14 fundamentals of complementary and alternative medicine Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.Great White Brotherhood (Prophet, 1976) involve a panoply of spiritual beings contactable during mesmeric trances (in today's parlance, during altered states of con - sciousness, channeling, higher states of awareness, or transmissions from spiritually evolved beings). Such asso - ciations are rarely organized as professional healing bodies, and indeed their methods routinely exceed the limits of healing practice, categorizable instead as alternative or emergent cults, or religions. A contemporary view of hyp - nosis (see the section below) is that \"mesmeric trance\" results from autosuggestion (see Chapter 10), a useful per - spective to keep in mind, so to speak, when considering these latter entities. PSYCHOLOGICAL ENERGIES Of all the mesmeric forces, the most complex, prolific, and hidden ones lie concealed in psychology. Significant aspects of clinical psychology's origins are connected with attempts to legitimize, mainstream, or find the real source of mes - merism and vital energy. In 1843, the Scottish physician James Braid (1795-1860) sought to clean up mesmerism's tainted reputation by changing its name to hypnosis , after Hypnos ( ), the Greek god of sleep. He postulated that mesmeric manifestations were \"entirely attributable to the mechanical pressure on an excited state of the nervous system\" and that the effects were due to a mental force, not magnetism, and certainly not some mysterious fluid (Braid, 1899). Hypnosis became a major concern in psychology and retains its importance in some areas of conventional medi - cine (Heap & Aravind, 2002). Hypnosis for these purposes can be taken together with such forms of passive volitional intention as guided imagery (Hall et al, 2006) and the auto - genic training of Johannes Schultz (1884-1970) (Linden, 1990), derived in part from postmesmeric methods of autosuggestion and with parallels in yoga (Bird & Pinch, 2002). It has in turn contributed to the formation of such modern cognitive-behavioral mind-body interventions as biofeedback (Schwartz & Andrasik, 2000), the relaxation response (Benson & Klipper, 2001), and the reexamination of older, self-control practices such as meditation (West, 1987). These mind-body interventions shift between conven - tional and nonconventional, and they have become valu - able intellectual and clinical resources for CAM, lending it significant credibility and allowing the vital force to be conceptualized in psychosomatic terms or within the current mind-body framework. They are the most scien - tific aspects of the mesmeric legacy, a kind of legitimate mesmerism, and have generated much research (e.g., Eccleston et al, 2003; Izquierdo de Santiago & Khan, 2007; Ostelo et al, 2005). \"Behaviorism\" itself, created by John B. Watson (1878-1958), emphasized external behavior and reactions rather than internal mental states. It has been described by one opponent as \"soulless psychology,\" the \"Newtonian psychology par excellence\" (Graham, 2001).descriptions of animal magnetism as \"malicious\" (Tatar, 1978) reveal her origins only too clearly, assuring Christian Science a place in the history of vital energy (Feldman, 1963; Schoepflin, 1988). By the late 1890s, New Thought authors such as Ralph Waldo Trine (1866-1958) had also replaced the fluidum inflow [of] Infinite Intelli (Trine, 1897). \"Channeling spiritual power through your thoughts\" was also central to the method later popularized by Norman Vincent Peale (1898-1993) as the \"power of positive thinking,\" which he claimed would lead to \"peace of mind, improved health, and a never-ceasing flow of energy\" (Peale, 1952). Norman Cousins (1915-1990), well- known for his personal battles against illness, was another who emphasized the capacity of the human mind and body to regenerate: \"The life-force may be the least understood force on earth\" (Cousins, 1979). New and updated forms of mind-based approaches to healing are particularly prevalent in the United States, examples being \"a course in miracles\" (Keyes, Beyond any organi - zation, the notion of \"what you think is what is real\" and a focus on love infuse important sectors of the modern CAM community, resonating through history in surprising ways. Quimby's 1859 declaration that \"Love or True Mind heals all\" (Dresser, 1969) could almost have been taken from Bernie S. Siegel's best-seller Love, Medicine and Miracles (Siegel, 1986), or even perhaps vice versa. Over a century ago, William James (1842-1910) wrote of the \"verbiage\" of Mind Cure, and how the \"Gospel of Relaxation\" of the \"Don't Worry Movement\" was becom - ing pervasive (James, 1902). The meditation, relaxation, and breathing techniques involved partially derived from somnambulistic or mesmeric trance states (see, e.g., Davis, 1885) but also, James considered, from both New England transcendentalism and Hinduism (see Chapter 7). They certainly helped prepare the way for further adoption of the numerous Asian-style and other meditation and relax - ation methods in the twentieth century that for many are now associated with CAM. In spiritualism, the trance states of animist mesmerism were used to contact noncorporeal realities and beings. Healing dispensations, medical diagnosis, and medical advice were common products of \"tuning-in,\" as much as clairvoyance or clairaudience. This movement was later reincarnated in the New Age scene of the 1970s and 1980s (Mayor, 2011; Melton, 1988). As with some forms of \"past lives therapy\" (Netherton & Shiffrin, 1978), phenomena such as \"experiencing the healing powers of interplanetary Brotherhoods and curing their medical ailments by soul travel to different planes of reality\" (Levin & Coreil, 1986, p 890) are frequently direct descendants of animist mes - merism. Associations such as the Spiritual Frontiers Fel - lowship founded by Arthur Ford, Edgar Cayce's Association for Research and Enlightenment (Carter, 1972), and the Vitalism e15 Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.(Driesch, 1914, 1929), a concept that in turn contributed to the morphogenetic field theory of Rupert Sheldrake (b. 1942) (Sheldrake, 1981). Closing the loop, Sheldrake's \"morphic resonance\" has been compared with Jung's concept of synchronicity as an acausal connecting princi - ple (Piirto 1999). Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957) developed Freud's concept of libido in a rather different way, concentrating on its physical expression and simultaneous psychological content (Kelley, n.d.). Libido here is a real energy (\"orgone\" or \"bioenergy\"), discharged during emotional expression and sexual orgasm (DeMeo, 1998) and manifesting physi - cally as static (but not galvanic) electricity (Spitzer, 2005). Reich considered the flow of life and its block in the frozen patterns of our personal histories (\"character armor\") as both ultimately derived from the same energetic source (\"orgonotic streaming\") (Reich, 1972). It is noteworthy that in 1921, even before Reich published his major work, the novelist D.H. Lawrence (1885-1930) was writing that illness can arise from the blocking of flow within the body, suppressing the sensual will. For Lawrence, as for Reich, this could also lead to psychological stunting of whole genera - tions , not just individuals (Lawrence, 1971). For both, the vitalist position was essentially antiestablishment, indeed revolutionary. Reich's orgone has been uncritically and 1987). Alexander Lowen (1910-2008), one of Reich's foremost pupils, focused on the release of the chronic muscular holding patterns of the character armor, tensions associ - ated with reduced vitality (Lowen, 1973) and emotional conflict, unresolved and probably repressed (Lowen, 1975). He expunged Reich's provocatively named \"orgone\" in favor of a blander, less politically challenging \"bioenergy\" and posited that all living processes can be reduced to its manifestations (Lowen, 1958). For Lowen, although nerves may mediate our inner perceptions and coordinate responses, \"the underlying impulses and movements are inherent in the body's energetic charge, in its natural rhythms and pulsations,\" blood in particular being \"the energetically charged fluid of the body\" (Lowen, 1976, p 51, 52). Inevitably, it has been suggested that orgone is identi - cal to qi (Senf, co-developed \"bioen - to found the Insti - tute of Core Energetics in 1980, integrating this work with insights from his study of Eastern traditions and the psychic explorations of his wife, Eva Pierrakos (1915- 1979). Like Lowen, he understood that \"pain results when the energy flow is blocked,\" but also emphasized that a free flow of energy both from and into the \"core\" of the person is necessary for spiritual development. There are many other neo-Reichian therapies, such as the Kelley-Radix work of Charles R. Kelley (1922-2005) (Kelley-Radix, 2009), the \"biosynthesis\" approach of David Boadella (b. 1931), and the \"biodynamic psychology\" Like Watson's original behaviorism as well as much hypnotherapy, \"cognitive-behavioral therapy\" (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic method with a goal-oriented approach, which makes it particularly amenable to research. It started life as \"rational therapy\" in the hands of Albert Ellis (1913- 2007) during the 1950s (Ellis, 1975). A more direct spin-off of hypnosis is \"neuro-linguistic programming\" (NLP), created in the 1970s by Richard W. Bandler (b. 1950) and John Grinder (b. 1940) from \"modeling\" therapists such as the psychiatrist and medical hypnotherapist Milton Erick - son (1901-1980). Here again, the approach is goal ori - ented, one key to success being for the therapist to know in advance the desired outcome of the intervention (Bandler & Grinder, 1979). Both CBT and NLP encourage brief rather than prolonged therapy, but they differ in that CBT pays no or little attention to the unconscious mind, whereas NLP makes use of unconscious behaviors and communication, although without the need to translate these into conscious form. No mysterious forces here\u2014just the mind and its reasons. Rather different was the method of psychoanalysis originally developed by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) in the 1890s on the basis of his studies in hypnosis with Josef Breuer (1842-1925). They initially proposed that disorders of the mind might result from \"a block that interferes with the normal current of feeling in such a way as to cause stagnation and overflow\" (Breuer & Freud, 1974). Both used hydraulic and electrical language to describe their new way of working (e.g., flows, dams, charges, discharges, excitation, cathexis, currents of energy, resistance, tension) (Zweig, 1933). To the horror of most of his contemporaries, Freud considered the will and force of life not as a form of higher intelligence, but as instinctual , defining \"libido,\" the energy of instinct, as a drive toward sexual gratification (Stafford-Clark, 1967). In his later writings, he redefined it as a drive toward any form of pleasurable bodily sensation (Wolff et al, 1990) or even as the energy of all the life instincts (Hall, 1954). James Hillman (1926-2011) has pointed out that the lin - guistic roots of the term libido encompass notions of plea - sure, pouring (flow), and freedom, as well as sexuality (Hillman, 1999). For Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), unlike Freud, libido was once more not so much instinctual as intentional , a neutral \"psychic energy\" in some ways like water, - [1928] 1969a), flowing down gradients, associ - ated with light and creative heat (Jung, 1967). He distinguished libido from \"vital energy\" (Jung, 1969b), comparing it instead with Melanesian mana , which he interpreted as a qualitative, not quantitative, power or influence, present in the atmosphere of life, although in a way supernatural rather than physical (contrast p 69.e4, earlier). He also explained it as a drive rather than a force, akin to the \"Will\" be compared with the \"nonenerget - ical\" psychoid \"entelechy\" of Hans Driesch (1867-1941) e16 fundamentals of complementary and alternative medicine Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.other objects in the world than as the core of the individ - ual's own being\" (Laing, 1969). HOMEOPATHY AND THE \"SPIRIT-LIKE VITAL FORCE\" For much of the nineteenth century, homeopathy was the most serious alternative to conventional Western medi - cine, particularly in the United States (Rothstein, 1992). Created by Samuel Christian Hahnemann (1755-1843), classical homeopathy espouses the belief that whatever symptom complex a substance can cause in a healthy person, infinitesimally small amounts of the same sub - stance can cure diseases with the same symptom configura - tion. The small dosage has the capacity to evoke the spirit-like vital force ( dynamis ), everywhere present in the organism and maintaining both the sensations and activi - ties of all its parts in harmony. Hahnemann described the rationale of his approach in The Organon of Rational Healing , first published in 1810 and in its sixth edition by 1842 (Hahnemann, 1983). The book begins with his account of how \"pathologically untuned vital force,\" the \"inner essence of disease,\" may lead to the \"disagreeable sensa - tions\" of disease, emphasizing that the influence of medi - cines is dynamic, not material. Progressive dilution in the form of \"potentization\" or \"dynamization\" of homeo - pathic remedies using a method he called \"succussion\" renders them even more effective. Hahnemann several times likens the \"dynamic, virtual action\" of medicines to the invisible force of magnetism, their effects \"perceived by the nervous sensitivity every - where present in the organism.\" Moreover, \"the dynamic forces of mineral magnetism, electricity, and galvanism act no less homeopathically and powerfully on our vital prin - ciple than medicines actually called homeopathic\" (Hahn - emann, 1983, p 16, 21, and 209). He further states that \"it is impossible only through the efforts of the intellect to recognize the spirit-like force itself,\" although in contrast \"it is possible to create a very grave disease by acting on the vital principle through the power of imagination and to cure it in the same way\" (Hahnemann, 1983, p 21 and 23). Toward the end of the Organon he writes effusively of the healing force of Mesmer's animal magnetism as \"a mar - velous, priceless gift of God to man,\" emphasizing the role of the \"strong and benevolent will\" of the mesmerizer to \"transmit human force\" to the debilitated. In contrast, he abhors the \"monstrous derangement of the entire being termed clairvoyant trance \" (Hahnemann, 1983, p 210-212). Hans Burch Gram (1786-1840), an influential early Ameri - can homeopath, also had a strong interest in mesmerism (Fuller, 1989). The origins of Hahnemann's \"spirit-like vital force\" go back to Paracelsus and van Helmont, as well as the more recent vitalism of Stahl (Coulter, 1977). At its inception, homeopathy also shared some characteristics with animal magnetism. Today other parallels may be highlighted. Following Hahnemann's aside on the dynamic force of of Gerda Boyesen (1922-2005) (Boyesen, 1994). Stanley Keleman has combined his experience with chiropractic, bio-energetic analysis and other therapeutic approaches in what he calls \"formative psychology\" (\"your body is your energy\"; Keleman, 1975). More information on these thera - pies, all of which owe considerable debt to Reich and his concept of orgone energy, can be found in the specialist journal Energy and Character founded by Boadella in 1970 (International Institute for Biosynthesis, 2008). A useful review of the web of connections between these various forms of bodywork and the world of dance has been written by Helen Payne (Payne, 2006). Reichian therapy is of course not the only bodywork method to focus on muscle relaxation. The Rosen method (Marion Rosen, b. 1914) is also intended to release chronic muscular tension. Rosen's teacher Lucy Heyer had found that treating patients with breathwork, movement, and massage enabled them to contact their emotions more freely in subsequent sessions of Jungian analysis. As Reich intuited, working with breathing and body awareness enables contact with the unconscious (Rosen & Brenner, 2003); in a sense, in an over-rationalized life, the body becomes the unconscious \"shadow\" (Conger, 1988). Holotropic Breathwork, created in the mid-1970s by Stanislav Grof (b. 1931) and his wife Christina, involves both intensified breathing and bodywork in a group setting, and is believed to facilitate access to nonordinary states of consciousness. Although Grof does not theorize about the role of vital energy in this work, participants commonly report greater awareness of somatic processes and bodily impulses, in particular feeling where energy is blocked or streaming within the body (Collinge, 2000; Taylor, 2003). Another author who emphasizes the importance of inner focus and of feelings within the body is Eugene T. Gendlin (b. 1926). The method of \"Focusing\" he and his colleagues developed involves awareness of the \"physical sense of meaning,\" the \"felt sense\"\u2014not just body sensa - tion, not just feelings or thoughts, but body-mind aware - ness of a total situation (Gendlin, 1981) or of \"our ongoing life process\". A very different approach to \"flow\" is that of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Although he writes of \"a loss of the feeling of self-consciousness\" and \"the merging of action and awareness\" in flow, he also repeatedly emphasizes the importance of a clear purpose, concentration, and sense of control. In other words, he explicitly intends his method to \"fortify the self \" rather than enable a letting go into deep contact with the inner flows of the body. As with CBT and NLP (and to an extent the \"what you think is what is real\" positive thinkers), his aim is to foster better outward goal-directed behavior (\"higher, faster, stronger\") (Csikszentmihalyi, 1992). To the ego, the animus, or rational mind, the interior of the body remains a shadowy unknown world (Becker, 1997; Conger, 1988). The body itself is in danger of being dis - owned (Young, 2006), \"felt more as one object among Vitalism e17 Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.2011; Neuburger, 1926). Early in the eighteenth century, Richard Mead (1673-1754), another eminent physician whose ideas influenced Mesmer (Mesmer, 1980), identified \"nature\" itself with the immaterial principle of life (Neu - burger, 1926), and in the 1770s the influential professor of medicine at Edinburgh University William Cullen (1712- 1790) reinstated the term vis conservatrix et medicatrix naturae (Neuburger, 1926), although in a different sense (Hiroshi, 1998). He considered that life consists \"in the excitement of the nervous system, and especially of the brain, which unites the different parts, and forms them into a whole,\" and that \"powers, which have a tendency to hurt and destroy the system, often excite such motions as are suited to obviate the effects of the noxious power,\" these \"motions\" preferred to assist \"tonics\" such as cold or \"fixed air\" [carbon dioxide]) rather than depleting it (with laxatives and purgatives) (Eddy, 2010). The earliest American natural healing movement was Thomsonian herbalism. Samuel Thomson (1769-1843), a farmer burdened by the back-breaking nature of his work, came to realize that exposure to cold temperatures can be a key cause of illness. On the basis of Galen's humoral pathology (Berman, 1951), and borrowing from indigenous colonial-frontier and Indian treatments (see Chapters 1, 37), he created a system based on restoring the body's \"natural heat\" using predominantly herbs and steam baths. The Thomsonian movement eventually developed into the profession of eclectic medicine, with a strong following in Europe (Griggs, 1981). Although Thomson himself did not use terms such as the vis medicatrix naturae or \"vital force\" (Fuller, 1989), the break-away physi - comedicalists (Haller, 1997) came to insist that treatment must be in harmony with nature and the vital force and must assist the latter instead of destroying it (Brown, 1985). As with homeopathy, herbalism as a profession suffered an eclipse in the United States in the early twentieth century (Rothstein, 1988) (probably less so in Europe), but more recently has once again begun to flourish (Brown, 1985; Hoffmann, 2003) (see Chapter 24), although set back once more by recent draconian legislative measures in Europe (MHRA 2013). Other systems of herbal medicine are also much more in evidence in the West than even a few years ago. These include Chinese herbal medicine (see Chapter 28), Tibetan medicine (see Chapter 30), and Ayurveda (see Chapter 31)\u2014all three of which have a vitalist core ( qi, rlung, prana )\u2014as well as traditional methods transplanted from other cultures (see, e.g., Chapters 34, 35, and 43). Herbal medicine is in many respects closely allied to the ecological movement and the \"Gaia hypothesis\" of James Lovelock (b. 1919), in which the earth's biosphere, atmo - sphere, oceans, and soil form one single self-preserving system, virtually a living organism in itself (Lovelock, 1979, 2006) (see Chapter 27). In this context, the vis medicatrix naturae begins to take on new meanings (Mayor, 2011). In particular, \"earth energies\" have frequently been explored electricity, the prominent homeopath George Vithoulkas (b. 1932), for instance, has written on the equivalence of \"electrodynamic energy\" and the \"vital force\" (Vithoulkas, 1980), and the work of Jacques Benveniste (1935-2004) on electronic digitizing of signals from ultra-low dilutions (Jonas et al, 2006) has been used as the basis for various computerized therapeutic devices, including variants of the VEGAtest, as well as for justification of older technolo - gies such as radionics (see earlier). (Interestingly, the origi - nal radionic device created by Albert Abrams [1863-1924] included a \"dynamizer,\" although not for the purpose of potentization; Wilson, 1998.) Homeopathy suffered a serious decline in the first half of the twentieth century (Kaufman, 1971), but more recently had a serious revival and generated considerable conventional biomedical research and debate (Ernst & Hahn, 1998), with a predict - able backlash from vocal opponents such as Steven Novella (b. 1964) (Novella & Roy, 2008) and David Colquhoun (b. 1936) (Colquhoun, 2005). As with osteopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture, and psy - chology, there are of course different approaches to home - opathy, from the \"classical,\" with its dependence on Hahnemann's spirit-like vital force, to the everyday use of low-potency remedies and \"isopathy\" (use of potentized disease agents), where such subtleties are less of a consideration. Related methods include the anthroposophic medicine of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) and Ita Wegman (1876- 1943), in which treatment aims to enhance the life force of the patient as an axis for improved health and deepened self-knowledge (Steiner & Wegman, 1996), and the flower remedies of Edward Bach (1886-1936), who believed that health was a result of mental or emotional balance and that the unique energetic property of a plant could be used to rectify an imbalance and restore the awareness of \"whole - ness\" (Bach 1990). Such self-knowledge is one of the aims of treatment with the Bach remedies (Dr Edward Bach Centre, n.d.). Although not potentized using succussion, the Bach remedies are classified as homeopathic remedies in the United States. A number of other flower essence systems now exist. Rather different is the 12 tissue salts system of Wilhelm Sch\u00fcssler (1821-1898). Although his remedies are homeo - pathically potentized, Sch\u00fcssler considered both disease and the effects of the tissue salts to be chemically based rather than involving any vital force (Boericke & Dewey, 1986). As within homeopathy itself, a polarization between vitalist and materialist approaches is evident here. HERBALISM, NATUROPATHY, AND THE VIS MEDICATRIX NATURAE Hippocrates considered that the body contains within itself the power of self-healing, physis () (Garrison, 1929). Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689), known to his sup - porters as the \"English Hippocrates,\" wrote similarly of the vis medicatrix naturae (the healing power of nature) (Anstey, e18 fundamentals of complementary and alternative medicine Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.using dowsing or divining, the paths they take likened to the jingluo of acupuncture (Graves, 1978; Skinner, 1982). In the late 1940s, there were even attempts to amplify the vis medicatrix naturae electrically (Eeman, 1950). Enhancing the vis medicatrix naturae was a key concept in the nineteenth-century health reform movement (Whorton, 1988) and the later eclectic approach known as \"naturopa - thy,\" based on the Naturheilkunde of German practitioners as Sebastian Kneipp (1821-1897) and Gleich (1798-1865) (Lohff, 2001). (1794- 1851), founder of the influential \"Grahamism\" health movement, aware of the focus on the stomach by Grimaud and other Montpellier vitalists, stressed the need to support the \"vital power\" provided by digestion. A Presbyterian minister, he also inveighed against the excesses of \"artifi - cial\" city life and the dangers of masturbation and alcohol, which could so easily deplete the body (Donegan, 1986; Fuller, 1989). The physicomedicalists warned not only against masturbation and excess venery, but even pro - longed nursing of children, for the same reason (Haller, 1997). Other health reformers such as Russell T. Trall (1812-1877) and William A. Alcott (1798-1859) took a similar puritanical line, considering sexual intercourse more frequently than once a month as excessive, for example (Donegan, 1986). Trall also advocated contracep - tion as a better alternative for women \"compelled\" to bear children that were a constant drain upon their life forces (Cayleff, 1988) and instructed fledgling hydropathic prac - titioners on the connections of their own methods with mesmerism (Fuller, 1989). The Naturopathic Society of America and American School of Naturopathy were both founded in 1901 by Kneipp's follower, the water cure therapist Benedict Lust (1872-1945) (Cooksey, 2001). He defined naturopathy as \"the art of natural healing and the science of physical and mental regeneration on the basis of self-reform, natural life, clean and normal diet,\" with the use of various CAM therapies but \"to the exclusion of poisonous drugs and nonadjustable surgery\" (Fishbein, 1932). John Harvey Kellogg (1852-1943), a prominent second-generation health reformer, Seventh Day Adventist, and the co-creator of corn flakes, similarly promoted a no-drug philosophy, with \"only such means employed as NATURE can best use in her recuperative work\" (Fuller, 1989). Like many other naturopaths, he laid considerable emphasis on the avoid - ance of constipation, labeling it in a distant and very American echo of Mesmer as \"the most destructive block - age that has ever opposed human progress\" (Whorton, 1988). Another key figure was Chicago-based Henry Lind - lahr (1862-1924), whose system of \"Nature Cure\" was based on the principle that \"every acute disease is a healing effort of Nature\" (Lindlahr, 1913). In Britain, Lindlahr's methods were popularized by practitioners such as James C Thomson (1887-1960) and Stanley Lief (1892-1963), and in 1945 the Nature Cure Association (founded in 1925) merged with the the British Association of Naturopaths to form the British Naturopathic Association.Although legal constraint may have prevented the wide - spread adoption of naturopathy as a unifying ideology for all natural therapies, its basic philosophy has spilled over into many fields. In the words of Jack Reginald (J.R.) Worsley (1923-2003), founder of one particularly influen - tial five-element acupuncture tradition, \"Only Nature can cure disease. Practitioners only assist Nature, acting as instruments of Nature in putting the patient back on the path to health\" (Worsley, 1985, p xi). Despite its virtual disappearance as an independent profession in North America by the 1970s (Gort et al, 1988), naturopathy is once more established today (see Chapter 22). DIALECTICS OF CAM\u2014THE RETURN OF VITALISM Vitalism is, by definition, a movement in opposition to a purely physicochemical science, part of a recurring dialec - tic of the immaterial and the material that occurs through - out history. Conventional science, including biomedicine, is inevita - bly reductionist, often perceived as needing to grind phe - nomena down into manageable, measurable particles. As a generalization, in contrast CAM therapies tend to look at the \"big picture,\" the whole, the wave and flow of things. A result is that CAM practices in the 1970s frequently ad - opted the label \"holism,\" and holistic methods were seen to share a common thread of belief in a \"universal Life En - ergy\" (Bauman & Berkeley Holistic Health Center, 1978), with the aim of opening \"pathways or flows\" within the body (Otto & Knight, 1979)\u2014although the original defini - tion of holism by the South African soldier, statesman, and scholar Jan Christiaan Smuts (1870-1950) as \"the ten - dency in nature to form wholes that are greater than the sum of the parts through creative evolution\" was antivital - ist as well as antireductionist (Smuts, 1926). Other labels for holistic medicine such as \"alternative\" and \"comple - mentary\" are, like \"vitalism,\" oppositional terms, defined in relation to \"orthodox\" or \"conventional\" medicine. Language and emphasis change over time, but a list of congruent polarities might look something like that in Table 6-2. Polarization inevitably occurs within CAM as well, as mentioned earlier for mesmerism, osteopathy, chiroprac - tic, acupuncture, psychotherapy, homeopathy, and related methods. And there is clearly quite a gulf between the abstract mind fields of the quantum theorists and the flows and feelings of the bodyworkers (although both concern connection ). The CAM label itself is a compromise, but at least allows rapprochement, although the risk of polarization and con - flict remains (quackbusters vs. neohippies). Vitalism is often associated with or democratic tendencies (Darnton, 1968; Mayor, 2011; McClean, 2006; Moore, 1977), but stark reminders of misinterpretation can be seen in its elevation to a \"gospel of energy\" by the Italian Futurists and military in World War I (will, struggle, Vitalism e19 Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.\"dynamic sensations,\" violence) (Thompson, 2008) and in the fact that so many of the innovators mentioned earlier\u2014 Freud, Reich, Rosen, Feldenkrais, Gendlin, for example\u2014 were emigr\u00e9s from a Europe under the authoritarian regime of the Nazis. Paradoxically, some forms of natural medicine actually flourished in Nazi Germany, homeopa - thy in particular (Abgrall, 2000), which was even tested on inmates of Dachau concentration camp (Hale, 2003). Of course, life is not so schematically dualistic in prac - tice. There are various forms of vitalism and mechanism, not a simple single spectrum with \"extreme\" vitalism at one end and \"extreme\" mechanism at the other (Benton, 1974). How we think and perceive depends on many differ - ent factors: \"vitalistic or mechanistic judgements . . . are largely determined by nonscientific beliefs or prejudices\" (Wheeler, 1939). Some of us will be more inclined to the Cartesian \"I think, therefore I am\" (Descartes, [1649] 1988), others to \"I feel, therefore I live.\" It is interesting, for example, that in most fields of CAM women practitioners had tended to outnumber 1988), and there are clear associations between feminism and CAM (Mayor, 2011). On the other hand, mechanists may become vitalists in older age (Wheeler, 1939), although the contrary trend is also possible. In the past, new branches of medical science have been founded by insisting on theo - retical concepts not reducible to those accepted at the time 2008). \"Yesterday's As the neo-Confucian Zhu Xi (1130-1200) wrote of the eternally oscillating relationship between qi and li (form, reason, principle of organization, ), \"Throughout the universe, there is no qi without li, nor li without qi\" (Yoke, 2000). Both are necessary to life. CONCLUSION\u2014VITALISM IN TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY CAM Much of human reason is based on metaphor (Lakoff, 1987), and much is grounded in visceral, lived experience (Johnson, 2007). In particular, the basic metaphors of vital - ism are present for all of us, usually unacknowledged (and metaphors themselves have been characterized as \"vital\" or \"moribund\" (Soueif, 1977). Whether they originate in our genes or in our inner, intrauterine, or early life experience; are intellectually molded later on by our sociocultural envi - ronments; or are part of our individual energy or thought fields, they are there whether we like it or not, whether we consider ourselves cool rationalists or hot-blooded intu - itives. Even in imagined interaction with a partner, \"it would seem as if images of energy patterns [are] one of the psyche's natural language or symbol systems\" (Reed, 1996). As one writer on vitalism has put it, vitalist views are too \"resilient and complex to be corroded by mere facts\" (Brooke, 1971).

Whatever the outcome of sci - entific investigations of vitalist medical traditions, and despite ongoing vociferous protests from pseudo-scientist quackbusters, vitalism's attractiveness for practitioners and patients is likely to remain a growing presence in health care, provided we can give it the necessary time in our own new and accelerating \"axial age\" (Lambert, 1999). As such, it is part of an increasing awareness of ecology as central to our very survival on this small planet of ours (Mayor, 2011).

Antares (with the glossary [Magick River website], n.d., Available at animal magnetism, quantum fields, and so forth\u2014attests to their significance for us as humans. This is particularly clear in literature and popular culture, where vitalism remains a pervasive influence. It is sustained in the writing of influential Romantic authors such as Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) (Grabo, 1930), his wife Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797-1851) (Shelley, 1831), and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac (Balzac, 1831), as as by post-Romantics such as Gustav Meyrink (1868-1932) (Meyrink, 1915) and D.H. Lawrence (e.g., in Women in Love , with its ubiquitous flows of kundalini -like \"fierce electric energy\") (Lawrence, 1999). It is difficult even now to find a novel that, in some form or other, does not make use of the language of vitalism, whether consciously or unconsciously (Mayor, 2011). What a society considers to be its \"main - stream\" views may actually be shared only by a numerical minority (Moore, 1977). Folk (medical) traditions from around the world lay stress on \"the flow, transmission, and balance of life energies\" (Hufford, 1988), as for instance in the positive or negative vibraciones of curanderismo (see Chapter 39). At the same time, as Mollon puts it, \"knowl - edge of the energy fields, and how to work with them, has always been 'forbidden'\" in our own culture (Mollon, 2011, p 248). As can be seen from the ubiquity of various forms of vitalism in the many CAM practices mentioned earlier, its multivalent possibilities have made it endlessly attractive. Its very imprecision allows for enormous flexibility and adaptibility, explanatory models morph and coalesce, and there are so many strands to its history that it is now prob - ably impossible to disentangle. However, some aspects of vitalism do appear consistently across the various modali - ties of CAM, more or less in the order shown in Figure 6-1 (a more detailed schema can be found in Mayor & Micozzi [2011]). In conventional medicine it is sometimes too easy for a person to become a thing, an object, an irrelevant specta - tor, overwhelmed by a mechanical world of technology, tests, and surgery in which stress may adversely affect self- healing. The vitalist perspective, on the other hand, aligns itself with coherent, life-affirming principles. The vitalist universe is not random, detached, or mindless; it is benign, coherent, and hospitable. Instead of a medicine whose central issues can seem coldly mechanical and buried in inaccessible molecular biology, vitalism instinctively invites Figure 6-1 Vitalism aspects in complementary and alternative medicine.
