Biosimilars are not exact copies of their reference product s but highly similar with regard to efficacy and safety and available at a discount. In Switzerl and, relatively low biosimilar prescription rates have prompted interest in a health technology assessment (HTA) of the infliximab reference product relative to biosimilars for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . This scoping report determines the feasibil ity of such an HTA. We conducted a systematic literature search for evidence on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and health economic outcomes of the infliximab reference product relative to biosimilars in RA. We also conducted a targeted search for eviden ce on biosimilar -related ethical, We iden controlled (RCTs) , 14 real -world evidence (RWE) studies , and 11 health economic studies. RCTs reported a range of clinical e fficacy, safety immunogenicity , and patient -reported outcomes . RWE studies primarily reported on effectiveness, safety, and treatment discontinuation. Health economic studies were costing studies or budget impact analyses. A substantial body of l iterature was identified on biosimilar regulation in different settings . For legal and ethical aspects, we developed sets of questions that we considered important for discussing reference products and biosimilars, particularly with regard to non -medical switching. The evidence base suggested that an HTA comparing the infliximab reference product with its bio- similars for treatment of RA in infliximab -na\u00efve and switched patients would be feasible. This HTA would have to include a syst ematic review ( and possibly a meta -analysis) of efficacy, effectiveness, and safety as well as a budget impact analysis (but not necessarily a full economic evaluation).

In the report , the methods that are to be used when a n HTA is pursued are described. Based on quantity and quality of the extra cted evidence , the feasibility of pursuing a n HTA is judged. Analysis of the ind ividual study outcomes is not the objective of the scoping report . Scoping Report 13 1 Policy question and c ontext The biopharmaceutical infliximab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) used to treat a number of inflammatory autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In 2016, infliximab generated costs of around CHF 128 million, rendering it the most cost -incurring drug reimbursed by the mandatory health insur- ance in Switzerland .1 For biopharmaceuticals such as infliximab, biological products having sufficient similarity with thei r previously approved reference product are available as biosimilars. At their market entry, b iosimilars have to be at least 25% cheaper than their reference product in order to be reimbursed in Switzerland.2 In 2018, infliximab biosimilars only accounted for less than 10% of a pre- contrast, other Euro- pean countries (such as Norway, Denmark, France, England, the Netherlands and Portugal) exhibit considerably higher proportions of prescribe d infliximab biosimilars as these countries adopted policies recommending the substitution of infliximab reference product s with biosimilars.3 These policies are based on clinical studies suggesting that initiating tr eatment with infliximab biosimilars4 5 as well as switching patients from infliximab reference product to biosimilars6 7 is an effective and safe way to treat RA. Therefore, the applicant suggests that an HTA should be performed to evaluate whether initiating treatment with infliximab biosimilars as well as switching patients from infliximab reference product to biosimilars is an effective, safe and cost -effective way to treat RA. Scoping Report 14 2 Research q uestion s This scoping report r eviewed the evidence base on the safety, clinical efficacy and cost -effectivene ss of the infliximab reference product relative to infliximab biosimilar in patients with RA who did not respond adequately to standard therapy with disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drug s (DMARDs) .Note that we chose to label the reference product as the in tervention and biosimilars as the comparator in line with the target of the Swiss HTA programme, namely disinvestment: Disinvestment would likely target refer- ence products so, as per the FOPH's suggestion, the reference product was treated as the intervent ion. The term \"standard therapy\" was chosen for consistency with infliximab entries in the Spezialit\u00e4tenliste (SL; the list of drugs reimbursed by mandatory healthcare insurance in Switzerland). Standard therapy, for the purpose of this report, refers to first-line therapy with conventional synthetic DMARDs (see Section 3.2.2 ).8-10 Note t hat we follow ed the DMARD nomenclature by Smolen et al. (Figure 1).11 Figure 1 Nomenclature of disease -modify ing anti -rheumatic drugs Source: Developed based on Smolen et al.11 The following research questions, which informed the development of Population, Intervent ion, Com- parator, Outcome (PICO) criteria (Section 5), were considered: Is it safe, clinically efficacious and cost -effective to initiate treatment with infliximab biosimilar instead of the infliximab reference product in patients with RA and inadequate res ponse to standard therapy with DMARDs? Is it safe, clinically efficacious and cost -effective to switch treatment from the infliximab refer- ence product to infliximab biosimilar in patients with RA and inadequate response to standard therapy with DMARDs? Scoping Report 15 Is it safe, clinically efficacious and cost -effective to switch treatment from infliximab biosimilar to the infliximab reference product in patients with RA and inadequate response to standard therapy with DMARDs? Scoping Report 16 3 Medical b ackground 3.1 Description of rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmun e disease that puts a substantial burden on patients, healthcare systems , and society.12 13 The disease mainly affects joints and leads to painful swelling, erosive damage , and functional deterioration . RA can also have e xtra-articular effects, e.g. on the pulmonary, ocular , vascular , and cardiac systems, so is also referred to as a syndrome with multiple sub-diseases.12 14 In this section, we describe the pathophysiology (Section 3.1.1 ), the aetiology and natural disease course (Section 3.1.2 ), and the diagnosis/classification and assessment of RA (Section 3.1.4 ). Subse- quent sections describe the treatment (Section 3.2), and the epidemiology and burden of RA (Sectio n 3.3). 3.1.1 Pathophysiology : inflammation and autoimmune response Multiple inflammatory cascades are involved in RA.14 15 An important cascade is mediated by the proin- flammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and and lead to TNF over- production , which in turn triggers overproduction of IL 6 and other cytokines.14 Cytokines (and chemo- kines) in the synovial compartment activate endothelial cells and attract immune cells, which promotes the inflammatory response . The presence of a ctivated fibroblasts, T and B cells, monocytes , and mac- rophages eventually results in osteoclast activation and differentiation, with subsequent bone erosion.12 15 In addition to inflammation, certain autoimmune processes are characteristic for RA. Key auto antibodies include rheumatoid factor , which targets immunoglobulin G, and anti antibodies (ACPA) , which bind to citrullinated proteins.12 14 At least one of these autoantibodies is present in 50 to 80% of patients, and seropositive patients tend to have more sever e disease, poorer clinical outcomes , and increased mortality relative to seronegative patients.12 14 3.1.2 Risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis The risk of developing RA is associated with genetic as well as environmental and lifestyle factors. A family history of RA is associated with an increased risk of developing RA, and several genetic loci have Scoping Report 17 been linked to development of RA.13 14 Environmental and lifestyle factors consistently linked to RA include smoking and exposure to silica.13 16 17 3.1.3 Natural course of rheumatoid arthritis Development of RA has been described as a result of \"multiple hits\"12: A genetically susceptible person, expos ed to environmen tal triggers and with lifestyle risk factors in conjunction with epigenetic modifica- tions, may lose tolerance to self over time, which leads initially to asymptomatic synovitis and then to symptomatic arthritis.12 13 3.1.4 Diagnosis/classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is a clinical diagnosis, which is partly based on the exclusion of other diseases: Tender and swollen joints, morning joint stiffness , and incre ased CRP and erythrocyte se dimentation rate (ESR) levels are typical for RA , but these symptoms could also indicate other forms of arthritis.12 Sets of classification criteria are generally used to define RA for study recruitment and comparison of patient populations across studies.12 18 Classification criteria have changed over time . The 1987 classi- fication criteria proposed by the American Rheumatism Society, for example, were dev eloped to achieve improved sensitivity and stricter definition of RA than in guidelines from the 1950s and 1960s.19 The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Lea gue Against Rheumatism (EU- LAR) criteria in turn were developed to improve upon the sensitivity of the 1987 criteria and identify patie nts at earlier disease stages, given increasing evidence on the benefits of early treatment initia- tion.18 20 The 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria (Table 1) are applied if synovitis is confirmed in at least one joint for which no other disease pr ovides a plausible explanation. A patient achieving a summary score of at least 6 is classified as having definite RA . Patients presenting at a later stage in their disease can also be classified as having definite RA if they have typical erosions or long -standing disease that would have previously fulfilled the criteria. Table 1 ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria for classification of rheumatoid a rthritis Classification criteria Score Joint involvement 1 large joint 0 2-10 large joints 1 1-3 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) 2 4-10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) 3 Scoping Report 18 Classification criteria Score >10 joints (at least 1 small joint) 5 Serology (at least one test result needed for classification) Negative rheumatoid factor and negative ACPA 0 Low-positive rheumatoid factor high -positive ACPA 3 Acute phase reactants (at least one test result needed for classification) Normal CRP and normal ESR 0 Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR 1 Duration of symptoms <6 weeks 0 6 weeks 1 Source: Adapted from who show typical erosions and/or long -standing disease who would have previously fulfilled these criteria should also be classified as having RA. 3.1.5 Assessment of disease activity and progression Once patients start treatment, monitoring and regular disease assessment are important to evaluate progress towards treatment targets (see Section 3.2).21 A range of assessment instruments are availa- ble, including laboratory and imaging data and physi cian- or patient -reported outcomes (PROMs) (see Table 2, which contains the most frequently used measures and those recommended by an ACR work- ing group in their 2019 update ).21 For more information, also on feasibility of assessments, we refer the interested reader to the ACR working group review paper21 and the ACR website on disease activity and functional status measurement, which provides forms and calculators for key disease activity meas- urements22.21 Many of these instruments are used as outcomes in efficacy and effectiveness studies of RA treatment , with s even instruments included in a Core Outcome Set (COS) for clinical trials in RA: pain, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, physical disability, swollen joints, tender joints, and acute phase reactants, with radiographic assessment also to be performed in studie s of at least 1 year duration.23 24 These core outcomes are combined into composite indices to assess disease activity. The most fre- quentl y used index is the Disease Activity Index 28 (DAS28, based on assessment of 28 joints).12 14 25 As the DAS28 is somewhat complex to calculate , simpl er indices have been developed, e.g. the Simpli- fied Disease Activity I ndex (SDAI) and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI).26 Cut-off points have been defined in the literature for these composite indices to classify patients as being in remission or having low, moderate , or high disease act ivity (low disease activity or remission are established treat- ment targets in RA (see Section 3.2)).8 12 27 Composite indices that assess disease activity based on PROM also exist . Examples include the Patient Activity Scale, the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data , and the Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Scoping Report 19 Disease (RAID) score .21 28 -30 In general, PROMs, which include the composite indices just listed but also functional status, pain, health -related quality of life (HRQoL) , and fatigue, are becoming increas- ingly important in RA treatment.31 These measures provide not only valuable information to physicians but also a patient perspective on disease and treatment which may contribute to improve (shared) de- cision -making in treatment.32 Some indices have been designed primarily for use in research. These indices assess change from baseline. Examples include the EULAR response criteria, which use follow -up DAS28 and change in DAS28 to classify disease response as \"goo d\", \"moderate\" , or \"no (response )\", and the ACR response criteria, which specif y an improvement of at least a certain magnitude in tender and swollen joint counts and in at least three (of five) additional criteria ( Table 2).33 34 In addition to assessments of disease activity, radiologic damage should be examined .14 35 A range of instruments is also available to assess extra -articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (for an over- view, see Scott et al.14).

Note: The RA COS is a set of endpoints recommended to be assesse d in clinical trials of RA.24 ACR 20/50/70 criteria are used only in clinical studies but not in clinical practice as they assess a change i n status and do not have a continuous scale.12 14 Scoping Report 22 3.2 Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis The target of RA treatment is clinical remission or at least low disease activity (see Table 2), and treat - to-target strategies are recommended to achieve and maintain clearly defined treatment endpoints.8 12 27 45 49 Overall, treatment of RA should prevent and stop damage to joi nts and preserve function .12 50 51 Several guidelines recommend treatment strategies, primarily based on pharmaceutical interventions, to achieve these treatment targets . Here, we focus on the treatment principles, recommendations , and pathways laid o ut by the 2019 EULAR Recommendations for management of RA with synthetic and biological DMARDs8, the 2015 ACR Guideline for the treatment of RA49 (please note that, at the time of writing in March/April 2020, the 2019 ACR Guideline was in the process of being updated and not yet publicly avai lable22), and German guidelines for management of early RA52 and for DMARD -based man- agement of RA9. The Swiss Soc Rheumatology publishes drug -specific guidance (\" Behandlungs- empfehlung\") on their website and otherwise refers to EULAR a nd ACR guidelines .53 3.2.1 Treatment principles Guidelines la y out several general principles that should inform RA therapy. These include: Treatment of RA should provide best care. Decision -making should be shared between the pa- tient and the treating rheumatolog ist.8 9 49 52 Therapy decisions should be made according to prior therapy, disease activity, functional ca- pacity, presence of erosions, safety , and comorbidity.8 9 As therapy may need to b e adapted, drugs with different modes of action should be accessible to patients.8 Treatment decisions should factor in costs to patients, healthcare systems , and society.8 9 The 2019 EUL AR guideline explicitly mention s the potential of biosimilars, if priced low enough, to reduce h igh treatment costs and inequity in access to treatment .8 Notably, the 2015 ACR guide- lines adds the caveat that \"arbitrary switching between RA therapies\"49 to meet specific payer or healthcare insurance policies is not recommended in patients with low disease activity or in clinical remission 3.2.2 Pharmaceutical t reatment recommendations Guidelines also la y out specific recommendations for pharmace utical treatment. We summarise key recommendations here but note that treatment strategies are not a key focus of the HTA as the infliximab reference product and biosimilar take the same place in the treatment algorithm. It should be noted that guidelines may differ in classifying a specific suggestion as a treatment principle or a recommendation , and that there may be differences in guidelines as to which treatments are preferred at which step Scoping Report 23 Symptoms such as pain and stiffness can be treated with analges ics or non -steroidal anti -in- flammatory drugs.14 52 54 These drugs do not modify the disease. DMARD therapy should be started as soon as RA is diagnosed.8 9 25 52 Early treatment initiation has been shown to be associated with improved long -term outcomes. DMARD initiation within 1 year, relative to 1 to 5 years, of symptom onset was associated with reduced long -term ra tes of radiographic progression.55 9 52 Patients should be treated to the target of sustained disease remission, e.g. as defined by ACR/EULAR criteria ( Table 2).8 9 49 52 If required, low disease activit y instead of remission may be set as the treatment target.. If there is no improvement within 3 months of treatment start or if the target is not reached within 6 months of tr eatment start, therapy should be adapted.8 9 52 The first treatment strategy sho uld include the csDMARD methotrexate.8 9 49 52 Initial therapy should also involve glucocorticoids to reduce symptoms and inflammation , but they should be tapered as quickly as possible to avoid long -term side effects .8 9 52 Throughout the treatment course, glucocorticoids may be used to treat RA flares, particularly when changing DMARDs or as intra -articular injections for individual active joints.8 14 49 If the treatment target is not achieved with the first csDMARD -based approach, therapy needs to be escalated . The 2015 ACR guidelines specify as feasib le escalation options csDMARD combination, biologic therapy , Janus kinase inhibitor), with preference.49 In contrast, the EULAR8 and German9 guidelines recommend to factor in patient prognosis: If the patient has no poor prognostic factors, ther apy escalation should involve additional csDMARDs, likely in combination. If this strategy fails, bDMARDs or tsDMARDs should be used.9 If the patient has poor prognostic factors, therapy escalation should involve adding a bDMARD or a tsDMARD to csDMARDs (ideally methotrex- ate). If further escalation is required, other b DMARDs or tsDMARDs should be considered, with 2015 ACR guidelines expressing a preference to choose a non -TNF inhibitor over tsDMARDs if a TNF inhibitor had been used before.8 9 49 If the patient achieves sustained remission after tapering glucocorticoids, bDMARDs and tsDMARDs may be tapered, particularly when given with csDMARD.8 9 No definition of \"sus- tained\" remission currently exists , but 6 months are frequently used.8 25 While pharmaceutical treatment of RA has advanced considerably in recent decades, open questions remain, e.g. on how drugs work and interact, when to initiate which therapy (e.g. in early RA), how to increase the share of patients achieving remission and how to perf orm treatment deescalation.9 12 Scoping Report 24 3.2.3 Supportive treatment Pharmaceutical treatment can be compl emented with non -pharmaceutical treatment. Supportive treat- ment includes ph ysiotherapy and occupational therapy as well as physical activity , foot care, psycho- logical support , lifestyle adaptations and patient education.14 52 56 Surgery of joints, especially joint re- placement, may also be considered.14 3.3 Epidemiology and burden of rheumatoid arthritis 3.3.1 Epidemiology The prevalence of RA is estimated at 0.51.0% in developed countries, with an estimated 85,000 prev- alent patients in Switzerland and almost 20 million prevalent patients globally.57-61 Estimates for inci- dence vary more widely but generally range between 2550 new cases per 100,000 population per year, which translates to approximately 2,1004,300 incident cases per year in Switzerland.59 62 The risk of developing RA is increased twofold in women (lifetime risk approximately 3.6%) relative to men (lifetime risk approximately 1.7%).59 63 Simil arly, the risk of developing RA increases with age , with mean disease onset between 55-65 years .57 59 3.3.2 Burden of rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is, firstly, associated with a su bstantial mor tality and morbidity burden. All-cause mortality in patients with RA is elevated by approximately 50% relative to the general population, with higher risk in patients with persistently high disease activity.64 65 This increased mortal ity has been at- tributed not only to RA activity but also to elevated risks of comorbidities among patients with RA.59 65 - 67 In particular, the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease is increased in patients with RA relative to the general population.14 65 66 68 Treatment with TNF -alpha inhibitors such as infliximab is associated with reduced mortality relative to treatment csDMARDs.64Treatment itself may be associated with ad- verse events (AEs) , such as infection at infusion/injection sites or tuberculosis (with some TNF inhibi- tors).14 69 Rheumatoid arthritis is, secondly, associated with a psychological burden on patients and reduced qual- ity of life. In a meta -analysis based on a systematic review of observational studies reporting Short Form (SF)-36 results for adult pati ents with RA, the disease was found to have a considerable impact on quality of life.70 Quality of life in more than 22,000 patients, with mean RA duration from less than 1 year to 17 years, was compared wit h the general population and with patients with other long -term diseases . Individuals with RA had lower quality of life than the general population i n the United States (US) and Scoping Report 25 United Kingdom (UK) and than individuals with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and myocardial infarc- tion.70 Regarding disease acceptance, a qualitative study in patients with RA from the Italian -speaking region of Switzerland showed that acceptance was a complex process that required p atients to find a way between grieve for lost capabilities and continued pursuit of one's own goals and values.71 Acceptance was particularly difficult for patients who were diagnosed later (often too late , in many patient's opinion ) in life as these patients experienced the disease as a more si gnificant turning point in their lives . Rheumatoid arthritis is, thirdly, an economic burden o n healthcare systems and society (notably, the economic burden of arthritis in Switzerland was already pointed out in a 1948 paper on productivity losses due to a rthritis72). Both direct medical costs (in particular drug costs) and productivity losses due to reduced work capabilities or absenteeism contribute to this economic burden. Direct medical costs of RA in Switzerland were estimated at CHF 791 million in 2011, with per -patient costs of CHF 15,063.73 A review of studies published since 2000 on costs of rheumatoid arthritis sug- gested that drug costs generally were the large st component in direct costs (up to 87% of direct costs , depending on the country ).74 RA is also associated with considerable productivity losses , in particular due to disability -related produc- tivity losses .66 75 For Switzerland in 2011, productivity losses were estimated at CHF 1,534 billion (or CHF 29,210 per patient), i.e. almost double direct medical costs.73 Overall, a recent review showed that productivity losses, measured with the human capital approach in most studies, accounted for 39% to 86% of total RA-related costs, depending on the country).74 Scoping Report 26 4 Technolog y The technology considered in this HTA is infliximab, given with concomitant methotrexa te to patients with RA who failed standard therapy. More specifically, the focus is on using one version of infliximab, namely infliximab biosimilar, instead of another version, namely the infliximab reference product. 4.1 Technology d escription Infliximab may be called a \"biologic\", a \"monoclonal antibody\" or a \"TNF -alpha inhibitor\", and reference may made to t he \"infliximab reference product \" or an \"infliximab biosimilar\". In this section, we provide an overview of what these terms mean and we describe inflix imab, including its indications, dosage and administration. 4.1.1 Key terminology and context Biologics are drugs produced by living systems , such as animal and plant cells or microorganisms .76 Biologic drugs are large , complex , heterogeneous molecules relative to chemically synthesized small - molecule drugs , which makes them difficult to manufacture .76 77 Importantly, as biologics are produced by living organisms , they change from batch to batch.76-79 Changes in m anufacturing process often lead to changes in the biologic , to the extent that \"widely used biologicals are not, after several changes to their original manufacturing process, anymore identical to the original version at the time of marketing authorization\"80. A biologic drug is referred to as the originator product if it was the first drug with a specific substance (such as infliximab) to come to market. Subsequent drugs with this specific substance can enter the market after patent expiry of the reference product and are referred to as biosimilars (while the origi- nator drug then becomes the reference drug) . Importantly, they should not be called (or c onfused with) generic drugs, which are subsequent -entry products for small molecules: While copies of sma ll mole- cules can be exact , due to t he unambiguous characteris ation of small molecules, biosimilars cannot be exact copies, due to the large, heterogeneous structure of their molecu les.77 81 Similar to their reference products, there may be batch -to-batch variation in biosimilar production .78 Like generic drugs, biosimi- lars are usually priced lower than their respective reference product s.82 The broad definition of biologics provided above captures a wide range of drugs, from vaccines to insu- lins, and disease areas, from cancer to diabetes. Here, we focus on biologics particularly relevant for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as in flammatory bowel disease (IBD) , ulcerative colitis (UC) , and RA. Among such biologic s, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a n important class . Monoclonal Scoping Report 27 antibodies are immunoglobulin molecules produced by cells that are single clones of a hybridoma parent cell.76 83 These antibodies each target a single epitope. Depending on the origin of the parent cell, mAbs can be distinguished further into murine, chime ric, humanized , and human mAbs.83 4.1.2 Description of infliximab Using the terminology just introduced, is a chimeric mAb with inhibition of TNF -alpha as its mode action, which makes it a TNF-alpha inhi bitor . Specifically, this mAb stops cytokine from activating the cellular TNF receptor complex.84 It does this by binding to TNF - alpha in soluble and membrane -bound form , which results in the formation of stable immune complexes. TNF-alpha is then no longer capable of binding to its rec eptor , and intracellular signalling is blocked that would otherwise result in inflammatory activity.84 85 Different pathways by which infliximab affects clinical outcomes have been identified, including regulat ion of the cytokine network, cell recrui (another cytokine) and angiogenesis as well as prevention of cartilage catabolism and erosion of bone.85 Infliximab is administered as an intravenous (IV) two-hour infusion .86 For patients with RA, the initial dose is 3 mg per kg body weight, given in weeks 0 (initial week), 2 and 6 and then every 8 weeks.10 86 Doses can be up -titrated if response is insufficient although the Swiss Society for Rheumatology rec- ommends not to exceed 10 mg per kg body weight every four weeks .10 87 Infliximab is given with con- comitant methotrexate. Infliximab is contraindicated in patients with:10 86 Tuberculosis or other severe (acute or chronic) infections, including sepsis, abscesses , or op- portunistic infections Heart failure classified as New York Heart Association classes III or IV Known hypersensitivity to infliximab or murine protein s Infliximab is generally a safe medication but may still be associated with AEs. Frequent AEs including opportunistic and infusion site infections, serum sickness (a hypersensitive reaction to non -human pro- teins) , headache and dizziness, flush, nausea, di arrhoea, abdominal pain and dyspepsia, hepa totoxicity, rash, pruritus, urticaria, increased sweating , dry skin, , and chest pain.53 86 88 89 4.1.3 Infliximab in Switzerland The infliximab reference product (Remicade\u00ae, MSD Merck Sharp & Dohme AG) was approved in Swit- zerland in 1999 and has been included in the SL since July 2000. Two infliximab biosimilars Switzerland SA) , which both contain Scoping Report 28 the sam e CT-P13 product90, have been included in the SL since October 2016.91 In RA, use of i nfliximab is limited (limitatio ) to patients with active RA after failure of prio r standard therapy with DMARDs.91 Infliximab is associated with substantial c osts to the Swiss healthcare system . It is noteworthy that the Swiss Soci ety for Rheumatology, in their therapy recommendations for TNF -alpha inhibitors, suggested a maximum dose of 10 mg per kg body weight and per every 4 weeks with an explicit reference to treatment costs.53 In addition, infliximab (like other TNF -alpha inhibitor) therapy requires prior costing approval by the medical officer (\"Ve rtrauensarzt/Vertrauens\u00e4rztin\") of the patient's healthcare insurer and must be prescribed only by rheumatologists or in rheumatology departments of university hospitals and polyclinics.91 Currently (April 2020), public list prices for 100 mg of infliximab are CHF 830.90 for the reference product and CHF 627.25 for the biosimilars.91 In 2018, estimated total costs for infliximab were CHF 133 million, equivalent to 1.7% of estimated total drug costs in Switzerland , with an estimated 6,976 individuals re- ceiving infliximab (notably not all for RA as infliximab is also indicated for other autoimmune disease s such as psoriasis (PSO ), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or UC).92 The reference product accounted for an es- timated 83.2% of all infliximab purchases. 4.2 Alternative t echnologies to infliximab This scoping report is about comparing the infliximab reference product and the infliximab biosimilar (Section 5). However, there are alternatives to infliximab for the treatment of RA, which we present here for the sake of completeness. 4.2.1 TNF-alpha inhibitors alternative to infliximab Infliximab was the first but is not the only TNF -alpha inhibitor. Other drugs in this class wh ich are used in the treatment of RA are adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol , and etanercept (etanercept is not a n mAb but a fusion protein). As a class, TNF -alpha inhibitors are c onsidered to have \"revolution- ized\"84 the treatment of RA in the past decades (see Section 3.2).14 The five TNF -alpha inhibitors are generally clini cally efficacious and slow radiographic progression, with relatively little difference in effi- cacy between agents although head -to-head comparisons are sparse.12 84 Scoping Report 29 4.2.2 Alternative biologic classes to TNF -alpha inhibitors In addition to TNF -alpha inhibitors, several other classes of biologics indica ted for RA treatment exist.54 A detailed review of these is beyond the scope of this report, so we list them here only briefly : Anti-IL 6 inhibitors , including tocilizumab and sarilumab .93 94 Abatacept, a fusion kinase inhibitors, including tofacitinib , baricitinib and upadacitinib .96 These are no t biolog- ics but small molecules. Scoping Report 30 5 PICO criteria The pre-scoping report and the research questions (Section 2) informed the PICO criteria (Table 3 to Table 5), which in turn inform ed our searches for evidence . In line with FOPH specifications, we use d the term s \"infliximab reference product s\" and \"infli ximab biosimilars\" in We specified outcome domains (e.g . \"clinical efficacy\") and outcomes as per the pre -scoping report. However, as this is a scoping report and therefore designed to explore and map evidence, additional outcomes within those domains identified during the scoping phase were also considered. Table 3 PICO criteria: patients with RA who initiate infliximab treatment (PICO 1) Population : Patients with RA who did not respond adequately to standard therapy with DMARDs Intervention : Initiate treatment with infliximab referen ce product [boDMARD] Comparator : Initiate treatment with infliximab biosimilar [bsDMARD] Outcome : Clinical efficacy : Clinical response, e.g. ACR criteria, Disease Activity Score 28, Clin- ical Disease Activity Index, Simplified Disease Activity Index, rheu matoid arthritis core set of outcomes including tender/swollen joint count, PK/PD : Pharmacokinetics (AUC, C max) and pharmacodynamic outcomes, including acute phase reactants Patient -reported outcome measures : Functional status; patient global assessment; physician global assessment (grouped here for consistency though not technically a patient -reported outcome); pain; health -related quality of life Safety : Serious and important adverse events Immunogenicity : Anti-drug antibodies and neutrali sing antibodies Treatment adherence : Discontinuation and its reasons (targeting the nocebo effect) Costs and health economic outcomes : Cost-effectiveness and budget impact (set- ting-specific) Source: Based on p 31 Table 4 PICO criteria: patients with RA treated with infliximab reference product (PICO 2) Population : Patients with RA who did not respond adequately to standard therapy with DMARDs and are currently treated with infliximab reference product Intervention : Continue treatment with infliximab reference product [boDMARD] Comparator : Switch to treatment with infliximab biosimilar [bsDMARD] Outcome : As in Table 3 Source and abbreviations: as in Table 3 Table 5 PICO criteria: patients with RA treated with infliximab biosimilar (PICO 3) Population : Patients with RA who did not respond ad equately to standard therapy with DMARDs and are currently treated with infliximab biosimilar Intervention : Continue treatment with infliximab biosimilar [bsDMARD] Comparator : Switch to treatment with infliximab reference product [boDMARD] Outcome : As in Table 3 Source and abbreviations: as in Table 3 Scoping Report 32 6 HTA k ey questions 6.1 Specific questions based on central research questions The central research questions (Section 2) for each of the three different populations of interest (Sec- tion 5) focus on (clinical) efficacy, effectiveness, safety , and cost -effectiveness. The aim of an HTA would therefore be to answer, for patients initiating infliximab biosimilars or switching from the reference product to infliximab biosimilar (or vice versa) , the following questions: What is the clinical efficacy of the infliximab reference product relative to infliximab biosimilar and of the switch from one to t he other ? Efficacy is the extent to which a specific health tech- nology produces a beneficial, reproducible result under study conditions compared with alter- native technologies (internal validity). Efficacy refers to the \"performance of [infliximab] under ideal and controlled circumstances\"97. Efficacy is usually assessed in ran domized clinical trials (RCTs). For biosimilars, RCTs are mostly equivalence trials: Their aim is not to demonstrate superiority or inferiority of a biosimilar relative to the reference product but to demonstrate equiv- alence.98-100 Equivalence means that differences between treatments are clinically irrelevant. In practice, equival ence is established if the difference in clinical response is within a pre -specified interval, to + . Choice of equivalence margins is challenging, with guidance suggesting that the margin should reflect the largest clinically acceptable difference between treatments while also being smaller than the minimum difference between the reference product and placebo.99 What is the effectiveness of the infliximab reference product relative to inflixi mab biosimilar and of the switch from one to the other ? Effectiveness is the extent to which a specific health tech- nology, when applied in real world circumstances in the target group, does what it is intended to do for a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose regarding the benefits compared with alternative technologies (external validity). Effectiveness is assessed using real-world evidence (RWE) , which include, for example, observational studies, pragmatic clinical trials, and post -marketing studies .97 101 What is the safety of the infliximab reference product relative to infliximab biosimilar and of the switch from one to the other ? Safety is a judgement of the harmful effects and their severity using the health technology. Relevant AEs are those that result in death, are life -threatening, require inpatient hospitalisation or cause prolongation of existing hospitalisation (serious AEs) and those that occur repetitively and the most frequent (highest rate).102 Safety can be assessed in RCTs and in RWE studie s. The latter may provide a long-term perspective on safety and use comparatively larger sample sizes that help identify rare but serious AEs . Scoping Report 33 What is the health economic perspective on the infliximab reference product relative to infliximab biosimilar in Switzer land and of the switch from one to the other ? Health economic considera- tions include c ost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) , i.e. the assessment of at least two treatments with regard to their effectiveness in relation to their cost.103 While CEA provides evidence to decision-makers on efficient resource allocation, it does not comment on affordability of a treat- ment - to assess affordability, budget impact analysis (BIA) is required . In addition to cost - effectiveness and budget impact analyses , more descriptive analyses of costs and resource use can be useful for decision -making. Notably, such analyses are not all likely to be transferable to the Swiss setting due to, among others, differences in healthcare systems and presc ription practices. However, they would still pro vide valuable information on study designs and methods that could be used for similar assessments in the Swiss setting. Beyond efficacy, effectiveness, safety and health economics, HTAs focus on additional domains of a technology :104-107 What, if any, ethical issues are there regarding the reference product and biosimilar, in particular switch to biosimilar? Ethical issues include, among others, effects on healt hcare dis tribution, patient autonomy as well as potential harm to patients.108 109 What, if any, legal issues in Switzerland are there regarding the reference product and biosimi- lar, in particular switch to biosimilar? Legal issues include, among others, legal regulation of interchanging medications and therapeutic freedom.107 110 What, if any, social and sociocultural issues are there regarding the reference product and bio- similar , in particular switch to biosimilar? These issues include, among others, effects of treat- ment on values and resource allo cation within a society .104 What, if any, organizational issues are there regarding the reference product an d biosimilar , in particular switch to biosimilar? Organizational issues include, among others, policies for chang- ing to biosimilars on a large scale.111-113 6.2 Additional outcomes of interests and additional question s In agreement with the FOPH, we included additional outcomes that were considered rele vant for (inflix- imab) biosimilars in the scoping report would sug gest their inclusion in an HTA. Scoping Report 34 6.2.1 Additional outcomes for infliximab the pharmacokinetic product relative to infliximab biosimilar , in particular in the context of switch- ing? The comparability of reference product s and biosimilars relies on comparative PK/PD as- sessments and biosimilar immunogenicity is frequently cited as concern so we co nsidered PK, PD, and immunogenicity results as important .80 114 115 How do PROM s differ between the infliximab reference product and infliximab biosi milar , in particular in the context of switching ? PROMs include RA -specific outcomes such as reported functional status and patient global assessment (we also group physician global assessment here) but also more general outcome measures such as HRQoL. We note that patient a nd phy- sician global assessment also have clinical value in RA and indeed form part of many clinical outcome instruments (see Table 2).38 40 Still, we group both assessments as PROMs as they are somewhat more subjective than assessment of joints and laboratory markers. In addition, separating patient assessment and other subjective instruments from more objective ones is helpful to identify nocebo effects (see next bullet point) .116 117 How do treatment discontinuation and its medical and non -medi cal reasons differ between the infliximab reference product and infliximab biosimilar , in particular in the context of switching ? In the literature , there is some discussion around discontinuation of infliximab biosimilar, which was frequently reported to be due not to objective but to subjective worsening of disease, indi- cating a possible nocebo effect.116 117 We therefore considered treatment discontinuation (or retention) rates in RCTs a nd RWE studies to be a relevant outcome, not least with regard to potential health economic modelling of infliximab biosimilars. 6.2.2 Additional question on international regulation and reimbursement of biosimilars At the request of the FOPH, we included evide nce on regulatory procedures for biosimilars in select countries (see Section 7). For a subset of countries , we also assessed evidence on pricing and reim- bursement practices, in addition to those of Switzerland. We grouped evide nce on regulatory and reim- bursement policies within the legal domain . Scoping Report 35 7 Methodology of the literature search We conducted two literature searches to inform this scoping report, one for evidence on efficacy, safety, effectiveness , and health economic outcome s (Section 7.1), the other for evidence on ethical, legal, social , and organizational (ELSO) outcomes (Section 7.2). We chose this approach as evidence on the former would need to be specific to infli ximab and RA , whereas evidence on the latter was broader and included biosimilars in general (not just infliximab biosimilar or in the treatment of RA). This approach allowed us to develop tailored search strategies for each group of domains. 7.1 Literature s earch for efficacy, safety, effectiveness and health economic out- comes 7.1.1 Search strategies and data sources We developed search strategies based on the PICO criteria (Section 5) in collaboration with a medical librarian (see Appen dix 12.1-12.4). Our focus was on the PIC components , and we did not specify out- comes to avoid undue narrowing of search results. The search strategies were implemented by the medical librarian in Coch rane (Section 12). Furthermore , we conducted a search in Google Scholar as allintitle: infliximab biosimilar arthritis (all these wo rds). This straightforwa rd search reflected the search functionality available in the tool. In addition, we searched websites of key HTA agencies (selection agreed in collaboration with the FOPH , see Section 12.3). Websites were searched, using built -in website functionality, for the keywords infliximab and biosimilar (and the respective translation in the local language): For health economic results, we additionally searched the following registries/databases, using built -in website functionality for the keywords infliximab and biosimilar. CEA Registry, hosted at Tufts Medical Center ( https://cevr.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/data- bases/cea -registry ) National Hea lth Service Economic Evaluation Database, hosted at the University of York's Centre for Reviews and Dissemination ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/Re- sultsPage.asp ) Reference lists of studi es included after full -text screening (see Section 7.1.3 ) were searched for addi- tional relevant studies that had not previously been included. Scoping Report 36 7.1.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined accor ding to PICO criteria (Section 5) and were kept broad, with no restriction by publication period or study quality . We included studies with adult populations, in line with the age of RA onset (though we note that paediatric patients might receive infliximab for in di- cations such as Morbus Crohn). S tudies with a published full text in English, French, German , or Italian were eligible. I n line with the \"scoping\" nature of this report, we did not specify concrete outc omes as inclusion or exclusion criteria as long as outcomes were within the domains outlined in Section 6. Inclusion/exclusion c riteria for studies on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, PK/PD , PROMs , and health economic outcomes are listed in Table 6. Studies had to be RCTs, RWE studies , or health economic analyses to be eligible for inclusion . RWE studies and health economic analyses were included if they had been conducted in one of the target countries ( defined in agreement with the FOPH, see below). The decision s to define target coun- tries and which countries to include as target countries were made to obtain information from a broad range of settings relevant for Switzerland while keeping literature sea rches manageable for the scoping report. Target countries included: Switzerland as the primary country of interest for the scoping report and HTA Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Netherlands, and Sweden and the UK as the reference countries used in the \"Auslandpreisvergleich\" (comparison of for- eign prices) to assess cost -effectiveness of drugs in Switzerland The remaining Benelux country (Luxemburg) and the remaining Nordic country (Norway) not already included in the refe rence countries (see previous bullet points) Italy and Spain as important pharmaceutical markets in Europe Australia, Canada , and the United States, which are highly developed countries with important pharmaceutical markets Scoping Report 37 Table 6 Inclusion criteria for studies on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, PK/PD and PROMs Criterion Inclusion Exclusion Publication period No restriction s \u2014 Publication status Published full text available Published full text not available (including conference ab- stracts) Language English, French, German or Italian Not English, French, German or Italian Setting RCT: all RWE study and health economic analyses : Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxemburg, Netherlan ds, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Australia, Canada, United States Randomized controlled trials: none Real-world evidence studies and health economic analyses : not in one of countries listed on the left Study design/type RCT RWE study , including obser vational and register -based studies Health economic analysis, including costing studies, budget impact analyses, cost -minimization analyses , and full health economic evaluations Not RCT, RWE study or health economic analysis Study quality No restrictions \u2014 Study population Adult (18 years) patients with rheumatoid arthritis who failed standard therapy with disease -modifying an- tirheumatic drugs and Initiate treatment with an infliximab product Are currently treated with infliximab reference product Are currently treated with infliximab biosimilar Animal studies Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have not failed standard therapy Patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biolog- ical drugs other than infliximab Patients without rheumatoid arthritis Study intervention Initiate treatment with infliximab reference product + methotrexate Continue treatment with infliximab reference product + methotrexate Continue treatment with infliximab biosimilar + methotrexate Any other intervention Study comparator Initiate treatment with biosimilar + methotrexate Switch to infliximab biosimilar + methotrexate Switch to infliximab reference product + methotrexate Any other comparator Study outcomes No restrictions \u2014 Abbreviation: PD, Pharmacodynamics; PICO, Population, Intervention, Report 38 7.1.3 Study selection Study results from searches in literature databases, Google Scholar , and websites were combined , and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts of studies were then screened, by two researchers inde- pendently, for meeting the inclusion criteria. For studies retained after title -abstract screening, full texts were reviewed independently by two researc hers. From studies meeting inclusion c riteria, study data relevant for the scoping report were extracted into a custom MS Excel workbook , again independently by two researchers (follow -up periods were converted to weeks, assuming an average of 365.25 days per year) . Screening was conducted using the systematic review software CADIMA.118 As per the study protocol, we dual -screened hits for this search at all stages of the screening process and conflicts were resolved through consultation with a third reviewer. We developed an internal guid- ance document to assist members of staff with screening. After the first draft of this internal guidance was completed, two resear chers screened titles and abstracts of a random sample of 100 hits to ascer- tain if criteria were clear and used consistently. We achieved a Kappa value of 82.7%, just above our pre-specified threshold of 80%. Still, we used our experiences from this initia l screening to refine further the internal guidance before rolling it out among the project te am. All hits were assessed for all criteria, with two exceptions: When a hit was of the wrong study design and/or of a non -eligible publication status (a confer ence abstract or poster), we ex cluded this hit and did not assess the remainder of the criteria further in the interest of time and efficient resource use. During the initial title -abstract -screening of a random sample of hits, we noted that titles and abstr acts rarely provided information on concomitant methotrexate treatment or prior failure of DMARD therapy. At the title-abstract -screening stage, we consequently excluded hits based on these c riteria only if there was evidence that these criteria were defin itely not met. A detailed assessment of these criteria was con- ducted during full -text screening. 7.2 Literature search for ethical, social, legal and organizational issues 7.2.1 Search strategies and data sources We developed search strategies for ELSO outcomes in collaboration with a medical librarian (see Ap- pendix 12.2). This search was not restricted by substance or patient population as we considered ethi- cal, legal , and social aspects of biosimilars to apply broadly, regardless of spe cific substances or patient populations. Scoping Report 39 The search was implemented in Medline (via EBSCOhost) (Section 12.2). Furthermore, we conducted a search in Google Scholar as allintitle: biosimilar (all these words) social legal law eth ical ethics organ- izational (any of these words) . This search reflected the search functionality available in the tool. In addition, we searched websites of regulatory agencies using built -in website functionality for the key- word biosimilar . The list of age ncies was drafted in agreement with the FOPH (see Section 12.4). 7.2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed in accordance with those of the efficacy, safety, effec- tiveness , and health econo mic search (see Table 6). For studies of organizational outcomes, we re- stricted eligibility to the same countries for which RWE studies and health economic analyses were eligible (Table 7). However, we impo sed no s tudy design restrictions as we expected discussion s of ELSO outcomes to be presented in a variety of study designs .

A single researcher screened and reviewed the literature and identified studies relevant to the ELSO domain s in CADIMA.118 Note that this review was not systematic. We considered this to be an appropriate approach as the primary purpose was to identify key aspects relevant to ELSO outcomes but not to provide an exhaustive or systematic review of the literature on these domains. In particular for regulatory issues, selecting Scoping Report 40 current guidance documents and recent studies was deemed preferable over summarizing all studies, some of which were (partly) obsolete due to changes in the often fairly dynamic regulation of biosimilars . 7.3 Quality of e vidence assessment Evidence quality was not assessed formally at the scoping stage but will be at the HTA stage. Scoping Report 41 8 Synthesis of evidence b ase 8.1 Evidence base pertaining to efficacy, effectivenes s, safety and cost -effectiveness 8.1.1 PRISMA flow diagram The search for evidence pertaining to efficacy, safety, effectiveness and health economic outcomes yielded 1,545 hits from literature databases and an additional 126 hits from other sources ( Figure 2). Figure 2 PRISMA flow diagram for effica cy, safety, effectiveness, health economic search Abbreviation: PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses .119 Of the 1,1 24 unique hits, 984 were excluded during title -abstract -screening. Of the remaining 140 arti- cles whose full texts were screened, 100 were excluded, most frequently because the y were conference abstracts/posters or because they did not include information o n infliximab biosimilars (see Sec- tion 12.5.1 ). Forty articles were retained for the scoping report, including 15 studies reporting on RCTs , 14 RWE studies and 11 health economic analyses 8.1.2 Efficacy and safety as well as PK/PD, P ROMs, immunogenicity and treatment discon- tinuation outcomes in clinical settings 8.1.2.1 Evidence table for RCTs Fifteen studies reporting on seven RCTs, including their extensions, were identified ( Table 8).4-7 98 120 - 129 By publication date, the first study was from 20134 and the most recent study from 2020127. Scoping Report 42 CoI (Conflict of Interest) and funding : All studies included in the scoping report had at least one author with a CoI. All studies were funded at least in part by the pharmaceutical industry, with the exception of the NOR -SWITCH trial, which was f unded by the Norwegian government.7 128 Countries, settings : Most RCTs were multinational, with the ex ception of NOR -SWITCH (conducted in Norway) and two RCTs from Japan124 126 129. Most studies had a parallel -group d esign, with the exception of three single -arm extension studies6 128 129. Indications : As per our inclusion criteria, all RCTs included (only) patients with RA. The NOR -SWITCH trial also included patients with Morbus Crohn, PsA, psoriasis, SpA and UC, and the trial was not pow- ered to detect differences in outcomes between indications.7 128 Switch, arms and open -label components : Almost all RCTs investigated a switch to infli ximab biosimilar at some point.6 7 98 120 124 127 -129 Upon s witch, most studies continued open -label.6 124 127 -129 An exception was the LIRA trial, which neither assessed switch nor included an open -label component.123 With regard to comparisons and study arms, initial trial phases always compare d infliximab reference product and biosimilar. Different transition designs were chosen fo r implementing and assessing switch.130 131 In the REFLECTIONS B537 -02 trial, half of the patients receiving the reference product were switched to biosimilar after 30 weeks , while the other half and patients initially receiving biosimilar continued on their respective initial medicatio n. After 54 weeks, patients still treated with the reference product were also switched to biosimilar.120 127 A similar design was chosen by Smolen et al.98 In PLANETRA, NOR -SWITCH , and the study by Tanaka et al. , all patients initially receiving the reference product switched to biosimilar so studies continued as single -arm extension studies.6 128 129 Follow -up, sample size, age, and sex : Follow -up periods ranged from 30 weeks up to 105 weeks in extension studies . Commonly used assessment time steps were 30, 54, and 78 weeks. Sample sizes ranged from 71 participants124 to 650 participants4 122. All RCTs recruited both women and men. Partic- ipants' minimum age was between 18 and 20 years in all trials. All trials that specified a maximum age for inclusion used 75 years. Infliximab dose and schedule, prior medication : By design, infliximab was dosed at 3 mg per kg body weight, at weeks 0 (initiation), 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks in all trials except for NOR -SWITCH, in which dose s and schedule s were continued from participants' prior doses and schedules. For all trials, only participants with at least 4 weeks of prior stable methotrexate dose, between 6 and 25 mg per week, were eligible. Primary endpoints : Most RCTs specified clinical efficacy outcomes , particularly ACR20 or DAS28, as their primary endpoint s. Exception s were the Japanese trial by Takeuchi et al.126, which specified a PK endpoint (C max) as its primary endpoint, and its extension by Tanaka et al.129, which specified a safety Scoping Report 43 endpoint (AEs) as its primary endpoint. The single -arm extension of PLANETRA did not explicitly specify a primary endpoin t.6 Scoping Report 44 Table 8 Characteristics of included RCTs First au- thor, year Study name, ID CoI for at least one author Industry funding Coun- tries Indications RCT de- sign Switch assessed Arms Follow - up (weeks) Total sample size Age (years) eligible Infliximab dose (mg per kg) Infliximab ad- ministration et al. , 2015126 JapicCTI - 111620 Yes Yes Japan RA PG No Reference product vs bi- osimilar 54 101 20 to 75 3 0-2-6-every 8w PK/PD (C max) Tanaka et al., 2017129 JapicCTI - 142419 Yes Yes Japan RA Single - arm ex- tension Yes Switched to biosimilar vs continued on biosimilar 105 71 20 to 75 3 0-2-6-every 8w Safety (AE) Lila Yes Yes Multina- tional RA PG No Reference product vs bi- osimilar 54 418 18 to 75 3 0-2-6-every 8w Clinical ficacy (ACR20) Mats uno et 2019124 NCT01927263 Yes Yes Japan RA PG (bio- similar for all after 30w) Yes Reference product vs bi- osimilar 54 242 20 to 75 3 0-2-6-every 8w - 37 Yes Yes Multina- tional RA PG No Reference product vs bi- osimilar 30 584 18 to 75 3 0-2-6-every 37 Yes Yes Multina- tional RA PG No Reference product vs bi- osimilar 54 505 18 to 75 3 0-2-6-every 37 Yes Yes Multina- tional RA PG Yes Continued reference product vs switch to bio- similar vs continued bi- osimilar 78 396 18 to 75 3 0-2-6-every Yes No Norway Crohn, PsA, Pso, RA, SpA, UC PG Yes Referen ce product vs bi- osimilar 52 482 >=18 Unchanged from base- line unchanged from baseline Clinical -002056 - 40 Yes No Norway Crohn, PsA, Pso, RA, SpA, UC PG Yes Switc hed to biosimilar vs continued bi- osimilar 78 380 >=18 Unchanged from base- line unchanged from baseline Clinical ef- Yes Multina- tional RA PG No Reference produc t vs bi- osimilar 30 606 18 to 75 3 0-2-6-every 8w Clinical ef- ficacy (ACR20) Scoping Report 45 First au- thor, year Study name, ID CoI for at least one author Industry funding Coun- tries Indications RCT de- sign Switch assessed Arms Follow - up (weeks) Total sample size Age (years) eligible Infliximab dose (mg per kg) Infliximab ad- ministration Primary endpoint NCT01217086 Yes Yes Multina- tional RA PG No Reference product vs bi- osimilar 54 455 18 to 75 3 0-2-6-every 8w Yes Multina- tional RA Single - arm ex- tension Yes Switched to biosimilar vs continued bi- osimilar 102 302 18 to 75 3 every 8w No info (Not appli- cable) Alten et Yes Yes Multina- tional RA PG Yes Continued reference product vs switch to bio- similar vs continued bi- osimi lar 54 566 >=18 3 every 8w 49 Yes Yes Multina- tional RA PG No Reference product vs bi- osimilar 650 >=18 3 0-2-6-every 49 Yes Yes Multina- tional RA PG Yes Switched to biosimil ar af- ter 30w vs switched to biosimilar af- ter 54w vs continued bi- osimilar 78 safety, PK/PD, PROMs, and immunogenicity outcomes from RCTs Outcomes in all domains were reported by identified studies , with a clear focus on outcomes related to clinical efficacy and safety ( Figure 3). Clinical efficacy : This was the domain for which the most data were available, in particular for ACR criteria and DAS28 (both calculated with ESR and with CRP). Other indices and EULAR response were also assessed frequently . Joint counts and radiologic damage were reported less frequently ( Table 9). Immunogenicity : All studies reported on anti-drug antibodies (ADAb ) and ten also reported on neutral- ising antibodies. PK/PD : Several studies reported PK/PD outcomes, in particular minimum and maximum serum concen- trations and acute phase reactants. Other measures were reported less frequently, with most reported only by a single study.4 PROMs : Nearly all studies reported on PROMs, in particular on functional status, which was the most widely used instrument. Patient and physician global assessment were also reported (as separate out- come measures, i.e. not part of composite disease indices), as was HRQoL. Pain was reported as a separate outcome in four studies. The remainder of PROMs was reported in at most two studies. Safety : All studies reported on safety. Frequent outcome measures included AEs, treatment -emer gent AEs, and serious AEs. Terminology varied between studies, with some also reporting on serious (and severe) treatment -emergent AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment. Assessment of RCT -based evidence : RCTs included in the scoping review ai med to assess the use of infliximab biosimilars compared to infliximab reference product , as well as the possible outcomes result- ing from a switch of the reference product to an infliximab biosimilar. Studies were similar in that they were (mostly) multina tional studies and included adults of both sexes ( although one must be careful in assuming that the population distribution is similar) , but sample sizes varied considerably. Efficacy and safety outcomes were reported frequently , and most studies reported results for all relevant outcome domains. Information was also available for PROM and PK/PD outcomes. Notably, study re- sults, as per authors' conclusions, were consistent across studies and indicated that infliximab reference product and infliximab biosimi lars were similar in both infliximab -na\u00efve patients and switching patients with regard to efficacy, safety, PK/PD, immunogenicity, and PROM ( Table 9).

Scoping Report 51 8.1.3 Effectiveness and safety as well as PK/PD, PROMs, immunogenicity and treatment discontinuation outcomes in real -world settings 8.1.3.1 Evidence table for RWE studies Fourteen RWE stu dies w ere identified as relevant for this scoping report ( Table 10).117 132 -144 CoI and funding : Not all studies reported on CoI and study funding. Where such information was avail- able, most studies had at least one author who reported a CoI (7 studies) and had rece ived some kind of funding from the pharmaceutical industry (5 studies) . Countrie s, settings, perspectives : Real -world evidence studies were eligible only if conducted in certain countries (see 7.1.2 ). Of the incl uded studies, four were performed in Denmark and three in the Nether- lands, with the remai nder from Finland, France, Italy, Spain , and the UK . No study was identified for Switzerland. Most studies were set in hospitals and other medical facilities while thr ee studies used register data. Studies were split evenly between prospective and retrospective studies. Indications : One study was conducted in an RA -only population.136 The remaining studies included sev- eral and UC. Not all studies reported patient characteristics and outcomes separately by disease . For Table 10, we extracted data for individuals with RA if reported separately though we note that sample sizes i n general and RA -specific samples in particular were frequently small. Switch, arms : Almost all RWE studies assessed switching from the infliximab reference product to in- fliximab biosimilar (the reverse direction was not assessed systematically but merely reported as part of adverse events, i.e. if patients were switched back to the reference product after biosimilar failure ). Studies differed in how they assessed switch . Eight single -arm studies included patients who switched to infliximab biosimilar, with patients serving as their own control, i.e. comparisons were done versus baseline. Another study compared infliximab biosimilar with certolizumab pegol and abatacept, from which we considered only the infliximab arm relevant , thereby turning this study, f or our purposes, into a \"single -arm\" study.136 Two studies compared patients initiating treatment with or switching to infliximab biosimilar , in one case supplemented by an additional historic cohort of patients receiving the infliximab reference prepration.134 142 The remaining studies compared reference product with biosimilar, in both switching and infliximab -na\u00efve patients. Follow -up time, sample size, age , and sex : Follow -up periods range from 24 weeks to 2 years. Sample sizes, as mentioned above, were frequently small and included less than 50 individuals. However, there were al so six studies with 200 individuals or more.134-136 140 -142 With regard to age - and sex -related patient eligibility criteria (actual results on age and sex were not extracted at the scoping stage), about half of studies specified age to be \"adults\" . No study specified sex as part of its eligibility criteria. Scoping Report 52 Primary endpoint s, subgroup analyses : Not all studies specified an explicit primary study endpoint or outcome. Those that did specified therapy duration (measured by drug retention )133 138 140 142, effective- ness (in particular DAS -28)117 144, safety (adverse drug reactions)141, PK (serum drug concentrations), immunogenicity (ADAbs)134, and nocebo effect (measure d as unexplained unfavourable outcomes)132 outcomes as their primary outcomes. Few studies reported on subgroup analyses. Those that did con- ducted analyses by, among others, prior infliximab treatment and baseline disease activity status.

Scoping Report 8.1.3.2 Findings on effectiveness , safety, PK/PD, PROMs, immunogenicity and therapy duration out- comes from RWE studies Outcomes in all domains were reported by RWE studies ( Figure 4). Scoping Report 56 Figure 4 Outcomes from RWE studies Source: Own calculations. Abbreviations: ADAb, Joint Count. Effectiveness: DAS28 was the most frequently reported effectiveness measure (available based on CRP and ESR), with all eight studies reporting on effectivene ss providing DAS28 ( Table 11). Other effective- ness outcomes were less frequent and reported by at most two studies. Scoping Report 57 Immunogenicity : Data on ADAb or neutralising antibodies were reported by three studies. PK/PD : Five studies reporte d on acute phase reactants, three on minimum serum concentrations , and one study on serum drug concentrations in general. PROM s: Three studies reported on patient global assessment, with two of them also providing data on functional status. Pain, fatigue , and self -reported disease activity were reported by a single study.139 Safety : Safety data were reported relatively frequently, including any AE, serious AE , and in particular AE leading to discontinuation of treatment. Data on adverse drug reactions were reported by a pharma- covigilance -based study.141 Therapy duration : Data on drug retention or therapy discontinuation were the most f requently reported outcome and provided by all but three studies. Assessment of RWE study -based evidence : The RWE studies identified for assessments of infliximab biosimilars in patients with RA in the target countries were found to be heterogeneous in the ir design. In addition, a substantial proportion of studies relied on small sample sizes. Specific outcomes, with the exception of DAS28, were reported by only few studies each. In light of these issues and of methodo- logical challenges regarding synthesis of non -randomised studies145, a quanti tative synthesis of RWE results is unlikely to be feasible and worthwhile. However, we would suggest to synthesize RWE studies narratively in the respective outcome domains. Notably, authors' conclusions for these RWE studies generally suggested that infliximab reference prod- uct and biosimilar were comparable in clinical practice with regard to effectiveness and safety ( Table 11). However, some authors also reported that infliximab biosimilar was associated with worse PROM s and higher treatment discontinuation, which was frequently attribute d to nocebo effects. It is for the discussio n of nocebo effects that we see the main value of RWE studies in an HTA, in the form of a narrative synthesis in conjunction with data from RCTs and existing reviews.116 146 147 Scoping Report 58 Table 11 Outcomes by RWE study First author, year Switch Effectiveness Immunogenicity PK/PD Therapy dura- tion Safety TJC AE to discon- tinuation, Seri- ous AE Not reported No changes in drug trough levels or objective parame- ters were observed after the systematic switch to bio- similar inflixi mab in a real clinical practice setting.

Of t he reported ADRs, considered preventable. In adjusted anal- yses, infliximab biosimilars were shown to have an in- creased probability of being reported as suspected drugs in infusion reactions and a decreased probability of being reported as suspect ed drugs in cases of lack of efficacy or infection. Considering the potential ad- vantages offered by the utilization of biosimilars in clini- cal practice, we believe that the use of biosimilars, in- cluding those of infliximab, should be supported. In or- der to achieve this aim, increased knowledge on safety and efficacy of biosimilar drugs should be obtained from real world clinical practice.

Scoping Report 61 8.1.4 Costs , cost -effectiveness and budget i mpact outcomes 8.1.4.1 Evidence t able for health economic analyses Eleven health economic studies were identified as relevant for this scoping report ( Table 12).134 148 -157 CoI and funding : All eleven studies reported on CoI , with seven studies reporting at least one author with a Co I. Study funding was reported for ten studies , with six studies having received some kind of funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Countries : HE studies were eligible only if cond ucted in certain c ountries (see Section 7.1.2 ). Two stud- ies estimated the budget impact for five countries.153 154 Of included studies, four were performed for the UK and three for Italy and the US, with the remainder for Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Spain. No study was identified for Switzerland in the searches. Please note that a Swiss budget impact analysis for biosimilars has been recently published by Kobler et al.158 However, the report was published in March 2020 - after searches had been implemented - and so was not formally included in our search results for the scoping result (bu t will of course be considered in a full HA). Types of health economic studies : No full economic evaluation study or cost -minimization analysis was identified. Six studies were BIAs and four studies costing studies. Costing studies were mainly retro- spectiv e studies. One study reported on resource utilization without assign ing unit costs.159 Therefore, this study did not report an outcome in monetary units. Perspective : Four studies were conducted from a healthcare system perspective. Another four studies investigated a healthcare payer perspective while two studies also inves tigated a healthcare provider perspective. Three studies used a health insurance perspective, of which one also reported costs from a patient perspective (out -of-pocket costs). Time horizon : The time horizon of the HE analyses ranged from 0.25 up to 5 year s. Indications : Three studies were conducted in an RA -only population. The remaining studies included several inflammatory or rheumatic diseases, in particular AS, AxSpA, Morbus Crohn, IBD, PsA, psoria- sis, and UC. In these multi -disease studies, results we re generally not reported per single disease.

Figure 5 Outcomes from health economic studies Source: Own calculations. Abbreviations: DMC, Direct Medical Costs; DNMC, Direct Non -Medical Costs. Drug cost: Nine out of eleven studies investigated drug costs. The two remaining studies investigated healthcare service resource use without assigning unit costs159 and extra time spent by physicians as well as laboratory tests and other procedures required due to non -medical switching152 (Table 13). Total budget impact : Six studies reported total budget impact. However, this outcome was estimated differently between studies. Three studies assumed that the main relevant difference would be due to drug costs. Two studies also included differences due to drug administration and monitoring152 154 and one study also included direct non -medical costs based on transport expenses150. Resource use : Resource utilization was reported separately in three studies.151 152 159 Assessment of health economic evidence : The health economic studies identified for assessments of infliximab biosimilars in patients with RA in target countries were either BIA s or costing studies. No full Scoping Report 64 health economic evaluation was identified (they are more frequent ly used when comparing different substances or drug classes160-162). Although different cost perspectives were used , most studies ana- lysed drug cos ts, and authors' conclusions generally suggested substantial cost savings associated with increased use of biosimilars ( Table 13). While one study reported considerable short -term switching costs due to increased drug administratio n and monitoring152, another study found only marginal changes with no clinically relevant increase in resource use after sw itching159. Consequently, a BIA focusing on drug, administration, and monitoring costs in Switzerland could be considered, similar to or based on the analysis by Kobl er et al.158 Scoping Report 65 Table 13 Outcomes by health economic study First author, year Outcomes Authors' conclusion (in abstract/summary) Aladul et al. , 2019148 Drug cost, Total budget impact The introduction of new infliximab, etanercept and adal imumab biosimilars will be associated with considerable cost savings and have a substantial favourable impact on the UK NHS budget. The number of biosimilars and time of entry of [sic] is critical to creat e competition which will result in maximum cost sav ings. (p. 310) Aladul et al. , 2017149 Drug cost The introduction of bDMARDs biosimilars has resulted in considerable cost savings to the NHS, with the branded products reduc ing their prices in response to the availability of less expensive biosimilars and competition betwee n the biosimilars themselves. Our results also suggest that when a biosimilar is available for a directly comparable branded molecule, price is the key influencing factor i n the prescribing of a specific product. (p. 533) Beck et al. , 2017150 Drug cost, Total budget impact, Total DMC, Total DNMC The study showed a positive financial impact of introducing bi osimilar infliximab for the treatment of RA patients in France. Such savings could contribute to improved patient care by allowing more patients to be treated without more money being spent. (p. 85) Curtis et al. , 2019151 Drug cost, Resource use Despite frequent dose escalation with infliximab that often increase its dose by threefold or more, the savings from the curr ent price of its biosimilar substantially offsets the costs of an alternative infused TNFi [TNF -alpha inhibitor] biologic for which no (p. 1) Gibofsky et al. , 2018152 Admin cost, Monitoring cost, Re- source use, Total budget impact, Total DMC Originator -to-biosimilar NMS [non -medical switching] in stable patients with autoimmune conditions could result in considerable switching costs for both providers and payers. (p. 97) Glintborg et al. , 2018159 Resource use Changes were marginal with no clinically relevant increase in use of outpatient health care resources 6 months after comp ared with 6 months before mandatory switch from originator to biosimilar infliximab. (p. 1) Jha et al. , 2015153 Drug cost, Total budget impact The introduction of Remsima [infliximab biosimilar] could lead to consider able drug cost -related savings across the six licensed disease areas in the five European countries. (p. 743) Kanters et al. , 2017154 Admin cost, Drug cost, Monitor- ing cost, Total budget impact This study has shown that only when price reductions are large enough (i.e., 50% or more), physicians indicated that they wil l prescribe biosimilars. Policy makers should ensure substantial price reductions and stimulate physicians to use biosimilar products, to obtain savings in healthcare budgets. (p. 1) Lucioni et al. , 2015155 Drug cost, Total budget impact The results from the analysis show (in the base ca se) that the availability of the biosimilar would provi de overall annual savings over EUR 16 million to the NHS in 2019, while the cumulated savings in the five years period would be no less than EUR 47 million. The sensitivity analysis highlights that suc h favourable results would be even more substantial, to the extent that switching from originator to biosimilar could be safely recommended. (p. 78) Mansell et al. , 2019157 Drug cost The overall use of biosim ilar drugs in Canada is low. Policy makers, healthcare providers, and patients need to be informed of potential savings by increased use of biosimilars, particularly in an increasingly costly healthcare system.

Scoping Report 66 8.2 Evidence base pertaining to ethical, legal , social and organizational issues 8.2.1 PRISMA flow d iagram The search for evidence on ELSO outcomes yielded 599 hits from literature databases and 71 hits from other sources ( Figure 6).

Of the 667 unique hits, 552 were excluded during title -abstract -screening. Of the remaining 115 articles whose full -texts were screened, 32 were excluded, mostly because they did not discuss ELSO outcomes or because they were conference abstracts/posters (see Section 12.5.2 ). Eighty -three articl es were re- tained for the scoping report, including 73 studies discussing, reviewing , or reflecting on legal/regulatory issues, 7 discussing organizational issues , and 3 discussing ethical issues. 8.2.2 Evidence t able for studies reporting on ELSO outcomes Chara cteristics of the studies reporting on ELSO outcomes are shown in Appendix table 7. Scoping Report 67 CoI and funding : Not all studies reported on CoI and study funding or studies were publications by state agencies where CoI and study funding where not applicable. In 18 of the 39 studies for which CoI infor- mation was available and CoI applicable , at least one study author reported a CoI. The corresponding number for study funding by the pharmaceutical industry was 13 out of 25 studies. Study types : We grouped studies /reports into different types . Forty -one studies were reviews (usually of regulatory or legal procedures /frameworks) and 22 were guidance documents or position statements. The remainder were explanatory articles, articles reporting on rea l-world experience or policy plans , and general reflections (within the E LSO domains) on biosimilars. Countries : The US and Europe, on their own or in comparison, and multinational comparisons were by far the most frequently reported settings (55 articles/ reports). For individual countries in and beyond Europe (with the exception of the US), fewer studies/reports were identified. We would like to reiterate at this point that the aim of searching for and reviewing studies within the ELSO domains was not (and would not be for a full HTA) an exhaustive review of the literature. Instead, we used these searches to identify important sources for target countries and retrieve sufficient infor- mation on regulatory and reimbursement frameworks, ethical, legal , and soc ial issues. In addition to the information identified from the literature, we also relied on domain -specific knowledge to raise important ethical and legal issues for Switzerland that should be reviewed in depth in a full HTA. 8.2.3 Findings and suggested quest ions regarding ethical issues Findings on ethical issues from the literature search were sparse. In addition to a study discussing the usefulness of and need for animal studies in the context of biosimilar development163, we identified two studies discussing ethical implic ations of non -medical switching from reference product s to biosimi- lars.164 165 Both studies used as their premise the uncertainty around the safety of non -medical switches and argued that, despite evidence suggesting that biosimilars in general and switches in particular were safe and effective, this uncertainty would need to be balanc ed with patients', physicians' , and society' s interests. Specifically, both papers pointed out that society had a justified interest in the cost containment achievable with biosimilars while patients and ph ysicians had a justified interest in the freedom t o decide in the best interest of the specific patient, e.g. if on remission with a reference product . The authors suggested several approaches to help balance these interests, ranging from reducing prices for origi- nator biologic s (after patent expiry ) to the extent that biosimilar production was no longer profitable165 to a \"robust and thorough disclosure of relevant risks, benefits and reasonable alternatives\"164. In additi on to these literature findings, we formulated a range of questions that can be investigated in a full HTA. Scoping Report 68 According to the HTA Core Model, \"[e]thical analysis aims to provide a thorough understanding of norms and values that need to be taken into account during the HTA and in the decision -making process\"105. As we are convinced that no single method for ethical analysis is likely to be sufficient to fully address the moral questions of applying a health technology166, we will use the axiological approach in this scop- ing review. The axiological - or So cratic - approach is based on a series of questions and answers , with the intention to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out underlying presuppositions , and is considered a valid methodological option in HTA. The \"Hofmann catalogue\"108 109 with 33 questions designed to identify the characteristics of a health technology, the involved stakeholders , and the relevant moral questions is a widely -used implementa- tion of the axiological approach .167-169 We are aware that the catalogue of 33 morally relevant questions presented by Hofmann is \"not exhaustive [...] moral questions [...] have to be added, depending on the specific technology or its particular use\"109. Yet, we will address select ed ques tions from the catalogue at the scoping stage to raise awareness for the underlying ethical concerns pertinent to the substitution of the infliximab r eference product with its biosimilars for the treatment of patients with RA. We will not give answers in the sense of normative solutions. Please note that numbering of the questions outlined below follows that in Hofmann's paper109. Q1: What are the morally relevant consequences of the implementation of the technology? On the basis of current evidence, which, however, will have to be shown in a full HTA, we assume that there is equivalent effectiveness, safety, and quality for the infl iximab reference product and b iosimilars in patients with RA.100 Even for the reference product , it is obvious that no lot is 100% similar to the next one as they are produced by living organisms .79 80 170 Biosimilars may deviate from the reference product only as much as different lots would deviate from each other.78 In summary, treatment initiation with or switching to biosimilars per se are not deemed to pose a problem endangering or harming patients. Against this background we will confine the ethical analysis to questions of non -medical switching be- tween infliximab reference product and biosimilars for the treatment of patients with RA. Relevant moral questions are as to when, how, for which patients , at what point in time switching could be done and by what kind of communication this action should be accompanied. Q10: Can the use of the technology in any way challenge relevant law? This question is considered in Section 8.2.4 . Q12: Are there any related technologies that have turned out be morally chal lenging? We acknowledge that substitution with generics is not equivalent to substitution with biosimilars , but the former can be considered a technology with some comparable moral challenges. There is no specific literature on the ethical problems of swit ching from infliximab reference product to biosimilars (or vice Scoping Report 69 versa) in RA so one needs to explore the general ethical questions of biologics and biosimila rs in a first step and then analys e whether similar ethical questions and possible solutions occur in comparable questions, e.g. substitution with generics. Q14: How does the implementation of the technology affect the distribution of health care? As stated by Hofmann, \"[m]any technologies imply substantial costs, sometimes covered with resources from o ther areas \"109. If financia l resources can be saved by substituting reference product s, this may help the healthcare system free resources for other patients (also see Q33 below).82 Q15: How does the technology contribute to or challenge professional autonomy? The issue of professional autonomy is raised by some authors in the context of the sub stitution of bio- logics. One needs to scrutinize this argument: If the evidence strongly implies that biosimilars are neither less effective nor less safe than their reference product s, then professional autonomy should not be a question in the sense that p hysicians should per se have a choice of treatment. Their autonomy should be looked at in particular cases (also see Q1), e.g. in terms of timing a switch. In addition, adherence to guidelines is not discussed under the aspect of reduced autonomy. Therefor e, the question of professional autonomy needs to be reframed: The question of overall profes- sional autonomy does not pertain to switching per se on the assumption that effectiveness and safety of biosimilars are non -inferior to inflixima b but to, among ot hers, when to switch. Q16: Can the technology harm the patient? The available scientific evidence does not suggest, to the best of our knowledge, that switching from reference product to biosimilar will harm patients . Yet, the reference product could likew ise harm the patient. In the face of nocebo effects reported under switching from reference product to biosimilar , communication and the attitude of the prescribing physician are crucial in order to minimize harm to the patients: \"Patients may experience n ocebo effects (worsening or incitement of symptoms that are in- duced by a negative attitude toward an intervention) that are only perceptible to the patient and may impact on quality of life, treatment adherence, and the cost -saving potential of biosimilars .\"171 As pointed out by Kim et al. , \"patient understanding of biosimilars is crucial for treatment success and av oiding nocebo effects. Full understanding of biosimilars by physicians and carefully considered communication strategies can help support patients initiating or switching to biosimilars\"171. For this, the prescribers need objective patient communication material; it needs to be discussed by whom this material should be provided. From a moral perspective, switching per se is not the problem , but adequate framing of the decision and inclusion of patients in decision -making are essential. This also relates to the adequate understanding of professional autonomy in the face of current evidence ( also see Q15). Switching, ho wever, should Scoping Report 70 not be performed during particularly vulnerable times in patients' lives, e.g. when patients face difficult family situations, periods of transition (job, adolescence), suffer from bereavement, or during pregnancy and early motherhood. Q20: W hat are the interests of the producers of technology? There are economic interests for both producers of reference product s and of biosimilars. The problem is not specific to the question of this scoping review. Q33: What are the moral consequences of the scoping review ? Patients may no longer receive the infliximab reference product , a consequence that according to our understanding of the current evidence does not seem to be problematic . Nevertheless, patients may feel that they do not receive the \"best\" treatment. Experts, physicians, and the public should be sensi- tized that communication around switching is crucial for the success of switching to or starting therapy with infliximab biosimilar. Conclusion The ethical challenges delineated in this scoping review are, from our perspective, the key issues to be examined and discussed in detail in a full HTA, based on a literature search (also see Droste et al.167). 8.2.4 Findings and suggested questions regarding legal and regulatory issues A review of the literature on legal and regulatory issues concerning biosimilars for different countries is provided in Section 8.2.7 . Here , we discuss legal aspects and challenges of biosimilars specifically for the Swiss context . This discussion is designed to raise legal questions tha t could b e investigated in a full HTA. We developed a set of questions that we consider important in the context of biosimilars from a Swiss legal perspective. We followed the objectives laid out by the HTA Core Model\u00ae for the legal domain: \"The objective of the Legal Aspects (LEG) domain is to assist the HTA doers in detecting rules and regulations which need to be taken into consideration when evaluating the implications and conse- quences of implementing a health technology\"105. In this framework, \"the aim within LEG is not, and indeed cannot be, to give or even propose a binding legal solution to a given question. Instead, the aim is to guide the HTA doers in recognising the relevant legal questions they n eed to consider when eval- uating the technology and providing advice for decisionmakers\"105 Scoping Report 71 Here, we discu ss the legal aspects of interchangeabili ty of biologicals. We consider several questions to guide our discussion, based on a checklist desig ned for the Swiss legal system.107 Is there an explicit legal regulation of the interchangeability of biologics in Switzerland? No. Currently, neither the therapeutic products law nor health insurance law regulate explicitly the inter - changeability of biologics (Swiss Supreme Court [SSC] decision 2C_60/2018, 31. 5.19, consid. 4.2. 3; Swissmedic172). Regulation of substitution in Swiss health insurance law (Art. 52a Krankenversicher- ungsgesetz [KVG]) pertain s, at revision to this regula- tion is curren tly under review (31.5.19, consid 4.2.4), the de cision on interchanging drugs rests with treating physicians, who have to abide by their professional duties and due diligence. What is the legal perspective on interchangeability? The SSC recently decided that biologic reference product s and their biosimilars could not just be inter- FOPH stated flatly in 2013 that biosimilars could not be interchanged with the reference product (and with each other) due to concerns about patient safety and immunogenicity.175 To this day, administrative practice refers to this FOPH statement.172 Interchangeability is not par t of the regulatory approval of a biologic. Consequently, approval does not contain any statement regarding the interchangeability of the reference product with its biosimilar in an individual treated case (SSC decision 2C_60/2018, 31.5.19, consid. 4.2.3). Such a decision (i.e. about interchangeability in an individual case) re sts exclusively with the treating physician, according to Swiss- medic .176 When is interchangeability admissible from a legal perspective? 1. This question appears not to have a definitive legal answer. As discussed, according to current legal regulation, the decision about interchanging rests with treating phys icians who need to consider their professional duties and due diligence (especially Art. 3 and 26 HMG ; Art. 40 Medizinalberufegesetz; SSC decision 2C_60/2018, 31.5.19, consid. 4.2.4). 2. We first need to consider which legal benchmark needs to be applied t o healthcare professionals' professional duties and due diligence if scientific knowledge about risks for patient sa fety is at least partly absent. Scoping Report 72 From a legal point of view, the following question appears to be crucial: Does the thera peutic product law-based precautionary principle (Art. 3 and 26 HMG; also see Swiss Federal Appeal Committee177) require that even potential dang ers to patient safety which result from changes to patient medication need to be avoided as far as possible? a) If the answer to this question is \"ye s\", then therapeutic product law permits healthcare profes- sionals to change medication only if scientific evidence shows that such a change does not (or only in extremely rare cases) endanger patients due to different adverse event profiles (see Eichenberg er and Helmle178, margin no te 50). b) If the answer to this question is \"no\", then risks which are only conceivable or hypothetical are no reason not to change medication. One should refrain from medication changes only if there is sufficient probability, backed up by scientific eviden ce, that patient safety could be in danger. 3. We also need to consider the health insurance law. It currently does not include statements regarding interchangeability and substitution of biologic drugs but requires, among others, a general assessment of cost-effectiveness (Art. 52 Paragraph 1 in conjunction with Art. 32 Paragraph 1 and Art. 43 Paragraph 6 KVG). In the legal literature on health insurance law, it is men tioned that it is at least ques tionable whether the originator product should be prescrib ed to treat ment -na\u00efve patients without fur ther consid- eration or whether the use of a biosimilar or reductions in the price of originator products sh ould not be required (see Wildi173, Art. 52/52a KVG margin note 79). An explicit legal regulation is currently mi ssing. The legal literature takes the position that gaps in the law should be closed by taking into account the relative cost -effectiveness principle (see Wildi173 Art. 52/52a KVG margin note 79). 4. There is no definitive legal decision on how to proceed in case of a conflict between norms set by therapeutic product law ( see second bullet point in this section ) and health insurance law ( see third bullet point in this section ). The health insurance law currently specifies for generics (and therefore not directly applicable to b iosimilars) that an insured patient does not have to bear any incremental costs if the treating physician prescribes the reference product for medical reasons (Art. 38a Paragraph 6 Krank- enpflegeleistungsver ordnung). This makes a therapeu tic decision based on therapeutic product law fea- sible and helps avoid a conflict between therapeutic product and health insurance law. Lack of such an opening clause may lead to rat her difficult legal questions.179 Additional note: Responsibility for a decision about the precautionary principle rests primarily with legis- lators. The relationship between the therapeutic product law -based precautionary principle (the scope of which has not been definitively settled) and the health insurance law has, from a legal perspective, not been settled. Legislators will have to consider that in particular for modern technologies, with a high potential for adverse outcomes, the - legally recognized - demand for precautionary me asures by the state will grow.180 A possible approach might be to design legal regulation according to the potential for Scoping Report 73 risk or endangerment. There would be a need to investigate, for example, if due to a) an abstract poten- tial for risk and/or b) scientific evidence new prescripti ons and s witch need to be treated differ ently. How is interchangeability to be evaluated in the context of therapeutic freedom? Therapeutic freedom is based on, among others, the economic freedom specified in Art. 27 of the federal constitution, and it is a prerequisite for diligent and scrupulous professional practice (Art. 40 Medizinal- berufegesetz). Therapeutic freedom implies the physician's right to refuse performing a certain treat- ment or to choose one among several treatment options. This also applies to dispensing and prescribing drugs.181 Therapeutic fre edom does not hold absolutely but is restricted by the legal system (see Gig er et al.182, p. 11). Important direct and indirect bars are set by legal regulations on therap eutic products and health insurance. At present, these regulations do not regulate explicitl y the interchangeability of bio logics. Both decision and res ponsibility therefore rest with the treating physician. A potential risk to patient safety would exist, according to the current legal situation, in particular if an individual responsible for prescribing and dispensing medicinal products were to violate their due diligence and professional duties (SSC decision 2C_60/2018, 31.5.19, consid. 4.2.4). The more v ague the legal requirements for interchangeability, the greater the responsibility of healthcare professionals. For reasons of avoiding liability, this can lead to reluctance regarding the prescription and dispensing of biosimilars.179 183 A clarification can be provided by law and/or by professional guidelines. How is interchangeability to be evaluated in the context of patient rights? Different patient rights are relevant for the issue at hand, including: Patient autonomy: Patient autonomy is derived from the constitutionally guaranteed protection of personal rights and private autonomy. Patients' self -determination is s afeguarded in particular by the requirement for informed consent to a (pharmaceutical) therapy. If different courses of treatment exist, the patient must be informed about them.178 Equality before the law/discrimination: If a change in medication is associated with an in creased risk for patient safety (see above for relevant benchmarks), then particularly vulnerable groups such as chronically ill patients must not be disadvantaged. In addition, unequal treatment - directly or indirectly - of patients must be avoided, e.g. if patients need to choose between higher risks and higher costs due to reference price systems or deductibles that do not provide exceptions . What are additional legal considerations of interchangeability? Scoping Report 74 Additional legal questions that require investigation, e.g. regarding the reliability and limits of substance (international non -proprietary name) -based prescription178 and regarding the appropriate design of and pharmacovigilance (\"good pharmacological practice\").184 Moreover, misguided incen- tives and conflicts of interest when prescribing and dispensing drugs need to be considered, e.g. with regard to incentives to generate higher profit when prescribing originator products or to the additional administrative burden when prescribing biosimilars.158 8.2.5 Findings on social issues We identified no studies on social issues associated with biosimilars. 8.2.6 Findings on orga nisational issues Organisational issues relate to various policies on promoting and implementing biosimilars (and they are frequently closely related to regulatory issues). One type of studies identified in the literature mainly focus on barriers to biosim ilar uptake and reasons for low market penetration of biosimilars , which range from additional workload for implementing switch- ing to insufficient price advantages of biosimilars but also on policies designed to increase the uptake of biosimilars , which ra nge from impro ved prescriber education to prescription quotas .112 113 185 -190 An- other type of study focused more concretely on experiences (or plans) in countries and regions where large -scale switching to biosimilars occurred, e.g. in Denmark or British Columb ia.111 191 8.2.7 Regulatory principles and reimbursement of biosimilars in selected countries In this section, we present spotlight summaries of regulatory procedures for different countries, at the request of the FOPH. Specifically, we discuss regulatory and, for a subset of countri es, pricing and reimbursement procedures to provide an international perspective on biosimilar regulations and reim- bursement . 8.2.7.1 Regulatory/legal framework for biosimilars in selected countries Switzerland Key definitions : Biosimilars are defined by Swissme dic as \"biological medicinal product[s] having suf- ficient similarity with a reference product authorised by Swissmedic and which refers to its [the reference Scoping Report 75 product's documentation\" 192 Accordingly, a reference product is defined as a biological medicinal prod- uct drug which has been used in the approval documentation of a biosimilar as the \"reference for the comparability of its [the biosimilar's] pharmaceutical quality, ef ficacy and safety\"192 In addition, Swiss- medic defines a comparator product as the product with which the biosimilar was compared in a com- prehensive comparability exercise.193 Approval process : Approval of a bios imilar requires that the biosimilar is sufficiently similar to a refer- ence product in structure, pharmaceutical quality, biologic activity, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity to exclude relevant clinical differences with sufficient certainty.193 The evaluation of sufficient similarity is base d on a stepwise approach and the totality of evidence , i.e. the step -by-step evaluation of com- parative analytical, functional, non -clinical, and clinical studies until biosimilarity can (or cannot) be es- tablished.193 With regard to choice of the comparator product for the comprehensive comparab ility exercise, Swiss- medic requires a single comparator product to be used.193 The Swiss reference product is recom- mended . Products approved in the EU or the US are also accepted, but their use must be justified as appropriate relative to the Swiss reference product if one is available. Data re quirements : In addition to analytical, chemical and pharmaceutical evaluations and comparative analytical studies of the biosimilar relative to the comparator product, clinical similarity has to be demon- strated in at least one relevant and sensitive patien t population, in one indication and with one dose for which the reference product is authorised.193 For establishing clinical similarity, clinically meaningful differences have to be excluded with sufficient statistical probability for a sufficiently sensitive indication and dose. With regard t o the design of comprehensive comparative studies, Swissmedic guidance makes explicit reference to guidance from other agencies, e.g. from EMA. Biosimilars can be submitted under Art. 13 Heilmittelgesetz (HMG, Therapeutic Products Act). This sub- mission pat hway is open if either the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have already approved the biosimilar.172 193 Swissmedic will then not conduct an independent assessment unless EMA and FDA assessments were contradictory or ther e was cause for concern based on EMA/FDA approval.192 194 Extrapolation : In principle, a biosimilar can be approved in all i ndications of the reference product with- out document protection (\"Unterlagenschutz\"). Decisions about extrapolation to different indications and dosage are made on a case -by-case basis.193 Swissmedic requires that extrapolation be scientifically justified and any associated risk for patient saf ety be acceptable. Biosimilarity in at least one sensitive indication and dose recommendation must have been shown for sensitive clinical or PD endpoints. Scoping Report 76 Interchangeability and provisions for automatic substitution : Automatic substitution with a biosim- ilar (a pharmacist dispensing a biosimilar instead of the prescribed reference product without consulta- tion of the prescribing doctor) is not explicitly permitted in Switzerland.172 The Swissmedic approval process does not co mment on or establish whether a biosimilar is interchangeable (an interchangeable product is a biosimilar that may be substituted for the reference product without consultation of the prescriber195) and can be substituted for its reference product . European Union Key definitions : Biosimilars are defined as biologic medicinal products that contain a version of an active substance of an original biologic medicinal product which has been authorized in the European Economic Area (EEA). This original biologic product is referred to as the reference (medicinal) prod- uct.115 Approval process : The approval process is designed to establish similarity of the biosimilar to its ref- erence product with regard to quality, biologic activity, safety, and efficacy in a comprehensive compa- rability exercise, which is called the \"biosimilarity approach\".115 196 The biosimilarity approach is a step- wise approach, based on the totality of evidence.115 It starts with physicochemical and biological as- sessments and evaluates any differences between th e reference product and the proposed biosimilar at any stage. Differences must be explained and justified, and they inform subsequent development steps.115 197 The comparability exercise should be based on a single reference product, which, as per EMA guidance, must be authorised in the EEA.115 If required, certain clinical and in vivo studies may use a reference product not authorised in the EEA, provided the non -EEA product has been demonstrated in a bridging study to be representative of the EEA reference product. Data requir ements : Data requirements can be derived from the steps of the biosimilarity approach. The first step are in vitro analytical and functional studies.197-199 Based on first -step results, the need and suitable endpoints (PK, PD, safety) for in vivo and toxicity studies are assessed in the second ste p. The third step are clinical studies, which themselves are conducted step -by-step: First PK (and PD) studies, then (equivalence) trials on clinical efficacy and safety or confirmatory PK/PD studies.198 This is, how- ever, not a one -size-fits-all approach as the \"nature and complexity of the reference product have an impact on the extent of the (non)clinical studies to confirm biosimilarity\".198 Clinical trials may not be required or may be waived for some products, e.g. insulins and (peg -)filgrastim.114 (For more details on EMA data requirements, also see the recent reviews by Rathore et al.200 and Rahalkar et al.201). Scoping Report 77 Extrapolation : \"Extrapolat ion\" is used to describe data for one indication, together with information on general comparability, being used to extrapolate efficacy and safety to the other indications of the refer- ence product. Extrapolation is an established scientific and regulatory concept and not specific to bio- similars.80 If scientifically justified based on the totality of evidence from the comparative comparability exercis e, then clinical efficacy and safety data may be extrapolated from the reference drug to the biosimilar according to EMA guidance.198 199 Additional data may have to be provided, e.g. if evidence on compa- rability is based on PD endpoints for the studied indication, but a different mode of action is relevant for the claimed indication. Interchangeability and provisions for automatic substitution : The EMA states that there is \"no rea- son to believe that harmful immunogenicity should be expected\"202 following a switch between highly similar biologics but does not decide on interchangeability and automatic substitution . These decisions remain with member states.203 United States Key definitions : Biosimilars are defined as biologic products which are \"highly similar to the reference product notwithstandin g minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and for which there are no \"clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency of the product\" (Section 351(i)(2) of the Public Health Service Act).195 204 The reference product is defined as the FDA -approved biologic against which a biosimilar is compared.195 Approval process : The aim of the approval process is to establish biosimilarity between the proposed biosimilar and the reference product. In particular, the two parts of the biosimilar definition must be confirmed as true: The biosimilar must be shown to be \"highly simil ar\" (mostly in in vitro studies) and to have no \"clinically meaningful differences\" (in PK, PD, immunogenicity and clinical studies). As in the EMA biosimilarity approach, the FDA approach considers the totality of evidence and does so in a stepwise fashio n.195 205 Comparative structural and functional characterisations should be conducted first, followed by toxicity studies, then by comparative PK and PD as well as immunogenicity studies. Additional clinical data may be required if residual uncertainty about biosimilarity remains after these steps.195 205 The comparability exercise should be based on an FDA -approved reference product, in particular for analytical studies and at least one PK study (and on e PD study, if applicable). However, as in the EMA's approach, a comparator from another setting can be used if bridging studies have demonstrated its comparability with the US -approved product and if the use of a non -US product is scientifically justi- fied.205 Scoping Report 78 The US approach is unique in that it explicitly regulates interchangeability. For a product to be desig- nated as interchangeable, it must be shown that the biosimilar \"produce[s] the same clinical result as the reference product in any g iven patient\" and that, if the biosimilar would be administered more than once to an individual, \"the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching be- tween the use of the biological product and the reference product is not grea ter than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch\"206. Data requirements : Data requirements can be derived from the approval proc ess. Establishing biosim- ilarity requires structural analyses and functional assays, possibly toxicity results from animal data, phar- macologic data, immunogenicity assessments and comparative clinical studies (using equivalence de- signs).205 207 However, data requirements are reviewed and adapted on a case -by-case basis. Extrapolation : Extrapolation to additional indications is permissible if scientifically justified.205 Justifica- tions should be framed within the totality of evidence and should cover, among others, modes of action, PK and possibly PD measures and immunogenicity. Extrapolation is permissible only to indications also covered by the reference product. Interchangeability and provision s for automatic substitution : Automatic substitution is possible for interchangeable products (at the time of writing, no product had yet been designated as interchangea- ble).195 For information on other countries, please see Section 12.7. 8.2.7.2 Biosimilar pricing and reimbursement in selected countries Switzerland Inclusion in the SL requires a drug to be efficient (\"wirtschaftlich\"), in addition to being effective (\"wirksam\") and appropriate (\"zweckm\u00e4ssig\"). In Switzerland, biosimilars are considered as efficient if, at the time of inclusion in the SL, their ex -factory price is at least 25% lo wer than that of the reference product.2 Every three years, the FOPH verifies that drugs still meet these criteria. Biosimilars are considered to meet the efficiency criteria if their ex -factory prices are at least 10% lower than average ex -factory prices of their reference pro ducts, on December 1 of the year in which verification is conducted.2 Inclusion in the SL implies reimbursement by mandatory healthcare insurance. Some drugs included in the SL are subject to further restrictions. In the case of infliximab (both reference product and biosimi- lars), prior approval from the healthcare insurance's medical officer is required.91 Austria Scoping Report 79 Inclusion in the Austrian Erstattungskodex (EKO; reimbursement index) requires drugs to pass a health economic evaluation.208 For biosimilars, health economic criteria were changed in 2017 (and will in re- main in force until the end o f 2021). These criteria specify that when a biosimilar becomes available:209 The price of the reference product must be reduced by 30% for the reference product to remain included in the EKO The price of the first biosimilar must be 11.4% lower than the newly reduced price of the refer- ence product for the biosimilar to be included in the EKO Subsequent biosimilars are included in the EKO if the price of the second biosimilar is 15% lower than the price of the first biosimilar and the price of the third biosimilar is 10% lower than the price of the s econd biosimilar. If a third price reduction occurs, prices of the reference prod- uct and of the first and second biosimilar must be reduced to the price of third biosimilar for the reference product and earlier biosimilars to remain included in the EKO For certain indications, different arrangements can be made to promote biosimilar availability The 2020 EKO includes four infliximab biosimilars, all classified within the \"yellow box\" that requires approval by a healthcare insurance medical officer.210 The reference product (Remicade\u00ae) was excluded from the EKO in June 2018.211 France Drug prices in France are set based on the drugs' improvement to medical benefit. Biosimilars are by default assessed to bring \"no improvement\" (ASMR V) so their price must be lower than that of the reference product.185 The expressed (long -term) aim of the government is the removal of the price ad- vantage of the reference product and the convergence of reference product and biosimilar p rices.212 Initial pric es of biosimilars tend to be around 15 -20% lower than those of their reference products, and current pricing policies agreed between state and pharmaceutical industry include initial discount rates for reference product and biosimilars of 30% in hospitals a nd 20% to 40% in outpatient settings.185 212 In addition, \"discount calendars\" are specified to achieve price convergence in both hospitals and outpa- tient settings. Germa ny In Germany, drugs with no additional benefit relative to their comparator are grouped in the same refer- ence price group (\"Festbetragsgruppe\") as the comparator. The reference price group determines the maximal price reimbursed by mandatory healthcare in surance for a drug from this group. Infliximab biosimilars have so far been grouped in a substance -specific reference price group as \"Infliximab/Level 1\" (where \"Level 1\" indicates that the included drugs share the same active ingredient).213 Currently, the Federal Joint Committee are in the process of setting up a \"TNF -alpha inhibitor/Level 2\" reference price Scoping Report include adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol based on their pharmacological and therapeutic comparability (which defines a Level 2 reference price group).214 Mandatory healthcare insurance will reimburse up to the maximum price specified by the reference price group. Netherlands In the Netherlands, biosimilars are not subject to specific price setting with regard to public list prices, but, like for reference products, maximum wholesale prices are determi ned via external reference pric- ing.215 However, as determined in a study on TNF -alpha inhibitors by the Dutch Competition Agency, there is little competition based on list prices, which was attributed to an interest in keeping list prices high for external reference pricing in other countries and to retain the ability to offer substantial, fre- quently conditional, rebates to hospital buying groups.187 There is, however, competition when it comes to rebates. These rebates also apply to TNF -alpha inhib- itors, which, in the Netherlands, are intramural drugs, i.e. prescribe d in and (initially) paid for by hospitals even if administered at home. Rebates can be substantial, with a particularly high -profile case discussed in the Dutch press, where the manufacturer of the reference product offered a 89% conditional discount on its product after the introduction of biosimilars to the market.216 Hospitals are reimbursed for drug expenses by healthcare insurers on the basis of the official reference price. While s ome healthcare insurers reimburse a per -active ingredient reference price, others reim- burse a per -cluster (of comparable medicines) reference price, thereby setting different incentives for hospitals.187 Norway Norway has one of the highest biosimilar use rates globally.217 218 Its national medicines agency takes an explicitly pro -switch stance, stating t hat switching from reference product to biosimilar, vice versa and from biosimilar to biosimilar was safe, that further switching studies were unnecessary, and that switching is a necessary tool to achieve drug competition.219 Indeed, the Nor wegian state financed the largest switching study to date (NOR -SWITCH).7 With regard to pricing and reimbursement of biosimilars for TNF -alpha -inhibitors and infliximab, the main focus is on national tenders. Prices are negotiated by the Norwegian Drug Procurement Cooperation on behalf of state -funded hospita ls that pay for treatment in the hospital and outpatient settings and for hospital prescriptions.217 Prices are set in tenders (which, for infliximab, have included biosimilars since 2014) that rank products on two -year costs based on information submitted by manufacturers and rec- ommendation s are issued on which drug to prescribe though all available products are reimbursed.217 220 Scoping Report 81 Scoping Report 82 9 Feasibility of an HTA We assess ed the feasibility o f an HTA by availability of evidence by HTA key question /outcome and PICO (Section 6).

Note: We don't mean to imply by \"can be answered\" that a question can be fully and definitively answered (which is rare in sc i- ence). Instead, we understand this to mean that an answer can be given based on the currently available evidence. 9.1 Specific questions based on central research questions (Clinical) Efficacy : Sufficient evidence was identified to inform an answer on efficacy of infliximab bio- similars, both i n infliximab -na\u00efve patients (PICO 1) and patients switched from the infliximab reference product (PICO 2). Evidence was available on efficacy measures of immediate clinical relevance (e.g. DAS28 and CDAI) and on efficacy measures more relevant for clinical trials (such as AC R20, ACR50, and ACR70). There was insufficient evidence to inform an answer on efficacy for patients switching from the biosimilar to the reference product . Effectiveness : Sufficient evidence was identified to inform an answer on effecti veness of infliximab bio- similars, both in infliximab -na\u00efve patients (PICO 1) and patients switched from the infliximab reference product (PICO 2). Notably, the studies identified for RA and infliximab for this scoping review were het- erogeneous in their des ign and frequently small. There was insufficient evidence to inform an answer on effectiveness for patients switching from the biosimilar to the reference product . Safety : Sufficient evidence was identif ied to inform an answer on safety of infliximab biosi milars, both in infliximab -na\u00efve patients (PICO 1) and patients switched from the infliximab reference product (PICO 2). Evidence on safety wa s available from RCTs and from RWE studies. Scoping Report 83 Health economics : No health economic evidence was identified that woul d allow to answer health eco- nomic questions, on either cost -effectiveness or budget impact of the infliximab reference product rela- tive to infliximab biosimilar in the treatment of RA, for Switzerland directly . However, sufficient ev idence was available to inform modelling for Switzerland. More precisely, a BIA could be conducted for all three PICOs, which would account for different populations and include different scenarios depending on PICO. A CEA could be conducted for PICO 1 and PICO 2 (as clinical da ta to inform CEA modelling are available fo r these PICOs). T he absence of evidence precluded a CEA for PICO 3. ELSO issues : With the exception of social issues (for which no evidence was identified), sufficient e vi- dence was identified to inform answers to questions in these domains. Answers, w hich cannot be defin- itive but can help explore important issues, could be provided for PICO 1 and PICO 2. For PICO 3, there was insufficient evidence available. 9.2 Additional outcomes of interest and additional questions PK/PD/Immunogenicity : Sufficient evidence was identified to inform an answer on PK, PD, and immu- nogenic profiles , both in infliximab -na\u00efve patients (PICO 1) and patients switched from the infliximab reference product (PICO 2). Evidence on these profiles was available predominantly from RCTs alt- hough RWE studies also provide d information on these issues. For PICO 3, evidence was insufficient . PROMs : Sufficient evidence was identified to inform an answer on PROMs associated with infliximab biosimilars, both in infliximab -na\u00efve patients (PICO 1) and patients switched from the infliximab refer- ence product (PICO 2). Evidence on PROMs wa s available predominantly from RCTs although RWE studies also provide some information on these issues. Key PROMs reported inclu de functional status, patient global assessment, and HRQoL. For PICO 3, there was insufficient evidence available. Therapy discontinuation : Sufficient evidence was available to inform an answer on treatment discontin- uation associated with infliximab biosim ilars, both in infliximab -na\u00efve patients (PICO 1) and patients switched from the infliximab reference product (PICO 2). Notably, evidence on treatment discon tinuation was available from both RCTs and RWE studies. Both types of studies explore d reasons for discontin- uation, e.g. AEs. However, RWE studies also explore d non-medical reasons for discontinuation , which could help assess the role of nocebo effects. Regulation and reimbursement : Different regulation and reimbursement procedu res could be reviewed and summarised . Scoping Report 84 9.3 Suggested c hanges to PICO In light of the absence of evidence on PICO 3, it may be worth removing PICO 3 for a full HTA. Given the currently relatively low uptake of infliximab biosimilars in Switzerland, this PICO may also be of little relev ance to clinical and regulatory practice. Scoping Report 85 10 Outlook After commenting on the feasibility of a full HTA in the previous section (Section 9), we discuss ap- proaches to synthesise evidence on efficacy and effectiveness and to obtain Sw iss-specific health eco- nomic assessments. 10.1 Synthesising evidence on clinical efficacy and safety Existing reviews of efficacy and safety : For synthesising efficacy and effectiveness evidence, w e base our discussion, in part, on existing systematic reviews o f biosimilars in general and infliximab in particular (Appendix table 8 and Appendix table 9). Note that, at the request of the FOPH, we focussed our litera- ture searches on primary studies. However, to cross -check our search results and assess our findings in context, we conducted a n on-systematic search for existing reviews of biosimilars for infliximab (and TNF-alpha inhibitors more broadly) that included RA. We do not claim that this searc h was exhaustive, but we are confident to have identified relevant reviews that can help provide context for th is section. Existing reviews have shown that the evidence on ef ficacy and safety of biosimilars , including those of infliximab, in RA for treatme nt-na\u00efve and switched patients consistently indicated similar efficacy, safe ty, and immunogenicity between reference product s and biosimilar s although evidence gaps remain with regard to switching (Appendix table 8). Some existing reviews of biosimilars of TNF -alpha inhibitors in general and infliximab in particular also performed meta -analyses on comparative efficacy and safety.221-223 These reviews used ACR response criteria as their main efficacy outcome and (serious) AEs as their main safety outcome. Agai n, their results consistently showed similar efficacy and safety between reference produ cts and biosimilars . Existing reviews have considered most RCTs of biosimilars to be of good to very good quality and to have been reported according to guidelines.131 223 -225 This also applied to RCTs of infliximab biosimilars, which were included in both existing reviews and this scoping report ( Appendix table 9). Trial populations and designs were similar across RCTs , and all but one RCT were conducted in samples of more than 100 patients ( Table 8). These findings indicate that a quantitative syn thesis of RCT results would likely be feasible and based on solid evidence . However, it would need to be kept in mind that any synthesis would be conducted separately for each PICO and outcome domain , which would reduce the number of trials and patients av ailable for PICO 2 in particular (as studies on the initial, non -switch phases of many RCTs would not inform the synthesis for this PICO). As pointed out by Numan and Faccin130 and F eagan et al.131, few of the RCTs that inves- tigated switching to infliximab biosimilar were powered to detect post -switch efficacy differences, and Scoping Report 86 some did not have a control group but w ere continued as single -arm extension studies of initial RCTs . In addition, there are, to date, no studies investigating multiple switching for infliximab. Outlook for a full HTA : We wo uld suggest to conduct a de novo synthesis of RCTs in a full HTA. This would allow to obtain a synthesis that is tailored to inform the decision problem at hand using inclu- sion/exclusion criteria approved by the FOPH and that incorporates the most recent e vidence, including recent studies that were not available to existing systematic reviews ( Appendix table 9). Based on the results of this scoping report and on existing reviews, we would suggest to perform : Quantita tive synthesis , i.e. a meta -analysis, separately for clinical efficacy, safety, immunogen- icity, and PROM results, which were frequently reported by RCTs . We anticipate that meta - analyses can be conducted for both PICO 1 and PICO 2 but that the synthesis fo r PICO 2 will likely be limited in the strength of its conclusions due to the aforementioned caveats. Endpoints would be chosen in discussion with the FOPH and reviewers , and they would likely include ACR criteria for ef ficacy, AE rates for safety, ADAb ra tes for immunogenicity, and functional status for PROMs. Depending on the number and timing of endpoints to be considered, standard meta -analysis may be insufficient and more advanced methods may be required, e.g. multivariate meta -anal- ysis to account for correlation of outcomes among each other and over time , subject to data availability .226-230 Synthesis without meta -analysis for PK/PD outcomes, which were less frequently report ed, and for those efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and PROM outcomes that were not included in the respective meta -analysis.231 This type of synthesis was used frequently in existing reviews of biosimilars.131 232 233 10.2 Synthesising evidence on real -world effectiveness and safety Existing reviews of effectiveness and safety: Most of the existing reviews of biosimilar included RWE studies , either exclusively or in addition to RCTs (Appendix table 8 and Appendix table 9).100 147 232 -234 Few of these reviews formally assessed the quality of RWE studies. Where such an assessment was performed, the primary studies were considered to be of fair quality although a 2018 review stated t hat none of its included RWE studies (many of which we identified for the scoping report, see Appendix table 9) met the requirements for a robust switching study .130 235 The RWE studies identified fo r the scoping report differed substantially in their study designs and were frequently based on small sample sizes , with only few studies reporting on any one outcome . Still, RWE studies remain an indispensable source of information , for therapy discontinu ation and nocebo effects in particular. Notably, as pointed Scoping Report 87 out by Kilcher et al. (2018) differences in patient populations between RCTs and observational studies may imply that efficacy estimates generated in RCTs differ from effectiveness estimates gener ated in RWE studies.236 This provides another rationale for considering RWE in the HTA. Outlook for a full HTA : We would suggest to synthesise real-world evidence, including evidence on effectiveness, safety, immunogenicity, PROMs, and treat ment discontinuation (including nocebo ef- fects), narratively but without a meta -analysis, e.g. a format similar to Bakalos and Zintzaras235 and Odinet et al.147. This would be in line with the existing literature and would allow us to explore outcomes in detail. 10.3 Generating health economic evidence Health economic evaluations for biosimilars, which we identified for the scoping report, were BIAs, in addition to costing studies ( Table 12). The use of BIAs and of cost -minimisation analys is is generally considered to be appropriate to inform biosimilar reimbursement if a reference product is available as standard of care (as would be the case with infliximab in Switzerland).237-239 In contrast, a full economic evaluation might be required only if no reference product is reimbursed and if there are concerns about nocebo effects and differences in therapy discontinuation .239 There is, however, little guidance available on which type of full economic evaluation would be requ ired in such a case and how, for example, to account for clinically irrelevant differences between reference product s and bios imilars in long -term modelling. In line with the evidence base identified for the scoping report and the literature, we would sugg est to focus on budget impact and possibly cost -minimisation analysis in a full HTA. Recent work for Switzer- land by Kobler et al.158 could possibly be adapted or extend ed. Key data requirements for any BIA would include epidemiologic, resource use, and market share data, including precise data on the number of individuals treated with infliximab for RA, which might prove challenging to calculate even with access to high -quality Swiss data sources such as health insurance claims data or the Swiss Clinical Quality Management Register . Based on available evidence, w e do not think that a full economic evaluation will be required or an efficient use of resources. However, if a need for a full economic evaluation were to be perceived, ex- isting models for assessment of treatment sequences in RA could be used. Examples include Markov cohort models but also individual patient simulation model s.160 161 240 Of particular interest, in our view, might be the open -source IVI -RA model, an individua l patient simulation model that could be adapted from the US to the Swiss setting.241 242 Still, we do not currently anticipate a need for a full economic evaluation. Scoping Report 88 In a full HTA, all literature searches conducted for the scoping review would be re-run and updated . In addition, the liter ature woul d be assessed for quality and overall certainty , with standard tools for as- sessment of bias and for rating certainty of evidence.243-246 Scoping Report 89 11 References 1 Schneider R, Schur N, Reinau D, et al.

Scoping Report 124 12.7 Regulatory/legal framework for biosimilars in different countries: additional coun- tries i. Australia Key definitions : Biosimilars are defined as versions of an already re gistered biological medicine (the reference product ).301 Approval process : The aim of the approval process is to establish the biosimilarity of the biosimilar relative to the reference product . The refere nce product must have been pre viously registered in Aus- tralia and must have been on the Australian market \"for a substantial period\"301, which is determined individually for each case. When a reference product not licensed in Australia is used, it must have been approved by a regulatory agency with similar standards as the Australian body (the EMA and FDA are listed explicitly) and a bridging study must have demonstrated that the medication is indeed relev ant for the Australian reference product . Data requirements : Australian data requirements are explicitly based on European guidelines on qual- ity, comparability, clinical and non -clinical data and product -specific guidelines. Extrapolation : Extrapolation is regulated as by the EMA.198 Interchangeability and p rovisions for automatic substitution : Automatic substitution is permitted for \"a-flagged\" drugs . A-flagged drugs include biosimilar s of TNF -alpha inhibitors.308 ii. Austria Approval : Approval as part of the EMA's centralised procedure. Interchangeability and provisions for automatic sub stitution: Automatic substitution is not permit- ted. iii. Canada Key definitions : Biosimilars are defined by Health Canada as a \"biologic drug that obtains market au- thorization subsequent to a version previously authorized in Canada, and with demonstrated simil arity to a reference biologic drug\"278. The reference product is defined as \"a biologic drug authorized on the basis of a complete quality, non -clinical, and clinical data package, to which a biosimilar is compared to demonstrate similarity\"278. Approval process : The approval process is designed to establish biosimilarity between the reference product and the biosimilar.278 The assessment is based on the totality of structural, functional, non - clinical and clinical evidence. Scoping Report 125 The reference product must be approved in Canada. Non -Canadian drugs are eligible provided th ey have been demonstrated to be suitable for the submission. Data requirements : Establishing the similarity in terms of quality attributes is the first step and involves the physicochemical and biological characterization as well as assessments of biologic al activity, immu- nochemical properties, purity, specifications and stability.278 If similarity has been de monstrated for qual- ity attributes, non -clinical in vitro (and possibly in vivo ) studies are conducted. Specialized toxicological studies are not generally required. Clinical studies on PK and PD characteristics should be conducted, as should be efficacy tr ials. These studies should also assess safety and immunogenicity. Extrapolation : Extrapolation to indications of the reference product is possible if scientifically justified. Interchangeability and provisions for automatic substitution : Decisions on autom atic substitution rests with provinces which are the public payers.309 The province of British Columbia, for example, has switched all patients treated with certain biologics (including infliximab) for certain indications (including RA) to the respective biosimilar by November 2019 as part of its B iosimilars Initiative.111 25 4 By March 2020, all patients treated with the infliximab reference product for gastrointestinal indications were to be switched to an infliximab biosimilar. After the end of the trans ition phase, the province's drug benefit plan cut all funding to reference product s and only covered biosimilars for infliximab (as well as etaner- cept and insulin glargine) for the included indications. iv. France Approval : Approval as part of the EMA's centra lised procedure. Interchangeability and provisions for automatic substitution: Automatic substitution is not generally permitted. There is a legal framework in place to allow automatic substitution for patients with specific conditions who initiate treatme nt if the treating physician does not explicitly forbid substitution.185 282 Drugs can substituted only within the same group. However, as of the time of writing, this framework is yet to be put into practice. v. Germany Approval : Approval as part of the EMA's centralised procedure. Interchangeability and provisions for automatic substitution: Automatic substitution is currently not generally permitted. However, current law (\u00a7129 Paragraph 2 Sozialgesetzb uch V) specifies that, under certain conditions (e.g. drug prescribed only by substance name), pharmacies must choose among available drugs with the same substance, dosage, pack size, same or exchangeable galenic form, and same indications (under considera tion of the Narcotics Law).186 310 The list of biologic drugs to which Scoping Report 126 these regulations apply have included the infliximab biosimilars Remsima\u00ae and Inflectra\u00ae since June 2015.311 The Fed eral Joint Committee has been tasked, in 2019, to develop guidance on automatic substitution by August 2022, in addition to developing guidance on physician -led substitution by August 2020.186 2 75 vi.

No significant difference between biosimilar - and originator -in- fliximab was found in terms of efficacy and safety.

(p. 53) Bakalos and Zintzaras, 2019235 Collate inf ormation from switching biosimilar mAbs and in- vestigate the subjectivity of rea- sons for discontinuation to deter- mine the impact of potential nocebo responses Yes Narrative: Biosimilar discontinua- tion rates of biosimilar mAbs may in- crease due to subjective effects after switching from an originator [reference product] mAb. These findings highlight the need for further pa- tient education and well -designed, observational switching studies as well as the collection and analysis of identifiable pharmacovigilance and postmarketing data of biologics, including bio- similars. The colle ction of real -world results is particularly pertinent for mAbs other than CT - P13, for which there is currently a lack of obser- vational switching data.

Sufficiently powered and appropri- ately statistically analysed clinical trials and pharmacovigilance studies, with long -term fol- low-ups and multiple switches, are needed to support decision -making around biosimilar switch ing.
