Taoist yoga also combines Indian and Chinese traditions and is generally considered to be a hybrid of the two systems. It is said to be appropriate for all people, regardless of their fitness, age or body type. During class I guide you through a gentle flow of moving and static postures, incorporating the controlled inhalation and exhalation of the breath to circulate and build chi without over stretching the muscles and tendons. This is a deeply healing practice which will develop strength and flexibility in the mind, body, and spirit. ***I'm currently offering this class as a modified gentle class absent of floor yin yoga postures and replacing them with a time of stillness and quiet meditation for the yin portion, this can be done sitting on the floor or laying down. If you need a chair for the sitting portion please let me know before class *** Join us for Morning Tao ~ Tending Our Garden -see upcoming events for class dates. Private classes can also be scheduled. I also offer a self care class for Licensed Massage Therapists for CEUs. I received my Taoist Yoga Teacher Training Certification in 2013 from Heng-Ni (Todd Grube) former owner of DownDog "}
