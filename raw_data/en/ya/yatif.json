Moxibustion stimulates circulation, counteracts cold and dampness in the body, and promotes the smooth flow of blood and qi. This safe, non-invasive technique may be used alone, but it is generally used in conjunction with acupuncture treatment. Tui Na Tui na means \"pushing grasping,\" and is a powerful form of Chinese medical bodywork. Based on the same Oriental medical principles as acupuncture, tui na seeks to improve the flow of qi through the meridian channels. Tui na is particularly effective for conditions involving muscles, tendons and joints, such as structural misalignment, orthopedic problems and sports injuries. It can also be used to treat internal diseases. Cupping Cupping is an ancient technique, used in many cultures, in which a special cup is applied to the skin and held in place by suction. The suction draws superficial tissue into the cup, which may either be left in place or moved along the body. Cupping brings fresh blood to the area and helps improve circulation. Traditional cupping, sometimes referred to as \"fire cupping,\" uses heat to create a vacuum-like suction inside of glass cups. In modern times, cups that use a small pump to create suction have also been introduced. Lifestyle Change Consultation Lifestyle change consultation includes Natural Wellness screening, progress tracking, dietary guidelines, recipes, meditation,and exercise consultations.

Allergy Elimination Technique (AET) With increasing stressful life style, poor diet and environmental pollutions and toxins, there are more and more people developing multiple allergies to pollens, dust, molds, food sensitivities, and chemical sensitivities. Allergies can be successfully treated by acupuncture, acupressure, herbal supplements and Allergy Elimination Technique (AET). AET is a specialize treatment modality in Complimentary Alternative Medicine. AET utilizes Applied Kinisiology (AK) and manual muscle testing (MMT) technique to diagnose allergies by comparing the strength of a muscle in the presence and absence of a suspected allergen. The theory of AET is based on when the body is exposed to allergens, the energy flow of the body is disturbed and blocked; therefore, causing dis-ease and allergic reactions. Allergies can be treated by addressing the energy blockages through the use of acupuncture or tapping on a set of acupressure points, and/or herbal supplements. Qigong Qigong (Chi-gong) means \"life energy cultivation\". With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, Qigong is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance Qi (chi) or what has been translated as \"life force energy\". It is traditionally seen as a safe and gentle meditative exercise that cultivate and balance Qi and promotes healing of the mind and body. It is a practice of aligning mind, body and spirit by focusing on deep breathing with diaphragm, meditation, and exercises. It allows us to access to higher realms of awareness, awakens one's \"true nature\", and helps develop human potential. Medical Qigong is used as treatment to promote, preserve and restore health. Most people acquainted with Qigong use deep breathing, meditation and exercises. These deep breathing, meditation and exercises may be recommended by a practitioner in combination with other treatment modalities. The full benefits of Qigong exercises can be achieved when using correct posture, deep breathing with diaphragm and intention in a regular daily practice. Qigong can also be used as energetic point stimulation (a special non-insertion needle called Shi Zhen is used) or energetic pattern adjustment as treatment. The treatment may appear to be subtle but can be quite powerful and profound. Qigong is often used to help reduce blood pressure, stress and anxiety; promote a restful sleep and well-being. It is often found to be very calming, relaxing and rejuvenating. Qigong is now practiced throughout China and worldwide for: recreation, exercise and relaxation; preventive medicine and self-healing; complementary and alternative medicine; meditation and self-cultivation; and training for martial arts. Emotional Freedom Technique (AKA- Tapping Solution) The goal of EFT (Tapping Solution) is to alleviate the feelings and effects of negative emotions. This is done by tapping on several acupuncture points while focusing on the emotion or issue around the emotion. During a typical EFT session, the patient is to focus on a specific issue while tapping on \"end points of the body's energy meridians\". According to the EFT handbook, by Gary Craig, published in the late 1990s, the procedure consists of the patient rating the emotional intensity of their reaction on a Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) (a Likert scale for subjective measures of distress, calibrated 0-10) then repeating an orienting affirmation while rubbing or tapping specific acupuncture points on the body. Eye movements, humming a melody and counting in numeric order are also employed during the tapping process. The emotional intensity is then re-scored and repeated until no changes are noted in the emotional intensity. EFT/Tapping Solution has been demonstrated to be effective in eliminating allergies and dis-eases caused by stress and various emotional issues, leading to energetic blockage. It is especially effective in treating phobia and post traumatic stress disorder (PSTD).
