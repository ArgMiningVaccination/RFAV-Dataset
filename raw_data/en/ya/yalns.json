Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. In prior projects, YCCO has built an understanding of existing housing -related resources, formed a housing -specific workgroup of community partners, identified key housing initiatives to invest in, and identified best practice for collecting housing data on YCCO . YCCO has identified the following existing housing supports associated with YCCO partners.

This workgro up identifies opportunities and risks with local needs and housing gaps, as well as OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 2 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 coordinates resources. This group also makes recommendations for YCCO housing -directed social determinants of health funding , which go through the Community Advisory Counci l for review and recommendation. In the past project cycle, YCCO encountered a series of barriers in identifying a workflow for identifying YCCO members based on their utilization or referral to supported housing programs. Shifts to the remote space and c ompeting priorities, as well as some changes in partnership, staffing, and data systems delayed progress in achieving this goal. In 2022, YCCO has developed new lines of communicatio n and is identifying best practices for tying member data to housing utili zation. D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. Coordinated care organization initiatives continue to become more aligned and integrated with social and community needs. As member supports for their social determinants of health increase , YCCO is committed to also building more robust systems to track and monitor the distribution and impact of these supports. YCCO has historicall y spent a large portion of its HRS Flex funds on housing -related supports, and its HRS -funded Service Integration Teams funding on housing/utility/rent supports. These needs have increased and been exacerbated by the pandemic, which has also amplified the need to understand and follow up on these needs using streamlined data and referral systems. Through partnership with Yamhill County Health and Human Services, YCCO is expanding the availabl e affordable housing in the community by funding the Sheridan H ousing Project, a 72 -unit supportive housing facility , but is also partnering to better integrate housing supports with behavioral and medical health support. Based on the prior project's assessment, a series of housing supports are offered, but there is n ot clear data about what additional needs are present for those individuals housed. A 2020 survey of YC Housing Authority complex residents, most of whom were in affordable housing units, indicated these main needs: 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18Basic needsHealthDepositUtilities and billsMiscellaneousTransportationRent NUMBER OF REQUESTSService Integration and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 3 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 While housing is a key social determinant of health, this project aims to ensure that not only are residents housed, but offered coordinated care supported by streamlined data sharing and analytics. YCCO will also continue to develop internal processes for identifying members referred to housing resources through its CHW Hub, and create regular analytic reports . E. Brief narrative description : This project will build on previous relationship -building, program development, and data system exploration to estab lish clear processes for collecting, sharing, and analyzing housing data associated with YCCO members. The project will have two key components: Develop a system to indicate which YCCO members have been engaged with supportive housing services and integrating this into HHS member reports and develop internal processes for documenting, referring, tracking, and analyzing member referrals into housing - relat ed services. This process will be informed by the 2019 Community Health Improvement Plan and the ongoing new Community Health Assessment, which is prioritizing reaching homeless or formerly homeless populations to understand the specific needs they have. YCCO will use this data to inform its own housing investments, referrals, and monitoring. Because many of the housing investments are driven through the SHARE initiative, the Housing Partners Workgroup and Community Advisory Council will receive regular updates on repor ts and progress . F.

Ensure the competence of individuals providing language assistance, recognizing that the use of untrained individuals and/or minors as interpreters should be avoided C. Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. CCOs are required under Federal and State rules to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services to members at no charge. While these requirements are written and implemented in a variety of policies, procedures, handbooks and contractual agreement s, the quality and consistency of the delivery of these services is partially unknown. Grievance and customer service data does not indicate significant reported barriers in these areas. Successes of the past year include : Activity 1: Continue fielding pro vider survey to learn how language services are requested, acquired, documented/tracked and assess for quality. Integrate these collection tools into ongoing network monitoring and oversight (CLAS Standard 10). Baseline or current state Target/future state Target met by (MM/YYYY) Benchmark/future state Benchmark met by (MM/YYYY) Provider survey developed and piloted with 15 PCPCH providers with 73% response rate. (11/15) 100% response rate from PCPCH providers 60% response rate from provider network in wh ole 12/31/2021 The project involved the development and administration of a provide r accessibility survey . The survey covered topics on identification of needs for language support and accommodations for a disability , on intake forms and collection methods, utilization of language services and accommodations for a disability, and procedures for staff training, monitoring and reporting . Response rates were 100% from PCPCH providers, with 10 dental clinics and 31 behavio ral health clinics responding. With these responses, YCCO felt confident in moving forward with the information given from this sample of partner clinics. D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. The Health Equity Plan goal of providing services that are culturally and linguistically appropriate and accessible is an evolving long -term goal. This past year's strategies to further this goal included: The assessing provider and the member needs through the collection of language access data, provider accessibility survey, and facilitated conversations with the com munity Advisory Council and community members. Development and dissemination of a provider toolkit to support Meaningful Language Access. Offering training and technical assistance to staff and community providers on best practices and resources available to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate care. Based on language access data collected and reported in 2020, approximately 44% (1612 unique members) who identify as speaking a language other than English received interpretation services from a qualified/certified interpretation source. To supplement this information, YCCO conducted a provider survey to determine what accessibility services OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 6 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 were offered to patients. One of the goals of this survey was to reach a wide range of providers, and YCC O improved its survey range from only a select number of primary care providers in project year one, 2020, to more than 50 physical, behavioral, oral health and specialty care providers. This survey helped YCCO understand in more detail provider capabiliti es in offering assistive service, staff training and protocols, and established policies and procedures. A copy of the accessibility survey (Accessibility Survey 2020) is attached for reference. This survey revealed that likely additional language services are being offered through providers direct ly or through office staff and are not being captured or reported. It is unknown if these language supports meet the standards of qualified or certified language services. Further data collection strategies to cap ture all language services is a long -term goal. In 2021, YCCO developed a Provider Language Access Toolkit, which shares state and federal laws and contractual requirements for Medicaid providers regarding language services, as well as best practices for offering these services. This toolkit was piloted in a CME event on language access with ten attendees, sent out widely to the provider network, and posted publicly. A staff -facing supplement was also developed to ensure staff can both meet members' needs in direct encounters and advise providers appropriate on the processes for accessing language vendors. E. Brief narrative description : Part of the lack of language services and access data comes from provider reporting. Providers rarely use interpreter codes because they are not reimbursed, and the provider accessibility survey reveals gaps in both knowledge about language service require ments and ability to monitor services. Current providers using T1013 codes are very limited; only three were identified in 2019 -2020. YCCO has also identified which clinics have the highest rate of non -English speakers, and will prioritize those in technical assistance and outreach, to ensure members needing interpretation services are receiving the most appropri ate care. Based on review of the comprehensive Accessibility Survey fielded with physical, behavioral, and oral health providers, 36 clinics were identified as needing extra support based o n at least one answer , with 4 clinics responding to multiple questions with answers that warranted follow -up. These ranged from clinics reporting that they use volunteers or untrained staff to provide language assistance to Billing Provider Utilizing T1013 code 2019 2021 Pediatric clinic 1 6 Pediatric assessment center 3 Pediatric clinic 2 1 OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 7 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 clinics that did not report a process for collecting or documenting accommodation ne eds. The YCCO team will prioritize those clinics with the most non -English speakers and those with gaps in their Accessibility Survey response for additional follow -up. Technical assistance follow -up will not be punitive but offer a model for educating cl inics in language service requirements, reporting, and best practices , in an effort to increase rate of quality language service delivery. Activities involved to address these areas are as follows: YCCO staff will work closely with clinics to support quality language access reporting and compliance with contract requirements . YCCO staff will conduct site visits to primary care clinics and forums for behavioral health staff to share the Language Acce ss Toolkit, offer guides and support to use language services codes to document compliance with language service requirements and the language reporting requirements to YCCO. Using member language data and the results of the Provider accessibility survey, YCCO staff will also offer additional technical assistance to key clinics that have a higher density of non -English speaking patients or indicated in the survey that they need more support. F.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment(s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. Despite the challenges each Behavioral Health Neighborhood ( BHN) clinic faced due to the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020 both continued to engage with their specific cohort of members (SPMI diagnosis). Although in person visits saw a 77% decrease , both clinics were still able to connect with many of their assigned mem bers through telemedicine appointments to ensure continued primary care engagement. However, due to these in -person visit limitations, specific clinical quality measurements were far more difficult to collect and track. Since many of these identified membe rs have more than one physical health comorbidity (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) it makes continued engagement with a primary care physician even more critical . Along with the other data collect ed, clinics have begun to enter care plans on all members who have been identified in the program into The Collective Platform. Clinics are also creating cohorts of members within the platform to identify when this population goes to the ED. YCCO will initia te monitoring processes of this data for both clinics beginning in 2021. A licensed clinical psychiatric continued to provide consultation for both clinics to YCCO members as part of the BHC initiative. A 2021 goal of a 5-point reduction in mean PHQ -9 mean score of the cohort achieved just un der a 1 -point reduction during the year . This will be reported again at the culminat ion of 2022. Newly inte grated member level data will allow tracking of health outcomes in a more meaningful way for 2022. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 9 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 As seen in the chart s below, cost s of care were re duced over 2020 a nd 2021. This will continue to be tracked for 2022, while more closely integrat ing the health outcome data indicators. This will lead to the ability to develop a proper overview of the p ilot project and recommendations for VBP integra tion and potential lon g term network upscaling. D. Project context : For new projects, include justificat ion for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. Both clinics saw decreases in emergency department utilization as well as total cost of care for their cohort of members over the course of 2020 and 2021 (see charts below). While these trends experienced the ebbs and flows of the pandemic , ED spend and overall total c ost of care saw decreases. As this program stretches into 2022 , YCCO will focus one final year on tracking member level health outcome data and utilization data, and will ultimately produce a final analysis report of the project, as wel l as a sustainability plan from a V BP standpoint. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 10 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 E. Brief narrative description : High service utilizers (e.g. 5 ED visits/12 months , total cost of care > $1k/12 months etc.) constitute about 5% of YCCO patients yet consume 50% of overall costs. It is noted that a high percentage of these patients have mental health issues, substance abuse issues, or both . Many of these members also have other comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. The social determinant of health (SDOH) of Health and Health Care is a determinant area that disproportionately impact individuals with behavioral health ch allenges. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) individuals with severe mental disorders have a 10 -to-25- year life expectancy reduction and most of these deaths are due to chronic physical medical conditions such as OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 11 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 cardiovascular, respiratory a nd infectious diseases, diabetes and hypertension . One of the study clinics broke down the comorbidities of their members as demonstrated below. This will help inform all the needs of a particular member. By managing the behavioral health needs of a member , the hope is that the physical health conditions will improve as well. These components will be a part of the data collection process by the participating clinics in 2021. Studies also show that those with SPMI are more likely to have difficulty naviga ting the healthcare system, so they misuse the Emergency Department more often that those who do not have a diagnosis of SPMI . This project aims to improve biopsychosocial primary care for all patients, with a coordinated and integrated model of care. M embers being able to access Primary Care services as well as receive behavioral health supports allows for better access for members who otherwise would have to travel to multiple locations to receive care. The ability for the Primary Care Team to consult with a psychologist on medication management for members who are otherwise not able to readily access a behavioral health prescriber has been life changing for many of the members in the program. This is demonstrated in regular qualitative data that is collected from the participating clinics at quarterly meetings. Physician's Medical Center and Virginia Garcia McMinnville have entered into agreements to coordinate integrated care around patients, and track and share data with each other and YCCO. Yamhil l Community Care hired a subject matter expert to develop workflows that will better support those who have an SPMI diagnosis within two pilot clinics. YCCO supported these clinics to hire an additional behavioral health professional (either a LCSW or psyc hologist) to better support these members. YCCO also supports time for each clinic to consult with a psychiatrist to aid in evaluation and medication recommendations. There is also work within this group to increase use of The Collective Platform within th is cohort of members. The clinics will be entering a care plan for each member they engage to let the ED doctors know they are enrolled in the program and any special considerations that should be considered while delivering care to the member while in the ED. Identifying these members in a cohort within the Collective Platform will also notify the care coordinator for the program at the PCP clinic that the member has been in the ED, so follow up care can be coordinated within 72 hours of discharge. F. Activ ities and monitoring for performance improvement : OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 12 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 Activity 1 description : Staffing models are in place and member level data is being collected. This data will be reported to YCCO on a monthly basis for health outcome tracking. This will be aggr egated and analyzed via a mid-year revie w and also at a 2022 cumulative level. Short term or Long term Monitoring activity 1 for improvement : Clinics will continue to report monthly on the number of members that they have engag ed in the Behavioral Health Neighborhood (BHN). They will continue collect ing and report ing data on not only the progression of mental health condition markers such as PHQ -9 and GAD -7, but also on blood pressure, HbA1C and number of members in the cohort who have a BMI over 30 . As members are engaged in the program to better support their behavioral health needs, the hope is that improvement in other health condition indicators will be observed . For 2022 , member level data will be a vailable for all cohort members for the entire year. This data will be utilized to determine success in th ese various health data outcome areas.

REASSIGNING MEMBERS TO REDUCE DRIVING DISTANCE TO ASSIGNED PCP OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 14 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 YCCO has identified notable differences in driving distance to assigned PCP among its members based on factors such as region of residence (urban/rural*), engagement in care **, race/ethnicity, and spoken language . A few notable examples as of December 2021 include: Among non -engaged members living in urban areas , English -speaking members lived an average of 7.3 miles closer to their assigned PCP than Spanish -speaking members (1 6.1 miles vs 8.8 miles) 16.7% of Spanish -speaking members in urban areas lived more than 30 miles away from their assigned PCP, while only 4.7% of English -speaking members lived more than 30 miles away from their assigned PCP. In nearly all cases, non -engaged members live d further a way from their assigned PCP than engaged members. Most notably: o While 16.7% of Spanish -speaking members in urban areas lived more than 30 miles away from their assigned PCP, only 1 .0% of Spanish speaking members did. o In rural areas, both English and Spanish speaking non -engaged members lived an average of two miles further away from their PCP than engaged member. The primary goal of this project is to establish a dashboard to better quantify and understand the effects of a member's race , primary language , region of residence, and engagement status on their access to their assigned PCP. A secondary goal was to identify un -engaged members who live a significant time/distance (>30 miles estimated driving distance or >30 miles estimated driving time) from their assigned PCP as candidates for reassignment to a closer PCP to reduce these inequities and a potential increase in engagement with care.

ACCESS MONITORING FOR PRIMARY CARE SERVICES According to the results of the 2021 CAHPS 5.1H Medicaid Member Experience Survey, conducted between January and April 2021, YCCO receives mixed scores from its members in its ability to prov ide sufficient access to care. The annual CAHPS survey has four questions that refer to access to care. For these, while a majority of members answer \"Always\" or \"Usually\", YCCO's rates are at or below the average for OHP members for three of the four qu estions asked. 2021 CAHPS Survey 0.9% 0.0%2.0%4.0%6.0%8.0% Non-Engaged Engaged% of members in rural areas who live >30 miles from their assigned PCP - spoken language and 24 month engagement English Spanish10.7 7.18.7 5.0 051015 English SpanishDriving distance (miles)Average driving distance to assigned PCP for members in urban areas - spoken language and 24 month engagement Non-Engaged Engaged 66.4% 50.2% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70% Within 30 miles Greater than 30 milesDistance to assigned PCP for members engaged in primary care in previous 24 months 10.1 8.4 024681012 Non-engaged EngagedDriving Distance (miles)Average driving distance to assigned PCP by 24 month engagement status 86.1%79.4% 79.6% 50.0%60.0%70.0%80.0%90.0%100.0% 2019 2020 2021Q4 -In the last six months, when you needed care right away, how often did you get care as soon as you needed? 81.6% 80.3% 81.8% 50.0%60.0%70.0%80.0%90.0%100.0% 2019 2020 2021Q6 -In the last six months, how often did you get an apointment for a check -up or routine care as soon as you needed? 2021 OHP Average (79.8%) +2.0%2021 Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 16 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 Results of 2021 CAHPS survey for questions pertaining to access to care. Percentages refer to the portion of members answering \"Always\" or \"Usually\". Additionally, while grievances filed related to access to care dropped significantly in 2020, likely an effect of the COVID -19 pandemic, these began a return to previous levels in 2019. In particular, YCCO sees a significant number of grievance s filed pertaining to category A.a ( Provider's office unresponsive, not available, difficult to contact for appointment or information ) and A.i ( Provider not available to give necessary care ). (see \" # of filed grievances related to member wait times, 2019 -2021 \" below). Currently YCCO lacks a process for monitoring access to Primary Care services. Per OARs CCOs should be regularly monitoring access for both Primary Care and specialty services. Currently YCCO allows Primary Care Clinics to state how much capa city is available for members. Monitoring access for members in Primary Care especially, will ensure that the clinics we reassign members to will have proper access to services.

For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. REASSIGNING MEMBERS TO REDUCE DRIVING DISTANCE TO ASSIGNED PCP In 2020 a dashboard was developed to provide more g ranular and specific information about members who do not live within convenient driving time/distance from their assigned PCP, defined as >30 miles and/or 30 minutes for members living in rural areas, and >60 miles and/or 60 minutes for members living in rural areas. This dashboard combines information from the bi -weekly Member Engagement Report the most recent OHA dashboard, and the locations of YCCO's PCPs to generate a list of members who live furthest away from their assigned PCP. Users of the dashbo ard can filter based on race/ethnicity, primary language, 24 -month engagement status, members in rural or urban areas, and whether the report will issue based on estimated driving distance or estimated driving time .* Integration of Special Health Care Needs status (SHCN) was included in Q1 2022. Screenshot from dashboard (member ID and address redacted to preserve privacy of PHI) *Estimated straight line distance - Calculated by applying the latitude and longitude of each member's home address and the latitude and longitude of each PCP's address to the haversine formula for calculating straight line distance between two points over the surface of the Earth distance - Estimated straight line distance X 1.4 Estimated driving time - Assumes average drivin g speed of 29.8 mph Estimated driving distance / (29.8/60) Given that YCCO's population is more linguistically and racially diverse in urban areas than in rural, addressing inequities in access to PCP has the potential to make a meaningful and quantifiab le difference in quality of care for YCCO's members . In December 2021 1,974 members who lived in urban areas had not been engaged in care with their assigned PCP in the previous 24 months, an engagement rate of 50.0% vs. 70.0% for OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 18 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 members in rural areas. If a portion of these members could be reassigned to a new PCP closer to their home at the beginning of 202 2, it would be possible to determine whether a closer assignment results in greater levels of engagement in care . Methodology for member re -assignment: Optimization add-ons for Excel exist which, for any given subset of members, can calculate the arrangement of PCP assignment that results in the shortest overall distance between members' addresses and location of their assigned PCPs. Repeated tests of this process as applied to PCP assignment have shown that it reliably and dramatically reduces overall driving distance to PCP for members. Note that reassignments factor in each given provider's current panel size, so that after apply ing the optimizer algorithm each provider still has the same number of members on their panel as they did originally. After consideration of how best to apply this optimization algorithm to actual member PCP assignments, YCCO has determined that it would b e best to use 2022 as a test year to identify any potential unforeseen resulting issues and to determine to what extent reassigning a member to a PCP closer to their home results in increased engagement in care. With that in mind, reassignments using the optimizer algorithm were determined in January 2022 according to the following criteria: Limited to a single health care system: In 2022, YCCO will only reassign members who are already assigned to a Virginia Garcia clinic to eliminate complications with enrolling a member in a different clinic network. YCCO is contracted with multiple Virginia Garcia clinics with a wide geographic distribution, making this still an effective test of this process. Only members with a minimum of 24 months enrollment with YCCO AND no PCP claims with their assigned PCP in the previous 24 months. Excludes members with a mental health claim with any VG clinic. This resulted in 1,637 members, of which 446 were assigned to a different Virginia Garcia clinic. O f these, 81.6% were assigned to a PCP closer to their home, with a median net estimated driving distance of 10.5 miles and a maximum decrease of 25.9 estimated driving miles. For remaining members who were reassigned to a PCP further from their home, the median increase in distance was 3.5 miles and the maximum was 6.1 miles. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 19 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 These reassignments were communicated to the Virginia Garcia system in February 2022, and are estimated to be come effective at some point in March 2022. Care utilization for these 446 members will be tracked periodically over the course of 2022, with a final analysis made at the end of 2022 to determine whether reassignments resulted in a corresponding change in care utilization. It is also hoped that tracking and resolving any unforeseen issues that may arise will allow for greater expansion of this process to include more contracted clinics beginning in 2023. ACCESS MONITORING FOR PRIMARY CARE SERVICES In February 2022 YCCO initiate d a process to monitor members' access to Primary Care. In Q2 this monitoring will expand to include specialty providers. YCCO will use both direct outreach to clinics as well as secret shoppers to obtain quantifiable and actionable data on the current state of access at these clinics . Once degree of access is determined , YCCO Provider Relations staff will have individual conversations with clinics to help them understan d if they are in compliance with access standards and provide individualized support where necessary to improve access level. E. Brief narrative description : REASSIGNING MEMBERS TO REDUCE DRIVING DISTANCE TO ASSIGNED PCP This project has three goals: i. Determine whether changing a members' assigned PCP from one exceeding the time/distance standards for their area increases engagement in care. a) To be achieved by re-assigning non-engaged members enrolled in the Virginia Garcia system to other clinics within that system using the optimizer algorithm as described in -30-25-20-15-10-50510Change in driving distance (miles) Reassigned members sorted by change in driving distance to assigned PCP after reassignmentChange in driving distance to assigned PCP for reassigned members Members assigned to a PCP closer to their home address Members assigned to a PCP further from their home address As a result of reassignment, a significant majority of reassigned members have been assigned to a clinic closer to their home, a majority of these more than 10 miles closer .

ACCESS MONITORING FOR PRIMARY CARE SERVICES The primary goal of this project is to creat e a structure to monitor access to ensure that all members have sufficient access to primary care services per OAR 410 -141-3840 , specifically ensuring that members have access for urgent issues within 72 hours, well care within four weeks , and primary for new members within four weeks . This will be accomplished through direct pr ovider outreach and the use of secret shoppers to determine the current state of access, and by providing clinics with individualized support to bring them into compliance where necessary.

Create conflict and grievance resolution processes that are culturally and linguistically appr opriate to identify, prevent, and resolve conflicts or complaints C. Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. CCOs are required under Federal and State rules to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services to members at no charge. While these requirements are written and implemented in a variety of policies, procedures, handbooks and contractual agre ements, the quality and consistency of the delivery of these services is partially unknown. Grievance and customer service data does not indicate significant reported barriers in these areas. Numbers of grievances overall were low, especially for non -Engli sh speakers, and grievances and complaints related to language services were made only by English speakers. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 23 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 The 2021 project assessment of grievance data related to cultural or language barriers was analyzed and showed no usable trends. Data shows that v ery few grievances are reported for interaction with plan or provider (IP) category. Only nine complaints have been filed over the past 6 years of data collection. Deeper case review revealed that the types of grievances filed were complaints about miscom munications with the plan or provider related to referrals, call routing within customer service, or unfair treatment associated with their identity i.e., LGBTQ parents, a black patient whose provider assumed had a different race and language needs and ini tiated care speaking in Spanish. Three of the nine grievances referenced reverse discrimination related to perception of identity, Spanish language spoken when not the Members' primary language, or a negative experience with the delivery of care related to opioid prescribing/pain management related to their identity. All of these grievances were filed by members who identify as Caucasian and who speak English as their primary language. YCCO language access data shows a series of limitations, from the brea dth of information available from partner clinics to the information available from member grievances and vendor reports. This has revealed a need to not only enhance data collection and analytics processes, but also to better educate members on providing feedback and understanding their rights. This project will enhance data systems regarding members' access to services and offer education to improve reporting and grievance pathways from internal staff, partners, and members alike. D. Project context : For n ew projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. Grievance data reveals that a disproportionately low rate of non -English speaking members file complaints or appeals. This number hints that those needing language services do not have access to information or support needed to file complaints or appeals successfully. It appears that the current system YCCO will, in this project, develop mechanisms to better understand barr iers through existing service data and collect more feedback from non -English speaking members, especially those who have received language services, to understand their experience. YCCO will also disburse plain - language member education materials to suppo rt this information -sharing. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 24 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 While there are clear language access requirements, provider ability to document these services and YCCO's ability to monitor them has historically been limited. Awareness of these documentation processes is limited even among YCCO staff, per a 2021 internal workgroup review. To best improve quality of care for members, YCCO must first understand the provision of these services and address gaps. Because there isn't available grievance data, YCCO must explore potential gaps with the data available. YCCO ha s identified which clinics have the highest rate of non -English speakers, and will prioritize those in technical assistance and outreach, to ensure members needing interpretation services are receiving the most appropriate care . The table below shows which Spanish speakers have an interpreter needs flag; YCCO will use this to review which patients needing interpretation actually received it in the clinic. For those who did not, while this is not a grievance filed by a member, it does present a barrier that may warrant one. Based on review of the comprehensive Accessibility Survey fielded with physical, behavioral, and oral health providers, 36 clinics were identified as needing extra support based on at least one answer, with 4 clinics responding to multiple questions with answers that warranted follow -up. These ranged from clinics reporting that they use volunteers to provide language assistance clinics to clinics that did not report a process fo r collecting or do cumenting accommodation needs. Reporting of the use of interpretation services is severely limited, with only a handful of clinics using the proper codes. While these codes aren't reimbursable, they are vital to understanding compliance. In technical assistance to providers, YCCO will work to understand barriers to reporting this information. Past discussions have revealed that billing a non -payable code can delay processing for clinics, and YCCO will conduct troubleshooting internally to ensure this reporting is low - barrier for clinics and staff. This reporting will be used alongside with language flag, language access data from language service vendors, and any new grievances that are filed, to best understand true member barriers in the area of language access. These interventions and assessments will improve operational processes to determine how language access specifically may be a barrier to members, whether lack of language services is limiting complaints or appeals being filed, an d assess actual experience with language services in order to develop a member -friendly complaint and appeal process for those who need language assistance. E. Brief narrative description : This project will address issues members who need language services many encounter, and monitor and improve these barriers according to identified need.

This will include working closely with language vendors to improve and streamline reporting processes, with existing data sources like grievances and appeals to understand disparities, and with clinics to improve reporting capacity and compliance with language services requirements. 2) YCCO will conduct provider and member outreach and education around language services. Members will receive plain language information about their rights regarding language services, how to request these services, and how to complain about not receiving th em in a quality or timely manner. YCCO will also develop mechanisms to gather feedback from non -English speaking members and more effectively monitor experience of service. 3) Internal staff will receive comprehensive training on member rights regarding lang uage access. Those who have direct member contact will also receive specialized training on how to recognize and document complaints or grievances appropriately. F.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data . The Yamhill Oral Health Coalition has been a guiding force in YCCO oral health integration projects, supporting integrated Community Connect events with integrated dental care, an oral health community assessment, and continuing education events. In previous Oral Health I ntegration TQS projects, YCCO has prioritized building relationships and referral pathways between providers of different disciplines. A series of successful meet -and-greet and Continuing Medical Education events have built connections between oral health providers and other physical and behavioral health providers and systems. Oral health providers have received education on how to refer to other disciplines, and vice versa. In the last year, it has become apparent that additional oral health supports have been needed, as dental care overall dropped during the pandemic, a high risk for many populations. D. Project context : For new projects, i nclude justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. The Oral Health Coalition specifically identified infants and families as priority populations that needed to be connected to services. Additionally, YCCO identified me mbers with diabetes as another high -risk category needing additional support. Pregnant people can experience birth risks like premature delivery, pre -eclampsia, and low birth weight babies as well as dental concerns like dental erosion and gingivitis. Beca use of perceptions of danger in dental care during pregnancy, some people avoid the dentist while pregnant. Gingivitis has been found in 40% of pregnancies ( Silk H, Douglass AB, Douglass JM, Silk L . Am Fam Physician. 2008 Apr 15; 77(8):1139 -44.). Forty -eight percent of pregnant people who were contacted by a YCCO CHW in 2021 did not have a dentist. Periodontitis can be a common co -occurrence with diabetes, and periondontitis, cavities, and limited tooth brushing can all be associa ted with larger risks like cardiovascular disease ( Song T, Jeon J, Kim J. Cardiovascular risks of periodontitis and oral hygiene indicators in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes & Metabolism. 47(6). 2021 .). Only a third of YCCO members with diabetes accessed any kind of dental care in 2020. In the past few years, outside of TQS projects, Capitol Dental Care has developed systems to hold available appointment slots for certain urgent cases and priority populations, includ ing those with diabetes diag noses. However, dental utilization for diabetics has decreased in 2020. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 28 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 Diabetes Year Total Diabetic Members Members with a dental visit % 2019 857 362 42.2% 2020 1223 408 33.4% The number of pregnant people receiving dental care in 2021 was also concerningly low, at only 23%. Year Total Pregnant Members Members with a dental visit % 2021 408 97 23.8 % Anecdotal evidence from the local Oral Health Coalition and Quality and Clinical Advisory Panel shows that not all providers are familiar with processes to refer patients into dental care , and Community Advisory Council feedback indicates that members are u naware as well. Perceptions of overall dental availability are that it is extremely limited locally. The goals of this project are to increase referral into dental benefits and services for providers to increase utilization for these two target populations , as well as ensure comprehensive, whole -self care for these individuals, from physical, behavioral, and oral health to social wellness. E. Brief narrative description : This project includes t wo main activities: - development of data -sharing process to ensure appointment adequacy for priority populations, and continued provider education on importance of dental care referral - internal THW workflow to support referral of pregnant patients to dental care The goal of the project is to increase the rate of patients with those diagnoses who access dental care in the project period . This dat a will be stratified by location and language, to better understand disparities related to these population s. Over the course of the project, YCCO anticipates also exploring how non -clinical provider s can use CIE to refer YCCO members into dental care. Currently, Capitol Dental attempts to keep available appointments for urgent needs and patients who are identified as being pregnant or diabetic. However, YCCO does not have a process to ensure these appointments are adequate to meet the needs of every pregnant or diabetic member. YCCO will work closely with Capitol to share updated member information related to these conditions, and conf irm with Capitol that an appropriate and timely number of appointment slots are available. Currently, YCCO performs outreach call to every YCCO member who has been identified as pregnant. These outreach calls are designed to ensure members are aware of an d connected to the appropriate services, including health appointments, WIC, doulas, and other social supports. However, currently the THW staff conducting these calls can only provide Capitol Dental's Customer Service number and direct the member to reach out. In this process improvement, project, YCCO staff will be able to send referral lists of members who have indicated they do not have a primary care dentist, and Capitol will perform outreach to get the member a timely appointment. In 2021, 225 pregnan t YCCO OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 29 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 members were identified and contacted. 57% of these calls were successful in reaching the member. Of those calls, YCCO found the following: Number of members Category of dental care for member 10 CCOB, no dental benefit 47 have a dentist 62 didn't have a dentist, were give n number to call 9 member did not provide information Of those contacted (who answered their phones), 27/98 (27.6%) had a dental visit. For those who did not answer their phones , 24/92 (26.1%) had a dental visit , indicating that informing people they have dental coverage does not seem to have much impact on dental engagement. These activities will attempt to improve the effectiveness of this outreach. Finally, YCCO will partner with cli nics and CBOs to ensure awareness of referral processes into Capitol Dental for YCCO members. These activities will be completed in clinic site visits and provider newsletters. CBO outreach will occur through Service Integration Teams and direct outreach w ith local Traditional Health Workers like doulas and Community Health Workers. F.

YCCO's APM clinics experienced a decline in PCPCH status among 12 PCPCH clinics . Many of the issues were related to staffing issues. Some of these clinics have let their PCPCH status expire altogether , as they did not have the staff capacity to renew their application. Some of YCCO's PCP clinics that opened just prior to COVID, or even during the pandemic have not have the staffing resources to devot e to standing up a PCPCH program at their clinic. Some clinics have also decided to reapply at a lower tier status, as staffing limitations and pandemic stressors, have not allowed the clinic to support certain activities. D.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment (s) for the compon ent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data . Prior Year Intervention Assessment: Intervention 1: YCCO completed an analysis and identified currently enrolled members with a diagnosis of diabetes and costs associated with treatment of the chronic condition. Intervention 2: Based on the identified members, YCCO implemented a workflow to engage these members with care programs and primary care providers. The workflow includes a weekly referral process for newly enrolled/transitioned members or those recently diagnosed. The process includes member assessment for care coordination or inte nsive care coordination programs. These referrals accessed community health workers or registered nurse case managers to support member's engagement with primary care, identification of specialty referral needs and educate members on disease and medication management. Intervention 3: YCCO was able to accurately identify based on PAC data and strengthen case management outreach for these members. Utilizing a risk score, YCCO can quickly engage members who would most significantly benefit from health coordin ation and case management . Referrals are made to care coordination programs and PCPs are notified of enrollment and provided the case management plan of care when applicable. Intervention 4: Currently these referrals and workflows are being evaluated to calculate engagement and track trends over time. This will allow YCCO to identify and remove any barriers that might decrease member participation and follow up with more frequent HbA1c testing. YCCO will also evaluate claims data on HbA1c lab s to identify clinics/providers that might require additional outreach and support to increasing member's engagement and timely testing. Care management program resources originally included in the opportunity required routing to COVID 19 outreach for positive cases, post hospitalization follow up and care coordination support with telehealth improvements. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 34 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 YCCO discovered this need in February 2020 as a result of the nationwide pandemic. This population wide risk continued throughout the rest of calendar y ear 2020. While the focus around the Diabetes episode remained a constant review item for YCCO, the capture of these cases were driven by acute ER and inpatient stay for high risk members rather than the chronic disease population as a whole. YCCO's Memb er Engagement Hub and Care Management teams worked closely with providers and community partners to: - identify members with acute diabetic ketoacidosis, - inpatient confinements due to their chronic diabetes mellitus, and - monitored DHS long term care and support needs for these members that were referred to our Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) meetings monthly. Tactics used for these sources were: - provider referrals, - Collective Medical's disease specific and ED utilization cohorts, - education t o school districts around Wellness to Learn program for early intervention, - screening assessments for diabetes related encounters with outreach calls from care coordination technicians. By narrowing the review process, it allowed YCCO and partners to en gage the members with the highest needs in this specific diagnosis group. YCCO t ook the goal of more frequent HbA1c testing and primary care engagement into 2021 to further expand the care coordination and targeted approach to support the (471) currently enrolled members identified with Diabetes related PAC. The baselining activity below shows how claim and cost trends presented for 2020 vs 2021 data. This data review will happen after 2022 claims runout to show how increased Care Management structures an d focus for this population drive Inpatient and ED claims trends.

Project context : For new projects, i nclude justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. YCCO was able to accurately use MEPP data from 2020 to 2021 to identify members with diabetes requiring additional care management interventions based on their utilization patterns. This work was limited due to staffing to members with greater than 10,000 dollars in claims for 2020 -2021. YCCO is planning a significant increase in scale by reviewing all members with greater than 1000 dollars in claims for care coordination or case management needs. The member will be reviewed for emergency and inpatient utilization, comorbid ity and SDOH -e needs to attempt to identify those who would benefit from education and additional supports. In addition, YCCO will evaluate PCP clinics with 5000 dollars or greater average member costs related to diabetes and provide education on programs and care management available in their communities. This will be accomplished with specific outreach to care coordinators or traditional health workers that are available in the clinics. By utilizing the existing health services program, YCCO is accessing staff that have the clinical knowledge to accurately triage and identify members who have the highest potential to be compliant and benefit from disease education and care management interventions. YCCO is also able to leverage the provider engagement expe rtise to work more effectively with PCP clinics and specialists to ensure the member's full care team is engaged in their disease management. Previously, YCCO was limited in the number of members that could be reviewed and outreach completed. With the 2022 strategy, there will be significant expansion to the scale of the diabetes program and use of MEPP data. YCCO will review all members with greater than $1000 of diabetes related claims for coordination needs. All members with two or more related emergency room or inpatient hospitalization will be invited to the Diabetes Care Management program. Their PCP clinic will also be provided information on the program and direct contact information to YCCO Health Services Specialist. Success Indicators: Achieveme nt of 100% of identified members receiving invitation, and 50% of those identified members participating in the diabetes care management program. 100% of the PCP clinics identified with >$1000 of member costs will receive outreach to alert them of Care Man agement resources, and providers will document an intervention added within their clinic to provide additional support to diabetic members.

The data from MEPP is related to long -term complications from di abetes. The intervention work identifies members for engagement and outreach, and to facilitate the connection between members and Care Management structures. Primary data used: Members identified within the MEPP platform who have been identified with the top diagnosis codes within with AAE threshold. Key implementation steps: Care Management structures were bolstered during 2020 and 2021. Staffing resources were added. Outreach activities increased. How will proposed project impact quality, outcomes, or utilization: Increase the quality -of-care management outreach services and to decrease acute utilization related to AAE. How will findings and results be tracked: The results will be tracked in total on the Diabetes AAE spread sheet , with additional documen tation provided from CIM 3 care management program notes and clinic specific trainings.

Component prior year assessment: Include calendar year assessment(s) for the comp onent(s) selected with CCO - or region -specific data. As defined by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and National Institute s of Health (NIH) , hypertension also known as high blood pressure is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure . Left uncontrolled, hypertension increases the risk of heart attack, heart failure, kidney disease, stroke , cognitive decline , and other serious health problems . Often called the \"silent killer ,\" hypertension does not always present with signs of illness that can been seen or felt and health risks increase with age. YCCO covers over 33,000 lives in Yamhill, Polk, and Washington Counties in Oregon . Approximately 2798, or 8.4% of membership are older adults with defined special health care needs (SHCN) and qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage. This population, known as Full Benefit Dual Eligible (FBDE) members have a higher prevenance of hypertension at 14.1% compared to all YCCO members at 6.3% b ased on claims. A study of the adverse actionable events (AAE) associated with hypertension found that 45.3% of FBDE members who have a diagnosis of hypertension have AAE compared to all YCCO members with the same condition having half the AAE at 22.3% . What MEPP data is being used: A study of the costs associated with adverse actionable events (AAE) for members who are full -benefit dual eligible plan members with hypertension (296 members) found there was an estimated $259,935 of oppo rtunity to improve. AAE information from the MEPP dashboard, filtered to the top 10 diagnosis codes with the highest AAE associated for hypertension . Care Management services exist for all members including members who are identified as having special health care needs, who are older and are eligible for dual benefits from Medicare and Medicaid, and who are OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 40 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 living with c hronic conditions that impact their health and wellbeing day to day. While care management services wrap around all members, working with individuals who have multiple points in their care experience such as a primary care doctor, specialists, care managers, home , and facility -based care givers, can be challenging and lead to gaps in care. Through the assessment of quality and performance of utilization for members who have a diagnosis of hypertension, YCCO found that inpatient services are the second largest care type with these services having the highest average cost per claim. How will project impact Quality, Outcomes, or Utilization: Increas ing a focused care management and coordinated approach with the primary care provider , specialty providers , and therapeu tic management will keep members out of the hospital for the identified AAE. How will results and findings be tracked: Root cause data exercise identified members having a hypertension diagnosis for 2021 minus exclusions, and includes their MEPP numbers fr om 2018 -2020 where applicable, and basic claims data (net amount, count of claims, avg. cost per claim) for 2021 and their current assigned PCP. Median amounts for these are as follow: Median amount spent per member - $1,736.69 Median count of claims per member - 52 Median cost per claim per member - $40.40 D. Project context : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. The overarching focus for this project is to provide coordinated support with primary care providers and care mana gers for the ongoing treatment and care support for hypertension. The goal is to positively impact the entire population with a diagnosis of hypertension and will focus specifically on the coordination barriers that exist within the multiple systems of ca re for the population of members who are FBDE and who have specific healthcare needs. This kind of intervention require s payers, providers, multi -discipline care teams, and care givers to work together in innovative ways. To do this effectively, a few cond itions must be in place: Engagement in patient -centered care treatment planning Structured c ommunication among the multidisciplinary care team Transparency and data sharing Over the past year, efforts to intervein upstream have expanded the offering of chronic disease care management program s; data sharing between the plan, its affiliated Medicare Advantage program, and care managers; and continuous tracking of hypertension control through Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Opportunities st ill exist to strengthen the collaborative development of treatment plans and supporting safe and coordinated transitions when they occur to or from an inpatient stay, skilled nursing facility , or outpatient specialty follow up. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 41 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 YCCO will engage in a popu lation management focus, featuring a multi -pronged approach: Identification and coordination with PCP treatment planning - An assessment of 2021 PCP engagement rates for FBDE members found 51% of members engaged with their assigned PCP in the past 24 mont hs. This leaves 49% of FBDE members not engaging in primary care services . Bolstering Care Management tools focus on specialized chronic disease management programs Use of clinical staff for therapeutic medical management. Primary Care data transparency focus - Providers currently submit Hypertension data from EMRs to YCCO. YCCO will turn that data back around to providers on how well they are managing these members. This will also help to identify members who need additional Care Management support. Thi s information to be shared at 100% of Spring 2022 site visits. Currently, clinics provide monthly Hypertension EMR/EHR data per requirements for CCO Incentive Metric tracking and submission. Many of the clinics that provide this data are large organizations with central reporting structures or entities. Potential gaps exist in the ability for the individual providers in those larger organizations to act upon reporting information. YCCO will engage in internal data analysis and targeted information development to create clinic - specific gap lists for the members who are out of control. YCCO will also support clinics with Meaningful Use for hypertension data. This information will then be shared back with the clinics to help with upstream intervention for potentially high dollar claims. E. Brief narrative description : The project activities will increase collaboration between health system partners (CCO, Affiliated Medicare Plan, local AAA/APD partners) to align PCP assignment, case manager coordination, and facilitat e care transitions with the goal of providing comprehensive care that reduces the need for costly AAE, adverse health outcomes related to care transitions , and readmission s that lead to medication errors and breaks in care continuity .

The YCCO intervention strategy is to invest resources and efforts in improving the current SUD provider network, both in number of providers, scope of contracted services, targeted quality outcomes, and contract payment terms. Alcohol and opioid related s ervices will be prioritized, as well as analyzing the historical use of single case agreements versus contracting and partnering with providers. To complete this necessary work, YCCO planned to acquire the equivalent of 1.6 FTE in new staffing for purpose s including SUD network development, contracting, and engagement. After struggling with hiring these positions (including hiring a Behavioral Health Systems Specialist 3, and then losing that staff member soon after) YCCO was able to hire a Provider Relations Supervisor and a Health Services Specialist in 2021, each who have a focus on the Behavioral Health network and quality improvement work within that space. For 2020 and 2021 , the approach shifted in response to the COVID pandemic. The focus moved to the ability to get SUD and other BH services and supports to Members. YCCO and the LMHA/CMHP/YCHHS worked closely together to identify support needs for both Med icaid and non -Medicaid individuals. System improvement efforts have included expansion of services provided by pra ctitioners outside of the CMHP . This expansion has shown an increase of 1,153% since the inception of YCCO. SUD related investments include youth and family advocates, SUD engagement/support peer services, partnerships with law enforcement (Commu nity Outreach Specialists), increased access to MAT services, and referral pathways/warm handoffs with the Yamhill County jail. SUD/BH services were expanded in the schools in 2020, adding two part -time counselors, and a 1.0 FTE was added in 2021 specific to the Newberg school district. The original estimate of potential savings using the revised MEPP dashboard and 2017 -2019 data are now $1,359,000. Updated potential costs are still under review, as 1) some costs have just been delayed as part of delays in recruitment, and 2) delays in actual contract negotiations and execution with providers which will inform the magnitude of any changes in provider reimbursement. An age -banding exercise took place as part of the recap of the previous years. The topline conclusion is that members in the IET denominator are disproportionately older than our membership as a whole.

Project c ontext : For new projects, include justification for choosing the project. For continued projects, provide progress to date since project inception. The focus of this intervention is to increase the number of contracted providers. This work is ongoing and i s a long -term QI effort. SUD system improvement will be implemented via Project 2 of YCCO's Comprehensive BH Plan Workforce Project. This project centers around enhancing workforce competency through development and implementation of targeted training curr iculum. 2020 -2021 work focused on transitioning between administrative entities and conducting assessment of system. SUD providers have been prioritized based on service utilization patterns. Work for 2022 and beyond will center around buildin g structures within this space to expand service availability and provide resources for expanded provider panel. Direct contracting is a focus of this project from the standpoint of an increased contracted network and fewer single case agreements. This wi ll allow for better quality monitoring of the network, with downstream impacts to overall member health, and specifically within areas identified as AAE within the MEPP platform. A specific contracting workgroup has been formed to aid in structural buildin g of this process and to align around best practices. The population of focus is the upstream membership who do not have a AAE as a preventative measure, and the aggregated membership identified as having AAE within the MEPP system. Assessment of the MEPP data provides insight by identifying the top AAE diagnosis codes into the physical health impacts of drug and alcohol use. In order to address these impacts YCCO is looking upstream of the hospital impact and address the larger commu nity-based system. By increasing the number of practitioners available YCCO seeks to increase the impact of critical services to address addiction among YCCO members. Key Implementation Steps: As part of the Comprehensive Behavioral Health Plan, a deep dive analysis has been completed, focused on reviewing the SUD providers in network as well as SUD providers who are out of network, who have provided services to YCCO members. How will the project impact Quality, Outcomes, or Utilization: YCCO expects tha t this will impact utilization by increasing capacity and member choice regarding SUD service providers. How will results and findings be tracked: Foundational core element that will be tracked is the number of contracted SUD providers. Longitudinal result s will be tracked based on the percent of members who receive a service from a contracted provider. Will be assessed against implementation to determine increased service usage. E. Brief narrative description : The overarching QI work to happen in 2022 is t o develop stronger referral pathways for specialty providers and services . A large -scale improvement tool will be the development of a Service Resource Directory, which will be an aid in connecting and coordinating better communication between provider groups. Increased coordination and communication will bolster upstream disease and health management and lessen costs for the system in the longer term. The work done in 2022 will provide the ability for Care Management and other staff to search specifically by subspecialties within SUD, location, and other m ore helpful filters. This tool will facilitate utilization in order to effectively connect members to the right provider (s) (especially within CM and customer service) and to easily find providers with necessary sub -specialties. OHA Transformation and Quality Strategy (TQS) CCO: Yamhill Community Care Organization Page 46 of 48 Last updated: 10/1/202 1 As part of ongoing quality structures, YCCO will engage in a review of utilization patterns mid-year in 2022 , to demonstrate the impacts of larger contracted network and increase in SUD costs (which will decrease avoidable costs down the line).

Project short title: MEPP Episode 2: Increased Engagement Within School -Based Programs B. Project unique ID (as provided by OHA) : N/A C. Criteria for project discontinu ation : Fully matured project that has met its intended outcomes D. Reason (s) for project discontinuation in support of the selected criteria above : MEPP Episode 2: Increased Engagement Within School -Based Programs was intended to be of limited duration with the primary focus being on establishing funding to increase the number of clinical practitioners available to provide services to youth in th e school setting. Once established and stabilized , no new intervention was planned as the impact of the original intervention will naturally evolve over time without additional interventions. This project was included for one year longer than originally an ticipated due to the impact of COVID on implementation. Additionally, YCCO is seeking to align efforts with larger statewide efforts, including those driven the CMS waivers. A. Project short title: Integration of PCP and Oral Health B. Project unique ID (as provided by OHA): 176 C. Criteria for project discontinuation: Fully matured project that has met its intended outcomes D. Reason(s) for project discontinuation in support of the selected criteria above : YCCO worked closely with the local Oral Health Coalition to develop an educational meet -and-greet series to promote interdisciplinary connection and increase referral pathways. More than 60 providers were engaged and more than 80 received information about integrating care, delivering high quality dental services, and referring between behavioral, oral, and physical health. While these events were successful and 100% of survey respondents indicated they learned information to use in their practice, integrat ion activities weren't being formed because of these events. The Oral Health Coalition shifted its priorities from increasing provider connections and awareness to moving into a place of action. The project achieved its goal of increasing awareness of refe rral between physical health and oral health providers, and will be discontinued. New projects will build on this awareness to increase actual activities related to integration. A. Project short title: Primary C are Capitation Pilot B. Project unique ID (as provided by OHA): 408 C. Criteria for project discontinuation: Project fails to meet TQS requirements for the chosen component(s) based on OHA feedback a nd/or written assessment D. Reason(s) for project discontinuation in support of the selected criteria above : Per OHA feedback, this pro ject met the Access: Quality and Ade quacy of Services component but lacked enough specific tie in for the PCPCH and UR elements. As a result, YCCO has pulled this project from the 2022 TQS, while incor porating those Components into other /new proje cts. This pilot work is ongoing and focuse s more on clinic engagement when capitatio n payment arrangements are in place.

YCCO shall submit the evaluation to the Authority, and upon request by the Authority, the Authority's contracted External Quality Review Organization (EQRO). Data Collection and Analysis YCCO maintains ongoing data collection, analysis, and follow up action to meet the goals of Health System Transformation, improving access and quality while reducing the rate per capita costs . YCCO policies and procedures ensure collection of timely data including health disparities and other data required by rule or contract that allows YCCO conduct s and report s on its outcome and quality measures and report s its performance through the governance committee and workgroup structures ongoing . Data from patient eligibility, demographics, claims, grievance and appeals, referral and prior authorization, EHR, case notes and care plans, patient self -report, survey collection, program outcomes , and other data sources are collected and aggregated in the YCCO data warehouse for purposes of central collection and analysis. These data are used to assess the delivery of services and how care can be improved throughout the system in the quality programs stated above. On a quarterly basis, data are collected, analyzed, and reported to OHA per contract requirements. Gaps in service and areas of improvement are identified through root cause analysis and PDSA improvement cycles to ensure minimum standards ar e identified and achieved. Data collected are shared with providers via web- based platforms to support on- going care and quality improvement efforts. Systems Community Integration Manager (CIM), Ayin Health Insights, the Collective Platform (event notif ication and care plan notes) as well as secure file transfer of member level data are mechanisms provider use to improve care and the delivery of services to Members . Quality Program and Performance Monitoring Page 8 of 10 QI-001 Measures YCCO QCAP maintain s accountability for both core and transformational measures of quality and outcomes: 1. Core measures are triple -aim oriented measures that gauge YCCO performance against key expectations for care coordination, consumer satisfaction, quality, and outcomes. T he measures are uniform across CCOs and shall encompass the range of services included in CCO global budgets (e.g., behavioral health, hospital care, women's health) or MHO and DCO contracts. Core measures may be defined as typical standardized medical -centric measures such as eCQMs or HEDIS that have state or national normative statistics.; 2. Transformational metrics shall assess CCO progress toward the broad goals of health system transformation. This subset may include newer kinds of indicators (for which CCOs have less measurement experience) or indicators that entail collaboration with other care partners, such as social service agencies or other community support services. Additional areas of transformational measures may include culturally informed car e, health equity or health- related services not typically associated with medical care. Transformational metrics will also require cooperation from CCOs for pilot or demonstration activities as these newly formed measures are developed over time. Development of different evaluation criteria for acceptance by the metrics selection committees for use by CCOs may also be necessary for transformational metrics. Incentive and Value -based Payment To further the triple aim, value- based payment arrangements drive quality outcomes, improve the care delivery and help to reduce the need for more costly care. YCCO payment models are dependent on the QAPI program, performance improvement initiatives, collection and sharing of data and analysis with providers , and trans parent quality measurement. Monitoring of these contract -based payment programs with providers ensure quality goals are met. Standards of Care YCCO QCAP review s and adopt practice guidelines consistent with 42 CFR 438.236 and the YCCO CCO contract expectations that address: 1. Assigned contractual responsibilities for physical health care, behavioral health care, or oral health care; 2. Goals to increase care coordination with other CCO's, the state, or other providers as outlined in OAR 410- 141-0160 and 410- 141-3860; and 3. Concerns identified by members or their representatives and to implement changes that have a favorable impact on health outcomes and member satisfac tion in consultation with its community advisory council or clinical review panel. COMPLIANCE & OVERSIGHT : YCCO reports on the status and results of each quality improvement plan following the guidance, criteria, format, and timelines as described by OHA and the CCO contract. Additional information is provided based on evaluation results from OHA until the activities are deemed sufficient and compliant with no further action. Quality Program and Performance Monitoring Page 9 of 10 QI-001 External Quality Review In conformance with 42 CFR \u00a7438.350 and 438.358, and 42 CFR \u00a7457.1250, YCCO will cooperate and require all subcontractors and participating providers to cooperate with OHA by providing access to records and facilities, and sufficient information for the purpose of an annual external , independent professional review of CCO compliance with all applicable state and federal rules, the CCO contract with OHA, and of the quality outcomes and timeliness of, and access to, services provided under the CCO contract. Th e annual EQR will be coordinated by the Audit and Compliance Department with participation from all applicable department staff, subcontractors, and partners . YCCO will address and require its subcontractors or delegated entities to address any findings or recommendations identifi ed in EQR reports in a manner designed to correct the deficiency within a timeline acceptable to OHA. Performance Measurement As required by Health System Transformation, YCCO is accountable for performance on outcomes, quality, and efficiency measures incorporated into the CCO contract. In accordance with schedules established for performance measures, YCCO will: 1. Measure and report to OHA its performance, using standard measures required by OHA; and 2. Submit data specified by OHA, that enables OHA t o measure the Contractor's performance Quality Performance Data Reports YCCO shall submit to the Authority the YCCO's annual written evaluation of outcome and quality measures established for YCCO or other reports as the Authority may require in response to the measures adopted by the Metrics and Scoring Committee, including but not limited to output from Electronic Health Records, chart reviews, claim validation reports and other materials required for final assessment of relevant measures and within established deadlines.

Upcoming: more training opportunities to raise awareness about the MDT program (adding to t he PCP trainings, creating new flyers, CHWs sharing information at communit y outreach events ). Renee Mina 7:25 A.M. (15 mins.) Community Health Assessment Stakeholder listening session for CHA is meant to be comprehensive and general, not specific to Medicaid members. Taking feedback from a variety of community groups and committees, with a variety of different backgrounds. Health includes social health and other systems, not just physical health. Community is the Yamhill County services area plus however you think of community (think broadly). How can you tell when your community is healthy? When people feel safe enough to talk to each other. Need safety, inclusivity. People have access to services and opportunities to proactively support their health, rather than tri age health problems (food, exercise, other activities that foster an active lifestyle). C ohesive language between partners/public. Educating people about how their bodies work (healt h literacy). Providers have an opportunity to pr edict/prevent health problems before they happen. Address the issue of why people are wanting to numb themselves (alcohol, drugs, food, other addictions)? What are the needs to create/support a healthy community? Easi er access to mental health, behavioral hea lth therapy. Free exercise/activity program s.

Teach kids how to metabolize stress early in life; c reate trauma-informed environments and cultures of safety that help support the development of resilience. Address systemic inequities regarding access to care. Identify the \"blue zone\" items that help folks live longer and healthier: large-scale access to P arks & Rec is missing between 6 th grade and age 60, activities to socialize and create ar t are more limited for young and middle-aged adults. Reduce social isolation. Build activities, ensure there's something available for everyone. What are the community's strengths? Existing Parks & Rec, the Relief Nursery, food production, CCO's fl exibility to pay for health-related services (strollers, hotel stays after discharge, car seats). The size and geography of Yamhill community keep it separate enough from gr eater metro area that it feels graspable. Survey Questions: What is the community's biggest strength? the gap? A.M. Rights (P) One of YCCO's require ments is to share what the members' rights and responsibilities are. Members have a right to access care in their own language, to be treated fairly and equitably. New focus on SOGI data (sexual orientation and gender identity data) will begin this year. Have been looking at REALD (race ethnicity language and disability), language access trainings. More to come this year as well. List of member rights and responsibilities starts on page 27 o f the handbook that was provided in the meet ing packet and on Govenda. Health Plan Policies are outlined (enrollee rights, grievance and appeals, communications, care coordination, coverage and services, privacy and protection of health information and compliance). Provider expectations also included in the handbook (contract, provider manual, online provider portal). Website also provides access to this information:Jenna MINUTES - Quality & Clinical Advisory P anel (QCAP): February 22, 2022 4 o f 5 https://yamhillcco.org/members/benefits- and-rights/ .

Survey posted in the meeting chat to attest that we have received this information. 7:55 A.M. (15 mins.) TQS (P) Transformation and Qualit y Strategy (started in 2018 as the CCO Transformation Plan and Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement deliverables). TQS is submitted on March 15 th of each year and a mid-year updated is completed internally. New component area added for 2022: Special Health Care Needs (SHCN): Full Benefit Dual Eligible Population Housing: Engage partners to improve the quantity and quality o f housing options (addresses SPMI, SDoH-E). In 2021, assessment of housing inventory was completed, reporting systems developed, and housing-related proposals were reviewed by CAC. Plan for 2022 is to develop a reporting system to share data with YCAP, develop referral systems to engage YCCO members with YCAP, use CHA to identify housing needs, and engage housing partners with CIE. 2021 TQS is posted on the website. CLAS Standards and Equity-based Oversight and Monitoring for D&HH and LEP members: in 2021, ther e was a CME event and Behavioral Health forum, and a Provider Language Assistance Gu ide was developed and piloted with providers. In 2022, the provider-facing langua ge access toolkit will be widely shared, target technical assistance is planned to support provider workflows, and a member-facing language access toolkit will be developed. Integrating and PC PCH-based Dental Provider Activities: C ME and Meet and Greet events reached more than 100 providers over past the two year s. In 2022 the PCPCH will be moved to a separate structure, develop a workflow with Capitol Dental, explore social needs screening opportunities using CIE, offer prov ider education with physical and behavioral health around Capitol Dental appointme nt availability and referral.Tyler MINUTES - Quality & Clinical Advisory P anel (QCAP): February 22, 2022 5 o f 6 Behavioral Health Neighborhood: YCCO shared cohort data with clinics, which used those structures. Model is working, trending downward and member satisfaction increasing. In 2022, clinics expanding their cohort groups, YCCO plans to share data more often and to evaluat e the pilot project (2020-2022) for effi cacy and potential continuation. Infrastructure Development for Tracking Timely Access: In 2021, developed ability to monitor members' time/distance to assigned providers using an ex cel-based dashboard. Enhancing this to a Tableau-based dashboard in 2022 and applying an optimization algorithm to assign members to PCPs closer to their homes and monitor primary care access. About 400 members being re-assigned to closer PCPs PCP Capitation, Assignment Engagement: Retiring TQS in 2022. 2021 membership increased by 28.8%, engagement rates down s lightly (pandemic). Supporting Members w ho experience system barriers: 2021 reviewed the grievance and appeal data to identify target populations, evaluated SOPs, developed Member Barriers Subcommittee and Member FAQ to increase member feedback. In 2022, disseminate the language access toolkits to providers, pilot staff and member training on language access, creat e Member Magazine and a member feedback guide, and monitor member experience of language services. PCPCH Program Improvement (new for 2022): addressing Tier Advancement and member enrollment. Goal is to provide a monthly collaborative for PC clinics, explore interest in PCPCH-spec ific collaboratives, provide 1:1 TA to targe t clinics, provide bi- annual site visits to target clinics, develop APM methodologies that support clinics financially for Tier advancement, auto-assign new members to only PCPCH clinics. SHCN - Supporting the Dual Eligible Population (new for 2022): Goal is enhanced care management and MDT collaboration for members needing Intensive Care Coordination. Planning on collaborating with Providence Medicare Advantage to align PCP assi gnments across pa yers, convene MINUTES - Quality & Clinical Advisory P anel (QCAP): February 22, 2022 6 o f 6 LTSS and MA partners to address system barriers, develop communications materials and disseminate through APD/AAA partners. Utilization Review through MEPP Interventions: in 2021 for SUD, hired 1.5 FTE and developed direct contract with Providence. For Diabetes, worked to expand care management through PPP and tracked success indicators internally. For Behavioral Health, partnered wit h YCHHS and Lutheran Community Services and reviewed claims and staffing to prepare fo r contracting work. For 2022, for SUD, will be working on referral pathway development. For diabetes, will be working on care plan sharing, case manager consults with members and a network asset review. For 2022, the BH element will shift to Hypertension with a care management focus on members with hypert ension and tracking data for efficacy. Will be used for the utilization review component for 2022. Action: Tyler to send out 2021 TQS Recap and 2022 Overview slides to attendees (Shay add to Govenda ) 8:10 A.M. (10 mins.)
