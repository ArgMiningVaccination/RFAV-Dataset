Aromatherapy is a derivative of herbal medicine, which is itself a subset of the biological or nature-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. Aromatherapy has been defined as the therapeutic use of essential oils from plants for the improvement of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Essential oils are volatile liquid substances extracted from aromatic plant material by steam distillation or mechanical expression. Essential oils produced with the aid of chemical solvents are not considered true essential oils because the solvent residues can alter the quality of the essential oils and lead to adulteration of the fragrance or to skin irritation. Essential oils are made up of a large array of chemical components that consist of the metabolites found in various plant materials. The major chemical components of essential oils include monoterpenes, esters, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, phenols, and oxides, which are volatile and may produce characteristic odors. Different types of essential oils contain varying amounts of each of these compounds, which are said to give each essential oil its particular fragrance and therapeutic characteristics. Plant species may have different chemovarieties (variations of subspecies that produce essential oils with different chemical compositions, as a result of genetic variation and growth conditions).[ Synthetic odors are often made up of many of the same compounds that are components of the essential oils. These compounds are synthesized and typically combined with other odor-producing chemicals. However, synthetic fragrances frequently contain irritants, such as solvents and propellants, that can trigger sensitivities in some people.[ Aromatherapy is used or claimed to be useful for a vast array of symptoms and conditions. A book on aromatherapy in children suggests aromatherapy remedies for everything from acne to whooping cough.[ A large body of literature has been published on the effects of odors on the human brain and emotions. Some studies have tested the effects of essential oils on mood, alertness, and mental stress in healthy participants. Other studies investigated the effects of various (usually synthetic) odors on task performance, reaction time, and autonomic parameters or evaluated the direct effects of odors on the brain via electroencephalogram patterns and functional imaging studies.[ Practitioners of aromatherapy apply essential oils using several different methods, including the following: Other direct and indirect applications include mixing essential oils in bath salts and lotions or applying them to dressings. Different aromatherapy practitioners may have different recipes for treating specific conditions, involving various combinations of essential oils and methods of application. Differences seem to be practitioner dependent, with some common uses more accepted throughout the aromatherapy community. Training and certification in aromatherapy for lay practitioners is available at several schools throughout the United States and United Kingdom; however, there is no professional standardization in the United States and no license is required to practice in either country. Thus, there is little consistency among practitioners in the specific treatments used for specific illnesses. This lack of standardization has led to variability in therapeutic protocols used in research on the effects of aromatherapy. Anecdotal evidence alone or previous experience has driven the choice of essential oils and different researchers choose different essential oils when studying the same applications. However, now there are specific courses for licensed health professionals that give nursing or continuing medical education credit hours, including a small research component and information about evaluating and measuring outcomes. The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) (www.naha.org/) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists (www.alliance-aromatherapists.org) are the two governing bodies for national educational standards for aromatherapists. NAHA is taking steps toward standardizing aromatherapy certification in the United States. Many schools offer certificate programs approved by NAHA. A list of these schools can be found on the NAHA website (https://naha.org/index.php/education/approved-schools/). National examinations in aromatherapy are held twice per year. The Canadian Federation of Aromatherapists has established standards for aromatherapy certification in Canada (www.cfacanada.com/). They also have standards for safety and professional conduct and a public directory of certified aromatherapists. Other countries may have similar organizations. Although essential oils are given orally or internally by aromatherapists in France and Germany, their use is generally limited to inhalation or topical application in the United Kingdom and United States. Nonmedical use of essential oils is common in the flavoring and fragrance industries. Most essential oils have been classified as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), at specified concentration limits, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For a list of international aromatherapy programs, see the International Federation of Aromatherapists website (www.ifaroma.org/). Aromatherapy products do not need approval by the FDA. References: Proponents of aromatherapy report that aromatic or essential oils have been used for thousands of years as stimulants or sedatives of the nervous system and as treatments for a wide range of other disorders.[ Although Gattefosse and his colleagues in France, Italy, and Germany studied the effects of aromatherapy for some 30 years, its use went out of fashion midcentury and was rediscovered by another Frenchman, a physician, Jean Valnet, in the latter part of the century. Valnet published his book The Practice of Aromatherapy in 1982,[ Despite the growing popularity of aromatherapy in the latter part of the 20th century (especially in the United Kingdom), little research on aromatherapy was available in the English-language medical literature until the early or mid-1990s. The research that began to appear in the 1990s was most often conducted by nurses, who tended to be the primary practitioners of aromatherapy in the United States and United Kingdom (although it is dispensed by medical doctors in France and Germany). Aromatherapists now publish their own journal, the International Journal of Essential Oil Therapeutics. Also, many studies regarding the effects of odor on the brain and other systems in animals and healthy humans have been published in the context of odor psychology and neurobiology (and in the absence of the specific term aromatherapy). In addition to topical antimicrobial uses,[ Studies on aromatherapy have examined a variety of other conditions, including the following: Published articles have described the use of aromatherapy in specific hospital settings such as cancer wards, hospices, and other areas where patients are critically ill and require palliative care for the following symptoms: In addition, several observational studies provide examples of the clinical uses of aromatherapy (and other CAM modalities), although they are generally not evidence based. Participants have included hospitalized children with HIV,[ Studies of aromatherapy use with mental health patients have also been conducted.[ Theories about the mechanism of action of aromatherapy with essential oils differ, depending on the community studying them. Proponents of aromatherapy often cite the connection between olfaction and the limbic system in the brain as the basis for the effects of aromatherapy on mood and emotions; less is said about proposed mechanisms for its effects on other parts of the body. Most of the aromatherapy literature, however, lacks in-depth neurophysiological studies on the nature of olfaction and its link to the limbic system, and it generally does not cite research that shows these links. Proponents of aromatherapy also believe that the effects of the treatments are based on the special nature of the essential oils used and that essential oils produce effects on the body that are greater than the sum of the individual chemical components of the scents. These assertions have been contested by the biochemistry and psychology communities, which take a different view of the possible mechanism of action of odors on the human brain (most do not differentiate the odors produced by essential oils from those of synthetic fragrances).[ References: Numerous studies on the topical antibacterial effects of essential oils have been published; most have found the essential oils to have significant antimicrobial activity.[ Studies on rats in Europe and Japan have shown that exposure to various odors can result in stimulation or sedation, as well as changes in behavioral responses to stress and pain. A study [ Other studies have investigated the effects of aromatherapy on rats' behavioral and immunological responses to painful, stressful, or startling stimuli. In two European studies, rats exposed to pleasant odors during painful stimuli exhibited decreased pain-related behaviors, with some variation in response between the sexes.[ References: No studies in the published peer-reviewed literature discuss aromatherapy as a treatment for cancer specifically. The studies discussed below, most of which were conducted in patients with cancer, primarily focus on the following: These studies purport to test the efficacy of aromatherapy, implying that the products used contain essential oils; however, only an occasional reference article includes significant descriptive information about the product(s) used (e.g., composition, source) thereby greatly limiting the ability of interested clinicians and researchers to compare or duplicate studies or produce meaningful meta-analyses of the research results. Anxiety and Depression A major review published in 2000 [ Another randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of massage or aromatherapy massage in 103 cancer patients who were randomly assigned to receive massage using a carrier oil (massage group) or massage using a carrier oil plus the Roman chamomile essential oil (Chamaemelum nobile [L.] All. [synonym: Anthemis nobilis L.]) (aromatherapy massage group).[ A study that evaluated an aromatherapy service following changes made after an initial pilot at a U.K. cancer center, also reported on the experiences of patients referred to the service.[ A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial conducted in Australia investigated the effects of inhalation aromatherapy on anxiety during radiation therapy.[ Health-Related Quality of Life A randomized, controlled, pilot study examined the effects of adjunctive aromatherapy massage on mood, QOL, and physical symptoms in patients with cancer.[ Sleep A placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, randomized trial compared an essential oil (choice of lavender, peppermint, or chamomile) with a pleasant-smelling placebo (rose water) administered by diffuser overnight for 3 weeks in 50 adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia who were hospitalized for administration of intensive chemotherapy.[ Another randomized controlled trial examined the effects of aromatherapy massage and massage alone in 42 patients with advanced cancer over a 4-week period.[ No significant long-term benefits of aromatherapy or massage in pain control, QOL, or anxiety were reported, but sleep scores (as measured by the Verran and Snyder-Halpern sleep scale) improved significantly in both groups. A statistically significant reduction in depression scores was also reported (as measured by the HADS) in the massage-only group. A randomized controlled trial of lavender, tea tree oil, or no-treatment control in adult patients who received outpatient chemotherapy with paclitaxel reported that trait anxiety and sleep quality improved with lavender, and that tea tree oil led to the highest change in sleep quality. However, changes in anxiety were observed only on the trait anxiety scores, not on the state anxiety scores, which may reflect short term changes associated with an aromatherapy intervention. In addition, there were no significant differences in sleep scores between the two aromatherapy groups and the controls, which the study was designed to detect.[ Xerostomia Radioactive iodine damage to normal salivary glands may be minimized by increased saliva production during the period of treatment. Inhalation aromatherapy was evaluated for its ability to increase saliva production during this administration period. An aromatherapy intervention consisting of a 2:1 mixture of lemon and ginger essential oils versus a distilled water (no smell) control inhaled for 10 min/d during a 2-week hospitalization for administration of radioactive iodine therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer was investigated in a randomized controlled trial of 71 patients. Salivary gland function was assessed by scintigraphy. Compared with placebo, those in the aromatherapy group showed a significantly higher rate of change of the maximum accumulation ratio in the parotid and submandibular glands (P < .05) and a significantly increased rate of change of the washout ratio before and after therapy in the bilateral parotid glands (P < .05). Although an increasing trend was observed for the submandibular glands in subjects receiving aromatherapy, no significant differences were noted between the groups.[ Nausea and vomiting A randomized, controlled, crossover trial investigated the effects of inhaled ginger essential oil on alleviating chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting in Asian women with breast cancer.[ In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial of bergamot inhalation aromatherapy compared with a pleasant-smelling shampoo that did not contain essential oils administered at the time of stem cell infusion in 37 children and adolescents undergoing stem cell transplant, aromatherapy was not found to be beneficial in reducing nausea, anxiety, or pain.[ A similar study evaluated the efficacy of an aromatherapy intervention for reduction of symptom intensity of nausea, retching, and/or coughing among adult patients who received stem cells preserved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The study found that an intervention of tasting or sniffing sliced oranges was more effective at reducing symptom intensity compared with orange essential oil inhalation aromatherapy.[ Procedure-Related Symptoms In a randomized placebo-controlled study of two different types of external aromatherapy tabs (lavender-sandalwood and orange-peppermint) compared with a matched placebo-controlled delivery system in 87 women undergoing breast biopsies, there was a statistically significant reduction in self-reported anxiety with the use of the lavender-sandalwood aromatherapy tab compared with the placebo group (P = .032).[ In a three-arm randomized trial of 123 patients that compared lavender, eucalyptus, and no essential oil administered via inhalation, procedural pain after needle insertion into an implantable central venous port catheter was significantly decreased in the lavender oil inhalation aromatherapy group compared with the control group. Inhalation of eucalyptus oil did not reduce procedural pain levels during needle insertion.[ A four-arm randomized trial compared aromatherapy, music therapy, a combination of the two, and a placebo in breast cancer patients before and after a mastectomy. The aromatherapy arm utilized a mixture of lavender, bergamot, and geranium essential oils, while the music arm offered a choice of music styles. Measured endpoints included pain intensity and anxiety. The combination of treatments was superior to either single treatment with all endpoints.[ |Reference||Trial Design||Essential Oil/Route of |QOL = life.| |a Patients with malignant brain tumors.| |b For information about levels of evidence analysis and scores, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary oils), 100 (carrier oil with fractionated low-grade essential oils), 100 (carrier oil only, nofragrance)||Anxiety||Unknown||Primaryoutcome: no effect on anxiety; secondary outcome: reduction in anxiety and in physical and psychological symptoms; improved QOL||1iiC| Type||Concurrent Therapy Used||Results||Level of Evidence Scored| |EORTC QLQ-C30 = European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire; HRQOL = health-related quality of |c Patients with breast cancer undergoingbone marrow transplantation.| |d For information about levels of evidence analysis and scores, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary drowsiness, pain, nausea, appetite, depression, anxiety, well-being||Unknown||Primary outcome: improvements in tiredness, drowsiness, lack of double-blind trial||Bergamot/inhalation||37; undergoing stem cell transplant||Unknown||Primary outcomes: increased anxiety and nausea in children 1 hour after stem cell infusion in aromatherapy group; no effect on pain; secondary outcome: parental anxiety declined compared with control group, the rate of change of the accumulation rate (marker of saliva production) was significantly higher in the parotid glands and submandibular glands outcome: improved sleep in both groups; reduced depression (in massage group); no effect on QOL||1iiC| |[ ||Randomized controlled trial||Lavender, tea tree, or no oil/inhalation||70; (lavender), 20 (tea tree); 20||Anxiety and sleep quality||Unknown||Primary outcomes: no improvement in state anxiety scores; no differences in changes in sleep quality between groups; secondary outcome: lower trait anxiety scores and higher sleep-quality lavender reduction in episodes; secondary outcome: improved HRQOL||1C| |[ intensity (nausea,retching, cough)||Yes||Primary outcome: greatest reduction in (massage), and vomiting||Yes||Primary improvements in mood in both groups (aromatherapy massage andcognitive behavioral therapy); secondary outcome: preference for aromatherapy over cognitive behavioral therapy||1C| |[ ||Randomized single-blind trial||Choice of bitter orange, black pepper, 15 (aromatherapy massage), 15 (plain completed||3iiC| |Reference||Trial Design||Essential Oil/Route or Cancer Type||Concurrent Therapy Used||Results||Level of Evidence Scorea| |a For information about levels of evidence analysis and scores, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.| |[ ||Randomized (orange); 27||Anxiety||Unknown||Primary outcome: reduction in anxiety with the use tab||1iiC| |[ ||Quasi-randomized group||1iiC| |[ ||Randomized controlled trial||Lavender, bergamot, geranium/inhalation||160; 40 (essential oil), 40 (music), 40 (combination), 40 (usual care)||Breast cancer; mastectomy pain and anxiety||Yes||Combination of music and aromatherapy superior to individual treatments||1iiC| Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

References: Safety testing on essential oils has shown minimal adverse effects. Several essential oils have been approved for use as food additives and are classified as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; however, ingestion of large amounts of essential oils is not recommended. In addition, a few cases of contact dermatitis have been reported, mostly in aromatherapists who have had prolonged skin contact with essential oils in the context of aromatherapy massage.[ References: To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for people with cancer, the strength of the evidence (i.e., the levels of evidence) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever possible. To qualify for a level of evidence analysis, a study must: Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., endpoints) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score, with a score of 1 being the strongest evidence and a score of 4 being the weakest design (or sometime similar).
