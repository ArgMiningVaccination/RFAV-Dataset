Highly contagious, frequently fatal, and often very disfiguring of thosewho survived, it has been feared for centuries. By the early twentieth cen- tury because of widespread vaccination and other measures, the disease was largely absent from North America and Europe. But as recently as the 1960sthe disease remained endemic in much of Africa and Asia. From around 1967 the World Health Organization coordinated a massive international campaign aimed at the global eradication of smallpox. The strategy involvedthe containment of outbreaks by isolating the affected area and the patients and then tracing and vaccinating all possible contacts and others at risk of contracting the disease. The campaign proved remarkably successful. Thelast naturally occurring case of smallpox happened in Somalia in 1977. In 1980 WHO declared that smallpox was finally eradicated from the world\u2014 a success that inspired thoughts of eliminating other diseases. It is, however, an unfortunate fact that our interest in smallpox today cannot be merely historical. There has been a recent debate as to whether or not the two remaining official stocks of the smallpox virus\u2014held at theRussian State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk, and at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention in Atlanta, Georgia\u2014should be destroyed. There is concern too thatsecret stocks of the virus may exist somewhere and could be released delib- erately, either by a rogue nation state or by terrorists. It is also conceivable that live smallpox virus could emerge from a corpse which has been pre-served in permafrost. Hence a recent editorial in The Lancet concludes that the threat of this disease still persists. 1 Moreover, humanity today is largely unprotected, because vaccination has not been practiced for two decades;and current global supplies of the vaccine are low and might take several Click to print article 650 SMALLPOX IN NINETEENTH -CENTURY INDIA Click to return to Table of Contentsyears to replenish. The editorial finishes with the sobering observation that declaring a disease eradicated does not consign it to history. With this as background the present article aims to shed light on an important, but not well-documented part of the story of smallpox\u2014namelythe history of the disease in India during the nineteenth century. It is some- times suggested that demographic data on causes of death do not exist for India before about 1880, when publication of the Annual Report of the Sani- tary Commissioner starts providing information on registered births and deaths. 2 Moreover, because during the nineteenth century deaths were rarely classified by both the age of the deceased and the cause, scholars have tendedto assume that little worthwhile cause-specific analysis of early Indian mor- tality patterns can be attempted. 3 Such constraints have resulted in there being few adequate demo- graphic studies of mortality patterns in British India during the nineteenth century. For example, while David Arnold's influential essays on cholera, smallpox, and plague examine colonial health policy and its political andcultural context, they do not examine the demographic impact of such dis- eases. 4 Similarly, studies by Ira Klein and Sumit Guha have tried to explain why Indian mortality began to improve from around 1921, but they largelyneglect the issue of mortality dynamics during the nineteenth century. 5 Like- wise, an early study of smallpox by S. P. James was confined to the late nineteenth century.6 In his classic 1951 book The Population of India and Pakistan , Kingsley Davis assessed the consequences of smallpox, cholera, plague, and malaria. His view too was that the available death registration data were not suit-able for demographic analysis. Interestingly, he speculates that \"[i]n nine- teenth century India, this disease [i.e., smallpox] must have carried away huge numbers.\" 7 Again, nevertheless, Davis's book deals mostly with the twentieth century and is chiefly focused on the national level. Another study by Dyson used vital registration data for the province of Berar in central India to estimate long-term trends in fertility and mortality over the period1881-1980. Touching upon the relative importance of different diseases in the late nineteenth century, Dyson remarks that smallpox appears to be fairly un- important\u2014on average accounting for between one and 3 percent of deaths. 8 The result of this inattention to nineteenth-century circumstances and data has been that the history of Indian morbidity and mortality has often been characterized in terms of the decline of a few particular diseases dur-ing the twentieth century\u2014notably malaria, plague, and cholera. Of course, there are constraints in studying trends in malaria mortality because the disease was usually not classified as a separate cause of death. Plague be-came a problem only after its probable reintroduction to India in 1896 and was largely controlled by the 1920s. This leaves cholera for longitudinal demographic study, but most studies of cholera have focused on aspects ofJAYANT BANTHIA / T IM DYSON 651 Click to return to Table of Contentshealth policy. So despite the fact that the population of India suffered from several epidemic diseases in the nineteenth century, virtually no long-term demographic studies of cause-specific mortality pertain to that period. The present study of smallpox in nineteenth-century India is a step toward filling this gap. We assemble authoritative data on the disease's case fatality and its prevalence and thereby assess the chances of dying from smallpox. We also quantify changes in the importance of smallpox mortal-ity during the nineteenth century. In doing so we use some substantial (though neglected) historical data sources, including annual provincial vi- tal registration reports. We explore variations in smallpox trends within In-dia, both at the provincial level and among the presidency towns, in an effort to account for differences in observed smallpox mortality patterns. Above all, through two case studies we examine the role of a specific medi-cal intervention\u2014vaccination\u2014in greatly reducing the number of smallpox deaths during the nineteenth century. Finally, our study underscores the sci- entific value of the various historical demographic data sets that exist for India. Smallpox case fatality We begin with the approximate case fatality rate for smallpox. The number of deaths from any disease depends upon that disease's case fatality rate (CFR) and its prevalence. The CFR is the ratio of the number of deaths froma disease to the total number of people contracting it; in other words, the proportion of people affected by the disease who die from it. Several prob- lems are involved in determining a single case fatality rate for smallpox innineteenth-century India. First, few people who were suffering from the disease were hospitalized in the small number of existing hospitals; this was partly because no cure for smallpox existed, and partly because most casesoccurred in young children. Second, the protective status of India's popula- tion changed over time (notably, as vaccination progressed during the nine- teenth century) and this status also varied from place to place. 9 Finally, the CFR for smallpox may vary according to other factors, such as the age of the afflicted person, the specific type of smallpox virus, the clinical small- pox-type, and, of course, whether people have been vaccinated, revacci-nated, or inoculated. 10 Inoculation (mentioned in relation to Bengal below) was the practice of injecting dried smallpox scabs from a previously infected person with the aim of providing immunity by causing a mild form of thedisease. In contrast, vaccination began with Edward Jenner's demonstra- tion in 1796 that deliberate infection with vaccinia (cowpox) was an effec- tive and safe prophylactic against smallpox. All these facts must be borne inmind when interpreting smallpox fatality rates. Table 1 presents case fatality rates found for the Indian subcontinent during the nineteenth century. They vary between 20 and 50 percent. (Stan-652 SMALLPOX IN NINETEENTH -CENTURY INDIA Click to return to Table of Contentsdard medical texts suggest a case fatality rate for smallpox of around 25-30 percent.11) The data for Ceylon, the earliest in this series, are based on hos- pital records relating to an unprotected population. The data for Calcutta and Madras are also based on hospital records for unvaccinated persons.Although the Madras data pertain to a period of severe famine, the indi- cated level of smallpox case fatality from the famine hospital records is not particularly high. Non-hospital-based (i.e., survey) records for unvaccinatedrural people are available for Moradabad and Gujarat. Although variations in recording no doubt existed, the data shown in Table 1 can be considered fairly reliable, being based on observations made by Civil Surgeons (in hos-pitals) and Superintendents of Vaccination during their rural inspections. CFRs could fluctuate considerably between districts and at different times of the year, reflecting fluctuations in the severity of the disease. Thus, ob-servations on the virulence of smallpox in the Malabar region of Madras Presidency invariably described it as particularly fatal. Overall, the data in Table 1 suggest that smallpox CFRs in nineteenth-century India were highand broadly similar to those cited in standard medical texts. In fact, in some circumstances the upper boundary clearly exceeded 30 percent. This is indicated, for example, by a long time-series from theSmallpox and Infectious Disease Hospital in the City of Bombay during the twentieth century (see Table 2). The CFRs recorded for unvaccinated people were quite stable, ranging between 35 and 40 percent. 12 The CFRs for people who at some time had been vaccinated (but probably not revaccinated) were TABLE 1 Number of smallpox cases and number of deaths from smallpox based on reports by Civil Surgeons and Superintendents of Vaccination in the nineteenth century in Ceylon and various parts of India Deaths Smallpox Smallpox from fatality rate Place/location Year(s) cases smallpox (percent) Remarks Ceylon 1800-02 2,110 records, unvaccinatedMadras 1877-78 21.4 Hospital records, during famine Gujarat 1884 1,783 352 19.7 Rural population, unvaccinated NOTE: The data for Moradabad, Mangalore, Malabar, and Gujarat come from surveys taken during epidemics.

Comment is required on the representativeness of hospital CFRs\u2014such as those in Tables 1 and 2\u2014for smallpox case fatality among the general population. It is conceivable that hospital data may overesti-mate case fatality in the general population; for example, clinically less se- vere cases could have been underrepresented among patients. On the other hand, CFRs were probably highest for unvaccinated infants and very youngchildren, an age group that was less likely to be hospitalized and is there- fore underrepresented in hospital data. Also, it is known that clinically the highest fatality rates occurred among smallpox cases of the hemorrhagictype, which actually tends to mask the characteristic pustular symptoms of the disease. 13 Therefore, again, hospital admissions of patients\u2014which were based on external symptoms\u2014may have understated case fatality for thegeneral population. Finally, it has been claimed that CFRs for unprotected populations in eighteenth-century Europe ranged between 10 and 20 per- cent. 14 Clearly case fatality in India was higher. One explanation for this difference may be that in India only the more virulent variety of the dis- ease, variola major, was reported. Variola minor, which had a CFR of one percent or less, was not found in the Indian subcontinent. Therefore it isquite possible that the lower CFRs observed for European populations partly reflect the presence of variola minor. Smallpox prevalence Although lacking statistical precision, many descriptions made by early medi- cal officers convey how widespread and destructive smallpox was in nine-TABLE 2 Case fatality rates among smallpox patients admitted to the Smallpox and Infectious Disease Hospital, Arthur Road, Bombay 1905-44 Vaccinated patients Unvaccinated patients Fatality Fatality rate rate Years Admissions Deaths (percent) Admissions Deaths (percent) 1905-09 1,385 222 16.0 914 374 40.9 1910-14 1,341 225 329 4,667 37.2 PRINCIPAL SOURCE: Annual Administration Report of the Municipal Commissioner of Bombay, 1905-44.654 SMALLPOX IN NINETEENTH -CENTURY INDIA Click to return to Table of Contentsteenth-century India. Thus J. Moore, the Civil Surgeon of Joudpoor, stated in 1866 that: Smallpox, I believe, numbers more victims in Marwar, than any other dis- ease. . . . [R]oughly speaking, from the calculations based on counting when passing through the streets of Joudpoor and Palee, ten percent of the popula- tion appear to have totally lost sight of one or both eyes, or to have receivedgreater or less permanent injury to organs. Of these afflictions the great ma-jority may be traced to smallpox. From similar observations it would appeareighty percent are pitted by the disease. 15 In another example, J. Pringle, the Superintendent of Vaccination for the North-Western Provinces, wrote in 1869 that: \"In the Doab region lying between the Ganges and the Jumna rivers, with a population of upwards of 9,000,000 . . . 95% of the population have been attacked with smallpox atsome period of their lives and that in 60% the traces of the disease are seen on the face.\" 16 We now assess the credibility of these observations. Because hospital records provide little information on the proportion of the total population that contracted the disease, we must look elsewhere for information on prevalence. Surveys of pockmarks among various population groups are animportant source of such information. The statistics in Table 3 relate to surveys of prison populations. The data are based on the results of physical inspections and similar inquiriesmade by Civil Surgeons during the period 1848-72 in most regions of In- dia. Those in jail were mainly male adults, who thus obviously represent survivors from previous exposures to smallpox. Although data on the agedistribution of these prisoners are unavailable, we may reasonably assume that in most cases their average age was above 20 years. So the data reflect the disease experience of prisoners who were very young children duringthe early and mid-nineteenth century. In interpreting Table 3 it must be borne in mind that the prevailing protection-status of different regional populations in India strongly condi-tioned the chances of contracting smallpox. In particular, the practice of inoculation was common in Bengal, where over 85 percent of people were inoculated (as suggested by figures for Chittagong, Ramganj Balueah, andDacca in Table 3). As a result, fewer than 10 percent of prisoners in the districts of Bengal showed any sign of having contracted smallpox. Also, in Benares in eastern United Province, where inoculation and vaccination to-gether covered roughly half the total population, only 46 percent of prison- ers showed signs of the disease. In most of northern and central India, however, smallpox was widely prevalent, with over 90 percent of jail populations showing signs of havingJAYANT BANTHIA / T IM DYSON 655 Click to return to Table of ContentsTABLE 3 Estimates of smallpox prevalence, and protection status, among imprisoned populations and students in different parts of India in the mid- nineteenth century Persons Had Location Year(s) examined smallpox Inoculated Vaccinated Unprotected Remarks Chittagong 1848 1,000 91 871 2 36 Jail (9.1) (87.3) population Ramganj 1850 730 50 632 1 47 Jail Balueah (6.8) (86.6) population Dacca 1850 785 29 729 0 27 Jail (3.7) (92.3) population North-Western 1861-72 268 ,445 228,964 4,223 2,553 12,215 (1.5) (1) (4.5) population Lahore 1864 1,930 1,818 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Jail (94.2) population Amritsar 1864 548 537 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Jail (98) population Ambala 1864 598 520 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Jail (87) population Nagpur 1862-63 1,309 1,195 \u2014 \u2014 1,811 Students (43) (41) (16) Benares 1869 900 414 162 0 324 Jail (46) (18) (36) population Oudh 1869 1,095 997 10 0 88 Jail (91.8) (1) (8) population NOTES: Figures in parentheses are the percentages in each category.

Indeed, the wide prevalence indicated for NWP can be taken as broadly typical of what must have been experiencedby unprotected populations elsewhere in India. 17 The observations from Madras Presidency in the south covering 17 districts are also noteworthy. Based upon examinations of a younger population, namely students, theyreflect a high prevalence of smallpox in the recent past. 18 In conclusion, in656 SMALLPOX IN NINETEENTH -CENTURY INDIA Click to return to Table of ContentsTable 3 regional variations in smallpox experience are discernible, reflect- ing different levels of population protection. It is also clear that in the ab- sence of protection through inoculation or vaccination, the vast majority of people contracted smallpox. Further evidence providing a rare cross-sectional view of smallpox prevalence during the early and mid-nineteenth century comes from the Census of Bombay City conducted in 1872. As part of this inquiry all in-habitants were categorized according to whether they had ever been vacci- nated or had experienced smallpox. At this time the population of the town was growing as a result of in-migration from the countryside. Therefore tosome extent the census data can be taken to reflect the prevalence of small- pox and vaccination in the wider Presidency.

Of the 16 percent who were reported as unvaccinated, one can assume that many had not yet been exposed to smallpox becausethey were still very young. Because they are cross-classified by age, the data in Table 4 can be subjected to \"backward time-referencing,\" so giving an indication of trendsearlier in the nineteenth century. Thus children classified as currently aged less than one year (i.e., on 21 February 1872) must have been born on or after 22 February 1871. Following this procedure the implied years of birthare given in the second column of Table 4. As one goes back in time, the proportion of the population protected by vaccination declines, slowly at first, and then rapidly as we approach the beginning of the nineteenth cen-tury. This suggests a gradual progress of vaccination spread over a long pe- riod. More importantly, the proportion of the population recorded as hav- ing experienced smallpox rises slowly in the recent past, and then rapidlyas we approach the start of the nineteenth century. For example, among those born during 1860-65 (corresponding to current age 6-12 years) 36 percent were vaccinated and 45 percent had experienced smallpox. 19 In con- FFFFFFFF FF F F F FB birthFIGURE 1 Smallpox experience and vaccination status of the population by implied year of birth and sex, Bombay City 1872 DATA SOURCE: Census of Bombay City 1872, Bombay.Had smallpox females males Vaccinatedmales females658 SMALLPOX IN NINETEENTH -CENTURY INDIA Click to return to Table of Contentstrast, among those born during 1802-11, 16 percent were vaccinated and 72 percent had suffered from smallpox. These long-run trends of rising vac- cination coverage and declining experience of smallpox are shown in Fig- ure 1. Males were slightly more likely to be vaccinated and slightly less likelyto have suffered from smallpox. The sex differentials in smallpox preva- lence (and thereby mortality) appear to have been influenced primarily by differences in the vaccination rate. The disease itself was not sex selective. These data from the 1872 Census of Bombay City provide strong sta- tistical evidence of a close link between increasing coverage of vaccination and the decline in smallpox. They also enable us to state with confidencethat smallpox was widely prevalent during the early nineteenth century and that it must have been a significant cause of death\u2014especially among children\u2014before the introduction of vaccination. In this context the progressof primary vaccination during the nineteenth century for Bombay Presi- dency is shown in Figure 2. Progress until the 1850s was clearly slow. Only in the second half of the century was a consistently high proportion of thePresidency's population vaccinated against smallpox. The decline in vacci- nations at the end of the century was temporary, reflecting the influence of plague in the city as people fled and health staff were diverted to plague-control efforts. 1805 1815 1825 1835 1845 1855 1865 1875 18950100200300400500600700800900Thousands YearFIGURE 2 of primary smallpox vaccinations, Bombay Presidency 1805-1900 NOTE: For years before 1850 annual data on primary vaccinations are sometimes unavailable.

We have already seen from Table 3 that inoculation was reasonably effective in protecting againstsmallpox. The question thus arises, what proportion of India's population enjoyed some form of protection against smallpox at the start of the nine- teenth century? To begin, how prevalent was the practice of inoculation in India prior to vaccination? In this context other work by the first author has shown that inoculation was largely restricted to Bengal Presidency, with isolatedpockets of the practice also occurring in northern and western India. 20 For simplicity in the following calculations we used population totals from the 1872 census (when India's population was 206 million), on the rough butreasonable assumption that the population distribution between the vari- ous provinces was broadly the same then as at the start of the nineteenth century. At the beginning of the century inoculation coverage is estimatedto be around 80 percent in Bengal Province (population, 34 million), while it was about 50 percent in Bihar and Orissa (combined population, 26 mil- lion). These figures give a total of about 40 million people protected throughinoculation. Granting another 3 million people inoculated in other parts of the country, we conclude that very roughly 21 percent of India's total popu- lation had access to this form of protection against smallpox around 1802. Thus it is reasonable to conclude that at the start of the nineteenth century about 80 percent of India's population was likely to contract small- pox. Universality of the disease for the unprotected, its high case fatality,and its wide geographical spread all resulted in smallpox being a major cause of death in most of India during the early nineteenth century and before. Regional patterns of smallpox mortality Systematic registration of deaths and births in India began in the 1860s. Although the vital registration system lay in the realm of the Medical De- partment, headed by the provincial Sanitary Commissioners, these officers had little control over the district- and village-level administrative appara-tus that was used to collect data on deaths and births. The village officer usually charged with recording deaths (the village watchman, or kotwal ) was an integral part of the Revenue Department that was headed by theDistrict Collector (Deputy Commissioner). The degree of interest taken by a District Collector and his subordinate officers influenced the quality, cover- age, timely reporting, and inspection of the vital statistics in a district. Thesefactors varied considerably over time and between districts and provinces.660 SMALLPOX IN NINETEENTH -CENTURY INDIA Click to return to Table of ContentsInitially many Indians viewed the recording of vital events\u2014deaths and births\u2014with suspicion.21 Underregistration was a recurring problem. In many cases the village watchmen were barely literate. Accordingly, it was decided that only basic information (e.g., the age and sex of the de-ceased) and relatively identifiable disease categories (smallpox, cholera, fe- vers, bowel diseases, and accidents) were to be recorded by the registration system. 22 However, there is no doubt that the vital data still suffered from underregistration (for a variety of reasons) and from misrepresentation and misclassification of both the cause and age at death. It is difficult to assess how these sources of error may have influenced collection and interpretation of smallpox mortality data. There were spe- cific sources of underreporting for smallpox deaths. For example, infant and child deaths were especially underregistered and most smallpox deaths tookplace among infants and children. 23 In certain communities efforts were made to conceal an outbreak of the disease by people opposed to the British prac- tice of vaccination. On the other hand, at least the diagnosis and classifica-tion of smallpox deaths were aided by a number of factors. Superinten- dents and Inspectors of Vaccination were especially interested in identifying smallpox deaths in order to ascertain the vaccination status of the deceased.This helped them both to assess the quantity and quality of vaccination and to persuade the general population of its efficacy. Also the public in general was familiar with the disease; and the onset of fever followed by the ap-pearance of the characteristic red rashes on the body left little doubt about its presence. Furthermore, smallpox was deified. When it afflicted a family member, few would risk offending the smallpox goddess, Shitala, by failingto worship her\u2014so making the presence of the disease known in the com- munity. In addition, smallpox had a markedly seasonal distribution, with about three-quarters of all deaths occurring between February and June(see below). Finally, it was mainly a disease of early childhood, although deaths to older people were not unknown. For these reasons we can prob- ably have considerable confidence in the classification of smallpox deaths. It was only from 1870 that all provinces were included in the regis- tered smallpox death total published for British India. Table 5 and Figure 3 summarize the data for the last 35 years of the nineteenth century. 24 Over 4 million smallpox deaths were recorded during this period, giving an aver- age of just over 100,000 registered deaths per year. This average masks great fluctuations, however. Thus in 1884 a total of 327,774 smallpox deaths wereregistered, whereas in 1894 the number was only 37,575. Also noteworthy is the steep decline in the average number of deaths from smallpox that took place roughly around the mid-1880s. Thus whereas in 1875-79 anaverage of 175,000 deaths were registered annually, by 1885-89 the num- ber had fallen to 78,000. By the end of the century registered smallpox deaths in the country had stabilized at a much lower level.Click to return to Table of ContentsTABLE 5 Average annual registered smallpox deaths 1865-99 in British India and its major provinces by period British United Central Period India Bengal Provinces Punjab Provinces concision, provincial maximum and minimum numbers of smallpox deaths (shown in parentheses) have been rounded to the nearest thousand.

And Figure 4 plots five-year moving average curves (to assist interpretation) for three of these\u2014Bengal, United Provinces (UP), and Madras. It is striking that Ben-gal, which had the largest population, did not even record 25,000 smallpox deaths in any year during this period. So smallpox was a minor cause of death in this province. In contrast in UP, Central Provinces (CP), and Punjab smallpox was initially a major cause of death, although it declined sharply in importance by the end of the century. In CP the range of annual registered smallpoxdeaths varied from a high of 25,492 (in 1879) to a low of 874 deaths (in 1891). Similarly in Punjab the peak year was 1865, when 66,221 smallpox deaths were recorded, and the minimum was in 1891, when the figure was4,085. The sharpest declines were observed for UP, where in 1884 a total of 202,541 smallpox deaths were registered compared to only 1,968 in 1895. In six years within the period 1865-84 UP registered more than 100,000smallpox deaths, but during 1885-99 this figure was not recorded once. Clearly, during the last two decades of the nineteenth century smallpox was declining in all these provinces. Of the remaining two major provinces, Bombay registered a compara- tively small number of smallpox deaths throughout the 35 years, with, again, of smallpox five-year moving average, Bengal, United Provinces, and Madras 1867-99 United Provinces Madras Bengal PRINCIPAL DATA SOURCES: Annual Report of the Sanitary Commissioner , Bengal, United Provinces, and Madras, various years.JAYANT BANTHIA / T IM DYSON 663 Click to return to Table of Contentsa significant decline from around the 1880s. Madras registered a far higher annual number of deaths, although there was substantial fluctuation; for example, in 1877 and 1884 respective totals of 88,321 and 64,247 smallpox deaths were registered, whereas in 1895 and 1896 the figures were only5,111 and 9,410. Madras too shows some indication of reduced smallpox mortality by 1895-99. Thus at least three distinct types of trend in registered smallpox deaths are discernible at the regional level and illustrated in Figure 4: first Bengal, where the number of deaths was low throughout the period 1870-99; sec- ond UP, which recorded a large number of deaths at the beginning of theperiod 1865-99, followed by a sharp decline by the end; third Madras, which experienced a stable and moderately high number of smallpox deaths throughout most of the period. To emphasize these points, Figure 5 plots the registered annual small- pox death rates for Bengal, UP, and Madras. Bengal exhibited a low small- pox death rate at the start of the period of death registration, and the rateremained low throughout the 30 years shown. UP experienced a high and violently fluctuating death rate until around the 1880s, after which a sharp decline occurred. Madras experienced a more moderate smallpox death ratethroughout the period, with occasional peaks.

In northern and central India, however, it was important until the 1880s, after which a significant decline set in. Finally, in the southern presidency of Madras, small-pox remained a moderately important cause of death even in the last dec- ade of the century. Therefore any study of mortality decline in India that begins in the twentieth century (or even the late nineteenth) would fail tocapture the widespread devastation caused by smallpox earlier on. To get a better idea of smallpox mortality during the early and mid-nineteenth cen- tury, we now examine data for the major towns. Evidence from the presidency towns The earliest data on smallpox mortality in India are for Calcutta in 1832. The Superintendent of Police in the city kept a record of deaths from the early nineteenth century.25 Later records of deaths in Calcutta were com- piled by the Municipal Corporation. In 1848 in Bombay a systematic effort by Dr. A. H. Leith, modeled on the English civil registration system, began to record deaths by cause, age, sex, and race.26 Then in 1865 the Bombay Municipal Corporation appointed an officer to report on the city's health and take responsibility for, and improve, the death registration system. Fi- nally, Madras introduced registration of deaths in 1855, modeled on theBombay system. 27 Thus records of urban smallpox mortality from three re- gions of India are available from the mid-nineteenth century or before (see Table 6). In Calcutta during 1832-69 (excepting 1851-55) smallpox accounted for roughly 5 to 10 percent of deaths. In Bombay during 1848-79 the range was fairly steady at about 4 to 6 percent. In Madras during 1855-84 therange was between 3 and 11 percent. Very broadly, then, smallpox usually accounted for between 5 and 10 percent of total mortality in these presi- dency towns, before sharp declines set in at various times. We conclude that smallpox remained an important cause of death in these towns, even though vaccination was introduced into each of them in 1802 and significant efforts subsequently were made to protect their gen-eral populations. 28 It seems inevitable to conclude therefore that smallpox must have been an even more important cause of death in urban popula- tions that were totally unprotected. Figure 6 plots smallpox death rates for Calcutta and Bombay.29 The landmark epidemic years of 1865 in Calcutta and 1876 in Bombay (1884 in the case of Madras) led to remarkable changes in government policies andpublic attitudes toward vaccination. In Calcutta inoculation\u2014long popular in Bengal\u2014was alleged to have retarded the progress of vaccination and was judged to be responsible for smallpox outbreaks in the city. 30 So afterJAYANT BANTHIA / T IM DYSON 665 Click to return to Table of Contentsmany years of dither, in 1865 the Government of Bengal prohibited inocu- lation in and around Calcutta.31 At the same time it promoted vaccination by sanctioning more vaccinators and their supervisors. The results are re- flected in the decline of smallpox after 1865: death rates were reduced, the disease accounted for a much lower proportion of deaths, and epidemicsbecame less frequent. Similarly in Bombay and Madras the epidemics of 1876 and 1884 forced the respective provincial governments to introduce Compulsory Vaccina-tion Acts. 32 This legislation resulted in greater vaccination coverage and it also meant that vaccinations subsequently occurred at younger ages, be- cause parents now had to vaccinate their children before their first birth-day. For Bombay Figure 6 shows that during 1848-76 smallpox epidemics occurred every three or four years; however, after the Act of 1877 death rates from the disease declined (though not as sharply as in Calcutta) andthe interval between epidemics increased. Table 7 shows changes in the proportions of vaccinations occurring before age one, for periods prior to and after the introduction of the Acts inBombay (in 1877) and Madras (1884). In the city of Bombay following the legislation, three-quarters of primary (i.e., first) vaccinations were performed by age one. In Madras the shift was greater, rising from 18-28 percent dur-TABLE 6 Number of deaths attributed to smallpox as a percent of the total number of deaths by period, Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras 1832-99 Calcutta Bombay Madras .7 / 0 0.4 PRINCIPAL SOURCES: For Calcutta, Report of the Health Officer, Calcutta Corporation 1895 and 1928; \"Vital statistics of Calcutta,\" Journal of the Royal Statistical Society of London, 1850, p. 176; H.

This increase in infant vaccinations had both an immediate and a long-term effect on the decline of smallpox.No doubt the resulting increase in the overall level of coverage played a beneficial role, but the compulsory vaccination of infants reinforced the ef- fect by decisively reducing the numbers of susceptible infants and children.We conclude that a shift in government and public attitudes toward vacci- nation was the primary reason for the decline in smallpox before the end of the nineteenth century in the presidency towns. Modeling smallpox mortality Using the evidence provided above on case fatality and prevalence, we canestimate the proportion of total deaths attributable to smallpox under vari- ous assumptions and in populations that were either totally or partially un- protected. The following simple calculations are only broadly illustrative,because the situation and data do not merit a more refined treatment. We have already seen that case fatality rates in India were very high and that experience of the disease among unprotected populations was nearly uni-versal. In what follows we make no assumptions regarding age at primary vaccination, the quality of the vaccination process, or the eventual decline in immunity following vaccination. Moreover, we assume no revaccination.Finally, we treat the smallpox experience of a birth cohort under various assumptions as to the prevailing level of early-age mortality. Average in- fant mortality rates in India during the late nineteenth century have beenestimated at around 250 per 1000 births. Prevailing levels of child mortality were also high. 33TABLE 7 Primary smallpox vaccinations by age and period in the cities of Bombay and Madras, 1857-91 Bombay Madras Age at primary vaccination TotalAge at primary vaccinationTotal Under 1 year primary Under 1 year primary Period 1 year and older vaccinations Period 1 year and older vaccinations data for Bombay and Madras 1857-72 are for fiscal years.

We have deliberately chosen a modest, though plausible, range of CFRs between 20and 30 percent. The smallpox prevalence range used is between 60 and 80 percent. Panel 1 simulates a situation where an entire birth cohort is ex- posed to smallpox before dying from any other disease. Under these cir-cumstances and with smallpox prevalence of 80 percent, roughly 16 to 24 percent of all deaths would be attributable to smallpox.

Such an expe- rience may well be represented by epidemics in 1850 in Calcutta and 1884 inOudh with proportional smallpox mortality of 47 and 27 percent respectively. 34 Although infants (i.e., those aged under one) were quite liable to die from smallpox, the calculations summarized in panels 2, 3, and 4 are con-servative in assuming no infant deaths from the disease. Even so, smallpox remains a significant cause of death in these models. The lowest propor- tional smallpox mortality is about 7 percent (in panel 4) under the assump-tion of 20 percent CFR and 60 percent prevalence and allowing for a very high overall level of infant and child mortality, none of which is assumed to be attributable to smallpox. Smallpox was a significant cause of death inunprotected populations. The sort of contribution of smallpox to overall mor- tality shown by panels 2-4 was probably representative of that experienced in eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century India. Lastly, panel 5 addresses circumstances akin to those of Bengal, where inoculation was widely practiced until at least the mid-nineteenth century and consequently smallpox was a fairly minor cause of death. Panel 5 alsoappears to be a reasonable approximation of the low proportional smallpox mortality observed in many provinces of India during the last decades of the nineteenth century and much of the twentieth, when a sizable fractionof the population was protected, mostly by primary vaccination. The impact of vaccination on smallpox mortality The provinces of Oudh and Berar, located in northern and central Indiarespectively, have special significance because their data provide a rare op-portunity to examine the toll of the disease in an unprotected population and illustrate the decline of smallpox following the introduction of vaccination. Oudh Oudh, a medium-sized province consisting of 12 districts with Lucknow as its capital, retained a separate political identity until the British took con- trol in 1856. In 1878 it was merged with North-Western Provinces. The mortality and vaccination statistics extracted for the districts of Oudh formthe basis of this case study. The first sanitary report for Oudh (for 1868-69) contains the following telling observation: \"Almost every native face is scarred by smallpox, whereas among Europeans this is an exception to therule. . . . [S]o prevalent in short is the disease that all adult natives may be said to be survivors of smallpox.\" 35670 SMALLPOX IN NINETEENTH -CENTURY INDIA Click to return to Table of ContentsDeath registration in Oudh started in 1869, and it is clear from inspec- tion of the registered crude death rates that during the initial years deaths were especially underregistered. The level of registration seems to have im- proved, however, particularly following the inquiry into excess mortalityassociated with the so-called food scarcity of 1877-79. 36 in 1869, 1872-74, 1878-79, 1883-84, and 1889. Thus the population experienced an epidemic cycle ofaround four to six years, with smallpox accounting for at least 10 percent of registered deaths in each epidemic; in both 1878 and 1883-84 the figure exceeded 20 percent. Only toward the end of the nineteenth century didthe share of smallpox in the province's total mortality decline. During 1869- 73 smallpox accounted for 9.7 percent of all registered deaths; during 1874- 78 it was 9.1 percent. This proportion was still as high as 7.3 percent during1884-88, before finally falling to 2.5 percent in 1894-98. In six years during the period 1869-90, registered smallpox death rates around or exceeding 200 per 100,000 population were recorded. Startingfrom around 1890 the province's smallpox death rate showed a perceptible decline, even though there was no fall in the overall registered crude death rate for Oudh. Table 9 shows that roughly 90 percent of total smallpox deaths oc- curred among infants and children. Indeed, infants alone accounted for around one-third of deaths. Adults (aged 12 years and older) constitutedonly about 10 percent of smallpox mortality. Figure 7 plots the proportion of the province's villages (which totaled some 25,000) that reported one or more deaths from smallpox during 1877-99. Itshows that in an epidemic year 40-60 percent of all villages could be affected and underscores the sizable and complex administrative network required to offer protection to children living in a large geographical area. Figure 8 depicts the seasonal pattern of smallpox mortality in Oudh.

About three-quarters of all smallpox deaths occurred in the five-month period from March to July. Smallpox was clearlyevident during the spring, reached its peak in mid-summer, and declined with the coming of the monsoon rains. This general pattern was found throughout the country. The province's political independence until 1856 meant that it remained isolated from the progress of vaccination occurring in much of India. 37 The indigenous practice of inoculation was unknown in Oudh, in contrast tothe neighboring regions of Kumaon and Benares where inoculation was practiced with varying degrees of acceptability. 38 Consequently many small- pox deaths continued to occur in Oudh, and neither the Nawab (Muslimprince) nor the general population made much effort to practice inocula- tion or establish vaccination. Early British Administration Reports for Oudh lamented the poor state of vaccination. In 1869 it was being practiced onlyin Lucknow (a city of about 300,000) out of a total provincial population of some 11 million. By 1872 vaccination was introduced to another 11 district headquarter towns and extended gradually to the vast rural population ofthe province. Figure 9 shows the relationship between primary vaccination in Oudh and the smallpox death rate. Initially vaccination progressed slowly, and by1875 only about 25,000 people were being vaccinated each year. Then 75,000 vaccinations were performed in 1882, but an official investigation672 SMALLPOX IN NINETEENTH -CENTURY INDIA Click to return to Table of Contentsrevealed that some records had been falsified in order to suggest improved performance. Punishment of the dishonest vaccinators followed, and the annual number of vaccinations recorded fell back to around 30,000. The slow progress of vaccination continued for some time, but its quality andcoverage began to improve. The early years of the last decade of the nine- teenth century saw very large improvement, with more than 350,000 pri- mary vaccinations being performed annually. Figure 9 also establishes the strong link between the increase in vacci- nation and the decline of smallpox. To achieve a lasting impact, primary vaccination coverage of at least 70 percent of annual births was required.This was finally achieved from 1891 and it produced a significant and per- manent decline in smallpox deaths by the end of century. This level of vac- cination coverage was sustained in the twentieth century, making small-pox a minor cause of death in Oudh. Nevertheless, a continued failure to vaccinate all infants, plus the fact that in some cases the procedure was delayed beyond age one, still left some children vulnerable. So occasionalminor epidemics still occurred\u2014for example in 1897 and 1908\u2014usually as- sociated with large-scale population movements and mixing of people (e.g., during famines), which exposed those unvaccinated to a greater risk of con-tracting the virus.JJJJJJ J J J J J J H HHHH H H H HH HHHHHHH H H H HH HHF FFFF F F F F FFF Jan.

It consisted of six districts, with a combined population of 2.2million in 1867. The historical demography of Berar has been studied by Dyson, who has shown that the vital registration data for years after 1881 were of high quality. 39 The present study reaffirms the uniqueness and util- ity of Berar's registration statistics by analyzing mortality and vaccination data for years before 1881. The first available mortality data by cause of death for Berar date from 1863, although we have been unable to find statistics for 1866-67. In the 1860s the province's vital registration system was new and the coverage of events was improving from year to year. Figure 10 shows that smallpoxwas a significant cause of death in the 1860s and 1870s, contributing around 6-8 percent of overall mortality. In early epidemics it accounted for over 10 percent of deaths, reaching about 16 percent in the worst epidemic. Butsmallpox death rates and proportional mortality were declining during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. The Sanitary Commissioner for Berar, appointed in 1869, was entrusted with establishing and extending vaccination throughout the province.

Nevertheless, resistance to vaccination was common, and it was diffi- cult to recruit and retain vaccinators in these early years. 41 Although the smallpox goddess, Shitala, was well known and worshipped throughout theprovince, inoculation was not practiced in Berar. Hence, the population was unprotected against the disease until vaccination was introduced. Figure 11 underscores that until 1867 vaccination was barely prac- ticed in Berar, with an annual coverage of less than 0.2 percent of the popu- lation. 42 But in 1867 a full vaccination program was approved to cover the rural population of each district. Vaccination progressed rapidly thereafter,overcoming the widespread indifference of the rural people observed a dec- ade earlier. In 1880 the Sanitary Commissioner of Berar recommended the introduction of a Compulsory Vaccination Act, particularly in the towns. 43 However, because the province's district officers feared adverse public reac- tion to compulsory measures, promulgation of the Act was withheld for over a decade.44 Even so, by the mid-1880s over 80 percent of infants wereJJJJJ J JJJ JJ JJ J Percentage of deaths from smallpox YearFIGURE 10 Annual number of smallpox deaths and its share in total mortality, Berar 1863-99 NOTE: Data for 1866 and 1867 are not available.

The introduction of a Compulsory Act within rural areas was deemed unnecessary since it could only marginally improve coverage and, if it stimulated opposition, would do more harm than good. Figure 11 shows that when vaccination coverage was low, smallpox deathrates were high. The smallpox death rate in Berar declined as vaccination progressed. Good vaccination performance in the province, which eventu- ally stabilized at a high level, was maintained by sustained efforts from theadministration aimed at ensuring that primary vaccination of young chil- dren became routine. Evidence that this success was firmly grounded is also provided by the fact that the smallpox death rate stayed low during thefamines of 1896-97 and 1899-1900 despite a massive increase in overall mortality. Of no less significance was the change in the epithet that was reportedly used by the public to address the vaccinator\u2014in the 1850s a \"mur-derer\"; in the 1890s the venerable \"Devi Doctor.\" 45 The Berar case allows us to reiterate three points. First, in the absence of protection through vaccination, smallpox was a significant cause of death.Second, if properly administered, the vaccination program caused a sub- stantial decline in smallpox deaths within a short period.

Finally, compulsory vaccination mea- sures were not resorted to if, through an efficient vaccination program, mostinfants could be protected early in life. Conclusions The following conclusions summarize the circumstances regarding small- pox in India during the nineteenth century. First, about 80 percent of India's population was completely unpro- tected against smallpox in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Inoculation, an effective and indigenous form of protection, was largely re- stricted to Bengal Presidency\u2014a fact that explains the low smallpox deathrate registered there in the period before the early 1880s. Second, case fatality in India from smallpox was high\u2014in the vicinity of 25-30 percent in unprotected populations, higher than recent estimatesfor eighteenth-century Europe. Third, evidence from pockmark surveys of adult jail populations and from the 1872 Bombay City Census indicates that in the absence of protec-1870 1875 1880 1885 1890 189502004006008001,0001,200Number (00s) YearsFIGURE Number of smallpox vaccinations under age one and number of infants surviving, Berar 1872-99 Number of vaccinations under age oneNumber of infants surviving NOTE: The number of surviving infants has been calculated by subtracting the number of registered infant deaths in a given year from the number of registered births in that year.PRINCIPAL DATA SOURCES: Annual Report of the Sanitary Commissioner and Report on Vaccination , Hyderabad Assigned Districts.JAYANT BANTHIA / T IM DYSON 677 Click to return to Table of Contentstion (or death while young from another cause) almost everyone in India contracted smallpox. Fourth, although deaths (including those from smallpox) were gener- ally underregistered, several considerations increased the accuracy of clas-sification of smallpox: the disease was common, it had characteristic symp- toms and distinct seasonality, and it mainly afflicted young children. The religious dimension\u2014the existence of the goddess Shitala\u2014was importanttoo, as was the close monitoring of vaccination by supervisory staff. Fifth, the early urban death registration data for Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras\u2014whose populations were partly protected in the mid-nine-teenth century\u2014indicate that on average smallpox accounted for 5-10 per- cent of registered deaths. However, the early data for the unprotected rural populations of Oudh and Berar indicate a similar range of 6-10 percent.Comparison of these ranges, and estimates from our calculations (see Table 8, panels 2-4), suggest that the range indicated for the unprotected popula- tions of Oudh and Berar may be low. The most plausible explanation forany discrepancy is differential underregistration of deaths at very young ages (in which smallpox featured prominently) in the early vital registra- tion data for Oudh and Berar and possibly some misclassification of deaths. Sixth, although smallpox was endemic to India, it also had a charac- teristic epidemic cycle usually in the range of four to seven years. In epi- demic years smallpox could account for a third of all deaths\u2014and then bebarely noticeable for the next few years. This was probably due to a sub- stantial diminution of the susceptible population during an epidemic year. It took several years for the pool of susceptibles to build up\u2014through theoccurrence of new births\u2014until it reached a size that would sustain an- other epidemic. Seventh, the available age data suggest that in unprotected popula- tions 85-90 percent of all smallpox deaths occurred among infants and young children. Eighth, the disease had a strong seasonality\u2014with late winter and early spring heralding its arrival, peaking during the mid-summer, and then abat- ing when the rains arrived. Ninth, vaccination\u2014introduced in 1802\u2014was an effective prevention against contracting smallpox. However, in much of the country progress in spreading the practice was very slow until well after the 1850s. Only in the 1880s was vaccination's impact fully felt, and thereafter smallpox became aminor cause of death in India. The case studies of Oudh and Berar clearly demonstrate the close link between the progress of vaccination and the de- cline of smallpox. Therefore the role of medical intervention in the controland decline of a specific disease is clearly established. Tenth, in the cities of Bombay and Madras a major part of the decline in smallpox deaths resulted from the introduction of Compulsory Vaccina-678 SMALLPOX IN NINETEENTH -CENTURY INDIA Click to return to Table of Contentstion Acts. In both cases a degree of legislative coercion produced a percep- tible further decline in smallpox mortality, long after vaccination had been introduced. Finally, although smallpox had its own epidemic cycle independent of famines, the mobility and congregation of people during food crises could help engender smallpox outbreaks. Nevertheless, the data for Berar in the 1890s show that with adequate vaccination coverage famines did not resultin raised smallpox mortality. Similarly in the case of Oudh, smallpox death rates were much lower during the famines of 1897 and 1908 compared with the rates recorded in earlier food crises. In conclusion, the introduction into India of primary vaccination against smallpox in 1802\u2014and its subsequent establishment and spread\u2014was even- tually successful. The wide diffusion of the practice throughout the subcon-tinent took between seven and nine decades to achieve, but once it was properly established mass primary vaccination resulted in a major decline in smallpox mortality. Ironically during the very period that this happened\u2014the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s\u2014the death rate in India suffered severe jolts from major famines and related epidemics. Yet the great importance of this specific medical intervention should not be underestimated. After a longand bitter fire-fighting operation, lasting most of the nineteenth century, smallpox in India was, like a fire, largely controlled but not extinguished. It was still capable of flaring up, as indeed sometimes happened in the twentiethcentury. Even as late as 1958 the disease claimed over 150,000 lives in India. Nevertheless the crucial first stage of controlling smallpox and ensur- ing that it became generally a minor cause of death was achieved. Its finaleradication\u2014the last recorded case of smallpox in India occurred in Assam in 1975\u2014required a different strategy, which included the revaccination of adults, the isolation of those infected, improved reporting of outbreaks ofthe disease, and even greater levels of infant primary vaccination.

In India revaccination be- gan only in the 1870s and remained at a low level for the rest of the nineteenth century. 10 Variola major and variola minor were the two types of smallpox virus. Clinically, however, there were five types of smallpox cases. In decreasing order of severity and case fatality they were hemorrhagic, confluent, semi-confluent, modified, and discrete. On the factors influencing case fatality see F. Fenner et al., Smallpox and Its Eradication (Geneva: World Health Organization, 1988), pp. 175- 178. 11 See Fenner et al., cited in note 10, p. 178. 12 By the early twentieth century a larger proportion of people who were unvaccinated contracted the disease at older ages, and at such ages case fatality rates were generally higher than at ages 1-10 years. This accounts for the higher case fatality of unvaccinated people shown in Table 2. 13 See Fenner et al., cited in note 10, p. 37. 14 See P.

An examination of 843 prison- ers at Coimbatore in 1855 found that 596 (i.e., 71 percent) had distinct smallpox marks, while only 70 (8 percent) had vaccination marks.

A committee was appointed by the Government of Bengal to inquire into the 1849-50 smallpox epidemic at Calcutta; it rec- ommended a ban on inoculation, holding it responsible for epidemics. 31 By Act V of 1865, the government was authorized to ban inoculation in any part of Bengal provided that simultaneously it made vaccination available to the people. 32 A Compulsory Vaccination Act was first promulgated in India in Bombay in 1877. Chil- dren born within the city limits were required to be vaccinated within six months of birth, failing which their parents could be prosecuted. 33 See T.

Click to print article POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW 25(4):681-702 (DECEMBER 1999) 681 Click to return to Table of ContentsThe Global and Regional Impact ofMortality and FertilityTransitions, 1950-2000 PATRICK HEUVELINE DURING THE SECOND half of the twentieth century, the world population, and even more so the population of the less developed regions, experienced de-mographic changes at an unprecedented pace. According to United Nations (1999) estimates, the world's population was 2.521 billion in 1950 and it will be 6.055 billion in mid-2000. This represents a mean annualized growthrate of 1.75 percent per year; the corresponding figure for less developed regions is 2.09 percent per year. The reasons for this unprecedented world population increase are well known, but the numbers remain striking. Glo-bal average life expectancy at birth increased by 9.5 years in just 15 years (from 46.5 years in 1950-55 to 56.0 years in 1965-70), while the average life expectancy at birth gained 11.3 years in less developed regions (from40.9 years to 52.2 years; United Nations 1999), almost certainly the fastest pace in human history (Durand 1967; Coale 1974). During the same pe- riod, world average fertility remained stable, as total fertility rates merelydeclined from 4.99 to 4.91. But in the following 30 years substantial fertil- ity declines occurred in many parts of the world, and, where they did, the pace of the decline was again rapid. The average total fertility rate declinedby half in less developed regions, from 6.01 births per woman in 1965-70 to 3.00 births per woman in 1995-2000 (United Nations 1999). These changes in life expectancy at birth and in total fertility rates trans- formed the \"average\" life course, especially in less developed regions. These major changes in demographic regimes also have long-lasting effects on population size, growth, and structure that have been extensively studiedand debated during the past 50 years (e.g., Bogue and Tsui 1978 and 1979; Demeny 1979a and 1979b). Interest typically concerns the long-term im- plications of mortality and fertility trends into the twenty-first century. Fewerattempts are made to look back and assess how different is today's world Click to print article 682 MORTALITY AND FERTILITY TRANSITIONS , 1950-2000 Click to return to Table of Contentspopulation as a result of past changes. In a recent exception to the norm, White and Preston (1996) measured life expectancy gains in the United States from 47.3 years in 1900 to 75.7 years in 1994 and estimated that about one-half of the population of the United States in the year 2000 owes itsexistence to the twentieth-century reduction of mortality. Expanding their approach, this article evaluates the impact of demo- graphic changes in the second half of the twentieth century on the end-of-century world population (hereafter referred to as today's population). The impact of the mortality reduction of the past 50 years on the size, growth, and age structure of today's population is first assessed for the world andbroad geographic regions. The impact of fertility declines is similarly ad- dressed, and the joint impact of these massive changes in demographic pro- cesses is then discussed. To disentangle the respective or joint impact ofmortality and/or fertility changes, the different assessments rest on similar comparisons between prevailing demographic characteristics and the out- comes of counterfactual projections that simulate population from 1950 to2000 had some demographic rates been different. The magnitude of demographic changes during the past 50 years sug- gests that today's world population is profoundly different from what itwould have been had demographic rates remained unchanged during that period. To a large extent, the expectation is confirmed by the results pre- sented below. The assessment of mortality reduction in the second half ofthe twentieth century suggests that 25 percent of today's world population is alive because of this reduction. Correspondingly, today's world popula- tion size represents only 73 percent of what it would have been had fertil-ity not declined in the past 50 years. Because mortality and fertility de- clines have varied in scope and timing across the world, certain changes have partially offset others, as have trends in different parts of the world.What emerges from these simulations is a more complex picture than an- ticipated, with an aggregate world population surprisingly little different at the end of the century from what it would have been had demographicrates remained constant over the past 50 years. Data and methods The impact of past changes is measured by comparing prevailing demo-graphic characteristics with the outcomes of retrospective counterfactualprojections. 1 Such projections appear only sporadically in the demographic literature (Coale 1956; Hermalin 1966; White and Preston 1996). As seem- ingly gratuitous exercises, retrospective counterfactual simulations may ap-pear difficult to justify, but they can show the implications of real demo- graphic trends by depicting the difference from what actually happened. In this instance, forward projections from 1950 on that maintain mortality and/PATRICK HEUVELINE 683 Click to return to Table of Contentsor fertility rates constant at their 1950-55 levels are used to depict the con- sequences of the actual course of mortality and fertility changes. Projections were prepared following the female-dominant cohort-com- ponent approach (Shryock and Siegel 1975; Keyfitz 1968), methodologyformulated by Cannan (1895) and gradually developed by Whelpton (1928 and 1936) that has since become the standard practice for population pro- jections. Age- and sex-specific survival ratios are applied to a population byage and sex, and age-specific fertility rates are applied to the female popu- lation by age. Net numbers of migrants by age and sex (i.e., number of im- migrants minus number of emigrants) are also added throughout the pro-jection interval. This approach implicitly restricts the heterogeneity of populations to two dimensions: age and sex. From the perspective of world population projections, it is also neces- sary to account for the geographical heterogeneity in demographic rates. When different subpopulations grow at different paces, projecting the ag- gregate population at constant fertility and mortality rates ignores such het-erogeneity and yields an incorrect estimate of the growth of the aggregate population because it amounts to maintaining the subpopulations in fixed proportions, even while the share of faster-growing subpopulations actu-ally increases over time. In 1950, age- and sex-specific fertility and mortal- ity rates varied greatly by area of residence; therefore, projecting the world population over a 50-year period first requires a breakdown of the worldpopulation into more homogeneous regions. 2 Accordingly, in the present exercise the world population was divided into regions, each of which was projected separately. These regions wereidentified so as to reduce within-region heterogeneity, but in the interest of simplicity the number of regions was limited to eight. Regions of roughly equivalent population sizes were preferred, and geographical coherence wasmaintained as much as possible. Clearly, such an exercise is constrained by the availability of data; the United Nations (1999) global population esti- mates covering the period starting with 1950 provide a valuable resource.The United Nations estimates present demographic data for the world, both the more developed regions (hereafter MDRs) and less developed regions (hereafter LDRs), 3 as well as major areas and countries. The smallest geo- graphical unit is thus the country, but for our purposes only the two \"de- mographic giants\"\u2014China and India\u2014are large enough (respectively, 21 percent and 17 percent of today's world population) to justify a separateprojection as a region; other regions were constituted by grouping the re- maining countries. Among these, the dichotomy between MDRs and LDRs captures much of the demographic heterogeneity within the global aver-age, and the first division was drawn along this line. Within the LDRs, sub- Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean each represent about 10 percent of the world population, and the two regions stand out for their684 MORTALITY AND FERTILITY TRANSITIONS , 1950-2000 Click to return to Table of Contentsdistinct demographic regimes. Each was projected as a separate region, leav- ing a long stretch of less developed countries and territories from Northern Africa to Asia (less China and India) and Oceania comprising 24 percent of the world population in the year 2000. This large area was divided into tworegions, East and West of India. In the rest of the article, the two regions are referred to as \"Other LDRs-East\" and \"Other LDRs-West.\" Finally, the MDRs, where 22 percent of today's world population live, were also di-vided into two smaller regions: Europe constituting one region and \"Other MDRs\" (i.e., Northern America, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand) another. United Nations data provide estimates of the population by sex and by five-year age groups 4 at mid-year, for every five years between 1950 and 1995; and estimates of total fertility rates and life expectancy at birth by sex in each five-year interval from 1950-55 to 1990-95. Projections providesimilar data up to 2050. 5 China, India, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe are countries or regions featured in the United Nations data- base, and therefore for these geographic units the estimates necessary forcarrying out the projections in the present exercise are directly available from that source. For the other four regions, the estimates are obtained by combining different United Nations areas or countries, as described in theAppendix (Tables A-1 and A-2). These estimates are treated as accurate even though total fertility rates and life expectancies at birth in the 1995-2000 period are in part estimates based on extrapolation. Obviously, the degreeof accuracy of the population size estimates as well as the fertility and mor- tality estimates relating to the years between 1950 and 1995 can also be questioned, but a specific discussion of this issue is not undertaken here. Preparing female-dominant cohort-component projections also requires assumptions about the sex ratio at birth, net migration rates by age and sex, and age-specific fertility and mortality rates in each five-year interval from1950-55 to 1995-2000. These additional parameters have been estimated from available ancillary data and finalized through forward projections aimed at reproducing United Nations population estimates for every five years be-tween 1950 and 2000. Although the outcomes of these forward projections based on actual mortality and fertility levels are not identical with United Nations estimates, they are extremely close 6 and below are taken as accu- rate representations of demographic trends between 1950 and 2000. The impact of changes in demographic regimes between 1950 and 2000 is then evaluated by comparing the outcomes of retrospective counterfactualprojections (alternative projection scenarios) and the above-described for- ward projections incorporating actual mortality and fertility levels (the ref- erence projections called scenario (a) in the tables). United Nations esti-mates were not used directly because those estimates are compiled from different data sources and are not necessarily internally consistent for past periods. Comparing the outcomes of different forward projections based onPATRICK HEUVELINE 685 Click to return to Table of Contentsalternative assumptions to reference projections describing the actual course of events allows any difference to be attributed precisely to the modifica- tion introduced in the fertility and/or mortality parameters, net of potential accounting discrepancies in the United Nations database. Retrospectivecounterfactual projections were prepared starting from the same 1950 popu- lation figures but then introducing specific assumptions as to the course of the 1950-2000 fertility and/or mortality rates (e.g., by stipulating that age-specific fertility or mortality rates remain constant at their 1950-55 values). Although population is projected between 1950 and 2000, demographic rates for the 1950-55 interval are the same in all scenarios. As a result, the 1955population is identical in each scenario, and the comparison between the counterfactual projections with constant rates and the reference projections accounts for the effects of only 45 years of fertility and mortality change. Preparing these different projections presents many technical issues. Perhaps the most delicate aspect of assessing the impact of past changes is of a different nature, however, and concerns interactions between demo-graphic parameters. The simpler assessment is to simulate one parameter change holding other parameters constant. This is the approach followed, in particular, by White and Preston (1996: 416), who point out that it thenaccounts only for the \"first-order effects\" of these changes. A full assess- ment of the impact would require estimating the effect the change in one parameter might have on other parameters, for instance whether fertilitywould have declined and at what pace had mortality remained constant. Such issues of demographic interactions have long concerned demographers (see for example Preston 1978 and Montgomery and Cohen 1998). Quanti-fying the interaction on a regional basis was clearly beyond the scope of the present article. A simpler strategy had to be followed here. Specifically, the impact of mortality changes is assessed by comparing two pairs of scenarios. In the first of these the reference scenario (incorpo- rating actual fertility and actual mortality) is compared with a counterfactual scenario combining actual fertility with constant mortality. The second com-parison involves projections both of which incorporate constant fertility but combine that assumption in one instance with actual mortality and in the other with constant mortality. These comparisons can be thought of as rep-resenting two extreme situations, one in which mortality has no effect on fertility and one in which fertility does not decline until mortality declines first. Results of these stylized comparisons are reassuring to the extent thatabsolute impacts vary much as expected (actual\u2014that is, lower\u2014fertility implies smaller numbers of people \"at risk\" of mortality). Impacts measured in relative terms (as the percentage difference between the projections com-pared) are much closer. The impact of fertility change is similarly assessed by comparing the reference scenario with a projection combining actual mortality with con-686 MORTALITY AND FERTILITY TRANSITIONS , 1950-2000 Click to return to Table of Contentsstant fertility, and by comparing projections both of which incorporate con- stant mortality but combine that assumption in one instance with actual fertility and in the other with constant fertility. As to migration, although it is highly improbable that migration would not have been affected by different mortality and fertility assumptions (e.g., through their effect on population growth in sending countries), migration flows do not represent an important contribution to the long-term growthof any sending region (see Table A-3). The highest contribution to growth (as measured by the crude rate of net migration) is for the receiving region \"Other MDRs,\" where it reaches nearly a quarter of a percent per year, onaverage, between 1950 and 2000. In the interest of simplicity, migration was kept identical across all scenarios. Past changes in demographic regimes and world population in 2000 Year 2000 populations that result under the four alternative scenarios (one of which, scenario (a), reflects the actual course of fertility and mortality change) are shown in Table 1. Figure 1 traces the population trajectories of these sce-narios between 1950 and 2000. Comparing scenarios (a) and (b), on the one hand, and (c) and (d), on the other, illustrates the pronounced impact on world population size of mortality improvements that have occurred since 1950-55. Today's population is at least one-third larger than it would have been without mortality changes after 1950-55 (see Table 2). The estimated abso- lute impact depends on the assumption about concurrent fertility levels,from 1.5 billion assuming fertility that actually prevailed (no interaction) to 2.2 billion with fertility also kept constant at 1950-55 levels. The difference TABLE 1 World population size (millions) in the year 2000, by age, projected from the population in 1950 according to four scenarios of fertility and mortality change Actual Actual Actual fertility; mortality; Mortality andmortality mortality fertility fertilityand actual 1950-55 levels: 1950-55 levels: 1950-55 levels: Age scenario (a) adapted from United Nations estimates (see Appendix).PATRICK HEUVELINE 687 Click to return to Table of Contentsbetween the two estimates owes much to the larger size of the population under age 45 had fertility remained constant. In relative terms, the impact of mortality decline varies much less, from 33.3 percent with prevailing fer- tility to 36.7 percent with constant fertility. The slightly higher impact withconstant fertility even in relative terms reflects the fact that mortality gains since 1950-55 have been relatively more important for the youngest age groups, as is also evident in Table 2. To reverse the perspective as do White and Preston (1996), the 1.5 billion people who would not be alive had mortality remained constant (all else equal) represent 25 percent of today's world population owing theirexistence to the reduction of mortality in the past 45 years. Although it may appear of a similar magnitude, this proportion reveals a stronger im- pact than the 50 percent in the past 100 years found for twentieth-centuryreduction of mortality in the United States. The reason is that the impact of changes is cumulatively compounded over time so that 50 percent in 100 years is achieved with considerably less change than 25 percent in any 50-year period. The impact on the 1940 population size of the 1900-40 mor- tality decline was less than 14 percent in the United States, and comparable 40-year mortality impacts diminished gradually throughout the century (cal-culated from data presented by White and Preston 1996: 421). It is well known that mortality declines have been strongly differenti- ated by age, with the largest absolute gains at the youngest ages and thelargest relative gains at both the youngest and oldest ages. This translates into an uneven age distribution of the population \"added\" by the reduction of mortality since 1950-55 (Table 2). Estimated with prevailing fertility, 545million people under age 15 are alive because of mortality gains (both sexes),TABLE 2 Impact of mortality change 1955-2000 on world population size in the year 2000, by age (in millions) Assuming constant fertility Assuming actual fertility at 1950-55 levels Absolute Relative Absolute Relative impact impact impact impact Age (a)-(b) Actual mortality and actual fertility (United Nations estimates) (b) Actual fertility; mortality constant at 1950-55 levels(c) Actual mortality; fertility constant at 1950-55 levels (d) Mortality and fertility constant at 1950-55 levels688 MORTALITY AND FERTILITY TRANSITIONS , 1950-2000 Click to return to Table of Contentsand the estimate is twice that (1.110 billion) with constant fertility rates. In relative terms, mortality declines increased the size of the population under age 15 by nearly one-half (some 44-47 percent) but increased the size of the population aged 60 and older by nearly the same proportion (43 percent). Although more recent, the impact of fertility change since 1950-55 on today's world population size is equally impressive. In Figure 1 the rel- evant comparisons showing this are between scenarios (a) and (c), on theone hand, and (b) and (d), on the other. With prevailing mortality, today's world population would be estimated to have 2.3 billion more people had fertility rates not changed since 1950-55 (see Table 3). Again, the assess-ment of the absolute impact of fertility change depends on the assumption about concurrent mortality levels, but the relative impact is slightly above 25 percent in either of the two scenarios considered here (it being some-what higher with prevailing mortality, i.e., positing no effect of fertility on mortality, perhaps a more appealing assumption than in the case of the reverse interaction). 7 The impact of fertility change is obviously differenti- ated by age, as changes since 1955 affect only the population under age 45 today. Since fertility changed little up to 1970, the actual effect is concen- trated in the population under age 30. The reduction by about a quarter ofthe size of the 15-29-year-old age group reflects the onset of many fertility transitions 15 to 30 years ago, while the reduction by nearly one-half of the population under age 15 reflects both the continued fertility reduction andthe smaller size of the cohorts entering their reproductive years in the past 15 years.

The projections with both mortality and fertility rates constant at 1950-55levels (scenario (d)) yield a world population size marginally higher (26 million) than the actual world population size (scenario (a)). The declines in fertility and mortality occurred at different times and at varying paces sotheir relative impact on world population size changed during the second half of the twentieth century, incidentally balancing each other at the end of the century (see Figure 1). Because mortality began to decline even be-fore the period under discussion here, the impact of mortality change in- creased steadily throughout this period. Conversely, the impact of fertility change on world population size is hardly noticeable between 1950 and1975, but it increases faster than the mortality impact after 1975. Initially, the impact of mortality decline has thus exceeded that of fertility change, and population has grown faster than it would have had mortality and fer-tility rates jointly remained constant. The absolute difference increases up to 245 million people in 1980 (or 5.5 percent of the world population size at the time) but contracts thereafter. With a difference in timing, fertilitydeclines at the close of the century have just begun to compensate for the impact of mortality declines since 1950-55. While fertility and mortality declines suggest a compensatory impact on today's world population size, their impact on the age structure is more visible. Although mortality declines sharply increased the number of persons in the youngest age groups, the depleting impact of fertility decline dominates under age 15, and the number of persons under age 15 would have been greater by 574 million (2343.3 - 1769.7; see Table 1) had both rates re- mained constant (nearly a third of today's population under age 15).

The net impact of these changes is that about 574 million fewer people under age 15 have been \"replaced\" by about 557 million more people aged 30 and older. The drastic changes in demographic regimes of the past 45years have thus left the size of today's world population almost unchanged but have shaped a quite different age structure. The implication of these structural shifts for population growth in the twenty-first century is unam-biguous. Had vital rates not changed, world average total fertility rates would not only be twice as high at the outset of the twenty-first century (4.99 in 1950-55 and 2.51 in 2000-05 according to United Nations estimates), butthe number of females under age 15 would also be 32 percent higher. While the size of the hypothetical population with constant rates is hardly distin- guishable from the actual world population size today, the difference wouldbecome quite significant very soon. By the mid-twenty-first century, the world population size would be projected above 15 billion with fertility and mortality rates still constant at 1950-55 levels, in contrast to the current UnitedNations (1999) projections of slightly under 9 billion for the same date. Nevertheless, it remains puzzling that during the past half-century the world population size stayed quite close to what it would have been with-out fertility and mortality declines. At the world level, it may seem that the dramatic mortality reductions and fertility reductions have responded to each other to keep population dynamics nearly unchanged, almost in equi-librium. It must be noted, however, that 1950-55 is used as the benchmark period because demographic data are hardly available for all regions of the world before 1950, but from the standpoint of the mortality and fertilitytransitions the choice of this period is arbitrary. The immediate post-World War II years do not represent any pretransitional equilibrium. This is obvi- ous for MDRs because of the baby boom, but it applies as well to thoseLDRs where mortality transitions started well before 1950, with a marked acceleration since about 1930, as is reflected in their already high rates of population growth in the 1950s. Latin America and the Caribbean in par-ticular was growing at an average 2.8 percent per year during 1950-55, while on average LDRs were growing at 2.0 percent per year. The 1950- 2000 period is thus much too short for expecting to find a return to somepost-transition demographic equilibrium worldwide. In a broader perspec- tive, these transitions may be seen as spread over four centuries (from the early eighteenth century to the late twenty-first century), and the secondhalf of the twentieth century is not necessarily the most salient phase of these processes. This period is exceptional because it marks the onset of the decline in global population growth after a prolonged increase, and the win-dow 1950-2000 is almost exactly centered on this inflection point.PATRICK HEUVELINE 691 Click to return to Table of ContentsContrasted regional trends Does the surprisingly small joint impact of mortality and fertility declines on global population size over the past 50 years reflect any \"homeostatic\" link between mortality and fertility declines? If so, similar results would be expected at the level of the regions delineated for the purpose of these pro-jections. (The year 2000 regional populations that result from the projec- tions are shown in Table 4.) But instead, the effects are very different across regions. The mortality and fertility impacts for each region are presented inTable 5, with the mortality impact measured with constant fertility and the fertility impact measured with prevailing mortality so that the two can be directly added together to assess the joint impact of these changes on re- gional population size. As mentioned above, and to a variable degree across regions, the assessment of the impact of mortality declines is partially trun- cated where mortality decline began before mid-century. 8 As expected, demographic trends had more moderate impacts in MDRs than in LDRs. The most important change in MDRs since 1950-55 is the TABLE 4 Regional population size (millions) in the year 2000, projected from the regional populations in 1950 according to four scenarios of fertility and mortality change Actual Actual Actual fertility; mortality; Mortality andmortality mortality fertility fertilityand actual 1950-55 levels: 1950-55 levels: 1950-55 levels: Region scenario scenario (c) scenario (d) Europe 722.9 (a) adapted from United Nations estimates (see Appendix).692 MORTALITY AND FERTILITY TRANSITIONS , 1950-2000 Click to return to Table of Contentsfertility impact in the \"Other MDRs,\" reducing today's population size in these regions by 170 million people, or by some 37 percent. In relative terms, the impact in these regions is no less than the worldwide impact (2.257 billion) that also amounts to 37 percent of today's world population. Thisresult might appear counterintuitive but is in fact consistent with stable popu- lation theory, which indicates that growth rates depend on the natural loga- rithm of total fertility rates (TFRs) so that, all else equal, a TFR decline from3.5 to 1.75 reduces the rate of population growth as much as a TFR decline from 6 to 3. Demographic trends in MDRs were dominated by the fertility decline from post-World War II baby-boom levels, and, on average, theseregions would have increased their rate of population growth had they main- tained their 1950-55 vital rates. The population size in these regions would be 300 million larger had fertility remained constant at the 1950-55 level,while mortality decline only added 115 million people to their population. On the contrary, the positive impact of mortality reduction on the size of today's LDRs populations exceeds the symmetrical negative impact of TABLE 5 Impact of mortality and fertility change 1955-2000 on regional population size in the year 2000, by age (in millions) Mortality impact assuming constant fertility Fertility impact assumingat 1950-55 levels actual mortality (c)-(d) (a)-(c) Under Age 45 Under Age 45 Region age 15 15-44 and older Total age 15 15-44 and older Total Europe 16.2 19.5 28.9 64.6 -87.4 -43.1 0.0 -130.5 Other MDRs 16.1 157.2 -25.9 7.3 0.0 -18.6Latin America and the Caribbean 73.4 50.3 20.5 144.3 and actual fertility (United Nations estimates)(b) Actual fertility; mortality constant at 1950-55 levels (c) Actual mortality; fertility constant at 1950-55 levels (d) Mortality and fertility constant at 1950-55 levelsPATRICK HEUVELINE 693 Click to return to Table of Contentsfertility change by 159 million people (2.116 billion less 1.957 billion, Table 5). But even within these regions, the results show a marked contrast. China and Latin America and the Caribbean would each have a larger population today had vital rates remained constant at 1950-55 levels (182 million and56 million respectively). The respective trends in the two regions are quite distinct, however. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the mortality im- pact (+144 million) was fairly small compared to the other LDRs, in partbecause mortality decline started earlier and ran some of its course before 1950. The impact of fertility decline in the region (-200 million), in propor- tionate terms about average among LDRs, was thus sufficient to more thancompensate for the mortality impact on today's regional population size. In China, on the contrary, both mortality and fertility impacts are spectacular (+879 million and -1.061 billion) even accounting for the large populationsize of the region (21 percent of today's world population). China accounts for 39 percent of the impact of mortality change and 47 percent of the im- pact of fertility change worldwide. Today's population in China is thus theproduct of two massive transformations, the mortality and fertility impacts representing respectively +69 percent and -83 percent of today's popula- tion of China. The other four LDRs would have smaller populations had vital rates remained constant at 1950-55 levels (altogether 397 million fewer people). The larger increases in population size attributable to demographic changessince 1950-55 are in sub-Saharan Africa and in the \"Other LDRs-West,\" with 139 million and 123 million people added to their respective popula- tions. In each of these four regions, mortality reduction had a significantimpact, if perhaps not as impressive as in China. More variation is observed with respect to the impact of fertility change. The lack of fertility impact even on the youngest age groups sets sub-Saharan Africa apart, suggestingthat the region's population growth will continue to exceed that projected with constant 1950-55 vital rates for several decades into the twenty-first century. The regional breakdown thus demonstrates that the nearly balanced impact of fertility and mortality declines on today's world population size is largely a coincidence, resulting from divergent regional trends worldwide. Aggregate fertility may seem to have declined in \"response\" to aggregatemortality decline, in a way that maintained population growth from 1950 to 2000 at what it would have been with 1950-55 vital rates. But regional trends do not support this \"homeostatic\" view of demographic change. Whiletoday's \"Other MDRs\" population would be 26 percent larger and that of China 14 percent larger, today's \"Other LDRs-West\" population would be 15 percent smaller and that of sub-Saharan Africa 22 percent smaller hadvital rates remained constant at their 1950-55 levels. The picture of regional diversity is confirmed by a further breakdown of the mortality and fertility impact on population by age and sex (Table 5).The result that mortality decline increased the adult and elderly population694 MORTALITY AND FERTILITY TRANSITIONS , 1950-2000 Click to return to Table of Contentsapplies to all regions and in proportionate terms to a roughly similar extent across regions. On the contrary, the finding that the population under age 15 decreased as the depleting impact of fertility change on that age group exceeded that of mortality does not apply across regions, because of verydifferent magnitudes of the fertility impact. Without detailing the specific structural changes of each region, it is worthwhile noting that the dispro- portionate contribution of China is even more visible in the population un-der age 15. In China alone the impact of fertility decline on the population under age 15 (-749 million) exceeds the impact of mortality decline (+434 million) by 315 million and by merely 102 million in the other five LDRs com-bined (646 million less 748 million, Table 5). The change in today's population age structure in the LDRs less China highlights the long-term implications of past mortality declines. The num-ber of people under age 15 in these regions is smaller by 102 million be- cause of the changes in vital rates that prevailed since 1950-55 but the main impact is the increased size of the cohorts now in reproductive ages (15-44) \u2014an increase by almost 300 million (+436 million less 148 million, Table 5). Actual population growth in the LDRs is expected to be slower in the first part of the twenty-first century than would have been the case had ratesremained constant at their 1950-55 levels, but only because of lower fu- ture fertility rates. The age structure of today's population in these regions is in fact conducive to faster population growth than would have been thecase had vital rates remained constant. A summary indicator for the present age-structure contribution to future growth is the population momentum, the factor by which population size would increase before stabilizing if fer-tility rates were to decline to their replacement level immediately and re- main there indefinitely. Population momentum thus expresses how much past mortality and fertility levels and changes, through their influence onthe present age structure, will contribute to future population growth irre- spective of future vital rates. Population momentum would be lower had vital rates remained constant at 1950-55 levels in all LDRs but China. Inthe LDRs less China, the present population momentum is 1.31 instead of the 1.04 that would have resulted with constant vital rates (data not shown, computed from formula in Preston and Guillot 1997: 21). The past 45 yearsof demographic changes in these regions thus imply that population would grow by an additional 27 percent even if fertility were to sink to replace- ment level instantaneously and thereafter remain there. On the other hand,past fertility declines brought current fertility levels closer to this replace- ment level than they were 45 years ago. In any event, from this perspec- tive, the expected further fertility declines hardly seem cause for alarm as aso-called population implosion (Wattenberg 1997) remains unlikely for the LDRs in the foreseeable future. In sum, results at the world level are somewhat deceptive. Even at the still highly aggregated level of the eight regions presented above, variationsPATRICK HEUVELINE 695 Click to return to Table of Contentsappear that are at odds with what world average trends might suggest and for two reasons. First, fertility levels have not systematically adjusted to de- clining mortality rates to keep population growth from accelerating. Already by the year 2000, regional population size in two of the eight regions con-sidered here differs by more than 20 percent from what it would have been with unchanged 1950-55 vital rates. Second, the potential for future growth has not been uniformly reduced. This phenomenon has been largely lim-ited to the more developed regions and to China. 9 Conclusions World average mortality has declined at an unprecedented pace during thepast 50 years. This impressive decline can be summarized using the abstractconstruct of the life tables' \"synthetic\" cohort, by stating that each person born at the end of the twentieth century could expect to live about 18 years longer, on average, than if born at mid-century. Another way to expressthe same decline, in perhaps more concrete terms, is that one-fourth of today's world population is alive because of mortality improvement in the sec- ond half of the twentieth century. Meanwhile, recent fertility declines havealso been impressive on average and, indeed, much faster than pre dicted only a decade or two ago. In terms of their impact on today's world population size, the aggregate effect of individual decisions to bear fewer children almostexactly offsets the upward pressure of increased survival probabilities. World average trends are deceptive, however. Whereas the respective effects of mortality and fertility on world population size nearly balanceout, the regional level reveals a variety of distinct situations. Changes in demographic regimes slowed population growth in the more developed re- gions because the impact of mortality gains after 1950 was modest and fer-tility declined from its exceptional baby-boom levels. In the less developed regions, mortality declines had a strong acceleration effect on population growth in the second half of the century, generally exceeding the impact oflater fertility declines except in two of these LDRs but for different reasons. First, Latin America and the Caribbean experienced earlier mortality de- clines than most other LDRs (by 1950-55, life expectancy at birth was aboutten years higher than in Africa or Asia), so that the impact of mortality changes after 1950 was more limited. Second, China's well-known fertility decline reversed the momentum set by the previous mortality declines. Inthe remaining LDRs, population growth has actually been higher during the second half of the century than it would have been had fertility and mortality rates remained constant at their mid-century levels. Substantialvariations were also found within these regions, most significantly in sub- Saharan Africa, where the impact of fertility declines has been minimal. This review of the demographic consequences of changes in mortality and fertility regimes during the past 50 years leads to three conclusions.696 MORTALITY AND FERTILITY TRANSITIONS , 1950-2000 Click to return to Table of ContentsFirst, it places recent fertility declines and the prospects for future fertility declines in perspective. A cursory reading of public debates over demographic issues during the past few years may leave the impression that contempo- raneous demographic changes have permitted us to avoid a world popula-tion explosion but that the \"over-correction\" of fertility rates may precipi- tate instead a world population implosion. That population growth has been no slower than if demographic rates had remained constant at their 1950-55 levels may then surprise many. In most of the developing world, the current population momentum is even greater than would have been the case had there been neither mortality nor fertility transitions in this half-century. Taking a slightly longer view on retrospective population changes provides a corrective for the fashionable present-day interpretation of cur- rent and expected fertility declines in these regions. Second, the balancing out at the world level should not support a fa- talistic view of short-term population growth either. Population growth dur- ing the past 50 years has been largely consistent with growth implied bymid-century vital rates in spite of dramatic subsequent changes in such rates, but the modest combined impact of mortality and fertility transitions during the last 45 years reflects the very significant but compensating impacts of both mortality and fertility changes. Recent fertility declines did reduce the size of today's world population by a quarter, but these declines occurred against a background of earlier mortality improvements that sharply increased thenumber of people reaching reproductive age. Recent fertility declines will have an even greater impact on future growth as they have reduced the size of the world population under age 15 by nearly 50 percent (Table 3). Finally, although on average fertility declines have followed mortality declines and kept population growth in check, regional diversity cannot sup- port a homeostatic view of recent transitions in LDRs. For instance, whilethe mortality impact has been less in sub-Saharan Africa than in the other LDRs except Latin America (24.4 percent of today's population in the re- gion is alive because of mortality reduction since 1950-55), fertility declineshave been modest in the region. By the time mortality decline had the same impact on population size in China, 23.5 percent of the 1985 population (calculation not shown), a swift fertility decline was already underway andpopulation was back to the size projected on the assumption that both mor- tality and fertility rates remained constant. Regional contrasts suggest that fertility change is not a necessary \"response\" to mortality change, or at leastthat their respective timing can be such as to allow a long period of sus- tained growth. That mortality declines preceded fertility declines is possibly the only universal trait linking recent transitions across the world (Hirschman1994), but both the magnitude and the timing of fertility declines relative to the mortality declines were diverse.PATRICK HEUVELINE 697 Click to return to Table of ContentsAppendix: Parameters of the reference projections For China, India, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe, the 1950 popula- tion by sex and five-year age groups was taken directly from United Nations (1999)data. Simple sums and differences in the population by sex and five-year age groupsin the constituent United Nations areas or countries were the source of the 1950population in the other four regions. The population of sub-Saharan Africa is sim-ply the difference between the populations of Africa and Northern Africa. 10 The population of the \"Other LDRs-West\" is the sum of the populations of NorthernAfrica, Western Asia, and South-and-Central Asia, less the population of India.The population of the remaining LDRs constitutes the population of the \"OtherLDRs-East,\" that is, the difference between the total population of the LDRs andthe sum of the populations of China, India, \"Other LDRs-West,\" sub-SaharanAfrica, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Similarly, the population of the \"OtherMDRs\" is the difference between the total population of the MDRs and the popu-lation of Europe. While total fertility rates are available for United Nations areas and countries in each period, age-specific fertility rates are not. Initial age patterns of fertilitywere obtained from either vital statistics (United Nations 1997 and earlier) or modelage patterns of fertility (published in the 1973 revision of United Nations biennialprojections). These initial patterns were gradually calibrated to best match theUnited Nations estimates of the number of persons under age five years in eachregion and at every five years. Age-specific fertility rates for the composite regionswere computed from the finalized rates in each of their constituent areas in thefollowing manner. For each region, period, and age group of women of childbear-ing age, the age-specific fertility rates multiplied by the average number of womenin the period provide the number of births by maternal age in the constituentareas. Simple sums and differences give the corresponding number of births by APPENDIX TABLE A-1 Total fertility rates by region (five-year averages), 1950-2000 Sub- Latin Other Other Other Saharan America and Period Europe MDRs China LDRs-East India LDRs-West Africa the 1.82 1.80 2.54 3.13 3.80 5.51 2.70 Source for Europe, China, India, and Latin America and the Caribbean: United Nations 1999.

In turn, these numbers of births and the average number of women in the region and period provide the age-specific fertility ratesfor that region and period. Resulting total fertility rates are shown in AppendixTable A-1. For each region, a constant value of the sex ratio at birth for the entire1950-2000 period completes the fertility parameters. Selected values range from1.03 in sub-Saharan Africa to 1.07 in China. A similar approach was followed for mortality parameters. In each period, life expectancies at birth by sex are available for United Nations areas and countries,and were used for China, India, Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Aswas the case for fertility, age patterns of mortality are described at the countrylevel but are not provided for regions. For each of the above four regions and eachconstituent area of the remaining four regions, a single age pattern of mortalityfor the period 1950-2000 was selected from model age patterns. From United Na-tions life expectancies at birth and these model age patterns, a full life table can becomputed (computations were carried out using MortPak, United Nations 1988).Survival ratios for a composite region are then obtained from the number of birthsby sex and survival ratios in the constituent areas in the following way. For eachregion, period, and sex, the number of births and the population by age at thebeginning of the period are survived forward until the end of the period in eachconstituent area. Sums and differences then provide the number of survivors byage in each region. These numbers are subsequently combined with the numberof births and the population by age in the region at the beginning of the period inorder to compute survival ratios for that region. This approach amounts to takingas survival ratios the weighted averages of the survival ratios from the constituentareas with the weights equal to the population of the appropriate area and agegroup at the beginning of the period (for a discussion of several approaches, seeLutz and Scherbov 1992). These life expectancies by sex were used for the composite regions; yet a single age pattern of mortality for the entire period 1950-2000 was selected from model APPENDIX TABLE A-2 Life expectancy at birth, by region (both sexes, five-year averages), 1950-2000 Sub- Latin Other Other Other Saharan America and Period Europe MDRs China LDRs-East India Source for Europe, China, India, and Latin America and the Caribbean: United Nations 1999.

Life expectancy at birth for both sexes is shown in AppendixTable A-2. Age patterns of mortality were taken from Coale and Demeny's (1983)model life tables for Europe and \"Other MDRs\" (West), as well as for sub-SaharanAfrica (North). United Nations (1982) model life tables for developing countries pro-vided the patterns for China, \"Other LDRs-East,\" \"Other LDRs-West\" (General), India(South Asian), and Latin America and the Caribbean (Latin American). International migration estimates are not available from United Nations data. While the average net number of migrants can be computed from populationchange and the average number of births and deaths in a five-year interval, esti-mates derived in this fashion are not satisfactory since they do not sum to zeroworldwide between 1950 and 1980. An examination of these data and figures inZlotnik (1994) led to initial estimates of the number of migrants by region, period,and sex. These were gradually adjusted to sum to zero and to reduce the differ-ence between the projected population by age in the reference projections and inthe United Nations data.

The label does not refer to the technique of projection, which is here forward projection, not back-projection. 2 For instance, Lutz and Prinz (1991) found that projecting the world population over 110 years (1990-2100) as the sum of six regions with constant fertility and mortality rates resulted in a population size 50 percent greater than the world population size had world average fertility and mortality rates been assumed constant. 3 The United Nations defines the \"More Developed Regions\" as Europe (including the territory of the Russian Federation), Northern America, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.4 The open-ended age interval is 100 years and older in the most recent United Nations estimates. Projecting this age group poses ad- ditional difficulties when using conventional model life tables (see Heuveline 1997 for a dis- cussion); 80 years and older was preferred here as the open-ended age interval. 5 The 1995-2000 figures incorporate avail- able data as of 1998, complemented by projec- tions. In the rest of the article, I refer to the United Nations estimates for the en tire 1950- 2000 period. 6 The parameters of the reference projec- tions are described in the Appendix to this ar- ticle. An additional appendix comparing the re- sults of these projections with the United Nations estimates is available from the author upon request. 7 There are some well-documented health benefits to both mother and child of longer birth intervals (in turn leading to lower total fertility), but past mortality declines appear more independent of prior fertility change than past fertility declines of prior mortality change. 8 In the MDRs, the majority of the im- pact of mortality decline results from changes before 1950. For instance, White and Preston (1996: 422) found that for the United States \"[m]ortality reductions during the first half of the century had a much larger impact on population size in 2000 than did reductions during the second half.\" 9 Many of the regional differences de- scribed above can be explained by the differ- ent timing and pace of fertility declines as compared to the timing and pace of mortal-period are shown in Appendix Table A-3. To allow a better match with the popu- lation age structures estimated by the United Nations, the numbers were not forcedto zero within each age group. Although this is of course inconsistent, releasingthis constraint allows the correction of the age patterns of mortality in case theydiffer from the selected model. In the interest of simplicity, a single model agepattern of mortality has been selected in each region for the entire projection pe-riod (1950-2000), but a single pattern is not necessarily valid throughout the pe-riod. Forcing the number of migrants to sum to zero for all ages combined, but notin each age group, amounts to a redistribution of the total number of deaths byage, but holds the total number of deaths unchanged.

P OTTER IN THE LAST several years, spurred in large part by Susan Watkins's persuasive argumentation and the rigorous analytic formulations of John Casterline, MarkMontgomery, and Luis Rosero-Bixby, there has been a resurgence of interest in the roles of social networks and interpersonal communication in fertility transitions and in the spread and changing composition of contraceptivepractice. 1 By and large, these authors have concentrated on the exchange of information and ideas among prospective parents or contraceptive users, and they have focused on the beginning and middle parts of the processrather than its later stages. Moreover, they have generally viewed networks and the transmission of information across them as positive phenomena that should be taken advantage of in the design of public policies. In thisarticle, I argue that there is ample reason to explore the problems as well as the opportunities that networks and diffusion pose and to consider the role of the providers of contraceptive services both as brokers of informationbetween users and as agents who control or at least influence the choice of reproductive and contraceptive technologies. In so doing, I look at the later as well as the earlier stages of the fertility transition and point to some ofthe contradictions and dilemmas that these matters pose for emerging norms regarding reproductive health and quality of care. What might be the problematic aspects and consequences of social inter- action? While there is no doubt that the interpersonal exchange of informa- tion across networks can speed the fertility transition, it is also responsible for the inertia that makes introduction of new contraceptive technologiesdifficult. Less recognized is the inertia that may be encountered in the later stages of the fertility transition wherein individuals and institutions may become committed to a reduced set of contraceptive practices that may be Click to print article 704 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsfar from optimal for most if not all women. I argue that the tendency to become accustomed to a reduced range of methods and particular ways of practicing them results from the various sorts of positive reinforcement that contraceptive choices are subject to, and follows the logic of path depen-dence. I illustrate the ways in which contraceptive regimes that evolved in one set of circumstances can persist long after they no longer make sensewith experiences drawn from Mexico and Brazil, countries that have expe- rienced substantial declines in fertility, but that have had widely different experiences in the realm of population policy. Mexico illustrates how gov-ernment policies and styles of implementing them may outlive the condi- tions for which they were originally designed, while Brazil shows how a far more laissez-faire approach can also yield perverse, unwanted outcomes. The stylized facts Writing in this journal, Bongaarts and Watkins (1996) have provided a com-prehensive review of the empirical evidence regarding the timing and paceof contemporary fertility transitions. As did demographers familiar with the history of the demographic transition in the West, they show that contem- porary transition characteristics do not follow directly from either levels orrates of change of \"conventional measures of development,\" and that \"once a country has begun a transition, further declines follow almost invariably.\" Using countries as the units of analysis, they find large differences in levelsof fertility and socioeconomic conditions prevailing at the onset of the tran- sition, and little or no correspondence between the pace of the ensuing change in fertility and change in socioeconomic conditions (at least as re-flected in the human development index, or HDI). They do, however, de- termine that the onset of fertility decline within countries in a macro-re- gion can be predicted quite well on the basis of the level of developmentand the time elapsed since the first country in the region entered the fertil- ity transition. Having established these features of contemporary fertility transitions, they proceed to suggest that much of the unexplained variationin contemporary fertility transitions, as well as in earlier ones, can be ac- counted for by the transmission of information and ideas regarding fertility and its control, and that \"social interaction . . . accelerates the pace of tran-sition\" (p. 669). 2 The argument that I make in this article is not that these facts and inferences are incorrect. Rather than question the importance of a diffusionprocess at work, my goal is to broaden the discussion of its consequences to include the problems that may be associated with the choice and practice of methods of birth control. To lay the basis for my suggestions as to how thescope of thinking about social interactions should be expanded, I draw at-JOSEPH E. P OTTER 705 Click to return to Table of Contentstention to the \"stylized facts\" pertaining to the contraceptive use associated with contemporary fertility transitions. Wide variations in method mix Perhaps the most striking aspect of contemporary contraceptive practice isthe wide variation that exists across populations. The magnitude of this varia- tion can be seen in Table 1, which shows contraceptive use by method for 26 countries selected from among those for which the United Nations (1996)has compiled this information. The percentages highlighted in bold print are for the most prevalent methods practiced in the country. While the cases have been selected to emphasize the diversity in world experience,the picture presented in the table is nonetheless striking. In many of the countries, the bulk of contraceptive use is concentrated on one or two meth- ods rather than being spread over a larger number. Second, the most preva-lent methods are not the same across these countries. For example, while female sterilization is an important method in about half of the countries shown in Table 1, its prevalence is below 5 percent in seven of the coun-tries, all of which have a relatively large percentage of married women prac- ticing contraception. Male sterilization is less frequently practiced than fe- male sterilization among these countries, but is an important method inNepal, Korea, and the United States. Other methods also show a wide range in prevalence: use of the pill ranges from less than one percent in Vietnam and Japan to 46 percent in Belgium, injectables from 15 percent in Indone-sia to less than 2 percent in 16 countries, the condom from 48 percent in Japan to 3 percent or less in 17 countries, vaginal barrier methods are used by more than 2 percent of married women only in the United States, rhythmis practiced by 21 percent of married women in Peru and is an important method in Japan and Sri Lanka, and, finally, withdrawal is the most widely practiced method in Turkey, the Czech Republic, and Romania. Each of these societies has a particular history, culture, medical sys- tem, and set of relations with other societies, and explanations for the indi- vidual patterns can be sought in those particularities. 3 In an era of global- ization in which goods and ideas are thought to travel more freely than ever before, however, such variation in the methods of contraception used in different countries has to command our attention. Simple appeals to varia-tions in the preferences of individuals and couples\u2014perhaps reflecting pa- triarchy or prevailing sexual practices\u2014do not seem convincing, nor do ex- planations based solely on programmatic fiat or market restrictions. Also,there is no correlation between average levels of income or education and the prevalence of certain methods. Indeed, the most striking aspect of these data is how little use is made in so many places of the contraceptive tech-nology that is available today.Click to return to Table of ContentsTABLE 1 Percent of married women of reproductive age using contraception, by method, 1980s and early 1990s, selected countries Country Female Male Vaginal With- Any and year sterilization sterilization Pill Injectable IUD Condom barrier Rhythm drawal method Egypt 1992 1.1 0.0 12.9 0.5 27.9 2.0 0.4 0.7 0.7 46.2 Kenya 1993 5.5 0.0 9.5 7.2 4.2 0.8 0.1 4.4 0.4 32.7 Bangladesh 1993 8.2 1.1 17.7 4.5 2.1 3.0 0.0 4.9 2.5 45.1 Hong Kong 1987 22.9 0.9 16.4 2.5 4.5 26.0 1.8 5.4 0.5 80.8 Indonesia 1991 2.7 0.6 14.8 14.8 13.3 0.8 0.0 1.1 0.7 49.7 Jordan 1990 5.6 0.0 4.6 0.0 15.3 0.8 0.6 3.9 4.0 35.0 Nepal 1991 11.0 6.8 1.0 2.3 0.2 0.6 0.0 0.5 0.4 22.7 Philippines 1993 11.9 0.4 8.5 0.1 3.0 1.0 0.0 7.3 7.4 40.0 Korea 1991 35.3 12.0 3.0 0.1 9.0 10.2 0.1 7.0 2.7 79.4 Sri Lanka 1987 24.8 4.9 4.1 2.7 2.1 1.9 0.0 15.0 3.4 62.0 Thailand 1987 22.4 5.5 20.0 9.2 7.2 1.2 0.0 1.0 0.9 67.5 Turkey 1993 2.9 0.0 4.9 0.1 18.8 6.6 1.2 1.0 26.2 62.6 Vietnam 1988 2.5 0.3 0.4 0.0 31.0 1.1 7.5 6.6 53.2 Colombia 1990 20.9 0.5 14.1 2.2 12.4 2.9 1.7 6.1 4.8 66.1 Dominican Rep. 1991 38.5 0.2 9.8 0.2 1.8 1.2 0.1 2.0 2.2 56.4 El Salvador 1993 31.5 0.4 8.7 3.6 2.1 2.1 0.0 3.0 2.0 53.3 Brazil 1986 26.9 0.8 25.2 0.6 1.0 1.7 0.5 4.3 5.0 65.8 Mexico 1987 18.7 0.8 9.8 2.8 10.2 1.9 0.6 4.4 3.5 52.7 Panama 1984 32.4 0.4 11.8 0.8 6.0 1.6 1.2 2.3 1.4 58.2 Peru 1991 7.9 0.1 5.7 1.9 13.4 2.8 1.0 20.7 3.9 59.0 Japan 1992 3.2 0.8 0.8 3.1 48.0 0.8 10.6 4.9 64.0 United States 1988 23.4 12.9 15.1 1.5 10.6 5.6 2.1 74.3 Belgium 1991 11.4 7.6 46.4 5.0 4.8 0.0 2.1 2.0 79.4 France 1988 6.7 0.0 29.7 25.9 4.3 6.4 6.6 81.2 Czech Rep. 1993 2.7 0.0 8.0 0.0 15.3 18.8 0.2 1.9 22.1 68.9 Romania 1993 1.4 0.0 3.1 0.0 4.2 3.9 1.9 8.5 34.4 57.3 NOTES: Blanks in the table correspond to methods for which prevalence estimates are not available and use is known to be either negligible or very small.

P OTTER 707 Click to return to Table of ContentsThe persistence of collective and individual contraceptive choices When viewed in a longer-term, dynamic perspective, the evolution in pat- terns of contraceptive use is perhaps even more anomalous than the cross- section shown in Table 1. While there is often an understandable trend away from the use of traditional methods and toward the use of modern, moremedicalized methods, what is surprising is the persistence of a particular mix and the tendency for the distribution of use to become more concen- trated through time. In Mexico, as will be seen below, a tendency towardincreased prevalence of the IUD and sterilization in recent years has come at the expense of the use of the pill and injectable contraceptives. The use of the IUD has diminished sharply in some countries such as the UnitedStates. In many countries such as Brazil, the tendency is toward reliance on just two methods, the pill and sterilization, with sterilization occupying an increasingly large share over time. There is no widely accepted explanationas to why the method mix does not become more diverse as more methods become available, or why the methods used in one country frequently do not become popular in neighboring countries. The tendency toward a persistent, narrow distribution of use by method at the aggregate level has a parallel at the level of the individual. The rela- tively small number of studies that have looked at sequences of use amongindividuals display high stability in a woman's choice of methods. That is to say, there is relatively little switching. This conclusion was drawn early on with respect to the United States by Ryder and Westoff (1971) and byMichael and Willis (1975), both using data from the 1965 National Fertility Survey (NSF). When the latter authors examined successive segments of use, they found that about three-quarters of the couples who were usingeither the diaphragm, condom, or withdrawal in the first segment were us- ing the same method in the following segment. Survey data have also pro- vided strong evidence of stability among women in Malaysia (DaVanzo, Ann,and Othman 1986; Reboussin et al. 1987). Reboussin et al. noted that \"couples used the same method of contraception both before and after 84 percent of the pregnancies in our sample\" (p. vi). They concluded that thetrend toward the use of modern methods of contraception apparent in the aggregate method mix was not the result of individual women substituting modern for traditional methods. Rather, those women who were using tra-ditional methods continued to do so, while new cohorts of previous nonus- ers began practicing modern methods. Further evidence of the tendency of women to continue using a method that they have already chosen is provided in studies of who accepts new methods of contraception when they are introduced. Michael and Willis used the 1965 NSF to study adoption of the pill when it was first intro-duced, and found that, as in Malaysia five to ten years later, women who708 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentshad not used a method were more likely to adopt the pill than women who had previously used another method. Results concerning the likelihood of adopting the subdermal contraceptive implant when it was first introduced are also available for Malaysia and the United States (Molyneaux 1997;Mellor 1997). Here again, previous nonusers were more likely to adopt the new method than were women who had previously used another method. How and why contraceptives are chosen The standard conceptual formulations regarding contraceptive choice areclosely related to familiar models of consumer choice theory wherein an individual takes into account the various attributes of a method such as itscost, including the time involved in acquiring the method, its ease of use, effectiveness, reversibility (in the case of sterilization), and possible side ef- fects (Bulatao 1989). People start with a utility function, or set of prefer-ences; they are subject to constraints with respect to their time and income; they encounter a specific set of prices (in terms of both money and time) for different methods; and they eventually select the method that is best forthem (maximizes their utility). Perhaps the most familiar type of logic re- lated to the application of this model of contraceptive choice is that \"spac- ers\" will give less weight than \"limiters\" to the effectiveness of a method.The model leads, in the absence of complications, to a felicitous outcome: individuals and groups of individuals choose the methods that are best for them. The model has been extended in an attempt to account for the low frequency of method switching. Michael and Willis (1975) and Mellor (1997) have suggested substantial \"fixed costs\" attached to contraceptive practiceas an explanation for the large fraction of couples who continue to use the same contraceptive method over time, and the large percentage of the adopt- ers of new methods constituted by individuals who were not previouslyusing a method. The fixed costs that inhibit people from switching methods are not well investigated, but are supposed to include monetary, psychic, information, and health costs. Monetary costs might include expendituresfor consultations with physicians, as well as the expense of the method. Information costs refer to all efforts to gather information at the time of method selection, and fixed health costs are those incurred by using a methodonly once. Others have suggested directions in which to expand the dy- namic aspects of the model (Mundigo, Phillips, and Chamratrithirong 1989) so as to incorporate the learning that occurs as couples gain experience withindividual methods. Most recently, as noted at the outset, attention has been focused on social learning: individuals are seen as depending on others for informationabout the existence of new technologies and about the risks and conse-JOSEPH E. P OTTER 709 Click to return to Table of Contentsquences of adopting them (Montgomery and Casterline 1996; Kohler 1997a and 1997b). In the remainder of this section, I first highlight two aspects that have not been given their due emphasis in most discussions of diffu- sion and social learning with respect to contraception, and then discuss theproperties of a model of contraceptive decisionmaking that incorporates these extensions and considerations. Fear of health consequences The uppermost concern that women and sometimes couples have regard-ing modern medical contraceptive methods is that they will be damaging to their health. Modern medical methods include hormonal contraception, theIUD, and surgical sterilization\u2014the contraceptives that have accounted for the bulk of contraceptive use in contemporary fertility transitions. The con- cern involved may range from well-informed, scientifically based fear ofcontracting pelvic inflammatory disease from using an IUD to a general worry that use of any of these methods will prove to be life-threatening based on a cognitive model of the body at some distance from the Western modeland based on rumors afloat in the community. 4 One of the most compelling descriptions of the role that fear plays in contraceptive decisionmaking is found in an article by Shedlin andHollerbach (1981). 5 Their subjects were women living in a rural commu- nity outside the city of Toluca, Mexico who had an understanding of repro- ductive processes based on \"traditional,\" non-Western conceptions, andample experience with the consequences of using traditional means of avoid- ing or ending pregnancies. The dilemma facing women seeking to limit their fertility is to choose the least dangerous of the available options. The tradi-tional methods present threats that are well known, while new methods such as the pill seem frightening both because they seem designed to inter- fere with the body's natural functions and because stories circulate in thecommunity about side effects. There are conflicting authorities regarding medical matters. Traditional practitioners and midwives seldom endorse the new methods but continue to provide the old ones, while the young andoften ill-prepared interns in the nearby government health post often fail to present a convincing case for the methods they offer. Shedlin and Hollerbach's account is based on extensive anthropologi- cal fieldwork by one of the investigators. It is reflective of a large literature on the conflict between modern and traditional medical systems and the resistance to modern contraceptives in communities in which the modernmedical paradigm is not dominant. But fear of contraceptive methods is not restricted to traditional populations; it is also found in the most highly medicalized of societies. The perennial concern for the health consequencesof the pill in the United States and Britain, the backlash against the IUD710 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsthat resulted from the legal proceedings of the late 1980s in the United States, and the recent wave of Norplant\u00ae removals in the United States are, in all likelihood, reflections of this underlying phenomenon. Work in cognitive psychology points to fear of severe or life-threatening outcomes, even whensuch outcomes are statistically remote, and suggests that it is human nature to attribute great importance to such outcomes in forming impressions and making choices. Montgomery (1996) has surveyed this literature with a viewtoward understanding the problem that individuals and populations may have in perceiving the mortality changes that are occurring in their com- munities. Citing the review by Camerer (1995), Montgomery concluded thatindividuals tend to employ relatively simple learning strategies, and that they \"consistently make fundamental mistakes in probabilistic reasoning, tending to assign too much weight to certain types of evidence and notenough to others\" (p. 15). The \"mistakes\" people are apt to make are of the very sort that would lead them to assign \"too much weight\" to severe or life-threatening out-comes resulting from the use of technologies such as contraception. There are several ways in which this may come about. First, individuals may give less weight to events that do not occur than to events that are noteworthy,because they have a differential proclivity to retain the information. In this instance, the notion is that people have a greater capacity to retain infor- mation about someone who develops a serious illness while using a contra-ceptive method than about someone who has used a method uneventfully. Second, individuals tend to give more weight to a small sample of evidence with which they are directly familiar than to a statistical portrait of the ex-perience of the larger population. Third, \"people are highly sensitive to varia- tions in the extremeness of evidence and not sufficiently sensitive to varia- tions in its credence or predictive validity . . . \" (Griffin and Tversky 1992:413, quoted by Montgomery 1996: 19-20). Moreover, they are likely to pay more attention to negative events and information than to positive in- formation and to be especially attuned to the occurrence of events that areboth highly undesirable and not easily prevented or controlled. If the psychological literature reviewed by Montgomery suggests that people are especially sensitive to information about highly deleterious orpossibly lethal consequences of using contraceptives, it also suggests that they will pay special attention to events that befall members of their imme- diate families and communities, and thus provides support for the idea thatsocial interactions are vital to decisions regarding contraceptive use. Indeed, in the light of this literature, the quintessential social interaction related to contraception is rumors circulating through a community about someonewho suffered a serious illness as the result of having used a method. A last finding from the psychological literature that adds further importance to such rumors and echoes Shedlin and Hollerbach's emphasis on cognitiveJOSEPH E. P OTTER 711 Click to return to Table of Contentsmodels of human reproduction refers to \"the importance of pre-existing beliefs and theories about causation, which function as mental frameworks through which new evidence is interpreted\" (Montgomery 1996: 24). Thus, if a woman's mental model of the menstrual cycle and the uterus is suchthat she believes inserting an IUD would have severe consequences, then it will take a great deal of personally verified information to the contrary for this person to be willing to accept this method. 6 The role of medical practitioners At least in part because of the importance of the fear of health consequences,doctors trained in Western medicine have played an important part in shap-ing patterns of contraceptive practice. Often they either constitute or con- trol the sources of new contraceptive methods, and they are the authority that must attest to their safety and efficacy. They may prescribe, recom-mend, or offer a contraceptive method or surgical sterilization to their pa- tients. 7 This prescription or recommendation may specify the exact brand or dosage, as well as the timing and manner of its use or execution. In sodoing, the medical practitioner or his or her superiors may be singling out one technology, such as a specific kind of IUD or manner of performing a sterilization, from an array of possible choices. These choices are not nor-mally left to individual patients. Once a method has been prescribed or recommended, the medical prac- titioner explains how the method works, how it should be used, and whatside effects to expect. He or she may also provide information and assur- ance as to the safety and effectiveness of the method. The final role of the doctor or medical practitioner is to monitor use of the method by the ac-ceptor. The doctor may have to check that there are no complications from use such as pelvic inflammatory disease in the case of an IUD, to provide explanations and assurances regarding the \"normality\" of certain relativelybenign side effects such as increased menstrual bleeding, and to propose the use of an alternative method should the acceptor be dissatisfied or suf- fer serious complications of use. In these functions and exchanges between a physician and a patient, there is a widely recognized difference between the two parties. As Ken- neth Arrow wrote nearly four decades ago with regard to medical care moregenerally: \"Because medical knowledge is so complicated, the information possessed by the physician as to the consequences and possibilities of treat- ment is necessarily very much greater than that of the patient, or at least soit is believed by both parties\" (1963: 951). It is this asymmetry in knowl- edge that makes \"the setting up of a relationship of trust and confidence\" so important to both patients and doctors (1963: 965). In the realm of contra-ceptive counseling, patients' fears of contraceptive methods and sometimes712 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentswavering motivation to use them provide ample scope for a doctor to play a large role in guiding individuals through the process of adopting and prac- ticing a method.8 The second general feature of medical care and the role of physicians that is relevant to contraceptive adoption also stems from the complexity of medical knowledge and technology and the uncertainty that surrounds them. In making recommendations concerning contraceptives, doctors face a widerange of choice. Moreover, with regard to the safety and efficacy of differ- ent contraceptives, the professional literature is too large to master, 9 and it would be difficult for a single practitioner to accumulate enough patientsaccepting a new contraceptive method to be able draw his or her own in- ferences about how well it works. Here, as in many other areas of medi- cine, \"The inference problem confronting doctors who wish to determine theefficacy of any specific intervention is hellishly complex . . . \" (Phelps 1992: 34). Phelps has argued that an important consequence of this contextual feature of medical practice is that doctors tend to conform closely to \"localpatterns of practice.\" On the one hand, \"In this model, when 'schools of thought' get established in a specific locality, the costs of gathering relevant evidence to alter those beliefs will often be large, if not prohibitive. Thus, local'schools' can emerge and persist that hold different beliefs about the efficacy of an intervention\" (1992: 31). On the other hand, conforming to local pat- terns is an excellent defense against charges of negligence, a standard com-monly applied in malpractice law. What is surprising, though, is the enor- mous variation across communities and countries in the frequency with which a wide variety of medical procedures are performed. Such variationcannot be explained by plausible differences in demand, and authors such as Scitovsky (1992) and Phelps (1992) can only account for it in terms of in- complete diffusion of information. Seen in this larger context, the wide varia-tion in contraceptive use patterns shown in Table 1 seems less anomalous. Social interactions, positive feedback, and path dependence in models of contraceptive adoption I now consider the nature, extent, and consequences of the various posi- tive feedback loops that are present in the broad process of contraceptive adoption. If multiple and forceful sources of positive reinforcement are op- erating in this process, then it becomes easier to understand why societieshave arrived at such widely varying method mixes. The recent economic literature on increasing returns and path depen- dence suggests at least four possible sources of positive feedback in adopt-ing new and competing contraceptive technologies (Arthur 1983, 1989, 1993; Bikhchandani, Hirschleifer, and Welch 1998; David 1985, 1993; Dosi 1991). First, spillover effects known as coordination externalities provide in-JOSEPH E. P OTTER 713 Click to return to Table of Contentscentives for agents to adopt the dominant technology and do whatever other agents are doing. If, say, the pill is the dominant method, a prospective user can count on a large number of outlets that stock adequate supplies, as well as availability of trained professionals able to recognize and treat the method'sside effects. The same reasoning holds for doctors. As more and more of their colleagues prescribe or provide a method, they can draw on the expe- rience that these doctors have in supervising the use of the method or per-forming the requisite procedure. A second source of positive reinforcement derives from learning . The more experience is gained with a contraceptive technology, the more it isimproved. That is, the technology itself changes for the better the more it is used. 10 Learning is perhaps most obvious with respect to providers. For ex- ample, the more practice providers gain inserting IUDs, the more skillfulthey become with the procedure; the more experience they have prescrib- ing pills, the more they learn about varying the dosage to relieve specific side effects. But there is also learning by producers and users of contracep-tive methods that leads to improvement of the technology. Examples are found in the evolution of formulations for the pill from high to very low doses of estrogen, and in the improvements in the design of IUDs. The third source of positive reinforcement arises not from any con- crete aspect of the technology itself but from information about its use. This is the positive feedback that lies at the heart of most accounts of diffusionand social interaction; it has particular relevance to technologies that are perceived to be risky. 11 The information in question is not simply about the existence of a technology but also about the risks and consequences of adopt-ing it (Montgomery and Casterline 1996). The need for information con- cerning the practicality, safety, and effectiveness of new contraceptive tech- nologies is felt not only by prospective acceptors but also by the medicalpractitioners who provide these technologies (Phelps 1992). From either perspective, however, the more widely a method is used, the more will be known about how it fares in practice. Other things equal, risk-averse per-sons may be expected to opt for a technology that their peers have used successfully. On the other hand, as more women adopt a new method, the number of individuals who experienced or are perceived to have experi-enced an undesirable health outcome from using the method may also in- crease, leading to rumors that may have a strong adverse effect on a method's acceptability. 12 Social influence is one further source of increasing returns. Montgom- ery and Casterline (1996) suggest that, through peer group pressure, women may feel obliged to do what everybody else in their social network does.Incentives to conform may be even stronger for medical practitioners than they are for women. As noted above, according to Phelps, \"local patterns of practice\" are often the standard against which the actions taken by an indi-714 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsvidual physician are compared in the event that he or she is being evalu- ated or that an inquiry is held to determine negligence (1992: 35). To summarize, the process of adopting new contraceptive technolo- gies involves four distinct but complementary sources of increasing returns:coordination externalities, learning, information, and social influence. More- over, each of these operates with respect to the providers as well as the users of contraceptive methods. What can be said about a process of tech-nology adoption that contains such sources of positive feedback? A general answer is available from the literature on increasing returns, path depen- dence, and information cascades. In theoretical models and simulations, \"theeconomy, under circumstances of increasing returns, can become 'locked- in' to a future technological path that is neither guaranteed to be efficient nor entirely predictable in advance\" (Arthur 1983: 14). In these models,which are said to be path-dependent and non-ergodic (David 1985), rela- tively small disturbances or chance events become magnified by the posi- tive feedbacks, and there is no sure way to predict the technology that willcome to dominate the market. Rather, history matters, sometimes more than underlying preferences, endowments, and opportunity sets. The transformation of the meaning and nature of a technology There is a striking similarity between the issues raised in Arthur's and David's discussions of the implications of positive feedbacks and those that anthro- pologists have brought up in their critique of diffusion. Kreager (1993), inhis succinct review of the debates on this subject that have occurred since the 1890s, warns that in their enthusiasm for the concept of diffusion in population studies, contemporary analysts would do well to avoid past mis-takes. Drawing on Dosi's review of a number of studies of innovation diffu- sion (1991), Kreager argues that there is more to the adoption of new tech- nologies than individual choices based on instrumental factors. He observesthat \"decisions are the outcomes of collective processes\"; and that, in the course of adoption, \"technologies and practices acquire a range of new and culturally-specific meanings\" (1993: 315). He quotes Malinowski's state-ment that \"whenever one culture 'borrows' from another, it always trans- forms and readapts the objects or customs borrowed. . . . In this process of readaptation the form and function, often the very nature, of the object oridea is deeply modified\u2014it has to be, in short, reinvented\" (1993: 315). The conclusion in this discussion is similar to that drawn from the analy- sis of increasing returns: the adoption process is both cumulative and open-ended. The anthropological critique, however, introduces the additional di- mension of meaning , with the attendant anthropological discourse concerning culture as the \"tacit knowledge that enables people to make active responsesJOSEPH E. P OTTER 715 Click to return to Table of Contentsto changing circumstances as they arise, successively reinterpreting the meaning of those circumstances and the several courses of behaviour that count as a response to them\" (Kreager 1993: 319; Hammel 1990). The im- plication for contraceptive choice may be clarified by way of an example.The condom is now being promoted around the world as a means of ac- complishing two distinct objectives: the prevention of pregnancy and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. Forty years ago in South Ameri-can countries such as Argentina condoms were generally available in the bathrooms of bars to men who might be considering having sex with a pros- titute. Condoms were seen as a response to the health risks entailed in suchencounters. They were not seen, or considered acceptable, as a means to prevent pregnancy within marriage. Argentinean couples in the 1950s, like those in much of Europe a few decades earlier, attained quite low levels ofmarital fertility while relying on withdrawal rather than the condom. A different outcome evolved at about the same time in Japan, where the con- dom came to be the principal means of preventing pregnancy within mar-riage (Coleman 1981). The question of scale Where does this discussion of the literature on contraceptive choice, cogni-tive psychology, and path dependence lead us? The process of adopting new contraceptive technologies involves a variety of positive feedback loops for both clients and their doctors. This reinforcement means that what hap-pened some time ago has a determinant bearing on what takes place in the present, even when there has been a major change in the environment. There may also be specificity in the way that methods are actually practiceddue to adaptations that have been made over time of particular contracep- tive technologies, and the meanings that they have acquired. The scale of the community within which these choices and adapta- tions are made, however, will depend on communication between agents. Bongaarts and Watkins (1996) stressed that social interactions related to fertility change occur at a variety of levels, not only within localities butalso across large territories, including national boundaries. On the other hand, much of the impetus and underpinning for theorizing about the role of networks in contraceptive choice has been the persistence of otherwiseunexplainable differences in method mix across communities (Rogers and Kincaid 1981; Entwistle et al. 1996). Indeed, the first attempt to explicitly model contraceptive adoption as depending on word-of-mouth communi-cation across networks focused on replicating the persistence of \"village- level\" variation in method mix (Kohler 1997a, 1997b). In this study, Kohler showed that, under a series of possible conditions concerning the precisionof the information exchanged, decision rules, and the role of social influence,716 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsword-of-mouth communication leads to path-dependent adoption of con- traceptive methods within communities. Here, the method mix that a com- munity becomes committed to is heavily influenced by the initial condi- tions and \"does not converge to the socially optimal adoption level\" (pp. 91-92). Broadening the conceptualization of adoption to include the choices made by doctors as well as users, and considering interactions beyond those based on word-of-mouth communication, lead to the expectation that therespective networks range well beyond villages or local communities. While broader ties may help to explain the speed and reach of the contraceptive adoption process observed in recent years (Bongaarts and Watkins 1996),they also raise the possibility that the commitment or \"locking-in\" to par- ticular configurations will have wider and more serious consequences. In the remainder of this article, I review the history of the promotion and adop-tion of modern contraceptive methods in Mexico and Brazil from this per- spective. In each case, I consider what happened in the early stages of adop- tion and then assess the problematic aspects of contemporary contraceptivepractice that had their origin in the earlier period. In both countries, doc- tors appear to have played an important role in the choice process and to have been heavily influenced by the behavior of their peers. Mexico Extending the national family planning program to rural areas: 1977-86 The Mexican government launched a population policy in 1973 with a view toward reducing the rate of population growth, but not until 1977 was aconcerted decision made to promote family planning in the rural areas of the country. 13 The rural population had much higher rates of fertility and much lower contraceptive prevalence than the urban population. Althoughrural fertility was very high with a total fertility rate of about 7.4 births per woman (CONAPO 1997), it had declined slightly from the peak levels it had reached by the start of the decade. Contraceptive practice, which was virtuallynil as late as 1970 (Garc\u00eda 1976), had increased to the point where 14 per- cent of married women were using some kind of method. Rural Mexico was characterized by widespread poverty, a virtual absence of employmentin nonagricultural activities, and dispersed villages. Most outside observers as well as those involved in implementing the population policy regarded the task of promoting increased contraceptive practice and lower fertility inrural areas as a major challenge (Alba and Potter 1986; Jain 1998). The public health institutions to which this task was delegated em- barked on a major initiative to extend their reach into rural areas. The Min-JOSEPH E. P OTTER 717 Click to return to Table of Contentsistry of Health's (SSA) Rural Health Program began by recruiting commu- nity health workers in over 11,000 communities (Elu de Lenero 1982). In the later years of the 1976-82 administration of President Lopez Portillo, after an unforeseen change in the cabinet, this program gave way to a muchbetter-endowed rural health program administered by the Mexican Insti- tute of Social Security (IMSS). Instead of relying on the existing infrastruc- ture as the SSA program had, this initiative involved building over 3,000rural health clinics and some 73 regional hospitals (Alarcon and Martinez 1986). Drawing on the regular IMSS infrastructure, but targeted toward people living in places with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants who were not yetserved by any of the public institutions, the IMSS-COPLAMAR 14 program greatly increased the number of physicians\u2014for the most part interns per- forming their required year of social service\u2014practicing in rural Mexico. In these rural programs, SSA and IMSS each placed strong emphasis on family planning, intending to make services and supplies available in the villages and promoting their use (Alarcon 1982; Potter, Mojarro, andNu\u00f1ez 1987). To motivate the doctors, nurses, community health workers, and parteras (traditional birth attendants) to recruit new acceptors of hor- monal methods, the IUD, and female sterilization, the administrators as-signed hospitals and clinics monthly targets for new acceptors. These tar- gets were usually method-specific, and, especially in the IMSS program, the highest priority was assigned to the IUD and female sterilization. The criti-cal statistic for public hospitals and maternity clinics was the percentage of mothers who accepted one of these methods immediately following delivery. To get a perspective on how providers responded to the program, in 1984 colleagues at IMSS and I visited a representative sample of villages with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants in the 1970 census that had fallen within the sampling frame of the 1981 Rural Survey of Family Planning. Most ofthe doctors and nurses and many of the midwives providing maternal and child health services to the selected villages were interviewed, irrespective of whether they practiced in the village or in a nearby town, or whetherthey were in the public or private sector. We were interested in learning how these providers perceived their own situation vis-\u00e0-vis the program, how they viewed their clients, and what they did to recruit acceptors. Theinformation obtained in this survey provides a glimpse into the early his- tory of the spread of modern contraceptive practice in rural Mexico. For the large majority of doctors in the public health institutions whom we interviewed, people's fear of modern methods was the greatest obstacle to recruiting contraceptive acceptors. In the perception of doctors, resistance to family planning derived much more from rumors concerning the healtheffects of contraception than from lack of motivation to regulate fertility. Fully 90 percent of the doctors and 94 percent of the nurses in our sample believed that their patients were afraid to use particular methods. They were718 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsespecially emphatic with respect to the fear that women had of the IUD, and fear, rumors, and misinformation were the main reasons they gave for the lack of demand for the method.15 Ninety-one percent of the doctors and 83 percent of the nurses responding reported that their patients were afraidof tubal ligations. Most doctors and nurses said that when they encountered a woman who was afraid to use a method, they would try to convince her that itwould do no harm. Besides providing an understandable explanation of how the method \"worked\" or what was involved in its use, their principal means of convincing clients of the safety of a method was to point to women inthe community who were using it successfully. By drawing upon their own clinical practice to promote the exchange of positive experiences between women, they quite consciously attempted to foster diffusion. Their strategyin promoting family planning was to continue mentioning the topic and insisting on its merit. Once a few people came to accept the idea, they could be used as examples to bring others around. The doctors, nurses, community health workers, and traditional mid- wives who promoted family planning in rural Mexico were themselves closely tied together by the public health institutions that employed or en-gaged them. The doctors in the small rural clinics were visited regularly by their supervisors, and the community health workers and midwives were called to attend quarterly meetings for training and to exchange experi-ences. Those responsible for districts or regions were, in turn, called to state or national-level meetings. As a result of this socialization and in response to the guidelines and priorities transmitted down the chain of supervision,the practitioners we interviewed gave nearly uniform answers to our ques- tions regarding the type of methods they would recommend under differ- ent circumstances, and believed that the IUD and female sterilization weresuitable postpartum methods. They also agreed on the number of children women should have and on how the birth of these children should be spaced. In retrospect, the early phase of the Mexican program successfully met many of the objectives that had been set for it. The prevalence of contra- ceptive use among married women of childbearing age in rural areas in- creased from 14 percent in 1976 to 27 percent in 1981 and 33 percent in1987. The emphasis was on recruiting acceptors and lowering the rural fer- tility rate, and at least the hospital-based portion of this program appears to have made a significant contribution to these goals (Potter, Mojarro, andNu\u00f1ez 1987). Clearly, the Mexican program also fostered an intervention- ist style of acting on the part of the personnel who were charged with put- ting it into practice. Mexican authorities responsible for health and popula-tion policy would later find this manner of promoting family planning unacceptable and ineffective, but during the first decade of the program the style became entrenched.JOSEPH E. P OTTER 719 Click to return to Table of ContentsThe problematic reliance on postpartum contraception in contemporary rural Mexico The opening of the Mexican political system and developments in the in- ternational arena such as the international conferences in Cairo and Beijing changed the context in which the Mexican national family planning pro- gram functions. The number of institutions and organizations that take anactive interest in family planning, population, and the status of women has increased markedly. Many of these institutions and organizations are both responding to and fomenting demands for greater autonomy and a widerand improved array of services related to maternal health care and contra- ception. Some, such as the Catholic Church, the Partido de Acci\u00f3n Nacional, and a number of the organizations representing women's interests, are openlycritical of the government's actions in this area. As a consequence, both the visibility and the political repercussions of population policy issues are now much greater than they were a decade ago. The second major change in context is the decline in fertility and the increase in contraceptive practice that have taken place. The total fertility rate for rural Mexico in 1995 is estimated to have fallen below four, andcontraceptive prevalence among married women was about 53 percent. 16 Shown below, for married rural women, is the proportion of current usersrelying on various methods of contraception in 1995 as well as in 1981,when prevalence was about half the 1995 level. The table shows a concen- tration of use in 1995 among just two methods, female sterilization and the IUD. The proportion of use accounted for by these two methods more thandoubled over the 14-year period, while the share of hormonal methods fell sharply.

Rather the current goals are to reach those segments of the rural popula- tion that have low rates of contraceptive prevalence and to promote changesin the timing of fertility by delaying the first birth and increasing the spac- ing between subsequent births. 17 With respect to the latter goals, however, the heavy emphasis on postpartum IUD insertions and tubal ligations pre-720 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentssents cause for concern. IUDs are rarely used prior to the first birth, and the demographic impact of the high rates of surgical sterilization is limited since the procedure is mostly performed on higher-parity women who would not have many additional children. Indeed, the 1995 survey indicates that amongrural women who were sterilized since 1990, 52 percent had five or more children and 27 percent were over age 35. There is also concern among Mexican authorities regarding access to both sterilization and the IUD since most of these procedures are performed immediately following delivery in public hospitals. The use of these meth- ods is limited among women who deliver in private maternity clinics orwho deliver at home with a traditional midwife\u2014the latter are usually the poorest women and those who live in remote villages. The table below shows the distribution of mothers in 1990-95, in percent, by contraceptive useaccording to place of delivery. In particular, it highlights the proportions of mothers who accepted either an IUD or sterilization following the birth of their last child, distinguishing between postpartum and later procedures.This table refers only to the rural respondents from the nine states that were assigned high priority by the national family planning program and that were sampled most heavily in the detailed survey of family planning(ENAPLAF) undertaken by CONAPO in 1995. 18 Contraceptive use (percent) among mothers by place of last delivery Other At home/ IMSS public Private traditional Allhospital N=534 N=492 N=1147 N=2841 IUD 28.7 10.3 9.4 Postpartum sterilization 20.3 22.3 13.3 1.8 11.6Later IUD or sterilization 9.8 9.8 10.1 8.5 9.3Currently using another modern method 10.6 15.9 23.6 9.4 12.9 The last row in the table shows the percentage of women who had a child since 1990 who are currently using a modern method of contraception other than the IUD or sterilization. Postpartum procedures are far more fre- quent in public than in private hospitals, but private patients make greateruse of other modern methods. The large number of women who deliver at home, with a traditional midwife, have no access to postpartum IUDs or sterilization, make only moderate use of these methods later in the birthinterval, and are relatively unlikely to be using any other modern contracep- tive methods. Besides its limited demographic impact, another problem with the gov- ernment program relates to the way acceptors of IUDs and female steriliza-JOSEPH E. P OTTER 721 Click to return to Table of Contentstion were recruited in public hospitals. In the rural areas of the nine states, 52 percent of current users of the IUD had the device inserted immediately following their last delivery while they were still in the hospital. This pro- portion was 67 percent for IUD users who obtained the method from IMSShospitals and 36 percent for users who obtained the IUD from another pub- lic institution. Between them, these two sources account for 93 percent of all current IUD users in these rural areas. Some questions included in the1995 survey asked about the procedures that were followed when women had their IUDs inserted. The responses indicate that the interventionist style fostered in the early phase of the Mexican program has remained prevalentmore than a decade later. The decision to use the IUD was often made very close to the time of insertion, without following an appropriately elaborate procedure guaranteeing informed consent. 19 Evidence from the survey regarding postpartum sterilization also war- rants concern. Of all rural women who were sterilized since 1990 in the nine states, 84 percent were operated on in a public-sector institution: 53percent in IMSS hospitals and 31 percent in other public institutions. Of these public-sector sterilizations, 70 percent were performed immediately following delivery in IMSS hospitals and 74 percent in other public hospi-tals. The decision to operate was taken while the woman was in the hospi- tal in 42 percent of the IMSS postpartum sterilizations and 32 percent of the other public cases. These survey results are indicative of heavy-handed tactics by medical personnel, and certainly suggest procedures that diverge from the guide- lines for the government family program that were adopted in 1994 follow-ing the Cairo conference. In that year, in line with international recom- mendations, administration of family planning services was relocated to a Reproductive Health Directorate in the Ministry of Health, and a uniformset of Normative Guidelines was established to cover the implementation of family planning services in all public-sector institutions. The emphasis in the Guidelines as well as in the rhetoric of the government program was onguaranteeing freedom of choice and improving the quality of the care pro- vided, rather than on meeting specific targets for the number of acceptors and contraceptive prevalence. To investigate the seeming divergence between rhetoric and practice and to assess the quality of family planning services provided to the popu- lation of the nine priority states, in late 1996 CONAPO undertook a surveyof the clinics, hospitals, and practitioners providing family planning serv- ices in the communities included in the ENAPLAF sample. Analysis of these data is in progress, but several conclusions can be drawn from the initialtabulations. Prominent among them is that the Normative Guidelines are not widely known or disseminated. Among the practitioners who responded to the survey, only 40 percent of medical doctors in public institutions re-ported having seen a copy of this document in the institution where they722 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsworked, and less than a third of these doctors claimed that they consulted it regularly. On the other hand, all doctors questioned were well aware of the targets that existed for family planning acceptors. Virtually all of them said that their institution had numerical family planning targets, and more thanhalf of the doctors had targets set for their own personal performance. In many respects, the story told by the doctors in 1996 was similar to the one we heard in 1984. The doctors recognized the need for family plan-ning in rural areas, and they believed that rural women would be better off having a limited number of children. In 1996, as before, the doctors be- lieved that women were afraid of the IUD and surgical sterilization becauseof rumors and inaccurate information, but that these were the most effec- tive methods and the ones they recommended most frequently. However, with the larger presence and coverage of the public health institutions, andmany more acceptors of the two methods they promoted most intensively, the government program had come to predominate over private medical sources of modern contraception or other indigenous or market-based ap-proaches to seeking contraceptive advice or supplies. This point may be illustrated with an exceptional experience that proves the rule. In 1998, my colleagues and I went to a remote and impoverishedtown where the respondents in 1995 had included an unusually high pro- portion of users of the rhythm method. Rhythm was still the predominant method. Its use in the village had been initiated by a local mother who hadbecome a community leader and recommended the method to others. Com- munity members, in turn, had resisted the efforts of the nearest IMSS clinic to persuade mothers to adopt other, more effective methods. This \"inde-pendent\" village contraceptive history, which closely resembles those re- ported by Entwistle et al. (1996) for the Nang Rong villages in Thailand, was anomalous in the Mexican context where the government institutionsalmost always overrode local initiatives. The 1995 survey of women and the 1996 survey of medical practi- tioners both point to the persistence of a particular way of promoting andpracticing contraception that had originated 15 to 20 years ago. This pat- tern was the outgrowth of directives issued in the early stage of Mexico's national family planning program. These in turn became institutionalizedin the IMSS and the Ministry of Health and as recently as 1998 appeared to be resistant to the directives and guidelines issued in response to the pro- nounced changes that have taken place in the demographic and politicalcontext. No one in or out of the Mexican government would argue that the situation is set in stone, but meaningful reform clearly constitutes a difficult challenge. Not only is there a need to raise women's awareness of the op-tions that should be open to them, but a substantial investment is required to motivate medical practitioners and program administrators to develop alternative ways of providing family planning services.JOSEPH E. P OTTER 723 Click to return to Table of ContentsBrazil Adopting modern contraception in the presence of supply restrictions: 1964-80 The early stage of the process of adopting modern contraceptive methods in Brazil is less well documented than it is in Mexico. Nevertheless, one may identify circumstances that led to predominant dependence on the pill and female sterilization and that promoted a clearly inferior technology for per-forming the latter. The initial period of the Brazilian fertility transition may be identified as extending from the mid-1960s until 1980. A sample survey of urban women showed the fertility levels and contraceptive prevalenceexisting in 1964 in Rio de Janeiro, where control of marital fertility first appeared in Brazil. The total fertility rate was about 3.7, but there was little use of modern contraception. Fewer than 3 percent of married respondentswere using the pill, 6 percent were sterilized, 10 percent used a barrier method, while 20 percent employed traditional methods such as the douche, rhythm, and withdrawal (CELADE and CFSC 1972). Fertility in the rest ofthe country was much higher, and use of contraception was much less preva- lent. The total fertility rate for Brazil as a whole in the early 1960s was about six (Bercovich, Martins, and Oliveira 1994). By 1975-80, the national total fertility rate had fallen to about 4.3, and fertility was declining in virtually all of the heavily populated regions of the country including the impoverished Northeast, where fertility hadbeen very high (Committee on Population and Demography 1983). Con- traceptive practice centered on the pill and female sterilization. The survey information for this period was collected in contraceptive prevalence sur-veys conducted in the highly industrialized southeastern state of S\u00e3o Paulo and in the northeastern states of Piau\u00ed, Bahia, Para\u00edba, Pernambuco, and Rio Grande do Norte. 20 Use of contraception among women in union aged 15-44 varied from 64 percent in S\u00e3o Paulo to 31 percent in Piau\u00ed. The per- centage of these women using particular methods of contraception in these two states is shown below: Female Any Pills sterilization Condom Rhythm Withdrawal Other method S\u00e3o Paulo 27.9 15.6 6.5 5.2 7.3 1.4 63.9 Piau\u00ed 10.1 15.4 0.1 2.6 2.5 0.2 30.9 SOURCE: Population Information Program (1981). The surveys showed negligible use of IUDs or injectable contraception in either state. The ratio of sterilization to pills is much higher in Piau\u00ed than724 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsin S\u00e3o Paulo, while the use of traditional methods is much lower in Piau\u00ed. Before turning to the evidence on the proportion of sterilizations conducted during cesarean sections in this period, a brief description of the institu- tional context in which this process of contraceptive adoption was takingplace is pertinent. 21 The 1964-80 period in Brazilian history began with a coup that led to 25 years of military government. Among the coup's more immediate ef-fects were the suppression of many forms of public debate and expression and the initiation of massive efforts to promote industrialization and na- tional integration. The Brazilian state made substantial commitments to ex-panding consumer credit, telecommunications, social security, and health care, and very substantial increases in the reach of all of these services were achieved in the post-1964 period (Faria 1989). In the context of extreme income inequality and expanding public in- vestments, there was a major transformation in Brazilian medicine and public health policy toward specialized, hospital-based curative care in place ofthe prevention and control of the \"diseases of underdevelopment.\" 22 The 1964-80 period witnessed a sharp rise in hospitalizations, especially for sur- gical interventions in private hospitals affiliated with the social security sys-tem. Following the reform and unification of the social security system in 1967, hospital admissions grew by more than 400 percent in ten years (Rodrigues Filho 1991). Between 1971 and 1980, the number of hospitaladmissions paid for by the social security system in urban areas increased from 2.9 million to 9.6 million, while the percentage of the entire popula- tion admitted to a hospital during one year increased from 3.2 percent in1971 to 8.8 percent in 1979. By the end of the period, 76 percent of all hospital care was paid for by the social security system, and 80 percent of medical facilities with beds belonged to the private sector (World Bank 1994).This rapidly expanding, publicly funded, yet highly privatized medical sys- tem had to meet the demand for contraception and birth limitation that emerged during this period. Despite the attention given to the evolving position of the Brazilian government on population issues (Fonseca Sobrinho 1993) and to the ac- tivities of organizations such as BEMFAM, the International Planned Par-enthood affiliate (Martine 1996), most of the response to the demand for contraception in Brazil took place in the private medical sector. Pills manu- factured in Brazil were sold over the counter in pharmacies beginning inthe early 1960s. Annual production rose steeply from 1.7 million cycles in 1964 to 13.5 million cycles in 1970 and to 61.2 million cycles in 1980. Be- sides regular commercial distribution through pharmacies, a significant num-ber of cycles were distributed by BEMFAM, but in 1976 these amounted to only about 9 percent of all the cycles produced in Brazil (Merrick and Berquo 1983). 23JOSEPH E. P OTTER 725 Click to return to Table of ContentsOne of the main reasons underlying the demand for surgical steriliza- tion in Brazil was that many women found the pill to be an unsatisfactory method of birth control for long-term use.24 The provision of sterilization, however, was complicated by regulations that made its practice virtuallyillegal and prevented physicians and hospitals from seeking reimbursement for procedures under the government's medical insurance program that funded about 80 percent of the surgical procedures being performed in Brazil.For physicians as well as hospitals, the remunerative way out of this regu- latory dilemma involved the use of cesarean section deliveries. During this period, the reimbursement for a cesarean delivery was greater than for avaginal delivery. This fact, combined with the argument that a cesarean section exposed a woman to high health risks in case of further pregnan- cies, contributed to creating a rationale for performing sterilizations duringcesarean sections. The doctors and hospitals profited since the cost of the tubal ligation was subsumed under the cost of the cesarean delivery by the hospital, and the attending physician might also receive a side payment. 25 For women, the opportunity to obtain a sterilization whose costs were cov- ered by health insurance presumably made a cesarean delivery an attrac- tive alternative, even among those whose previous delivery had been vagi-nal. Moreover, among the growing number of women who were giving birth to a first or subsequent child by cesarean section, the possibility of a progressively weakening uterus constituted an additional motivation for ob-taining a sterilization (Fa\u00fandes and Cecatti 1993). In view of the formal restrictions on sterilizations and the limited num- ber of contraceptive options available, this system made sense to both womenand obstetricians. Undoubtedly, it also led to a substantial increase in the prevalence of unnecessary cesarean section deliveries, with consequent in- creases in maternal morbidity. Prevalence surveys conducted in 1980 in thenortheastern states of Bahia, Para\u00edba, Pernambuco, and Rio Grande do Norte record that of all women who had been sterilized, about 60 percent were sterilized during a cesarean delivery (Janowitz et al. 1985). Data for laterperiods suggest that the proportion of sterilizations performed during ce- sarean deliveries was considerably higher than this level in other regions of the country. 26 The contraceptive adoption process in the early years of the Brazilian fertility decline contrasts sharply with that in Mexico. Most services were provided by private physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies rather than bygovernment doctors, hospitals, and clinics. Moreover, government regula- tions in Brazil tended to restrict rather than promote the use of contracep- tion. Yet, during this period, a formally illegal method of birth control gainedwidespread acceptance by women and physicians, all of whom were clearly responsive to the prevailing set of incentives and who together developed a seemingly perverse but innovative contraceptive culture. This process in-726 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsvolved the rejection of alternative technologies, notably the IUD, which was promoted so energetically in Mexico but which never gained a foothold in the Brazilian market in spite of a number of experimental research projects that pioneered its use.27 The narrow mix of methods and the high rate of cesarean sections in contemporary Brazil Between 1980 and the mid-1990s, Brazil experienced the gradual advent of democratic elections for municipal, state, and federal government posts and the end of a long period of military rule. Along with democratizationcame a large increase in the number and vitality of the organizations in- volved in public discussions regarding family planning, population, and women's health and empowerment. Out of the ensuing debate, the Pro-gram of Integrated Assistance to Women's Health (PAISM) was conceived in 1983 and instituted in 1986 with the objective of providing comprehen- sive health care for women of reproductive age, including the provision ofa wide array of contraceptive services by publicly financed health centers. While PAISM remained more a set of aspirations than a functioning system during its first decade (Costa 1992 and Corr\u00eaa 1993), it served to crystalizedebate as democratization proceeded. Finally, the 1994 International Con- ference on Population and Development served as a catalyst to define and propagate Brazil's position on issues related to family planning and repro-ductive health. 28 While the Brazilian government guarantees women the right to an adequate supply of contraceptive services to be provided by publicly financedhealth services, in contrast to the Mexican policy it does not promote fertil- ity decline, nor does it set targets with respect to population growth or the adoption of contraception. Implementation of PAISM also coincided with areform in the government's procedures for financing health care that in- volved a considerable delegation of authority to state and municipal gov- ernments and limited the ability of the federal Ministry of Health to imple-ment national policies of this sort. Two further policy developments related to the use of cesarean section deliveries and surgical sterilization deserve mention. First, starting in the late 1970s in response to the rapid increase inthe rate of cesarean deliveries, the schedule for reimbursing deliveries was adjusted so as to reduce and eventually eliminate the premium paid for cesarean as compared to vaginal deliveries. Second, the Brazilian Congresspassed legislation in August 1997 intended to legalize and regulate the use of sterilization in public hospitals. I return to this law and the current policy issues confronting the Brazilian government after reviewing the recent evo-lution of contraceptive practice. Two nationally representative sample surveys collecting data on con- traceptive practice in Brazil were carried out in 1986. In that year, BEMFAMJOSEPH E. P OTTER 727 Click to return to Table of Contentsconducted a Brazilian round of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics added a module on contraceptive practice to the annual National Sample Survey of Households. In 1996, there was a second DHS, again implemented by BEMFAM. Whilethese surveys revealed a large increase in the practice of contraception, with prevalence among married women reaching 66 percent in 1986 and 77 per- cent ten years later, the 1996 survey also showed an apparent further nar-rowing of the mix of methods practiced in Brazil. The percentage of cur- rently married women aged 15-44 currently using particular methods is shown below for the 1986 and 1996 surveys: Female Any Year Orals sterilization Condom Rhythm Withdrawal Other method 1986 25.2 26.9 1.5 4.2 4.4 3.6 66.0 1996 20.7 40.1 4.4 3.0 3.1 5.4 76.7 SOURCES: National Survey of Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning, 1986 (DHS); National Survey on Demography and Health, 1996 (DHS). The proportion of all contraceptive practice accounted for by female steril- ization among married women rose from 41 percent to 52 percent during the ten years. Use of oral contraceptives declined over the decade, but in 1996it remained the only other widely used modern method of contraception. The ever-increasing reliance on surgical sterilization evident in these data seems to run counter to PAISM's stated goal of making a broad arrayof methods available to the population, and counter to the continuation of restrictions on the use and availability of surgical sterilization. On the other hand, considering the lack of experience with alternatives to the pill, aswell as the apparent desire of mothers of two or more children to terminate their childbearing, it is logical that the use of female sterilization that had first manifested itself in Brazil in the 1970s would have increased in subse-quent years. What is less understandable is why the unusual way of per- forming these procedures that emerged in the earlier period would also have persisted to the present time. Not only had there been changes in the mean-time in the schedules for reimbursing hospitals for different types of deliv- ery, but hospitals relying on the government health insurance system were coming under increasing pressure to control their costs by, among otherthings, limiting the number of unnecessary surgical interventions. Data from the 1996 DHS referring to the sterilizations performed in the five years preceding the survey show that for the country as a whole,60 percent of sterilizations were performed during a cesarean section. This fraction was by no means uniform throughout Brazil. While the fraction of sterilizations conducted during a cesarean was only 40 percent in the North-728 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentseast, it was 71 percent in the rest of the country. Leaving aside the question of how and why the practice of sterilization is so different in the Northeast, the finding that conforms to the general argument being advanced in this article is the persistence, in most parts of the country, of a technology for carry-ing out sterilizations that reflects incentives that prevailed decades earlier. The practice and consolidation of surgical delivery and surgical steril- ization in Brazil were, of course, mutually reinforcing phenomena. The highfraction of sterilizations performed during cesarean sections derives from the high fraction of all births delivered surgically. Not only does a cesarean present an opportunity to perform a sterilization, but the fact of having hadmultiple cesareans is a justification and motivation for sterilization. The fol- lowing table shows the proportion of births delivered by cesarean section during 1991-96. There is a pronounced differential according to the type ofhospital where the birth took place, and in the Northeast as compared to the rest of the country. The most telling statistic is that some 72 percent of all births at private hospitals that do not accept government health insur-ance are cesareans. Cesareans, on the other hand, constitute less than a third of all births in public hospitals, and 45 percent of all births at private hospitals, the so-called conveniados , that accept government health insur- ance. In general, there is little variation in the cesarean rate by birth order such that, in a given type of hospital, the overall rate is similar to that for first births. Finally, there is a large difference in the prevalence of cesareansbetween the Northeast region and the rest of Brazil, with cesareans being less frequent in the Northeast. Type of hospital Region Rest of Birth Private Public Conveniado Northeast Brazil Brazil order (N=605) (N=3064) (N=763) (N=2755) (N=2226) (N=4981) 1st 70.6 33.1 74.0 36.1 50.0 26.3 51.9 44.23rd 76.4 33.8 52.8 26.1 49.4 41.34th and higher 53.5 21.6 22.5 9.3 27.4 18.7 All births 71.5 31.6 44.5 20.6 45.6 36.9 SOURCE: National Survey on Demography and Health, 1996 (DHS). The original pattern in which sterilization was closely tied to cesarean sections is still dominant in most of Brazil. Apart from the Northeast, 71 percent of all sterilizations are performed during cesarean sections, and 46percent of all births are cesareans. It is difficult to know how much of the increase in the prevalence of cesareans over the last 25 or 30 years was motivated by a desire to obtain a sterilization, and how much of the increase inJOSEPH E. P OTTER 729 Click to return to Table of Contentsthe use of sterilization was motivated by a history of cesarean sections. Evi- dence points to the importance of both lines of causation. Moreover, much of the increase in both surgical delivery and surgical contraception occurred long after the original financial incentives favoring cesarean sections hadbeen removed and a national policy had been instituted to promote the use of alternative methods of contraception. Consideration of the ways in which Brazilian women and their doc- tors came to depend on this technology is complicated by the interdepen- dence of choice involving type of delivery and type and timing of contra- ception. Nevertheless, positive reinforcement seems to be present at anumber of levels. For instance, with reference to the emergence of \"cul- tures\" of sterilization and of cesarean section deliveries, women who have had either a sterilization or a cesarean are especially likely to have otherrelatives, such as a mother or a sister, who have also undergone the proce- dure (Berquo 1993). Without doubt, the prevalence and frequency of ce- sarean section deliveries render these procedures less exceptional than theymight appear in other settings, and women are likely to know few people who are practicing a method other than ster ilization for fertility limitation. But, as in the Mexican case, the most compelling examples of positive rein-forcement pertain to the choices made by doctors. The medical community avers that Brazilian doctors are more skilled than doctors in the United States at performing cesarean section deliveries.Brazilian doctors pioneered the \"bikini cut,\" and they note disapprovingly the larger and higher scars left by many North American obstetricians. While such local pride may seem misguided, it is evident that considerable learn-ing has taken place and that most Brazilian obstetricians have ample prac- tice in performing cesarean section deliveries. Furthermore, because cesar- ean deliveries in private hospitals are common, the doctors who performmost of their deliveries by cesarean section are well protected against pos- sible charges of malpractice and can count on collegial support. The social interactions and professional reference groups for obstetricians also extendbeyond the hospital. They often have close links to their former classmates or professors in medical school, and most of them are active members of medical associations at the state, regional, and national levels. Medicalschools and associations, in turn, have played a decisive role in the consoli- dation of a permissive environment for the use of cesareans (Fa\u00fandes and Cecatti 1993). 29 The reduced reliance on cesarean sections as the means of performing sterilization in the Northeast region requires further explanation. The emer- gence of this divergent pattern seems to reflect the smaller fraction of thepopulation enjoying middle-class or high incomes in the Northeast and the much smaller proportion of deliveries that take place in private hospitals. In the face of substantial unmet demand for sterilization within the popula-730 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentstion unable to afford private care or to obtain a cesarean delivery in a pub- lic hospital, local doctors and politicians have developed alternative ways to cover the costs of sterilization performed independently from a cesarean section (Potter and Caetano 1998). These arrangements are often based ona promise of electoral support whereby the woman expecting to be steril- ized agrees to vote for the political party or individual providing or paying for the procedure. As such, the arrangements seem to constitute anotherinstance in which the demand for fertility control has led to a perverse pat- tern of medical practice. Policy responses in Mexico and Brazil The situations described in these two countries have elements of path de- pendence leading to the persistence of outmoded contraceptive regimes. In both instances, many of the factors that prompted the initial policies and the responses they engendered have been removed, yet the patterns havepersisted or have become even more pronounced. At present, there is con- sensus regarding the undesirability or the problematic features of each situ- ation, and steps are now being taken in each country to correct matters. Itis unclear, however, how \"locked-in\" these countries are to their present regimes, hence how much effort will be needed and how long it will take to bring about change. In Mexico, the problem is to change the way that the public health institutions promote family planning. The two corrective initiatives already underway involve the implementation of strict informed-consent procedureswith regard to IUD insertions and sterilizations, and efforts to increase the familiarity of practitioners with the official norms regarding the provision of contraceptive services. Longer-term efforts to upgrade the knowledge,skills, and qualifications of the doctors and nurses who staff family plan- ning clinics and who see patients during prenatal care, delivery, and post- partum care are also envisaged, as are efforts to educate rural women abouttheir reproductive rights. 30 These efforts involve large institutions, many thousands of profession- als practicing in thousands of localities, and a health bureaucracy that isnow largely decentralized to the state level. Change in the nature and qual- ity of the services the health institutions provide is likely to be difficult. Some of the more objectionable practices related to IUD insertions and ster-ilizations have now been controlled by way of strongly worded administra- tive directives, but the way programs relate to their clients may well prove more resistant to change. These institutions have been providing family plan-ning services for nearly 25 years, and their modes of operation have con- siderable inertia. In Brazil, legislation was passed in August 1997 intended to legalize and regulate the use of sterilization. Its specific goals were to reduce theJOSEPH E. P OTTER 731 Click to return to Table of Contentsnumber of sterilizations that are undertaken prematurely, to increase the use of methods other than the pill and sterilization, and to reduce the num- ber of cesarean section deliveries. The law authorizes the public health fi- nancing system to reimburse hospitals and clinics for performing steriliza-tions, but specifically restricts the use of postpartum sterilization to those cases where there is a compelling medical justification. Moreover, it requires institutions that provide sterilizations to offer counseling not only on thenature and consequences of the procedure but also on alternative ways of preventing pregnancy. In implementing the new law, Ministry of Health officials have been careful to respect the stipulations regarding the condi-tions under which sterilizations may be performed, and only hospitals or clinics that have been authorized to seek reimbursement for the procedure may do so. But this means that, to date, there has been only a modest in-crease in the availability of sterilization in the public health care system. Policymakers recognize the role that the previous limitations on fi- nancing sterilizations through the public health system played in motivat-ing women to seek a cesarean-based sterilization in the private sector, or to exchange their vote for a sterilization in the Northeast. But immediately satisfying the frustrated demand for sterilization would have led to a largenumber of postpartum procedures and an even greater imbalance in the method mix. The extent to which policymakers are attempting to control and influence the behavior of medical providers and their potential clientsunderscores the degree to which they perceive both parties to be commit- ted to the very patterns they hope to change. At the same time, their at- tempt to implement the new law only gradually means that in the shortrun little will be done to eliminate the distortions inherent in the current system. Conclusion The patterns of contraceptive delivery and practice that emerged in rural Mexico and in Brazil were strongly influenced by circumstances that were present in the early phases of the respective fertility transitions, but that have long since disappeared. In the present circumstances, these patternsare highly problematic. At the same time, they are well entrenched and have an inertia that makes it unlikely they will be quickly or easily reversed by the policies that are now being considered or implemented to correctthe situation. This dynamic is consistent with and, I suggest, is driven by the wayward logic of path dependence. The concepts of increasing returns and path dependence are helpful in thinking about the fertility transition and the pattern of change in contra- ceptive practice. They provide an alternative perspective on some of the questions now prominent in the debates over population policy and repro-ductive health. Path dependence provides a way of understanding how in-732 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsdividual societies around the globe might have adopted widely differing mixes of contraceptive methods and have become committed to a variety of contraceptive cultures. It is not an explanation for this diversity, since it refers responsibility back to seemingly insignificant or accidental historicalcircumstances and the erratic dynamics of positive feedbacks; but it should stop us from looking for answers solely in terms of deep-seated cultural preferences or the present-day incentive structure. The concept of path dependence is closely related to the anthropologi- cal critique of diffusion (Kreager 1993). By addressing the issue of optimality, this complementary formulation also seems to strengthen the original critique.Not only is the outcome of the process of technology adoption open-ended, but there is no guarantee that the process will lead to the best outcome. While the anthropological critique questions the linear characterization ofthe adoption process offered by the proponents of diffusion, the logic of path dependence highlights the possibility that the process may go astray. This should temper confidence that social networks and social interactionwill serve as engines of change for the better. While they undoubtedly con- tribute to the speed of fertility transitions, there is no guarantee that in ev- ery respect they will lead to a satisfactory outcome. Another point of contact with current debates has to do with the em- phasis on rights, options, and quality of care embodied in the Program of Action hammered out at the International Conference on Population andDevelopment. The arguments advanced in this article share much common ground with the feminist critique of the status quo vis-\u00e0-vis contraceptive practice and delivery systems. There is ample reason for concern about thequality of care and the range of contraceptive options available to women. The feminist critique also addresses the problematic aspects of the fertility transitions that have occurred over the last four decades and of the existingstate of contraceptive regimes, and emphasizes the problems that have to be dealt with rather than the accomplishment of attaining lower rates of fertility. Feminist critiques are also articulate about the specific ways bothproviders and women are committed to the status quo, and the difficulties they face in attempting to establish alternative systems and adopt alterna- tive behaviors (Diaz and Rogow 1995). Finally, the notion that remote historical events may, over time and through the logic of increasing returns, result in contraceptive practices and delivery systems that are far from optimal has important if somewhat con-tradictory implications for public policy. On the one hand, the notion sug- gests that the transition should be monitored and regulated since it can take an undesirable path that may become entrenched in the absence of promptand potent corrective actions. The case of Brazil seems to support such an interpretation: remedial measures were \"too little, too late.\" On the other hand, while the presence of increasing returns implies that unregulatedJOSEPH E. P OTTER 733 Click to return to Table of Contentsmarket outcomes will not always be efficient, the impact of early efforts to hasten and direct the transition may also be amplified and perpetuated in an undesired direction by the type of dynamics described here. The persis- tence in Mexico of a heavy-handed, hospital-based family planning pro-gram serving the rural population provides a telling example of an approach that outlived the problems it was designed to solve. Notes The author is grateful to the National Popu- lation Council of Mexico (CONAPO) for per- mission to use data from the 1995 National Family Planning Survey, and to the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the National In- stitute of Child Health and Human Develop- ment for financial support. Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez de Le\u00f3n and Rodolfo Tuir\u00e1n kept me abreast of developments related to population policy and family planning in Mexico. John Bongaarts, Andre Caetano, Suzana Michael Reich, Germ\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, and Susan Watkins provided ad- vice and encouragement on earlier drafts of the article. Sonia Corr\u00eaa provided detailed editorial suggestions, and left me with an armful of questions to ponder in the future. 1 Some of the most influential publications have been Bongaarts and Watkins (1996), Wat- kins (1987 and 1990), Montgomery and Cast- erline (1996), Montgomery and Chung (1999), and Rosero-Bixby and Casterline (1994). 2 Earlier publications reaching a similar conclusion are Coale (1973), Knodel and van de Walle (1979), Watkins (1987), and Cleland and Wilson (1987). 3 For example, Bulut et al. (1997) seek, albeit unsuccessfully, an explanation of the high use of withdrawal in Turkey in terms of the reproductive morbidity experienced in the population. Goldberg and Serbanescu (1995) have considered how the economic and political history of Romania and the Czech Republic account for the low use of modern methods in those countries. But perhaps the most intriguing is Coleman's (1981) study of the factors underlying the high use of con- doms in Japan. He ends up suggesting that\"a large proportion of Japanese married couples who are using condoms are not par- ticularly pleased with the method\" (p. 36), and that \"Japanese couples' extensive reli- ance on condoms results largely from the unavailability of other methods, in a cultural context of embarrassment and passivity to- ward contraception\" (p. 29). 4 Quantitative evidence on the impor- tance of health concerns has been captured, al- beit summarily, by Demographic and Health Survey questionnaires. See Bongaarts and Bruce (1995) and Lesthaeghe (1998). 5 Rutenberg and Watkins (1997) pro- vide a recent account of the importance givento health concerns and side effects in evalu- ative conversations about contraceptive methods in Nyanza Province, Kenya. 6 Leal (1994) provides an excellent de- scription and analysis of the ways that people's understanding of the reproductive system can impinge on use of pills. 7 A second but indeed prior function of doctors is to motivate the use of contracep- tion or sterilization. There are many ways that medical personnel may attempt to mo- tivate use, but they have a particular advan- tage in drawing attention to the deleterious health consequences of continued childbear- ing for the mother. They may also point to the positive health consequences of a lengthy interval between pregnancies for both mother and child. They may make recom- mendations that extend beyond their medi- cal competence, and point to the limits of a mother's or a family's capacity to care for and educate a large number of children. 8 One of the clearest statements regard- ing the potential importance of such guidance was offered by Howard Taylor (1966), an734 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of Contentsearly advocate of postpartum family planning programs. Taylor held that the medical prac- titioner who attended a mother's delivery was in a special position to counsel her with respect to family planning. Having been \"ac- corded the role of guide and protector to as- sure a safe delivery,\" this practitioner was likely to give advice of \"special significance\" during the critical postpartum period (p. 436). Moreover, it came at a moment when the mother was likely to have ample moti- vation to prevent or at least postpone another pregnancy. While Taylor's pronouncements now sound outdated, patronizing, and far re- moved from the spirit and recommendations of the International Conference on Popula- tion and Development, they may be quite representative of the ideology that was im- bued in many of the doctors who were pro- viding family planning services over the past 30 years. Moreover, Taylor's emphasis on the role of trust and assurance seems like a nec- essary antidote to fear of the health conse- quences of contraception. 9 For an overview of the literature on effectiveness that highlights the methodologi- cal inconsistencies and contradictory findings,see Trussell and Kost (1987). 10 An industrial example is jet aircraft designs such as the Boeing 727 that \"undergo constant modification and they improve sig- nificantly in structural soundness, wing de- sign, payload capacity and engine efficiency as they accumulate actual airline adoption and use\" (Arthur 1989: 116; Rosenberg 1982). Arthur and others have cited numer- ous technologies such as gasoline- powered motor vehicles and light-water nuclear reac- tors that, for particular chance reasons, got a head start and came to dominate their market or industry even though the alternative tech- nology probably had greater promise. 11 The following statement by Arthur and Lane (1994), articulating the situation of anyone who must choose between a variety of new technologies, captures the essence of the phenomenon, and has a clear relevance to the problems faced by prospective adopt- ers of new contraceptive technologies: For the potential purchaser, a new techni- cally based product can be a source of con-siderable uncertainty. Specifications, adver- tising brochures, and consumer reports maybe available, and the cost of purchase pre- cisely known. Yet the purchaser may still be unsure about how the product will per-form for him: how smoothly it can be inte- grated into his existing operations; how much maintenance or \"down time\" theproduct will require; whether the product in fact is suited to the particular uses he has in mind. . . . In cases like these, usually thepotential purchaser tries to reduce this un- certainty by asking previous purchasers about how they have fared with the prod- ucts they bought and subsequently used. (p. 70; emphasis in original) 12 While the likelihood of rumors will, of course, increase as a new method becomes more widely adopted, it is not clear that this is a continuous source of decreasing returns. My suspicion is that rumors of serious health consequences constitute an inevitable and possibly lethal threat that surfaces early in the life course of a new contraceptive tech- nology. Either the method survives the threat and continues to grow in acceptance, even- tually outrunning the danger, or it succumbs and virtually disappears. 13 The definition of rural is that used in the Mexican census, namely places with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants. 14 COPLAMAR was the acronym for the General Coordination of the National Plan for Depressed Zones and Marginal Groups. In May of 1979 IMSS agreed to provide primary health care to a wide range of disadvantaged rural areas on COPLAMAR's behalf. 15 There was also an acknowledgment of the deleterious influence of actual as well as anticipated side effects of hormonal meth- ods and the IUD. Three-quarters of the doc- tors believed that such symptoms as exces- sive bleeding commonly reduce continuation rates for these methods. 16 These estimates are based on unpub- lished tabulations from the Encuesta Nacional de Planificaci\u00f3n Familiar (ENAPLAF) under- taken by the National Population Council in late 1995. More details concerning the design and content of this survey are found below. 17 These goals are clearly set forth in the National Population Program 1995-2000 (CONAPO 1995). 18 These were the states of Chiapas, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Hidalgo, M\u00e9xico,JOSEPH E. P OTTER 735 Click to Table of ContentsMichoacan, Oaxaca, Puebla, and Veracruz. They contain about half the population of Mexico and account for most of the poorest areas of the country. 19 When the IUD was inserted for rea- sons of a \"medical indication,\" the mother was informed about the placement of the de- vice only following the procedure. 20 The National Investigation on Hu- man Reproduction carried out in nine pur- posively selected locations in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio Grande do Sul, Pernambuco, Piau\u00ed, and Par\u00e1 also collected information on contraceptive practice in this period (Merrick and Berquo 1983). 21 There has been an extensive debate in the Brazilian literature concerning the de- terminants of fertility decline in this period. The central issues concern the various aspects of the Brazilian pattern of development that may have accounted for the emergence of the demand for fertility control, as well as the role played by organizations that were seek- ing to promote family planning and control Brazilian fertility. The latter are more ger- mane than the former to my present purpose, which is simply to provide a brief historical reconstruction of the environment in which contraceptive decisions were made between 1964 and 1980. 22 Preventive medicine's share of the health budget fell from 64 percent in 1965 to barely 15 percent in 1982. Preventive medicine in this context refers to expendi- tures on sanitation, immunization cam- paigns, disease control, and inspection. 23 BEMFAM was, however, a more im- portant source of the pill in the five north- eastern states in which it had cooperative agreements with the state health secretari- ats (Merrick and Berquo 1983). 24 There is little direct evidence con- cerning the character and nature of pill use during this period, but on the basis of evi- dence for the mid-1980s it seems reasonable to assume that medical supervision was of- ten lacking and that complaints about side ef- fects were frequent (Corr\u00eaa and \u00c1vila 1989). Moreover, pills were just one of a large num- ber of medications that were widely adopted during a time when the pharmaceutical in- dustry was expanding rapidly, and the pre-scription and administration of medications were highly problematic for the bulk of the population (Scheper-Hughes 1993). 25 For more complete discussion of the relationship between sterilization and cesar- ean section delivery in Brazil, see Berquo (1993 and 1995). Direct evidence regarding side payments, albeit for a later period, is given in Vieira and Ford (1996). 26 This is clearly revealed in the mater- nity history in the 1986 Demographic and Health Survey, which recorded for all births information on whether or not the delivery was by cesarean section. 27 There are two different explanations for the lack of acceptance of the IUD in Brazil. One concerns the considerable discussion that occurred between various groups as to whether use of the IUD constituted a form of induced abortion. This controversial theme arose in con- gressional inquiries as well as in the scientific and popular press. The other reason is simply the cumulative effect of individual incidents in- volving serious side effects or accidents result- ing from IUD use. The latter explanation seems to most observers to have been the more im- portant of the two (Sonia Corr\u00eaa, personal communication, 1997). 28 The Brazilian delegation to the Cairo conference included a broad representation of nongovernmental organizations and played an important role in forging the consensus that emerged in the final conference document. Moreover, following the inauguration of Presi- dent Cardoso in 1995, a National Commission on Population and Development was set up to coordinate the implementation of the main recommendations of the Program of Action adopted in Cairo (Berquo 1997). 29 Comparatively permissive or generous criteria for the use of cesareans are embedded in several of the most widely used obstetric textbooks published in Brazil, for example Rezende and Montenegro (1992). 30 In January 1998, a memorandum of agreement was signed by officials represent- ing CONAPO and the various public health agencies involved in family planning, setting forth a plan of action for improving the qual- ity of services and ensuring full respect for reproductive rights.736 THE PERSISTENCE OF OUTMODED CONTRACEPTIVE REGIMES Click to return to Table of ContentsReferences Alarc\u00f3n N., F. 1982. \"Las actividades de planificaci\u00f3n familiar M\u00e9xico,\" in City: Mexicano del Seguro Social.

G OLDSTEIN WILHELM SCHLAG RECENT SUCCESSES in prolonging the life spans of laboratory animals have raised the possibility of large increases in human longevity (Carey et al.1998; Lin et al. 1997; Biddle et al. 1997). The prospect of longer life is often greeted by fears of overpopulation (Kevles 1999; Kolata 1999; Gavrilov and Gavrilova concerns, which appeared on the opin-ion page of the New York Times , are typical. He wrote that \"forestalling death would inevitably worsen many of the social crises that we already see loom- ing. It would increase population, further burdening the planet\u2014 and might well create a generation gap of titanic proportions.\" In this article, we use a simple mathematical model to show that longer life need not\u2014and, if current trends continue, will not\u2014lead to population growth. We distinguish between two types of post-reproductive life extension. Life-cycle telescoping occurs when death is postponed without affecting the timing of childbearing. The alternative is life-cycle stretching, in which longerlife is accompanied by delays in the timing of reproduction. Our model shows that population growth will result from life-cycle telescoping, but not from stretching. Stretching appears to be the more likely scenario, judging fromanimal experiments, evolutionary and behavioral theory, and recent hu- man experience. We conclude thus that current forecasts of an end to world population growth before the end of the twenty-first century (Lutz, San-derson, and Scherbov 1997) may not be upset even by quite dramatic in- creases in human longevity. Similarly, differential access to life-extension technology (Silver 1997) may not alter the population composition in favorof those who live longer. Life-cycle stretching may itself be an evolution- arily adaptive mechanism. Population growth consequences of different scenarios for increased longevity To study the effects of increased longevity on population size, we consider stationary populations in which mortality declines occur in post-reproduc- Click to print article 742 LONGER LIFE AND POPULATION GROWTH Click to return to Table of Contentstive ages. Near zero population growth rates are typical of most developed countries and are forecast for the world population by the end of the twenty- first century (e.g., Lutz, Sanderson, and Scherbov 1997). In stationary popu- lations, an identity relates population size K to years of life expectancy at birth e and the annual number of births B: K = Be. (1) Any change in life expectancy that leaves the number of births unchanged, such as life-cycle telescoping, will produce a proportional change in total population size. Consider now the case where a population undergoes a transition in which the timing of reproduction is allowed to vary with the timing of death. Let the change in demographic regimes occur from one cohort to the next, such that everyone born before a given moment in time has the originaldemographic regime, and everyone born after this time has the longer-life regime. Replacement fertility holds for all cohorts. Denote the expectation of life e' and the mean age of reproduction \u00b5' under the new regime. We find that lim tKt Ke e()=\u00b5 \u00b5,(2) where K'(t) is the size of the population t years after the change in regime. This result provides the conditions under which life expectancy can be in- creasing without causing population growth: namely, when the ratio of life expectancy to the mean age of reproduction is kept constant across demo- graphic regimes (i.e., =ee \u00b5\u00b5). This is the scenario we call life-cycle stretch- ing. Telescoping is a special case of (2) where =\u00b5\u00b5 . More generally, popu- lation will increase whenever longevity increases faster than the mean age of reproduction (> e e\u00b5 \u00b5), while population declines will be produced if the opposite occurs (< e e\u00b5 \u00b5). The dynamics of stretching the life cycle can be illustrated by simula- tion. Figure 1 shows the birth stream that results from a simple form ofstretching in which the mean age of reproduction was doubled by shifting the onset and end of childbearing to older ages. After an initial period of oscillation, the birth stream settles down to a new equilibrium equal to one-half of the previous equilibrium. The existence of an equilibrium is a well- known consequence of demography's strong ergodic theorem (Sharpe and Lotka 1911). What is remarkable is that the level of this equilibrium de-JOSHUA R. G OLDSTEIN / W ILHELM SCHLAG 743 Click to return to Table of Contentspends only on the shift in mean age of reproduction.1 It is also possible to de- rive this result as a consequence of the renewal theorem (Feller 1971). Li and Tuljapurkar (1999) use related methods to study population momentum. Evidence for life-cycle stretching While it is not possible to specify the form that future extensions of life will take, there are a number of reasons to believe that increases in longevitywill be accompanied by delays in childbearing. The biological link between reproductive timing and mortality has been demonstrated repeatedly. The same animal experiments that have succeeded in extending longevity inMediterranean fruit flies (Carey et al. 1998), drosophila (Finch 1990: 304- 310), mice (Biddle et al. 1997), and nematode worms (Lin et al. 1997) also resulted in postponing the timing of reproduction.

The stretched maternity function has the same value, but the age range has been shifted to ages 40 through 79.The simulation shows that the stream of births declines during the first few years following the change indemographic regimes as the births of the \"stretched\" cohorts are postponed. This decline is reversed as thenew cohorts occupy the full range of ages of their reproductive span. Oscillations follow as the original dip inbirths is echoed. 1A self-contained proof of equation (2) using elementary methods is available from the authors <http://opr.princeton.edu/~josh/stretchproof.pdf>.744 LONGER LIFE AND POPULATION GROWTH Click to return to Table of Contentstemporary epidemiological studies (Perls and Silver 1999) have found a posi- tive association between longevity and late childbearing. Contemporary variation across species provides a proxy measure of evolutionary history, although ideally one would want to study changewithin species. The correlation between life expectancy and age at sexual maturity is very strong both across mammalian species (Harvey and Zammuto 1985) and across primates in particular (Harvey and Clutton-Brock1985), a relationship often attributed largely to differences in body weight. Figure 2 shows the relationship between life expectancy and mean age at reproduction (generation length) in 25 mammalian species for which dataare available. The correlation coefficient is large (r = 0.95) and the slope of the logarithmic regression line through these data is 1.01 (s.e. = 0.07). The regression line thus indicates that a doubling of life expectancy is accompa-nied by a 101 percent increase in the mean age of reproduction. There are several explanations for the connection between reproduc- tive timing and mortality (Charlesworth 1994). The costs of early repro-duction may be high both in terms of subsequent survival and in terms of the survival of offspring. For density-dependent populations the linkage be- tween longevity and age of reproduction may be evolutionarily adaptivebecause it allows increases in longevity without placing larger demands on the local environment. Life-cycle stretching may also be adaptive in the con- FIGURE 2 Relationship between life expectancy at birth and mean age at reproduction (generation length) for 25 mammalian species(logarithmic scale) NOTE: Logarithmic regression line has a slope of 1.01 (s.e. = 0.07); r = 0.95 (r = 0.94 in original scale).

There may also be an evolutionary argument for the ideal number of generations that are simul- taneously alive. Grandparents may be able to contribute to the fitness of their offspring by assisting their grandchildren. On the other hand, if toomany generations are alive at the same time, the fitness of the youngest generation may be diminished through competition for resources. Evolu- tion may have introduced a mechanistic biological link between the timingof birth and death, a link that may mean that the same technological advances that postpone death will also, however inadvertently, postpone reproduction. Although the future life-cycle demography of humans may be influ- enced in part by biological constraints, choices will also play a role in deter- mining when long-lived humans, using their own free will, will decide to bear children. Behavioral theories such as economic theories of human capi-tal investment (Becker 1983) support the proposition that delayed child- bearing is a rational response to longer life spans. Kaplan and Lam (1999) have shown theoretically that increased productivity at older ages createsincentives for postponing childbearing. Life-course stretching may thus re- sult as much from the optimizing choices of individuals facing increased longevity as from more-deterministic biological processes. Empirical support for the link between longer life and postponement of childbearing can be found in the low-mortality populations of North America, Europe, and Asia, where reproductive ages have been rising inrecent decades. As shown in Table 1, the mean age at childbearing has been increasing at approximately the same pace as life expectancy over the last two decades in the United States, Japan, and Sweden. Ages at first birthhave been increasing slightly faster than mean ages at childbearing because of a decline in higher-order births to older women (Bongaarts and Feeney 1998). Later onset of reproduction appears to be driven by changes in behavior ratherthan changes in biology, since the age at menarche has been getting earlier during most of the twentieth century (Eveleth and Tanner 1990).

Lee and Carter (1992) forecast a joint-sex life expectancy of 86.05 years by 2065, an increase of 13.5 percent from 1990. The same proportional increase in the timing ofreproduction would imply a mean age at childbearing of 30.0 years instead of the current value of 26.4 years. Such levels are clearly possible without bio- logical innovations; in Japan, the current mean age at childbearing is already29.2 years (Japan Ministry of Health and Welfare 1998). Whether reproduc- tive timing is as elastic as longevity for very large changes, like a doubling of life expectancy, is not yet known. While animal experiments suggest that thismay be the case, it may turn out to be easier to postpone death than meno- pause. Nonetheless, it is clear that reproductive timing in human populations has not yet begun to approach biological limits. Conclusion Fears that extension of the human life span will lead to population growth in replacement-level populations may be misplaced. As long as later ages at death are accompanied by proportional delays in the timing of childbirth, ashrinking birth stream will exactly offset increases in longevity. Current fore- casts, which omit the possibility of dramatic increases in longevity, suggest that world population growth will cease toward the end of the twenty-firstcentury. Our results suggest that these forecasts can still hold, even if lon- gevity is greatly increased.

O'N EILL SERGEI SCHERBOV WOLFGANG LUTZ LONG-RANGE POPULATION projections derive from underlying assumptions about the future paths of fertility, mortality, and migration. Fertility sce- narios are usually constructed by choosing a level at which fertility is as-sumed eventually to become constant and a path from the current to the eventual fertility rate. Stable population theory (Keyfitz 1968) shows that populations experiencing constant fertility, under the assumption of con-stant mortality and migration, tend toward a fixed age structure and growth rate that are independent of the history of vital rates. However, the long- term population size is determined by both the eventual fertility level andthe transition path. Two projections with identical eventual fertility rates but different transition paths will produce population sizes that differ in the long term by a constant proportion. For example, long-range population projections that assume univer- sal convergence to a replacement-level fertility rate show that doubling or halving the length of the transition from current to eventual fertility pro-duces a range in population size in 2150 of about \u00b120 percent (Bos et al. 1994). In contrast, projections in which eventual fertility rates vary by half a birth per woman around a central estimate produce global populationsthat differ by \u00b150 to 70 percent in 2100 and by more thereafter (United Nations 1998). Taken together, these results have been interpreted as im- plying that the timing of the fertility transition has a relatively unimportanteffect on long-term population size. Nevertheless, no long-range projections have systematically investigated the importance of the path of fertility de- Click to print article 750 THE TIMING OF FERTILITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentscline as distinct from the effect of the eventual fertility level, and theoreti- cal analysis (Keyfitz 1971) has been limited to the case of eventual replace- ment-level fertility. In this note, we first demonstrate the effect of varying the assumed length of the fertility transition\u2014an indicator of the rate of change in fertil- ity\u2014for different eventual levels of the total fertility rate (TFR) by carrying out an extensive set of projections for the single region of North Africa.Figure 1 shows the results of 35 projections for the region in which, start- ing from the age distribution of 1995, the eventual TFR was varied from 1.0 to 3.0 births per woman, while the length of the transition from the cur-rent total fertility rate of 4.24 to the eventual TFR was varied from 20 to 80 years. Each curve shows the results of projections in which fertility con- verges to a different eventual fertility level. The length of the fertility tran-sition (assumed to be linear) is given along the x-axis, and results are nor- malized to the population size assuming a 50-year transition. Migration is assumed to be zero, and mortality follows a central scenario (Lutz 1996).The projections cover a period of 155 years from 1995 to 2150. The scenario assuming the lowest eventual fertility level shows the greatest sensitivity to the speed of the decline.

O'N S ERGEI SCHERBOV / W OLFGANG LUTZ 751 Click to return to Table of Contentsto be 1.0, then as the length of transition varies by \u00b130 years around a central value of 50 years, population size varies in the long term by +145 to -60 percent. In contrast, if eventual TFR is 3.0, long-term population size varies by +21 to -17 percent around its value in the 50-year transition sce-nario. These differences are achieved at different times depending on the length of the transition. In general, much of the difference is apparent within two generations of the time at which fertility becomes constant. We reportresults for 2150, by which time the relative sizes of populations projected with different transition lengths but common eventual fertility rates have become nearly constant in all cases. Beyond 2150, relative population sizeschange little. However, absolute population size, changing at a constant rate, will become either extremely large or extremely small if the eventual fertil- ity rate remains constant above or below replacement level; we make noassumptions as to the likelihood of these outcomes. For reference, Table 1 shows the absolute size of the projected population of North Africa in 2150 for a selection of the scenarios considered here. The results of the analysis are explained by the fact that the difference between the initial and the eventual fertility rate over the course of the transition is the key factor in determining the impact of the path on popu-lation size. The lower the eventual fertility, the greater the rate of change in fertility over the transition, and the greater the impact of altering that rate on population size. By analogy to geography, this relationship is equiva-lent to the observation that the more distant a geographic destination, the more important travel speed becomes. To investigate the effect within the context of an existing set of long- term population projections, we constructed a set of 12 scenarios by modi- fying the central scenario from the projections of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA; see Lutz 1996), as shown in Figure 2for the example of North Africa. In the four central scenarios, represented by solid lines in the figure, TFRs in regions currently above replacement level follow the IIASA central scenario to 2030-35, then reach an eventual TABLE 1 Projected population of North Africa in 2150, in millions, under various assumptions concerning the length of fertility transition from the current level ofthe TFR of 4.24 to various levels at which fertility eventually stabilizes Eventual totalLength of transition fertility rate 20 years 50 years 80 years 1.0 24 59 145 1.5 96 178 3322.0 279 432 6692.5 679 916 1240 3.0 1460 1770 2140752 THE TIMING OF FERTILITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentslevel of 2.4, 2.1, 1.8, or 1.5 in 2080-85, the time interval used to specify eventual constant fertility in the IIASA projections. We tested the sensitiv-ity of each scenario to the timing of the decline by defining two alternative scenarios involving a rapid and a slow decline to each of the four assumed eventual fertility levels. Dashed lines represent the rapid fertility declinescenarios in which the TFR achieved in 2030-35 and 2080-85 in the cen- tral scenario is achieved 10 and 20 years earlier, respectively. Dotted lines represent the slow fertility decline scenarios in which these TFR values areachieved 10 and 20 years later, respectively. For all scenarios, mortality and migration assumptions are identical with the paths specified in the central scenario. Table 2 shows that if the high-fertility regions stabilize near replace- ment level, an acceleration or deceleration of the fertility decline would cause an eventual change in the combined population size of all regions of-16 percent to +21 percent, similar to the effect found in previous studies (Bos et al. 1994). If the eventual fertility rate is assumed to be 0.3 births per woman higher, the impact on population size weakens to -11 percent to+13 percent. In contrast, if eventual fertility stabilizes below 2 Scheme of the alternative fertility scenarios for developing regions, 1995-2150, illustrated with the example of North Africa, where theinitial level of TFR is 4.24 NOTE: See discussion in text.Rapid decline scenario Central decline scenario Slow decline scenarioBRIAN C.

Thus, a lowering of eventual fertility by 0.6 births per woman relative to replacement level roughly doubles the effect of altering the length of the transition by 20 years. The magnitude of such relative differencesvaries region to region, as detailed in Table 2. In Latin America and Pacific Asia, for example, the impact of a change in the timing of fertility decline roughly triples at lower eventual fertility levels.

These results demonstrate that a given change in the speed of the fer- tility transition has a larger impact on population size the lower the assumedeventual fertility rate. It is also true that a given change in eventual fertility itself has a larger impact the lower the eventual fertility rate in a reference case. For example, changing eventual fertility by 0.3 births per woman froma reference case in which eventual fertility is low will have a larger impact than the same change from a case in which eventual fertility is high. We therefore investigated the relative sensitivity of projected population size tothese two factors. Figure 3 illustrates the relative impact of the speed and extent of the fertility transition on the projected population size of the de- veloping regions. It demonstrates both that a change in transition speed hasa greater impact at lower eventual fertility levels and that its impact in- creases relative to the effect of a change in the eventual fertility rate. The thick solid line in the figure represents the difference between the increasein population (relative to the \"central 2.1\" scenario) brought about by slow- ing the fertility transition by 20 years and the increase caused by raising the eventual fertility level from 2.1 to 2.4 while holding the transition length 1995 2045 2095 2145-0.15-0.10-0.050.000.050.100.150.200.25Fractional population difference YearFIGURE 3 Illustration of the relative impact of the speed and extent of the fertility transition on the projected population size of the developing regions by comparing scenarios differing in the eventual level of the total fertility rate and the speed with which that level is attained S-2.1 vs. C-2.4 R-2.1 vs. C-1.8S-1.8 vs. C-2.1 R-1.8 vs. C-1.5 NOTE: R, C, and S represent the rapid, central, and slow fertility decline scenarios; 2.4, 2.1, 1.8, and 1.5 indicate the eventual fertility level achieved in each case.BRIAN C. O'N EILL / S ERGEI SCHERBOV / W OLFGANG LUTZ 755 Click to return to Table of Contentsconstant. This difference is positive between 1995 and about 2125, indicat- ing that the change in the speed of the transition dominates the increase in eventual fertility in terms of its effect on population size. After 2125, the change in eventual fertility is the dominant influence. The thick dashedline compares the effect of speeding up the fertility transition by 20 years to the effect of lowering the eventual fertility rate from 2.1 to 1.8. It shows that between 1995 and about 2120, speeding up the fertility decline re-duces population size by more than reducing eventual fertility. After 2120, lowering the eventual fertility rate is the dominant influence. The two thin lines in Figure 3 show a parallel set of results that dem- onstrate how these relationships change when an eventual fertility rate of 1.8 instead of 2.1 is taken as a reference point. Changes in the speed of fertility decline are dominant for a longer period of time, relative to changesin eventual fertility, than is the case when the reference eventual fertility rate is at replacement level. Our analysis of the impact of changes in the timing of the fertility tran- sition could easily be extended to include regions in which fertility is cur- rently at or below replacement level. However, concern in low-fertility so- cieties centers less on population size than on issues related to aging (deJong-Gierveld, van Solinge, and Wormser 1995; van Praag and van Dalen 1994); and while the rate of aging will be affected by the path and by the eventual level of fertility, the long-term age structure is independent of thepath over the next several decades. This implies that a more rapid pace of fertility decline is not achieved at the expense of a higher eventual propor- tion elderly. These findings place new emphasis on the task of constructing sce- narios for fertility decline. As demographers begin to take into account the possibility of eventual subreplacement-level fertility in long-term popula-tion projections (Bongaarts 1998; Lutz 1996), they need to be cognizant of the significant role the path of fertility decline will play in determining the size of the ultimate stable population. Our results also have implications forpolicies seeking to take into account the consequences of population growth for economic change and the environment (Vitousek et al. 1997; O'Neill, MacKellar, and Lutz, in press). Finally, while considerable aging will takeplace under all scenarios of future population growth, the speed of fertility decline over the coming decades will make a significant difference to the long-term levels of population size that will accompany older age structures.

Despite being accompa- nied by advice to interpret urban population projections with caution and not as forecasts (United Nations 1980), these early projections of rapidgrowth fueled common perceptions of an impending \"urban population ex- plosion\" in poor countries (Bairoch 1988; Schiffer 1989), while providing many governments with a pretext for concentrating economic resourcesand focusing population control efforts, such as restrictions on in-migra- tion, in big cities (Badshah 1996; United Nations 1981). The recent availability of data from the 1990-round censuses makes it equally opportune to examine whether influential predictive models of ur- ban and city growth in developing countries, published around 1980, have remained robust over time. The most prominent of these models were pes-simistic in assessing the prospects for modifying rapid urban growth through direct interventions in cities and against urban in-migration. Economists concluded that pricing policies biased in favor of cities, as well as nationaldevelopment strategies and global economic conditions that spurred manu- facturing rather than agricultural productivity, made rapid urban growth until the year 2000 likely (Kelley and Williamson 1984b: Table 6.6). Mean-while, demographers linked city growth rates closely with national popula- tion growth rates, implying that municipal authorities and planners were virtually powerless in controlling the future sizes of their cities (United Na-tions 1980: 43). These empirical studies supported Lipton's (1976) thesis of \"urban bias,\" which contends that economic development policies of gov- ernments in low-income countries favor cities to such an extent as to un- Click to print article 758 URBAN GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Click to return to Table of Contentsdermine efforts to slow urban growth, including measures to discourage rural-to-urban migration. Contradicting these scenarios of rapid growth, the United Nations and urban scholars have tentatively concluded that rates of urban and city growthin the developing world have been slower in recent decades than was once anticipated (Becker and Morrison 1999; Satterthwaite 1996; United Nations 1998). A glaring and often-cited example is Mexico City, whose estimatedcurrent population of about 18 million does not approximate the more than 30 million inhabitants projected for 2000 as recently as 1980 (United Na- tions 1980). 1 Such discrepancy reflects in part the limitations of the data to which UN urban estimation and projection procedures are applied. Yet, de- scriptive accounts are lacking to indicate whether the experience of Mexico City is unique or whether it is illustrative of widespread, highly erroneousurban population projections at the regional, national, and city levels in developing countries. Moreover, it is not known whether slower-than-ex- pected urban growth has been consistent with economic trends that influ-ence migration between urban and rural areas, or with demographic fac- tors, such as declining national population growth. An examination of the patterns and causes of unexpectedly slow urban growth in recent years isneeded to improve the basis for urban population projections in the future, and thereby assist development planning. Such an exercise is also impor- tant for assessing the plausibility of current projections according to whichvirtually all world population growth in the near future will occur in urban areas of the developing world (United Nations 1998). This article has two objectives: (1) to scrutinize the slower than for- merly anticipated urban growth noted by the United Nations for the devel- oping world as a whole in recent years at lower levels of population aggre- gation\u2014regions, countries, and cities\u2014so as to ascertain whether thisphenomenon is common throughout the South or, rather, is particular to certain areas and sensitive to population size; and (2) to reevaluate the strength of predictive models of city and urban growth developed around1980 by demographers and economists, as typified respectively by Preston (1979) and Kelley and Williamson (1984a), in light of urban population data now available from the 1980- and 1990-round censuses, as well asdata accumulated since 1980 that may reflect changes in potent explana- tory factors (for instance, economic conditions). Reexamination of these models may indicate the forces responsible for a slowdown of urban growthin recent years, if this phenomenon has indeed occurred. An assessment of urban population projections to the year 2000 The accuracy of population projections to 2000 and later dates can be as- sessed most conclusively through ex post facto comparisons of observedMARTIN BROCKERHOFF 759 Click to return to Table of Contentspopulations in the twenty-first century to currently available published sta- tistics. For evaluation at present, one must accept the most recent UN ur- ban projections to 2000, revised in 1996, as reasonably correct given their recent data base and short projection period. Because the methodology em-ployed by the United Nations to estimate and project national urban and rural populations was reformulated in the late 1970s (United Nations 1980: 9-11) and has not changed since then (United Nations 1998: 31-36), themost recent figures serve as a benchmark for determining to what extent subsequent developments and the use of newly available data affected the accuracy of projections made in 1980. 2 Comparison of these sets of projec- tions is also appropriate to detect an unanticipated slowdown of urban growth, because the latest projections make full use of all available data from the 1980- and 1990-round censuses, whereas the earlier set of projections did not. Table 1 presents the size of the urban population in developing regions and subregions in the year 2000, as projected in 1980 and 1996 by the United Nations. The figures in the table are derived from an identical group of 134countries classified as less developed in 1980 (therefore excluding those coun- tries in the former Soviet Union that are now classified as less developed) whose definitions of urban did not change between the two years. 3 The most recent United Nations projections foresee a less developed country (LDC) urban population of somewhat under 1.9 billion in the year 2000, more than 10 percent (or 222 million) lower than the somewhat over2.1 billion expected in 1980 (13 percent lower if China is excluded). In con- trast, the size of the projected total population has been revised downward by only 2 percent, and the size of the rural population has been revisedupward by 4 percent. These percentage changes suggest that the United Nations has been much more successful in projecting accurately the total LDC population than the urban population. However, roughly half (110million) of the downward revision of the projected urban population is at- tributable to the projected total population growth in the developing world that was slower than anticipated in 1980. 4 Slower total population growth, in turn, has largely resulted from faster-than-expected fertility declines in LDCs.5 The 1996 projections of the size of the 2000 urban populations are lower than those projected in 1980 in all major developing regions and in10 of the 12 subregions listed in Table 1. Most striking is the shift in these figures for Latin America and the Caribbean: some 17 percent fewer urban- ites according to the 1996 projection (which corresponds to a sharply re-vised average annual urban growth rate between 1980 and 2000, from 3.31 percent to 2.54 percent). The urban population of Asia in 2000 as projected in 1996 is 105 million less than was projected in 1980, while recent urbangrowth in Africa\u2014frequently claimed as occurring at high levels unprec- edented in history\u2014has been apparently occurring at an appreciably slower pace than was anticipated in 1980 (at roughly 4.3 percent per year, on av-erage, rather than 4.8 percent).760 URBAN GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Click to return to Table of ContentsTable 2 shows that the consistent pattern among regions\u2014of much slower urban growth than was expected earlier\u2014masks a high degree of diversity in the accuracy of projections among countries within subregions, even between adjacent countries (for instance, Mozambique and Malawi).6 The countries in Table 2 show the extremes of differences within subre- gions. In Middle Africa, for example, the Congo's urban population was projected in 1996 to number almost 2 million in 2000, about 40 percenthigher than was projected in 1980. In contrast, in the neighboring Demo- cratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), the 1996 projected urban population is 12 million, or almost one-half fewer than was projected in1980.

In Southeastern Asia, Singapore and Vietnam exhibit a pattern similar to that of the two countries of Middle Africa just cited, with Vietnam ex-pected to have in 2000 just over half the urban population that was pro- jected in 1980. In Latin America, the 1980 projections of the urban popula- tion for 2000 have been revised downward in 1996 for all countries exceptArgentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. In El Salvador the 1996 projection was lower by 36 percent. Upward revisions of anticipated urban populations in countries such as Lesotho and Oman are not surprising, given the smallinitial size of the urban populations. Revisions of the magnitude made, for example, for Vietnam and South Africa, however, are significant also in terms of the absolute numbers of persons involved. Comparison of Tables 1 and 2 reveals that the much-revised urban projections of subregions correspond closely to revised projections for the largest countries in those subregions. This is clearly the case with Egypt,China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and their respective subregions. The excep- tional upward revision in 1996 as compared to 1980 of Western Africa's urban population projected to 2000, by 13 percent, is largely a result of a26 percent upward revision for urban Nigeria, where about 60 percent of Western Africa's urbanites reside. The seemingly accelerated urban growth of Nigeria in the 1980s and 1990s is remarkable given that the projectedtotal population of the country in 2000\u2014which was much influenced by the surprising results of the 1991 census\u2014was revised downward by 18 per- cent between 1980 and 1996, from 135 to 111 million; as a result of thetwo revisions, Nigeria's expected level of urbanization in 2000 has been changed from 33 to 44 percent. 7 The consistency of the two projections for China, despite change in the national definition of urban during 1980-96,has been explained by Banister (1997: 79-80). 8 The revised projection for urban India\u2014of 75 million fewer urban residents projected in 1996 than was projected in 1980\u2014is by far the largest absolute change of any country,and represents a decrease in the 1980-2000 average annual urban growth rate from 4.24 percent to 2.95 percent. 9 Table 3 compares projections to the year 2000 made in 1980 and 1996 for the largest cities of the 15 most populous countries in each of the three major developing regions. The same definition of each city\u2014as an agglom- eration, the city proper, or by the application of some other criterion\u2014isused for both years. Most of the early projections of LDC city growth ap- pear to have been far too high, indicating the weakness of data on which city population statistics, in particular, are calculated. In each region, the2000 population projected in 1980 has been lowered in the 1996 projec- tions in 9 or 10 of the 15 cities. The 13-million downward revision of the projection for Mexico City is hardly exceptional: projections for Shanghai,Jakarta, Baghdad, and S\u00e3o Paulo have each been lowered by more than 6Click to return to Table of ContentsTABLE 3 Projected population in 2000 of the largest city in the 15 largest countries in each developing region (in thousands) As projected in Region/country Largest city 1980 1996 Percent changea Africa Nigeria Lagos 4,518 13,488 198.5 Egypt -17.5 Ethiopia of Congo Kinshasa 8,411 5,068 -39.7 South Africa Cape Town 2,850 3,092 8.5 Tanzania Dar es Salaam 4,645 2,051 -55.8 Algiers 2,643 4,447 22,677 14,173 0 Bangladesh Vietnam 2,716 113.9 Dem. 2,240 2,726 11,125 4,796 -56.9 Malaysia Kuala Lumpur 2,552 1,378 -46.0 the Caribbean Brazil 15.0 Honduras 7.9 El Salvador San Salvador 895 1,415 58.1 a Median change for LDC cities with at least 750,000 residents in 1995 = -15.1 percent.

The relative over-projection of Mexico City's 2000 population in 1980 as compared to 1996 by 42 percent is exceeded by the shift for several smaller cities in Africa as well as by Kuala Lumpur. A remarkable change, as compared to the general pattern of cities, is the threefold increase in theprojected 2000 population of Lagos, which accounts for 85 percent of the upward revision of Nigeria's urban population. In 1980 it was projected that 389 cities would reach sizes of at least 750,000 by 1995; according to themost recent estimates 239 did, 150 did not (United Nations 1980, 1998). Projections in 1980 to the year 2000 were far less accurate for cities than for the urban population at large. For example, whereas the urban popula-tion of developing regions has been revised downward by 10.5 percent (and by a median average of -7.5 percent among all developing countries), the projected population of the 239 cities with at least 750,000 residents in thesecountries in 1995 has been lowered, on average, by 15.1 percent. 10 Figure 1 summarizes salient aspects of the apparent slowdown of ur- ban growth in the developing world during 1980-2000 (excluding China).Undoubtedly, most total population growth has been urban (a combined result of urban natural increase and net rural-to-urban migration), and the component of urban growth within total growth will certainly increase inthe future (United Nations 1998). Nonetheless, the average annual rate of urban growth during the last two decades of the twentieth century, which was projected in 1980 to exceed 4 percent, is anticipated to be 3.4 percentaccording to the 1996 projections. The changed outlook implies a 1980- 2000 urban population increase of 98 percent rather than 127 percent. The pace of urbanization in 1996 appears more modest than was the case in 01020304050607064.557.0 Average annual rate of urban growth (percent)Ratio of urban to rural growth0123454.06 3.41 2.83 2.36 1980 1996 1980 1996 1980 1996FIGURE 1 Measures of urban population growth between 1980 and 2000 in developing countries, as projected in 1980 and 1996 (excluding China) Urban growth as a proportion of LDC population growth (percent)MARTIN BROCKERHOFF 765 Click to return to Table of Contents1980: between 1980 and 2000 the urban population is projected to be grow- ing 2.4 times, rather than 2.8 times, more quickly than the rural popula- tion. And whereas in the 1980 projections 65 percent of the 1980-2000 population growth in developing countries was expected to occur in urbanareas, this figure in the 1996 projections has been revised downward to 57 percent. This last comparison raises doubt about the reliability of current UN projections according to which over 90 percent of LDC population growthduring 2000-25 will occur in urban areas (United Nations 1998), if one as- sumes that the factors that contributed to slower urban growth in the 1980s and 1990s will persist in the future and have not been fully accounted forin the most recent set of projections. Sources of city growth since the 1970s While the UN's earliest projections of year 2000 urban and city populationsin the developing world, made in the late 1970s, were generally far toohigh as compared to projections made in 1996 (which presumably are more accurate given the recency of the information on current population size and the much shorter projection period), there has also been considerablevariation among countries and cities in the size and direction of change from the earlier to the later projections. The substantial revision of projec- tions may be to some extent an artifact of assumptions that underlie theUN's methodology. This hypothesis could be explored by applying alterna- tive assumptions to the data used by the UN in 1980 to make urban popu- lation projections to 2000 and then assessing whether results more closelyapproximate the populations projected in 1996 than did the projections pub- lished in 1980. At present, such an analysis can only be undertaken by the United Nations Population Division; the specific data used for projections in1980 are not presented in any publication and cannot be identified with certainty from UN Demographic Yearbooks . An alternative approach is to ex- amine potential sources of the recent slowdown and variation in urban andcity growth based on existing theory of the underlying determinants of such growth, taking advantage of abundant population and development data collected for developing countries in recent years. Preston (1979) and the UN Population Division (1980) analyzed the effects of several variables on intercensal growth rates of 1,211 cities in more and less developed countries (excluding China) between the 1960- and 1970-round censuses; no analysis of this scale has been conducted for developing countries alone or since that time. The most striking finding was an almost perfect association between national population growth rates and city growthrates: a 1 percent increase in the former resulted in a 1.002 percent in- crease in the latter. For example, if a country with an annual population growth rate of 3 percent experienced average city growth rates of 4 per-cent, then a country that experienced 4 percent growth had cities growing,766 URBAN GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Click to return to Table of Contentson average, by 5.002 percent per annum. From this finding, one could con- clude that the same forces fuel population growth in cities as in the coun- tries in which they are located and thus, by implication, that high natural increase in rural areas does not propel cityward migration, nor are programsthat modify natural increase (for instance, family planning and child sur- vival programs) differentially effective in cities and in the countryside. Other notable results of the investigation just cited were that levels of economicdevelopment and performance positively affect city growth rates, whereas rates are significantly lower in more urbanized countries, and higher in Latin American countries, than elsewhere. Table 4 replicates the analysis of Preston and the United Nations for 1,154 cities of developing countries only, based on city population data com- piled from UN Demographic Yearbooks covering a span of 26 years (1971-97). This sample represents all cities in the developing world whose population sizes are reported for two time points\u2014before and after 1980, and at least eight years apart\u2014and whose population size was at least 100,000 at the earlierdate. 11 On average the period covered is 1977-90, although for some cities estimates extend to 1996. Independent variables are derived from United Nations and World Bank publications for the same years as estimates of citysize. While alternative measures of the variables may be preferable (for in- stance, adjusting conventional gross national product and gross domestic product according to purchasing power), this would preclude strict com-parison to results of the Preston/UN study. The findings of this earlier study are shown in the final column of the table. Analyses of the earlier and more recent periods show little consistency of results. One constant determinant in size and direction of effect is the annual growth rate of national GDP per capita: a 1 percent increase raises city growth rates by roughly 0.2 percent (or 2 per thousand persons). Thisis not surprising, as fast-growing LDC economies (for instance, in East Asia) presumably stimulate demand for labor in urban industry, manufacturing, and services, a situation conducive to net urban in-migration. Because cit-ies are the historical engines of national economic growth, reverse causality could also be hypothesized from this relationship (that is, city population growth may be driving national economic growth). As Preston observes,however, it is unlikely that the average city is large enough for its popula- tion growth to contribute substantially to measured national economic growth during a short period of years. On balance, results indicate that factors that drove city growth in the 1960s and 1970s have had markedly different effects on LDC city growth rates in recent years. Initial levels of GNP per capita are generally irrelevantto rates of city growth in subsequent years ( =0.042, p=.728). The impor- tance of national economic conditions therefore appears ambiguous\u2014eco- nomic progress as measured by GDP growth per capita spurs city growth,MARTIN BROCKERHOFF 767 Click to return to Table of ContentsTABLE 4 Effects of demographic, economic, and political variables on city growth rates, 1960s-1990s (annual percentage growth rates) Effect of one unit increase in variable on city growth ratea Unit of LDCs only MDCs and LDCs combined Variable measurement (1970s-1990s) (1960s-1970s; Preston 1979) Demographic National population Annual percentage growth rate growth 0.788* 1.002* Natural log, initial city size Persons -0.314* -0.211*Initial proportion urban Urban percentage -0.062* -0.029* Economic Initial level of national Thousands of US dollars 0.042 0.332* GNP per capita (LDCs only: initial year of observation; Preston:1964) Growth rate of national Annual percentage 0.189* 0.239* GDP per capita growth (unadjusted to purchasing power) Political Capital city 1 if capital city; 0 otherwise 0.933* 0.589 Largest city 1 if largest city in country; 1.152* 0.292 0 otherwise Regional Latin America 1 if in Latin America; -0.294 0.614* 0 if Asia (excluding Chinaand India) Africa 1 if in Africa; 0 if Asia 0.372 -0.025 (excluding China and India) China 1 if in China; 0 if other Asia 0.817* \u2014 (excluding India) India 1 if in India; 0 if other Asia -0.544* \u2014 (excluding China) Constant 3.548 4.119R 20.352 0.312 (N) 1,154 1,212 Initial year of observation 1977 1962 (mean) Average duration 12.7 10.0 of observation (years) NOTE: Based on cities with at least 100,000 residents in the initial year of observation. *p<.05 a Partial regression coefficients.

City growth rates are dampened in highly urbanized countries\u2014in part owing to smaller proportions of potential in-migrants from rural areas\u2014but the768 URBAN GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Click to return to Table of Contentsnegative effects of urbanization levels on city growth are twice the magni- tude reported for the 1960s, at about -.06 for every one percentage point increase in the initial proportion urban. Given our global sample of devel- oping countries, inclusion of both primate and smaller cities, and statisticalcontrol of regional effects, this result suggests that counter-urbanization may be widespread across city sizes, and within the developing world, not re- stricted to cities of Latin America. 12 Largest cities and capital cities of LDCs grew approximately 1.15 and 0.93 percent more quickly per annum than other cities, figures much higher (and more reliable statistically) than those reported by Preston. Therefore,presuming an average annual growth rate of 4.10 percent for other cities with at least 100,000 residents in the initial year of observation, cities that were both the national capital and the largest city in their countries grew,on average, by 6.18 percent per annum. Several factors account for these discrepancies with earlier findings. First, most of the cities analyzed for the 1960s are located in more developed countries, whereas our sample is ex-clusively from less developed countries where \"urban bias,\" or the concen- tration of migration-inducing resources, has been much more pronounced in favor of major urban centers. Second, the largest and capital cities ofmost countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and of many countries in other re- gions, have populations of less than one million (United Nations 1998: Tables 11, 12), population bases that are sufficiently small to translate populationincrements in absolute terms into high city growth rates. Third, high esti- mates for major urban centers run counter to the observed slowdown of mega-city growth rates since the 1970s, but these slow-growing giant cit-ies\u2014cities of 8 million or more residents\u2014represent less than one percent of cities in the developing world with more than 100,000 inhabitants (hence included in our sample). Finally, support for these findings comes from otherstudies that indicate that cities of 1,000,000-5,000,000 residents grew more quickly than cities of 500,000-1,000,000 residents in developing regions during 1975-90 (Brockerhoff and Brennan 1998: 81). With respect to regional location, cities grew more rapidly in Latin America than elsewhere in the 1960s\u2014other factors being equal\u2014but in recent years cities in Asia (excluding China and India from this referencecategory) grew more rapidly. The evidence of a sharp reduction in city growth in Latin America (relative to city growth in Asia), after controlling for national economic conditions that largely determine migration flows be-tween cities and the countryside, points to Latin America's remarkable fer- tility decline\u2014from an average total fertility rate of 6 in the early 1960s to 3 in the early 1990s (United Nations 1999)\u2014as a likely major componentof reduced city growth in the region. As compared to other Asian cities, the much more rapid growth of China's cities (greater by 0.8 percent per an- num) and more sluggish growth of Indian cities (less by 0.54 percent perMARTIN BROCKERHOFF 769 Click to return to Table of Contentsannum) is noteworthy insofar as China and India had virtually equivalent levels of urbanization and GNP per capita around 1980.13 As one might expect, these regional estimates for cities are consistent with the direction of revised UN projections for regional urban populations shown in Tables 1 and 2. A striking result in Table 4, as compared to findings for the 1960s- 1970s, is that a one percent increase in national population growth rates of LDCs increases city population growth rates by less than 0.8 percent, de-spite the fact that urban growth has been more rapid than total population growth since 1975. Indeed, 351 of the 1,154 cities in our sample experi- enced slower growth than their country's population during the period ofobservation. This finding suggests that small urban centers not included in this analysis, those with fewer than 100,000 residents, may be the fastest- growing settlements in the developing world, as has been noted elsewhere(UNCHS 1996). This result also supports the notion that, on the whole, there has not been net in-migration to LDC cities from smaller urban areas and rural areas; the net flow may be in the other direction, if weak city econo-mies have discouraged out-migration from small areas and encouraged re- turn migration to towns and villages. Such reverse flows from cities have been documented since the late 1980s, for instance in Ivory Coast and Guinea(Bocquier and Traor\u00e9 1998). Alternatively, technological progress and im- proved economic performance in agriculture, as compared to urban eco- nomic sectors, may have induced many potential migrants to remain in ru-ral areas, a pattern consistent with some theories of rural demographic change (for instance, Boserup 1965) but at odds with others (for instance, Davis 1963). Yet another explanation is that cities may have experienced awidening difference in rates of natural increase as compared to rates in smaller areas (for instance, resulting from more rapid fertility decline in big cities), to an extent that more than offsets high net migration into cities.These hypotheses warrant investigation to reveal the demographic and eco- nomic underpinnings and policy instruments in rural areas that affect the pace of city growth. Sources of national urban growth since 1980 In addition to examining sources of city population growth since the 1970s, causes of national urban population growth since 1980 also merit investi- gation, with reference to predictions of national-level urban growth madearound 1980. Kelley and Williamson (1984a and 1984b) examined whether the rate of urban growth in developing countries during 1973-79 would have differed in the absence of the major increase in oil prices and relatedeconomic conditions that prevailed in those years. Their analysis was ex- ceptional in considering economywide influences on urban growth in an \"open\" setting, in which migration between rural and urban areas is af-770 URBAN GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Click to return to Table of Contentsfected by exogenous forces that confront an entire country. The study found that the average annual urban growth rate of a \"representative\" developing country (4.65 percent) would have been much higher\u2014more closely ap- proximating the rate during 1960-73\u2014if urban-based manufacturing hadnot declined relative to rural-based agriculture in terms of trade and pro- ductivity. 14 In contrast, the slow growth of agricultural land stock and high growth of the population of labor force age\u2014factors that presumably \"push\"surplus rural population toward urban areas\u2014as well as foreign capital in- flow and the higher price of fuels and raw materials did not affect the pace of urban growth. Kelley and Williamson concluded that imbalance betweenmanufacturing and agriculture matters most to urban growth, in part by instigating (or inhibiting) migration to urban centers of employment and economic advantage. Continuation of unfavorable trends in manufacturingrelative to agriculture therefore would indicate slower rates of urban growth in the 1980s and 1990s than would be expected otherwise. Table 5 presents the key findings of Kelley and Williamson and com- parable results from an analysis of data from 95 developing countries rep- resenting the period 1980-96. Variables examined for recent years are those identified as potent causes of urban growth during 1973-79 (and, implic-itly, before and after those years) as well as factors deemed insignificant at that time but nonetheless apposite to consideration of the influence of popu- lation pressures on urban growth since 1980. The importance of four na-tionwide factors that could have reduced urban growth in part by depress- ing migration from the countryside is also examined: (1) the percentage of population aged 65 or older in 1980; (2) the growth rate of the proportionof the population age 65 or older during 1980-96; (3) a policy in 1980 to alter the spatial distribution of population\u2014as defined by the simultaneous existence of a negative perception by government of the population distri-bution, intention to decelerate or reverse migration flows, and intention to modify the rural/urban configuration of settlements (United Nations 1981); and (4) country size in terms of area, which when large might indicate agreater distance between rural and urban places. An alternative to counter- factuals\u2014values that Kelley and Williamson derived from historical data and expert opinion and that presumably approximate conditions prior tothe rise of oil prices\u2014is used to determine the impact of national trends and conditions on urban growth. Additionally, analysis of data for 1980-96 shows the mean values of variables among these 95 countries as recordedby the United Nations and the World Bank, presents the median annual urban growth rates for countries that experienced values above and below the means, and estimates the linear effects of variables on the urban growthrate. 15 A substantial technological slowdown has occurred in the developing world since 1980 (encompassing the so-called lost decade of the 1980s),Click to return to Table of ContentsTABLE 5 Effects of economywide variables on the national urban growth rate (UGR) in LDCs, 1973-79 and 1980-96 fromMedian annual for countriesEffect of variable on Variable Assumption Counterfactual counterfactual Mean > Mean Mean average annual UGR Unbalanced factor productivity (agriculture growth /manufacturing growth),% per annum 0.8 0.5 5.86 0.89 3.65 4.83 -0.296* Relative price of annum -1.6 0 6.49 -0.97 5.30 2.89 -0.735* Foreign capital inflow per annum, as % of GDP 3.0 0 4.67 1.26 4.11 4.01 0.137 Agricultural land stock, % growth per annum 0.5 1.0 4.61 0.83 4.02 4.13 0.083 Labor force, % growth per annum 2.68 2.54 4.60 2.50 4.46 3.92 0.261 Percent of population aged 65 or older in 1980 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 4.20 3.24 4.83 -0.279* Proportion of population aged 65 or older, % growthper annum \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 0.74 3.31 4.85 -0.412* Policy in 1980 to curb urban growth (1= yes, 0 = no) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 0.40 Yes: 3.53 No: 4.88 -0.713* Size of country (sq. miles, in thousands) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 226,411 4.01 4.13 -0.002 Constant = 1.292 N = (40) (Actual avg.

US Bureau of the Census 1991.772 URBAN GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Click to return to Table of Contentsand the price \"squeeze\" on the agricultural sector has been reduced. These trends are reflected by the much higher productivity increase in rural agri- culture as compared to urban manufacturing (at 0.89 percent per annum, even exceeding OPEC-period levels) and by the price decline of manufac-tures relative to agricultural goods (at -0.97 percent per annum). Countries that experienced lower than average relative growth in manufacturing had a median annual urban growth rate of 3.65\u2014or 0.4 percentage points lowerthan all countries on average, and about 1.2 percentage points lower than countries with comparatively strong manufacturing growth. Among coun- tries where the price of manufactures fell by more than 0.97 percent yearlyas compared to agricultural prices, the median annual urban growth rate was 2.89\u2014or 1.2 percentage points lower than the aggregate average and just over half the rate of countries where price trends have been more fa-vorable to manufactures. The effect of these sector productivity trends dur- ing 1980-96, quite disadvantageous to manufacturing, was to reduce the average annual urban growth rate by 0.3 percentage points. Likewise, de-clining relative prices for manufactures reduced the rate by 0.74 percentage points. In sum, results indicate that, as in the 1970s, the sluggish performance of manufacturing (as compared to agriculture) remains largely responsible forthe observed slower pace of urban growth in developing countries, and may have decelerated urban growth from what otherwise would have been higher rates in the 1980s and 1990s by curbing net rural-to-urban migration. Sustained periods of reduced international capital inflows experienced by many countries since the 1980s might be expected to have dampened urban growth\u2014given that most capital inflows (hence income-earning op-portunities) typically come to cities\u2014but strong evidence remains that, for LDCs on the whole, the level of foreign capital inflow over time has had no significant effect on the pace of urban growth. Likewise, agricultural landexpansion and the rate of growth of the population of labor force age (the main contributor to urban fertility and net rural-to-urban migration) have had negligible effects on urban growth. In all, despite the use of more-lim-ited data for a much earlier period, Kelley and Williamson were remark- ably on target in identifying those overarching forces that do, and do not, determine rates of urban growth in developing countries. Of the additional variables considered here, size of country turns out to be unimportant, but population aging appears to be crucial. Aging popu- lations would logically be associated with slower national population growth,but their relationship to the pace of urban growth is undocumented. Many developing countries, notably in Latin America and the Caribbean, had high proportions of elderly persons among their populations in 1980 or earlier(US Bureau of the Census 1992: Table 5). Those countries with percentages of persons aged 65 or older exceeding 4.2 experienced urban growth rates 0.8 percentage points lower than average. Moreover, a yearly increase ofMARTIN BROCKERHOFF 773 Click to return to Table of Contentsone percent in the proportion of population aged 65 or older (for instance, from 5 percent to 5.05 percent)\u2014a value slightly higher than the 0.74 per- cent mean increase per annum observed in our sample\u2014reduces the urban growth rate by 0.41 percentage points (for instance from 4.05 percent to3.64 percent). The difference in median urban annual growth rates between countries that experienced higher and lower rates of growth in their pro- portion of elderly persons than the mean exceeds 1.5 percentage points (3.31percent as compared to 4.85 percent per annum). High levels and rapidly growing proportions of elderly persons could reduce urban growth through several mechanisms. These include, most di-rectly, lower and declining urban fertility and decreased propensity among the aging rural population to resettle in urban areas (if rural-to-urban mi- gration is prompted mainly by job, school, or marriage prospects). On theother hand, the concentration and growth of the elderly population in de- veloping countries may be largely an urban phenomenon\u2014given that cura- tive health care services are overwhelmingly based in cities in many coun-tries, while higher fertility persists in the countryside. Unfortunately, no comprehensive data on the age structures of urban and rural populations exist to examine these arguments. Without engaging in undue speculation,suffice it to say that the more-rapid growth expected in the future of the proportion of population aged 65 or older in developing countries\u2014at 2.1 percent per annum between 2000 and 2025, to represent over 8 percent ofthe total population by the end of the period (according to the UN me- dium-variant projections)\u2014implies a potentially strong dampening effect on rates of urban growth. Whether changing age structures reduce urbangrowth purely through urban fertility decline or are associated with it through other linkages is a question for future research. Spatial aspects of population policy appear more significant to curbing urban growth than is conventionally assumed on the basis of the failed \"mi- gration policies\" of many governments in the 1960s and 1970s (Simmons 1981). Measures implemented to modify the distribution of population, in-cluding migration policies, substantially reduced the average annual rate of urban growth in LDCs during 1980-96, by about 0.7 percentage points, and likely would have had a greater dampening impact on urbanization in thedeveloping world if applied in more countries. Admittedly, the policy indi- cators are crude, as they reflect governments' perceptions of the compara- tive desirability of alternative spatial patterns, not their actual interventions,and they are reported to the United Nations by potentially biased or not well-informed offices of government. Nonetheless, many countries that viewed their population distributions as unacceptable and acted to changethem\u2014for instance, Mexico, Egypt, and India\u2014experienced lower urban growth rates during 1980-96 than did their global subregions, and much lower growth than neighboring countries\u2014Guatemala, Sudan, Bangladesh\u2014774 URBAN GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Click to return to Table of Contentsthat had less negative stances on urban growth. This result points to a need to identify which migration-related policies most influence urban growth\u2014 for instance, rural development schemes versus the imposition of eligibility requirements for movement from the countryside. In the absence of suchresearch, and given the strong effect of migration policy on urban growth independent of economic and demographic conditions, one cannot dismiss spatial distribution policies as uniformly ineffective instruments to managethe urban transition. Conclusion While short-range population projections sometimes prove imprecise, thelarge downward revision of the projected size of the urban population ofmost developing countries in the year 2000\u2014based on a considerable amount of accumulated evidence\u2014suggests that a slowdown of urban growth has occurred since the 1970s. A much-modified picture of the \"urban popula-tion explosion\" in recent years reflects the effects of relatively weak expan- sion of urban industries and price shifts unfavorable to manufactured goods, population aging, policies to alter migration and spatial distribution patternsin some countries, and no doubt other forces not examined in this analysis. National population growth rates that produce less than commensurate city growth rates, net of other factors, suggest that reduced net rural-to-urbanmigration has been a principal demographic component of slower-than-ex- pected urban growth. However, the continued absence of timely, adequate data on rural-to-urban migration in most developing countries, as well ason natural increase in urban and rural areas separately, precludes attribu- tion of the slowdown of urban growth in most countries to any single de- mographic process (or to statistical changes due to such causes as redraw-ing of city boundaries or reclassification of urban places). Further clarification of the demographic underpin nings of urban growth\u2014rather than of its un- derlying economic and social causes examined here\u2014awaits analysis of datafrom the 2000-round censuses. It remains to be seen whether economic downturns and other recent trends have just temporarily slowed the process of the urban populationtransition in the developing world\u2014as implied by current projections that anticipate rapid urban growth and very large population increments in cit- ies in the next few decades\u2014or whether conditions of the 1980s and 1990shave a more lasting effect on the future growth and size of the urban popu- lation. Comparison of the biennial urban estimates and projections issued by the United Nations with earlier data, as done here with reference to the1996 revision, on a routine basis would shed light on this issue provided that the UN methodology is not altered in future estimates and projections. The discrepancy between early and the most recent urban population projections is no doubt attributable, in part, to the continued inadequacy ofMARTIN BROCKERHOFF 775 Click to return to Table of Contentsthe underlying data on which these projections are based; urban popula- tion statistics should be interpreted with caution. As illustrated above, how- ever, the increased availability of basic population, economic, and geographic data for most developing countries in the last 20 years now enables de-tailed analysis of the causes of urban growth. With few exceptions (for in- stance, Becker, Hamer, and Morrison 1994; McGee and Robinson 1995), this topic has been neglected for some time, despite its obvious demographicsignificance. This article has revisited notable examples of research on sources of urban and city growth in the 1960s and 1970s and has derived results that inform our understanding of the causes of growth since that time (ei-ther through confirmation or refutation of earlier findings). An apparent priority for future research is to determine whether policy interventions of governments can hasten the pace of urban growth, if more rapid growth isdeemed desirable on economic or other grounds. Alternatively, research might determine whether the pace of urban growth in developing coun- tries can be controlled by governments if, for instance, doing so is suggestedby global economic conditions or by demographic conditions identified in this study. Fortunately, sufficient data are becoming available in some coun- tries to address these and other questions pertinent to the growth of citiesand urban populations. Notes 1 Mexico City's population increased from 5.4 million in 1960 to 13 million in 1980 (Garza 1999: 153). By simply extrapo- lating this rate of growth, the UN projected a population size of 31.3 million by the year 2000. 2 The method for projecting city size, however, has been changed (see United Na- tions 1998: 33-36). National urban and ru- ral projections made in 1980 and 1996 may both be flawed as a result of the UN's meth- odology. Much potential inaccuracy may be associated with the central measure used in calculations, a single urban-rural growth dif- ferential derived from 228 countries in both developing and developed regions and ap- plied hypothetically to each individual coun- try (including those 22 countries with no definition of an urban area, and 8 countries where all population officially resides in ar- eas designated as urban or rural). For urban population projections of individual coun- tries, the use of data from other countries in- evitably introduces potential error (even if the hypothetical differential, properly weighted,applies to countries at any level of urbaniza- tion). At national and higher levels of popula- tion aggregation, the UN's urban projections may also prove inaccurate if any of numer- ous assumptions are violated: for instance, if the urban-rural growth differential assumes a negative value, as it has in Oceania since the late 1970s; if the exclusion of countries with small populations from the procedure produces a less, not more, valid hypothetical differential; if the linear incremental weights applied to the differential over successive five-year intervals are inappropriate; and so forth. However, since the method has re- mained constant between 1980 and 1996, all discrepancy in projections between the two dates that results from the method would originate from changes in the country-level data that enter into the procedure (includ- ing their source, amount, timeliness, and va- lidity in measuring demographic events). 3 Almost no developing country changed its official definition of urban between 1980 and 1996. The few countries that did change their definition\u2014for instance, Afghanistan,776 URBAN GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Click to return to Table of ContentsBenin, and Iran\u2014did so in a manner that did not change the locales classified as urban. The UN urban projection method allows for the graduation of rural areas to urban areas (and vice versa) based on population size criteria, and therefore does not invalidate the trends shown in Table 1. 4 The extent to which over-projection of the urban population in 1980 is attributable to over-projection of the total population var- ies by region. For instance, the projected ur- ban population of Africa in 2000 has been revised downward by about 36 million since 1980, whereas the projected total population of Africa in 2000 has been revised upward by about 6 million. In this case, none of the downward revision of the projected urban population can be attributed to slower total population growth in Africa than was ex- pected in 1980. In contrast, the projected ur- ban population of Latin America and the Car- ibbean has been revised downward by about 79 million, while the projected total popula- tion of the region has been revised downward by 105 million. Therefore, in Latin America and the Caribbean one could attribute all of the over-projection of the urban (and rural) population to slower-than-expected growth of the total population. The point to empha- size is that errors in projecting urban popu- lations are affected by errors in projecting to- tal populations. 5 As recently as 1988, for instance, the UN's medium variant projection of the total fer- tility rate (TFR) in less developed regions in 1990-95 was 3.69 (United Nations 1989). The UN now estimates that the TFR during this pe- riod was 3.27 (United Nations 1999). Admit- tedly, the current estimate includes some rela- tively low-fertility developing countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union whereas the earlier projection did not, but these coun- tries in sum account for a very small propor- tion of the developing world's population. 6 Countries with populations of less than 2 million in 1995 are not examined, because small absolute changes in their projected ur- ban population sizes may have resulted in such large percentage changes that compari- son with larger countries is misleading. 7 Faster-than-expected urbanization and urban growth in Nigeria since 1980 are es- pecially intriguing insofar as the structuraladjustment policies imposed in that country by international financial institutions in the 1980s (though not strictly adhered to by the governments) would be expected to have re- duced migration to cities and perhaps to have lowered urban fertility (Olu Abiodun 1997). A plausible explanation for the revision of the size of Nigeria's (and Lagos's) urban popula- tion is that estimates and projections have been based on poor-quality census data, par- ticularly preceding the 1991 census. 8 In the 1980s, China established hun- dreds of new cities and thousands of new towns with extraordinarily large land areas. This reclassification of rural places as urban greatly magnified the size of China's urban population (for instance, it raised the propor- tion classified as urban from 21 percent in 1982 to 57 percent in 1990). To correct for this change in definition, the State Statisti- cal Bureau created a second, more realistic defini tion of urban applied to the 1990 cen- sus, which defines the urban population as in- cluding urbanized residents of neighborhood committees. 9 Mohan (1996) speculates from 1991 census data that would-be migrants to cities were discouraged from moving by the lack of jobs and a worsening quality of urban life in the 1980s. 10 These represent all cities in developing regions with a population of at least 750,000 in 1995 (United Nations 1998) whose projected populations to 2000 can be traced to those in- cluded in United Nations (1980). 11 For China, data are taken from the 1982 and 1990 national population censuses. 12 In this case, counter-urbanization would be defined as the movement of people away from cities, regardless of city size crite- ria, toward smaller areas, including suburbs or peri-urban areas not officially recognized as part of the city proper. Descriptive ac- counts of this process in the 1980s for large as well as small cities are given by Gilbert (1996) and UNCHS (1996). History suggests that in regions where urbanization levels are relatively low, such as South Asia and sub- Saharan Africa, counter-urbanization would be fleeting; it may reflect the more adverse impact on cities than on other areas of eco- nomic downturns in the 1970s-1990s.MARTIN BROCKERHOFF 777 Click to return to Table of Contents13 Detailed explanations of recent city growth patterns in China and India, respec- tively, are found in Scharping (1997) and Mohan (1996). 14 Data for a representative developing country were based on unweighted averages of 40 countries. These developing countries included only \"price-takers\" in international trade\u2014therefore excluding net oil-exporting countries of OPEC\u2014and countries with fa- vorable economic situations between 1960 and 1973. The present analysis of 95 devel- oping countries during 1980-96 includes any of these formerly omitted states for which suitable and complete data are available, since the capacity of these countries in dic- tating global fuel prices has greatly dimin- ished since 1980, and because economic forces unfavorable to rapid urban growth pre- vailed in most developing countries in the 1980s and early 1990s (with the exceptionof some Asian countries that experienced rapid economic growth during that period). The characterization of manufacturing as \"urban\" and agriculture as \"rural\" is some- what inaccurate, especially in countries where \"mega-urbanization\" or metropolitan sprawl has dispersed industries to adjacent rural areas (McGee and Robinson 1995), or where export-oriented manufacturing has been established in rural hinterlands (for in- stance, in \"New Economic Zones\" of coun- tries in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean). Even in this minority of developing countries, however, the manufacturing and agricultural sectors are overwhelmingly concentrated in urban and rural areas, respectively. 15 For some small countries, data taken from the World Bank World Development In- dicators 1998 are available only in CD-ROM format, not in publication.

Click to print article POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW 25(4):779-787 (DECEMBER 1999) 779ARCHIVES Click to return to Table of ContentsAlfred Marshall on the Growth of Population Classical views of population, as expounded in the works of Smith, Malthus, and Mill, retained their influence through the nineteenth century and into the twenti- eth\u2014until sidelined, many would argue, by the marginalist revolution in econom-ics. Oddly, Alfred Marshall (1842-1924), the major figure in that revolution, was, when it came to population, himself firmly in the classical tradition. He diverged from it in two main respects. Writing in the late nineteenth century he had of courseto take account of Darwinian theory, with the potential implications it suggested for differential fertility. And, deriving from his interests in industrial organization and efficiency and in biological analogies in economics, he gave greater attention thanhis forebears to the possibility that returns to labor could routinely be increasing as well as diminishing. Marshall, the preeminent economist of his time, was for most of his career professor of political economy at the University of Cambridge. His major work, Prin- ciples of Economics , was first published in 1890, and then in a series of revised editions over the rest of his life. The final\u20148th\u2014edition appeared in 1920. (A \"ninth\"variorum edition was issued in 1961.) The Principles has been described, by G. J. Stigler, as the second greatest work in the history of economics. The contributions to theory and method warranting such praise, however, are chiefly in the later partsof the volume. Up to and including Book IV ( The Agents of Production: Land, Labour, Capital and Organization ), the reader is given the impression, according to Keynes, of \"perusing a clear, apt and humane exposition of fairly obvious mat-ters.\" Certainly in comparison to the rest, these early sections were left fairly intact in their 1890 form over subsequent editions. But Keynes also remarks, in his lengthy obituary of Marshall, how deceptive that surface smoothness could be\u2014and notesthat Marshall \"had a characteristic habit in all his writings of reserving for foot- notes what was most novel or important in what he had to say.\" The excerpts below are taken from Book IV, Chapters IV (\u00a7\u00a71-2, 4-5) and XIII (\u00a73), of the 1890 edition of the Principles . In the first, Marshall presents a Click to print article 780 ARCHIVES Click to return to Table of Contentsbrief, selective history of population doctrines up to Malthus, and then the doctrine \"in its modern form\"; in the second, from the concluding chapter of Book IV, he explores the applicability of the law of increasing returns\u2014stated, earlier in the chap- ter, as: \"An increase of labour and capital leads generally to improved organiza-tion, which increases the efficiency of the work of labour and capital.\" The supply of labour. The growth of numbers. \u00a71. In the animal and vegetable world the growth of numbers is governedsimply by the tendency of individuals to propagate their species on the onehand, and on the other hand by the struggle for life which thins out vast numbers of the young before they arrive at maturity. In the human race alone the conflict of these two opposing forces is complicated by other in-fluences. On the one hand regard for the future induces many individuals to control their natural impulses; sometimes with the purpose of worthily discharging their duties as parents; sometimes, as for instance during thedecay of the Roman Empire, with the vilest and meanest motives. And on the other hand society exercises pressure on the individual by religious, moral and legal sanctions, some times with the object of quickening, andsometimes with that of retarding, the growth of population. The study of the growth of population is often spoken of as though it were a modern one. But in a more or less vague form it has occupied theattention of thoughtful men in all ages of the world. To its influence often unavowed, sometimes not even clearly recognized, we can trace a great part of the rules, customs and ceremonies that have been enjoined in theEastern and Western world by law-givers, by moralists, and those name- less thinkers, whose far-seeing wisdom has left its impress on national habits. Among vigorous races, and in times of great military conflict, they aimedat increasing the supply of males capable of bearing arms; and in the higher stages of progress they have inculcated a great respect for the sanctity of human life; but in the lower stages, they have encouraged and even com-pelled the ruthless slaughter of the infirm and the aged, and sometimes of a certain proportion of the female children. With the safety valve of the power of planting colonies, and in the presence of constant war, the legislators of ancient Greece and Rome did not hesitate to give special privileges to the fathers of many children. But thoughtful men were even then aware that action in the contrary sensemight be necessary if the responsibilities of parentage should ever cease to be burdensome; 1 and in Western Europe during the Middle Ages there may be observed as Roscher says2 a regular ebb and flow of the opinion that the State should encourage the growth of numbers. It flowed gener- ally when plague or war had thinned out the people, or when the fear ofALFRED MARSHALL 781 Click to return to Table of Contentswar made the recruiting officers anxious; but it seems to have ebbed in England after the Reformation, when the abolition of the celibacy of the religious orders and the more settled state of the country had given a great impetus to population, while the effective demand for labour had beendiminished by the increase of sheep runs, and by the collapse of that part of the industrial system which had been organized by the monastic estab- lishments. Later on the growth of population was checked by the licen-tious habits that grew up with the later Stuarts, and by that rise in the standard of comfort which took effect in the general adoption of wheat as the staple food of Englishmen during the first half of the eighteenth cen-tury. At that time there were even fears, which later inquiries showed to be unfounded, that the population was actually diminishing. Petty had fore- stalled some of Carey's and Wakefield's arguments as to the advantages ofa dense population. Child had argued that \"whatever tends to the depopu- lating of a country tends to the impoverishment of it;\" and that \"most na- tions in the civilized parts of the world, are more or less rich or poor pro-portionably to the paucity or plenty of their people, and not to the sterility or fruitfulness of their land 3.\" And by the time that the world-struggle with France had attained its height, when the demands for more and more troopswere ever growing, and when manufacturers were wanting more men for their new machinery; the bias of the ruling classes was strongly flowing in favour of an increase of population. So far did this movement of opinionreach that in 1769 Pitt declared that a man who had enriched his country with a number of children had a claim on its assistance to educate them. An act, passed amid the military anxieties of 1806, which granted exemp-tion from taxes to the fathers of more than two children born in wedlock, was repealed as soon as Napoleon had been safely lodged in St Helena 4. \u00a72. But during all this time there had been a growing feeling among those who thought most seriously on social problems, that an inordinate increase of numbers, whether it strengthened the State or not, must nec- essarily cause great misery: and that the rulers of the State had no right to 1Thus Aristotle ( Politics, II. 6) objects to Plato's scheme for equalizing property and abolishing poverty on the ground that it would be unworkable unless the State exercised a firm control over the growth ofnumbers. And as Professor Jowett points out, Plato himself was aware of this; (see Laws, v. 740: also Aristotle, Politics, VII. 16). The population of Greece is said to have declined from the seventh century B.C., and that of Rome from the third.

X. 4See Twiss, Progress of Political Economy, Lect. VII. Note also that a comparison of the rapid increase in the population of Germany with that of France was a chief motive of the order of the French Chamber in 1885 that education and board should be provided at the public expense for every seventh child in all necessi- tous families. Napoleon the First had offered to take under his own charge one member of any family whichcontained seven male children: and Louis XIV., his predecessor in the slaughter of men, had exempted from public taxes all those who married before the age of 20 or had more than ten legitimate children. (See Garnier's article on Population in the Dictionnaire de l'Economie Politique. )782 ARCHIVES Click to return to Table of Contentssubordinate individual happiness to the aggrandizement of the State. In France in particular a reaction was caused, as we have seen, by the cynical selfishness with which the Court and its adherents sacrificed the well-be- ing of the people for the sake of their own luxury and military glory. If thehumane sympathies of the Physiocrats had been able to overcome the fri- volity and harshness of the privileged classes of France, the eighteenth cen- tury would probably not have ended in tumult and bloodshed, the marchof freedom in England would not have been arrested, and the dial of progress would have been more forward than it is by the space of at least a generation. As it was, but little attention was paid to Quesnay's guardedbut forcible protest:\u2014 \"one should aim less at augmenting the population than at increasing the national income, for the condition of greater com- fort which is derived from a good income, is preferable to that in which apopulation exceeds its income and is ever in urgent need of the means of subsistence.\" Sir James Steuart was much under the influence of the Physiocrats, and was indeed in some respects imbued with Continental rather than English notions of government: and his artificial schemes for regulating population 5 seem very far off from us now. With regard to the tendency of population to increase up to the margin of subsistence he accepted the Physiocratic doctrine that, to use Turgot's words, the employer \"since he always has his choice of a great number of working men, will choose that one who will work mostcheaply. Thus then the workers are compelled by mutual competition to lower their price; and with regard to every kind of labour the result is bound to be reached\u2014and it is reached as a matter of fact\u2014that the wages of the workerare limited to that which is necessary to procure his subsistence \" 6. Adam Smith said but little on the question of population, for indeed he wrote at one of the culminating points of the prosperity of the Englishworking classes; but what he does say is wise and well balanced and mod- ern in tone. Accepting the Physiocratic doctrine as his basis, he corrected it by insisting that the necessaries of life are not a fixed and determined quan-tity, but have varied much from place to place and time to time; and may vary more 7. But he did not work out this hint fully. And there was nothing to lead him to anticipate the second great limitation of the Physiocraticdoctrine, which has been made prominent in our time by the carriage of 5See his Inquiry, Bk I. Ch.

If on the otherhand, food be increased, the spring which stood at 0, will begin to exert itself in proportion as the resistance diminishes; people will begin to be better fed; they will multiply, and in proportion as they increase in num- bers the food will become scarce again.\"ALFRED MARSHALL 783 Click to return to Table of Contentswheat from the center of America to Liverpool for less than what it used to cost to carry it across England.

And to crown all, well meaning enthusiasts, chiefly under French influence, were proposing com-munistic schemes which would enable people to throw on society the whole responsibility for rearing their children 10. Thus while the recruiting sergeant and the employer of labour were calling for measures tending to increase the growth of population, more far-seeing men began to inquire whether the race could escape degrada- tion if the numbers continued long to increase as they were then doing. Ofthese inquirers the chief was Malthus, and his Essay on the Principle of Popu- lation 11 is the starting point of all modern speculations on the subject. ... [The doctrine of population in its modern form] \u00a74. The growth in numbers of a people depends firstly on the \"natural in- crease,\" that is, the excess of their births over their deaths; and secondly onmigration. The number of births depends chiefly on habits relating to marriage, the early history of which is full of instruction; but we must confine our-selves here to the conditions of marriage in modern civilized countries. The age of marriage varies with the climate. In warm climates where child-bearing begins early, it ends early, in colder climates it begins later 7See Wealth of Nations, Bk. I. Ch. VIII. and Bk. V. Ch. II. 8The average price of wheat in the decade 1771-1780 in which Adam Smith wrote was 34 s. 7d.; in 1781-1790 it was 37 s. 1d.; in 1791-1800 it was 63 s. 6d.; in 1801-1810 it was 83 s. 11d.; and in 1811-1820 it was 87 s. 6d. 9Early in the present century the Imperial taxes\u2014for the greater part war taxes\u2014amounted to one- fifth of the whole income of the country; whereas now they are not much more than a twentieth, and even of this a great part is spent on education and other benefits which Government did not then afford. 10Especially Godwin in his Inquiry concerning Political Justice (1792). There is some interest in the com- parison of Malthus' criticism of this Essay (Bk. III. Ch. II.) with Aristotle's comments on Plato's Republic (see especially Politics, II. 6). 11First edition 1798, second and more careful edition in 1806. Malthus' results were not all new and were not all true: but his work has the merit of being the first thorough application of the inductive method to social sciences. The chief workers therefore in the modern historical school of economics justly regard him as one of the founders of that school and his work as a solid possession for ever.[. . .]784 ARCHIVES Click to return to Table of Contentsand ends later12; but in every case the longer marriages are postponed be- yond the age that is natural to the country, the smaller is the birth-rate13. Given the climate, the average age of marriage depends chiefly on the ease with which young people can establish themselves, and support a familyaccording to the standard of comfort that prevails among their friends and acquaintances; and therefore it is different in different stations of life. In the middle classes a man's income seldom reaches its maximum till he is forty or fifty years old; and the expense of bringing up his children is heavy and lasts for many years. The artisan earns nearly as much at twenty-one as he ever does, unless he rises to a responsible post, but hedoes not earn much before he is twenty-one; his children are likely to be a considerable expense to him till about the age of fifteen; unless they are sent into a factory, where they may pay their way at a very early age; andlastly the labourer earns nearly full wages at eighteen, while his children begin to pay their own expenses very early. In consequence, the average age of marriage is highest among the middle classes; it is low among theartisans and lower still among the unskilled labourers 14. Unskilled labourers, when not so poor as to suffer actual want and not restrained by any external cause, have seldom, if ever, shown a lowerpower of increase than that of doubling in thirty years; that is, of multiply- ing a million-fold in six hundred years, a billion-fold in twelve hundred: and hence it might be inferred a priori that their increase has never gone on without restraint for any considerable time. This inference is confirmed by the teaching of all history. Throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, and in some parts of it even up to the present time, unmarried labourershave usually slept in the farmhouse or with their parents; while a married pair have generally required a house for themselves. When a village has as many hands as it can well employ, the number of houses is not increased;and young people have to wait as best they can. There are many parts of Europe even now in which custom exercis- ing the force of law prevents more than one son in each family from mar-rying; he is generally the eldest, but in some places the youngest: if any other son marries he must leave the village. When great material prosper- 12Of course the length of a generation has itself some influence on the growth of population. If it is 25 years in one place and 20 in another; and if in each place population doubles once in two generations during a thousand years, the increase will be a million-fold in the first place, but thirty million-fold in the second. 13Mr F. Gallon ( Inquiries into Human Faculty, pp. 320-1) estimated that in England the probable num- ber of children of women married at the ages of 17, 22, 27 and 32 are respectively 9.0, 7.5, 6.0 and 4.5; that is, that their relative fertilities are as 6, 5, 4, and 3.[. . .] 14The term marriage in the text must be taken in a wide sense so as to include not only legal mar- riages, but all those informal unions which are sufficiently permanent in character to involve for several years at least the practical responsibilities of married life. They are often contracted at an early age, and not unfrequently lead up to legal marriages after the lapse of some years. For this reason the average age atmarriage in the broad sense of the term, with which alone we are here concerned, is below the average age at legal marriage. The allowance to be made on this head for the whole of the working classes is probably con- siderable; but it is very much greater in the case of unskilled labourers than of any other class.[. . .]ALFRED MARSHALL 785 Click to return to Table of Contentsity, and the absence of all extreme poverty are found in old fashioned cor- ners of the Old World, the explanation generally lies in some such custom as this with all its evils and hardships15. It is true that the severity of this custom may be tempered by the power of migration; but in the MiddleAges the free movement of the people was hindered by stern regulations. The free towns indeed often encouraged immigration from the country: but the rules of the gilds were in some respects almost as cruel to peoplewho tried to escape from their old homes as were those enforced by the feudal lords themselves 16. \u00a75. In this respect the position of the hired agricultural labourer has changed very much. The towns are now always open to him and his chil- dren, and if he betakes himself to the New World he is likely to succeed better than any other class of emigrants. But on the other hand the gradualrise in the value of land and its growing scarcity is tending to check the increase of population in some districts in which the system of peasant properties prevails, in which there is not much enterprise for opening outnew trades or for emigration, and parents feel that the social position of their children will depend on the amount of their land. They incline to limit artificially the size of their families and to treat marriage very muchas a business contract, seeking always to marry their sons to heiresses. Mr Francis Galton has pointed out that though the families of English peers are generally large, the habit of marrying the eldest son to an heiress, whois presumably not of a fertile stock, and sometimes dissuading the younger sons from marriage, has led to the extinction of a great many peerages; and in the like manner among the French peasants this habit combined withtheir preference for small families keeps their numbers almost stationary 17. On the other hand there seem to be no conditions more favourable to the rapid growth of numbers than those of the agricultural districts of newcountries. Land is to be had in abundance, railways and steamships carry away the produce of the land and bring back in exchange implements of advanced types, and many of the comforts and luxuries of life. The \"farmer,\"as the peasant proprietor is called in America, finds therefore that a large 15A typical instance is that of the valley Jachenau in the Bavarian Alps. There the custom is rigidly enforced: and there are scarcely any small cottages in the valley. Aided by a great recent rise in the value oftheir woods, with regard to which they have pursued a farseeing policy, the inhabitants live prosperously in large houses, the younger brothers and sisters acting as servants in their old homes or elsewhere. They are of a different race from the work people in the neighbouring valleys, who live poor and hard lives, but seem tothink, so far as I could gather their opinions that the Jachenau purchases its material prosperity at too great a cost. 16See e.g. Rogers, Six Centuries, pp. 106-7. 17The birthrate in France is known to vary inversely with the predominance of small properties, being lowest in those departments in which the largest proportion of the agricultural population are landowners, and highest in those in which there are fewest peasant proprietors. See Dr Berthillon's statistics quoted by M. Yves-Guyot ( Social Economy, Bk. IV. Ch. I.). The birthrate in France was 32.3 per 1000 at the beginning of the century, and it has diminished steadily from decade to decade till now it is only 24.6. The extreme prudence of peasant proprietors under stationary conditions was noticed by Malthus. See for instance his account of Switzerland ( Essay, Bk. II. Ch. V.).786 ARCHIVES Click to return to Table of Contentsfamily is not a burden, but an assistance to him. He and they live healthy out-of-door lives; there is nothing to check but everything to stimulate the growth of numbers. The natural increase is aided by immigration; and thus, in spite of the fact that some classes of the inhabitants of large cities inAmerica are, it is said, reluctant to have many children, the population has increased sixteen-fold in the last hundred years. ... [The law of increasing return] \u00a73. Our discussion of the character and organization of industry taken as a whole tends to show that an increase in the volume of labour causes ingeneral, other things being equal, a more than proportionate increase in the total efficiency of labour. But we must not forget that other things may not be equal. A rapid growth of population has often been accompaniedby unhealthy and enervating habits of life in overcrowded towns. And some- times it has started badly, outrunning the material resources of the people, causing them with imperfect appliances to make excessive demands on thesoil; and so to call forth the stern action of the law of diminishing return as regards raw produce, without having the power of minimizing its effects. Having thus begun with poverty, an increase in numbers may go on to itstoo frequent consequences in that weakness of character which unfits a people for developing a highly organized industry. These are serious perils: but yet it remains true that the collective ef- ficiency of a people with a given average of individual strength and energy may increase more than in proportion to their numbers. If they can for a time escape from the pressure of the law of diminishing return by import-ing food and other raw produce on easy terms; if their wealth increases at least as fast as their numbers; and if they avoid habits of life that would enfeeble them; then every increase in their numbers is likely to be accom-panied by a more than proportionate increase in their power of obtaining material goods. For it enables them to secure the many various economies of specialized skill and specialized machinery, of localized industries andproduction on a large scale: it enables them to have increased facilities of communication of all kinds; while the very closeness of their neighbourhood diminishes the expense of time and effort involved in every sort of trafficbetween them, and gives them new opportunities of getting social enjoy- ments and the comforts and luxuries of culture in every form. No doubt deduction must be made for the growing difficulty of finding solitude andquiet and even fresh air: but there is in most cases some balance of good 18.ALFRED MARSHALL 787 Click to return to Table of ContentsTaking account of the fact that an increasing density of population generally brings with it access to new social enjoyments we may give a rather broader scope to this statement and say:\u2014An increase of population accompanied by an equal increase in the material sources of enjoymentand aids to production is likely to lead to a more than proportionate in- crease in the aggregate income of enjoyment of all kinds; provided firstly, an adequate supply of raw produce can be obtained without great diffi-culty, and secondly there is no such overcrowding as causes physical and moral vigour to be impaired by the want of fresh air and light and of healthy and joyous recreation for the young. The accumulated wealth of civilized countries is at present growing faster than the population: and though it may be true that the wealth per head would increase somewhat faster if the population did not increasequite so fast; yet as a matter of fact an increase of population is likely to continue to be accompanied by a more than proportionate increase of the material aids to production: and in England now, with easy access to abun-dant foreign supplies of raw material, an increase of population is accom- panied by a more than proportionate increase of the means of satisfying human wants other than the need for light, fresh air, etc. Much of thisincrease is however attributable not to the increase of industrial efficiency but to the increase of wealth by which it is accompanied: and therefore it does not necessarily benefit those who have no share in that wealth. Andfurther, England's foreign supplies of raw produce may at any time be checked by changes in the trade regulations of other countries, and may be almost cut off by a great war, while the naval and military expenditurewhich would be necessary to make the country fairly secure against this last risk, would appreciably diminish the benefits that she derives from the action of the law of increasing return. 18The Englishman Mill bursts into unwonted enthusiasm when speaking ( Political Economy, Bk. IV, ch. VI, \u00a7 2) of the pleasures of wandering alone in beautiful scenery: American economists from Carey to Henry George no less characteristically use their highest eloquence in splendid descriptions of the growing richness of human life as the backwoodsman finds neighbours settling around him, as the backwoods settlement de- velops into a village, the village into a town, and the town into a vast city.

The sciences of human behavior are being inexorably transformed by the intro- duction of genuinely neo-Darwinian evolutionary reasoning. Not to be confused\u2014as is still too often the case\u2014either with noxious expressions of a discredited So-cial Darwinism or with versions of societal developmentalism frequently mislabeledevolutionism, the current intellectual transformation is grounded in the realiza-tion that animal, including human, behavior is but another phenotypic expres-sion of organisms whose traits are products of a complex interaction of geneticinformation and environmental constraints. The upshot of these developments isthat social and behavioral scientists can no longer deny or ignore the fundamentalprinciples of the evolutionary sciences in their attempts to formulate more nearlycomplete explanations of their subject matter. Into this setting steps ChristopherWills, professor of biology at the University of California at San Diego, whose mostrecent book, Children of Prometheus , should appeal to a diverse audience. Indeed, his argument should be especially intriguing to students of human demographyand ecology because, as Wills correctly points out, \"demographic trends are, afterall, the very stuff of the evolutionary process\" (p. 118). The central problem that Wills explores concerns the rapid pace of hominid evolution over the past few million years. His answer to this intriguing puzzle isthat, relative to other primate species, humans and their hominid ancestors havebeen more likely to migrate into novel physical environments that posed unprec-edented challenges and, therefore, new selective pressures on their repertoire ofanatomical, physiological, and behavioral traits. Moreover, our ancestors were re-markably clever creatures, owing to the development of relatively big brains. Thismental agility undergirded their capacity for cultural innovation, further modify-ing the environments that our ancestors occupied. Other organisms, of course, behave in ways that alter their environments. But none do this to the degree exhibited by hominids. Our ancestors' extraordinaryadaptive flexibility enabled them to occupy physical environments far removed fromthose typical of their African origins, thereby exposing them to novel selective pres-sures. In addition, cultural innovations triggered additional environmen tal modifica- tions that represented new constraints on our ancestors' array of anatomical, physi-ological, and behavioral traits. It is this very mental and cultural flexibility, accordingto Wills, that continues to accelerate the pace of human evolution. All these genetic and environmental changes have tended to reinforce each other in a feedback loop. Any cultural or environmental change would have selected for indi- viduals who happened to carry genes that made them best able to take advantage of it. As a result, some of them (or their progeny) would have been clever enough to pro- duce still more cultural and environmental changes. This would lead to even more Click to print book reviews 790 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentsselection, not only for new genetic variants that had arisen by mutation but also for new combinations of old genes that are produced by the genetic shuffling known as recombination that takes place every generation. (p. 5) The story of hominid evolution is complex, constantly amended by new discover- ies, and only incompletely grasped. Still, Wills does a masterful job of telling thetale in an engaging and thought-provoking manner. The book is divided into three well-integrated parts. Part I, \"The many faces of natural selection,\" traces the debate over whether human traits continue to evolveand provides a strongly affirmative response. In a series of chapters, Wills providesreaders with an overview of the basic mechanisms of natural selection; sketches,by way of a fascinating comparison of Andean and Tibetan peoples, some intrigu-ing physiological adaptations and their possible genetic foundations in human popu-lations living at high altitudes; reviews recent evidence regarding host-parasitecoevolution and its implications for understanding certain human diseases, includ-ing one of the most informative accounts of sickle-cell anemia and of AIDS that Ihave encountered in recent years; examines the relationship between position inthe social hierarchy and levels of stress, partly by reference to a recent study of theBritish civil service; and assesses the evolutionary implications of declining fertil-ity and patterns of immigration in advanced industrial societies, making frequentmention of the effect of social and psychological attitudes on birth rates. Thesechapters, in particular, will be of special interest to demographers and human ecolo-gists. Part II of the volume, \"Our stormy evolutionary history,\" reviews the latest findings regarding hominid evolution; contrasts this evidence with what is knownabout the evolution of other ape species; and, throughout, emphasizes the relativerapidity of hominid and human evolution. The concluding Part III, \"Selection fordiversity,\" focuses on patterns of brain evolution and selection for mental flexibil-ity in humans. This latter characteristic, according to Wills, will assuredly be putto the test in years to come. Whether our physical environment becomes safer in the future or takes a turn for the worse, our intellectual environment is certainly becoming more challenging. It is in this realm that our future evolution will primarily take place, continuing and enhanc- ing the trend that has continued uninterrupted for the last several million years. The challenges we will face\u2014traveling to other stars, healing our damaged planet, learning how to live with our differences\u2014will be met in part because we will be able to draw on that genetic legacy. (p. 271) The conclusion is an apt one. No one can doubt that the most severe chal- lenges our species will face in years to come will be those of our own making, asWills rightly emphasizes throughout the volume. He singles out the threats stem-ming from the simplification of ecosystems stimulated by the spread of agricul-ture, from excessive global population growth, from the horrors of industrial acci-dents, and from the introduction of new and potentially toxic substances that posepotentially serious selective pressures on our species' traits. These and other formsof cultural transformation will certainly introduce potent selective pressures towhich our species may or may not adequately adapt.BOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )791 Click to return to Table of ContentsA brief review of Children of Prometheus can hardly do justice to Wills's richly textured argument. He effectively pulls together materials from a variety of spe-cialized fields, including archaeology, cultural and physical anthropology, epide-miology, medicine, neurobiology, primatology, social psychology, and sociology.That he tells this complexly woven story with a graceful style and an occasionaldose of keen wit only adds to the reader's enjoyment and enlightenment. It is, inshort, a volume from which social scientists with varying interests will be able tolearn much. Wills's argument illustrates the manner in which evolutionary theorymay usefully inform analyses of, for example, migration, ethnic intermarriage, fer-tility behavior, and patterns of morbidity and mortality. Above all, it stresses thepotent selective pressures emanating from the cultural environment that continueto shape the evolutionary pathway of our species and, in the process, reminds usthat the same selective forces that forged our traits in the distant past are still ac-tively constraining our species' destiny.

Both incorporate demographic factors intotheir analyses, making their efforts of potential interest to students of population.Fisher focuses on women's increased participation in the labor force, a global trendshe believes to be biologically driven. Evolutionary forces have molded womeninto \"web thinkers,\" who see the broad picture, consider all options, are sensitiveto others, accept ambiguity, and easily modify objectives when necessary. Women,in short, are ideal members of the twenty-first-century corporate work team. Oc-casionally Fisher's propensity to see biological advantage borders on the silly\u2014such as when contending that women's greater ability to see in dim light makesthem more adept viewers of slide presentations\u2014but most of her exposition fol-lows stereotypes: women will come to predominate in the health professions be-cause their greater natural empathy makes them better healers and because theirgreater dexterity makes them better surgeons. Her one foray into demographicanalysis is to provide a sociobiological slant on the aging of the baby boom genera-tion: women will burst through the glass ceiling in their corporate careers as theirfemale hormones decline with menopause, unmasking the power of their tes-tosterone. Demographers will find her analysis of which societies will experiencethis shift vague and occasionally misleading, and readers who like their stories792 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentswell plotted will find her testosterone explanation of employment success some- what at odds with her thesis about the new workplace's affinity for female traits.She does, however, manage to have something new to say about the baby boom. Tiger contributes to this \"production\" debate, but from the other side of the podium. He bemoans the fate of the prey-stalking, physically assertive male pro-grammed to focus single-mindedly on demanding tasks. When young, the con-temporary male finds himself in schools that unnaturally expect him to sit still forhours a day, for years on end, and when he rebels he gets filled with tranquilizersand is said to suffer from \"attention deficit disorder.\" Once discharged from schoolhe enters a workplace with few occupations, outside of the military and sports,suited to his inclinations. But no matter how great are the male's contemporaryworkplace problems, Tiger argues that his decline has even more to do with es-trangement from the reproductive realm. The arrival of female-controlled contra-ception, specifically the midcentury development of \"the Pill,\" marked the truedownfall of the male. In a world with the Pill a female can have sex when, andwith whom, she wants. If she desires a child, her improved work status frees herfrom the need for male support. The Pill infects the male, biologically driven toassure a place for his genes in the next generation, with a terminal case of \"pater-nity uncertainty.\" He reacts by walking away from his now questionable father-hood, and societies everywhere experience sharp upsurges in divorce and singlemotherhood. Tiger foresees a twenty-first-century world in which the male hasbecome so much the \"second sex\" that there might be no need for him. What do these analyses offer the student of population? Both provide enter- taining introductions to the thinking of evolutionary psychologists. Since they in-corporate familiar demographic themes in their analyses, one might hope that de-mographers reading them would be induced to broaden their explanatory horizons.I fear, however, that the authors' deductive methods and unsophisticated socialtrend analyses (most of which are lifted from newspaper accounts) will elicit moredismissal than marvel from this readership. Tiger, for example, never offers anyempirical evidence, other than a rough reference to timing, to support his theorythat the arrival of the Pill caused societal increases in divorce and single mother-hood\u2014not even a cursory discussion of Pill use rates, divorce rates, and rates ofsingle motherhood in various societies. He deduces the societal significance of fe-male-controlled contraception from a consideration of general sociobiological prem-ises, but attempts no empirical proof. This, however, might be a good thing be-cause in Tiger's demographic analyses what is most memorable are his gaffes: hisdiscussions of \"zero birth rates\" and his embarrassing explanation of how sex-se-lective abortion of female fetuses in India somehow produces \"an excess of poten-tial brides over potential grooms\" that facilitates the growing problem of dowrydeaths (p. 139). There is increasing scientific evidence that evolutionary processes have pro- duced sexes with distinct physiological and psychological traits, traits that mightbe especially relevant to any student of human behavior wishing to better under-stand patterns of work, marriage, and reproduction. These two books, however,provide a cautionary tale to those who would use trends of a comparatively briefduration to illustrate the utility of what, by its very nature, is a perspective onhuman behavior suited to explaining trends encompassing, at the least, many gen-erations. No doubt it is tempting in an era when the war between the sexes makesBOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )793 Click to return to Table of Contentsheadline news, and the public is troubled by having half its marriages fail and by having many of its daughters bring forth babies without husbands, to offer a \"deep\"explanation of the factors behind these events. But as demographers are acutelyaware, having themselves not foreseen the baby boom, social trends can be veryfickle things. Although just published, Tiger's talk of high unemployment amongAmerican males already sounds \"odd\" today. And having characterized the singleyoung mother as a \"Mother Courage\" who is \"at the heart of the ancient mamma-lian process\" (p. 174), one wonders what he would make of the sharp decline inbirth rates of single teens in the United States during the 1990s. Department of Sociology DENNIS HODGSON Fairfield University FRANCIS FUKUYAMA The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstitution of Social Order New York: The Free Press, 1999. xii + 354 p. $26.00. Big-picture social science aims to lend order to social facts, finding or refindingpatterns in them and telling stories about them. The facts need to be important,the stories interesting. Francis Fukuyama is an accomplished practitioner in thisdomain. The Great Disruption , like his earlier books, is directed at a wide audience. It should be of more than passing interest to social demographers. The plot line is simple. A great disruption in Western society has occurred; the author characterizes it. There are competing explanations for it, each of which theauthor finds unsatisfactory; he proposes his own. The disruption needs to be healed:history suggests that this healing may be largely a spontaneous process, but it isalso likely to require deliberate efforts at social innovation; the author makes afew general suggestions about what might be done. In the middle of this argument the author takes the opportunity to introduce some contemporary ideas in social science: kernels of theory and gobs of evidencethat might be drawn on in understanding what is going on and predicting howmatters might develop. These are popularizations rather than original contribu-tions, but are well done and sustain interest in themselves. However, they are notin fact much drawn on. Indeed, the single chapter on \"what comes next\" is quiteperfunctory. The reader, it might be said, has been shown the facts, given sometools, and now should go away and use them to fashion the remedy\u2014or simply tobe better informed in watching the repair take place unaided. So much for the skeleton; now for the flesh. The disruption of the title refers to a set of changes in Western societies observed starting in the 1960s: \"increasinglevels of crime and social disorder, the decline of families and kinship as a sourceof social cohesion, and decreasing levels of trust\" (p. 60). The demographic com-ponent of the disruption is seen in falling marriage rates, falling fertility rates andat the same time many more extramarital births, and sharply higher divorce rates.Fukuyama sees all these as manifestations of a decline in social capital. Social capital, roughly speaking, is the resources that inhere in social relations. The concept was examined thoroughly in a recent issue of this journal by Nan794 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsMarie Astone and colleagues (vol. 25, no. 1), where it was traced back to George Homans's 1950 monograph The Human Group . Fukuyama finds a much earlier use of the term\u2014in 1916, in an article on school community centers by Lyda JudsonHanifan. But the current popularity of the concept is owed mainly to PierreBourdieu, James S. Coleman, and Robert D. Putnam. Analytically, it is a rather critical question, as Astone et al. point out, whether social capital is a characteristic of an individual or a group. They hold strongly thatit should be the former, and criticize Coleman for fudging the issue. For Fukuyamasocial capital is more the glue of society, a measure of societal health. It is \"a set ofinformal values or norms shared among members of a group that permits coop-eration among them\" (p. 16). This was a theme developed in his last book, Trust . It is also the sense in which the term is used in the influential writings on Italyand the United States by Robert Putnam, and in the current debate over the em-pirical issue of whether social capital in the US has in fact been declining. Fukuyama sees societies as being in the business of maintaining systems of norms\u2014indeed, that is essentially what societies are. It is a dynamic enterprise, entailing constant adaptation and adjustment to changing circumstances. Sometimesthose changes may be so abrupt or severe as to undermine or destroy the norms gov-erning some area of behavior, perhaps many areas. But the same societal adjust-ment processes are engaged\u2014now in the task of repair and restoration, whatFukuyama calls the task of renorming . There is a kind of institutional homeostasis at work, not with any particular structural outcome in view (it is not a teleologicalprocess) but influenced by enduring human qualities and values that are probablyhard-wired into our species. As hints on how renorming might work, in the middlepart of the book, titled On the Genealogy of Morals, the reader meets in shortcompass the incest taboo, iterated prisoners' dilemmas, bonobo society, self-orga-nization, the logic of collective action, the Hayekian extended order, and variousother ideas that could bear on natural and spontaneous sources of social order. How reasonable is a faith in self-correcting mechanisms? Fukuyama's main instance of a successful renorming is the way he perceives that Victorian valuesbrought back into line the disarray of early industrial society. A striking graphshows the incidence of crime in England peaking in the 1840s and thereafter steadilydropping. In both Britain and the United States, \"masses of rude, illiterate agricul-tural workers and urban poor were converted into what we now understand asthe working class\" (p. 268)\u2014disciplined, washed, and sober. Much of this changewas a \"moral renovation\" brought about through inculcation of new values. Itwas associated with a widespread increase in religious observance, notably in sec-tarian Protestantism. Overt social control, through establishment of modern po-lice forces and a kind of early zero-tolerance policy, also helped. Fukuyama sees the currently disrupted order as already embarking on the path to reconstitution. Crime is down, family values are being reasserted, the era ofever-expanding individualism is ending. As in the Victorian case, religion is heldto be playing an important role in the process. But now it is religion as ritual andtradition rather than belief: a benign, social religiosity impelled by the desire forcommunity and the wish to instill the right values in children. (This might seem amore plausible prospect in the US than in Europe\u2014of a measure with the cynic'sone-time view of Anglicanism as the Tory party at prayer.)BOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )795 Click to return to Table of ContentsFamilism in itself would presumably help to sustain fertility, but Fukuyama makes no claims in this regard. A stable, renormed social order, replete with socialcapital, might turn out to be compatible with high rates of childlessness and single-person households and total fertility nearer a one than a two child average. Hismodest hope is for \"cultural adaptations that will make information age societiesmore hospitable to children\" (p. 276). Economic trends may help in this, throughthe shift from Taylorite working conditions to telecommuting. In addition, he sug-gests, the income and work status forgone by women through childrearing willseem less serious as men too increasingly lose security of employment and rou-tinely come to experience downward as well as upward mobility over the courseof their working lives. Fukuyama concludes by contrasting the unidirectionality of history in the po- litical and economic sphere\u2014culminating, as The End of History argued, in West- ern-style liberal democracy\u2014with the cyclical nature of history in the social andmoral sphere, \"with social order ebbing and flowing over the space of multiplegenerations\" (p. 282). Historically, fertility could be viewed as if it were an inci-dental part of the first sphere; demographers have yet to come to grips with fertil-ity as part of the second. Australian National University GEOFFREY MCNICOLL and Population Council TOM KIRKWOOD Time of Our Lives: The Science of Human Aging New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. x + 277 p. $27.50. Tom Kirkwood has written an interesting and readily accessible book on the \"new\"biology of aging. He presents a wealth of recent scientific material that is changingour view of biological senescence. Much of the scientific research Kirkwood citesis organized in reference to an article he published in Nature in 1977 on a specific theory of aging: the so-called disposable soma theory for which he received theguiding intuition\u2014as he indicates several times in the book\u2014while sitting in abathtub at home. The disposable soma theory eschews the notions that there are strictly pro- grammed life spans, that \"death genes\" have evolved to prevent overcrowding, oreven that biological senescence, as a unified process, is necessarily a direct out-come of evolution. Kirkwood suggests that cell replication, especially DNA errorchecking, is an energy-intensive process, for which reason a species' optimal sur-vival strategy is to favor genetic traits that enhance reproduction and maximizesurvival through the primary reproductive ages. This implies that there are intrin-sic limits to the energy available for biological error checking and other basic cel-lular functions at later ages and that, indeed, biological traits found to be optimalduring reproductive life may not be optimal at advanced ages. Hence, the somaticcells (in contrast to germ cells) are \"disposable\" in the same scheme of species-specific survival.796 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsAround this core model and theme Kirkwood reviews a number of classic re- search studies on aging such as the long-lived cell lines cultured by Alexis Carrel,the Hayflick and Martin experimental results on cell replication limits, and morerecent work on such specialized topics as Werner's syndrome, helicases, apoptosis,heat-shock proteins, and telomerase. By using a readily understandable conceptualmodel as a basis (i.e., the disposable soma model), Kirkwood skillfully challenges somespecific scientific results, such as earlier assertions about the complete independenceof the genetic mutations underlying cancer from those underlying senescence. Despite the evident value of the book as a comprehensive scientific review of many recent results, a few shortcomings may limit the book's value for certainscientifically trained readers. One problem is the absence of a standard bibliogra-phy. Instead, a brief bibliographic essay discusses broad areas of relevant literatureand identifies their primary authors. As a consequence, a number of assertionsabout particular scientific results or lines of investigation made in the text cannotbe directly verified. Although most of Kirkwood's assertions appear correct, oftenthe ideas of scientific investigators evolve over time, through several publications,so that this lack of reference to results in specific scientific publications will be aserious handicap to readers interested in the development of certain theoreticalarguments. A second major departure in the book is the inclusion of a science fiction-type epilogue that presents an image of the socio-biological future as generated by long-term extensions of current biomedical research and technology directed to bio-logical aging processes. How much value this adds to the book will depend uponthe individual reader and his interests. My version of the future of aging and lon-gevity might be very different from that presented in the epilogue. One individual'sview of the likely long-term development of the science of aging and its socialimplications must be highly speculative. A more substantive reservation concerns instances in which I feel the topic of research on aging was not as completely developed as it might have been. Forexample, there is limited discussion of the ability to manipulate the internal bio-chemical environment of the organism to modify phenotype expression, an areaof study now often referred to as pharmacogenomics. This approach is clearly thebasis of modern molecular medicine and pharmacology, which, aided by the ad-vent of micro-computers and processors, the evolution of bio-informatics, and spe-cial-purpose silicon chips that sense physiological levels of critical compounds andrelease drugs to the organism in nano-quantities, promise to modify age-relatedprocesses in a quite different fashion, and with greater control, than is currentlypossible. One aspect of this process is the control of phenotype and gene interac-tions, especially of \"latent\" (i.e., unexpressed) genes, by sets of complex proteinsgenerically called growth factors. This also suggests that more dimensions of agingand of aging-related changes could be environmentally, or exogenously, manipu-lated than once thought. We might, for example, allow neurons in specific areasof the brain to be replicated\u2014a principle Kirkwood seems not to explicitly recog-nize (see, e.g., p. 130). Such replication has been suggested, at least in theory, tooccur naturally in mammals and in humans, and there is evidence that physicaland cognitive activity stimulates the development of neurological complexity invarious animal species.BOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )797 Click to return to Table of ContentsThus, as with any rapidly developing scientific field, new areas of research are constantly emerging and it is not possible for all of them to be included in anysingle book. Many parts of the present book will undoubtedly have to be rewrit-ten within a few years. For example, the critical Hayflick limit model has beenlargely surpassed by a 1998 study that showed no correlation between age andthe remaining number of cell replications in healthy human subjects. Five newdrugs, intended to counteract the recently discovered enzymes forming the plaquesfound in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, will enter human trialsshortly. There is now even talk of curing Alzheimer's disease within several yearsthrough drug therapy. There were at least a dozen studies reporting several formsof neurogenesis and stem cell activity in the human brain in 1999. The productionof such scientific results is growing exponentially. This phenomenon is made pos-sible by advances in micro-electronics and computing. Such is the nature of lifeand aging\u2014and, in turn, of basic research on those topics. Center for Demographic Studies KENNETH G. M ANTON Duke University MARGO J. A NDERSON AND STEPHEN E. F IENBERG Who Counts? The Politics of Census-Taking in Contemporary America New York: Russell Sage, 1999. x + 319 p. $34.95. While census-taking may seem to be a cut-and-dried administrative procedure\u2014merely counting the people\u2014in many countries national population censuses havebecome flashpoints of controversy. This is because censuses reveal the relativeweights of numbers of different segments of the population. Which region has thegreatest population? Which cities have grown; which have shrunk? And, usuallymost contentious of all, what are the numbers of the various religio-ethnic groups?Insofar as these numbers are eventually translated into fundamental desideratasuch as economic resources and political power, it is no surprise that the censussits at a point of potential conflict. Who Counts? tells the story of an ongoing and apparently intractable census dispute in the United States. The authors, Margo Anderson, a social historian, and Stephen Fienberg, a math- ematical statistician, represent a uniquely qualified team. Anderson, author of thevaluable The American Census: A Social History (1988), has spent years studying the sociopolitical process of creating population statistics in the United States. Fienberg,former president of the American Statistical Association, has been deeply involvedwith special scientific committees that have advised the U.S. Census Bureau onstatistical methodology for the 1990 and 2000 censuses. Together they have writ-ten a book that takes advantage of both of their areas of expertise: it presents thehistorical background and the unfolding \"current history\" of what has been happen-ing in the US government regarding the census, and it clearly explains the statisticaltechniques along with the arguments that have arisen about them. The well-editedtext moves smoothly between the governmental and the statistical developments, pro-ducing a very readable volume.798 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsThe principal issue in the US census is this: regardless of the diligent efforts of the Census Bureau, time after time, the decennial enumeration is incomplete. Theundercount is consistently biased such that African-Americans are more likely to bemissed than whites. It has also been shown that other minorities, such as AmericanIndians and Latinos, are more likely to be missed as well. These biases have ramifica-tions for the system of allocating seats in the House of Representatives (Congress),which are based upon population size. If the 1990 census had been adjusted to correctfor the undercount, two states would have lost Congressional seats, which would havebeen allocated to other states. Within individual states, the undercount may also af-fect the way in which seats are allocated in the state legislature. Because big cities tendto have populations with disproportionate numbers of members of minority groups,the undercount negatively affects them more than it does suburbs and rural areas.Indeed, suburban areas are sometimes \"overcounted.\" For more than 30 years the issue has been how to address this problem. The political story begins with judicial rulings in the 1960s that increased the value ofsmall-area statistics, particularly in the process of allocating legislative seats, butalso in distributing tax dollars to local areas. Once politicians became aware of theimpact of these rulings, they became more attentive to census numbers than theyhad been in the past. Over time the political controversies intensified and, by themid-1990s, the two political parties were sharply and bitterly divided about howto conduct the 2000 census. The scientific story begins with a series of demographic discoveries that demon- strated that the 1940 census had systematically missed black males. Each census there-after was accompanied by evaluation studies. Starting in 1950, the demographic analysiswas accompanied by studies employing a second method, based upon large-scale sur-veys. These studies became increasingly sophisticated, incorporating different formsof dual-systems analysis. Demographic analysis made it possible to measure censusundercounts in a historical series, even retrospectively into the late nineteenth cen-tury. The survey-based evaluations gave a second set of estimates of undercounts incensuses from 1950 onward. Apparently both series of results showed that censuscoverage improved consistently: typically the gross undercount in each census wasless than that of the previous census. Despite this accomplishment, the census-takerswere unable to eliminate or even diminish the black-white differential. Anderson and Fienberg devote a chapter to the measurement of \"race\" and \"ethnicity,\" a topic that has been neglected in discussions of this problem. Theypoint out the unscientific nature of the concept of race and demonstrate the weak-ness of the census's questions on ethnicity. In this context, it is no wonder that itis so difficult to solve the problem of counting racial and ethnic groups. The authors emphasize that it is misleading to focus upon the census's net undercount, which represents the difference between the number of persons missedand an actual overcount, consisting of persons who were counted more than once.For various reasons, the 1990 census included individuals who were counted morethan once. It also included \"erroneous enumerations.\" Although the publishednet undercount was 1.8 percent, the authors suggest that \"it might be reasonableto expect that the percentage of people correctly counted was closer to 90 percentfor the 1990 count (corresponding to a gross error of about 10 percent).\" Ander-son and Fienberg assert that rather than evaluating a census on the basis of its netundercount, the correct criterion should be its overall error rate.BOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )799 Click to return to Table of ContentsBy 1990, statisticians at the U.S. Census Bureau had developed methods to make statistical corrections at all geographical levels, including for small areas, butwere prevented from using them. Thus, despite the errors in the census of thatyear, the Census Bureau published uncorrected numbers. The principal decision-maker who rejected the correction procedure was the Secretary of Commerce, aRepublican, whose department includes the Census Bureau. Although the direc-tor of the Census Bureau along with most knowledgeable statisticians supportedcorrection, the Secretary's decision was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court. Anderson and Fienberg contend that a court of law is an inappropriate forum in which to make a decision about the best way to take a census. This is becausethe court must make a decision based upon the legal formulation of the issue. Inthe case of the 1990 census, the Supreme Court's 1996 decision was based uponthe question of whether the Secretary of Commerce had violated the Administra-tive Procedures Act, not whether he had executed the census in the most accuratemanner. The authors point out a number of ironies in the differences between theways in which census issues are defined by social scientists and the way in whichthey are defined in the legal process. Much of Who Counts? is devoted to the story of the 2000 census, its planning, the statistical developments that support its methodology, and the political machi-nations that affected its final form. From the point of view of the population sci-ences, this is a sad tale. While census officials, along with supportive colleaguesoutside the government, were working to develop an efficient and accurate meth-odology, political groups had mobilized to thwart their plans. Census officials ex-perienced defeats in Congress and in the courts and were forced to withhold cer-tain procedures and to enter into cumbersome political compromises. While this book was published prior to the execution of the 2000 census, it is timely. Indeed, on its final pages, it even alludes to a January 1999 Supreme Courtdecision. Who Counts? is well-organized, full of interesting material, and clearly written. It is accessible to students as well as professionals. It should be of interestto anyone interested in censuses, population statistics, and issues at the nexus ofstatistics and politics. I suspect that the authors would be pleased if American jour-nalists, lawyers, and members of Congress, many of whom have misconstrued therecent issues (sometimes deliberately), would read this book.

Translation by Camille Naish of La politique des grands nombres: histoire de la raison statistique. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998. 368 p. $45.00. There have been a number of notable histories of statistics. The one by Harald Westergaard ( Contributions to the History of Statistics ), published in 1932 after his re-800 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentstirement from academia, is an interesting survey with full attention to population data. A later book by Stephen Stigler ( A History of Statistics , published in 1986) cov- ers much the same material as the work under review, with equations or graphson almost every page. Alain Desrosi\u00e8res, who has written what he calls a historyof \"statistical reasoning,\" generally assumes that the reader has the requisite back-ground in mathematics and focuses rather on the relation of the analytical struc-ture to its social and political context. The word \"statistics\" was introduced into English in the late eighteenth cen- tury to denote a survey of a political entity. As with the German Statistik from which it derived, in its original sense the \"survey\" did not have to be given innumbers. It was only later that \"statistics\" took on the same meaning as the earlier\"political arithmetic,\" numerical data about a state's population and other mea-surable characteristics. That both terms are etymologically related to the affairs ofstate, to politics, is evident; a \"statist,\" now rare in any sense, can mean either astatesman or statistician. But in most works on statistics this enduring associationwith official bureaucracy is not given its due. That Desrosi\u00e8res emphasizes it con-stitutes a distinctive and valuable feature of his book. The range of his history covers the principal Western countries, but, as a French scholar, he concentrates on France, and this is a happy circumstance. No othercountry exemplified so well the characteristics of the mercantilist era, and the ca-reer of a man such as Marshal Vauban (1633-1707) combined analysis with ad-ministration. And it was during the revolutionary and Napoleonic period thatFrance's adunation (or consolidation into one unit) took place. The metric system replaced various traditional measures; dialects were cut back and, through schoolsand the army, standard French was generalized; the new d\u00e9partements were given names that pointedly avoided any association with the former provinces. In everyrespect Paris became the nucleus of France, and the major role of statistics was tohelp administrators at the center. Typical of the book's style is the discussion of nineteenth-century debates over averages. Not only does it elaborate on the contributions of Gauss, Laplace, andQuetelet but the whole controversy is presented as a continuation of the four-teenth-century confrontation between realists and nominalists. \"The process ofaddition caused local singularities to disappear and caused a new object of a moregeneral order to appear.\" Quetelet's \"average man\" was a way to raise the sum ofmultiple units to a higher level, such as the price index or the unemployment rate, which soon was converted into inflation/deflation or, as a concept, the unemploy-ment that was being measured. Similarly, when in his work on suicide Durkheimspelled out how the \"moral constitution of groups\" differs radically from that ofindividuals, he set a pattern followed by the next century's sociologists. But whatif the average d\u00e9partement 's characteristics were used to describe Paris, for instance, which everyone knew was idiosyncratic? Then the \"realist\" point of view wouldbe false, and those on the other side of the long debate held that in such an in-stance using the average would be illegitimate. When the account of how modernstatistical thought developed is tied to a recollection of medieval philosophizing,the result is a novel and attractive presentation. A chapter on correlation begins with a review of Karl Pearson's The Grammar of Science (together with its 1912 French translation by Lucien March, director ofBOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )801 Click to return to Table of Contentsthe national statistical bureau). It was Pearson's central doctrine that \"we have to replace the old idea of causation\" with a correlation, ranging from 0 to 1, betweenany two occurrences. Between the work's first edition (1892) and the third (1911),its tools were applied by Francis Galton, who gave the dogmas of eugenics a quasi-scientific underpinning. Desrosi\u00e8res gives us a detailed account of the controversyover eugenics and the role that evolving statistical techniques played in it. Quetelethad used the normal curve to map human heights, and Galton, adapting it to so-cial aptitudes, divided the population into five categories of increasing genetic worth:criminals, paupers, etc.; the poor and low-paid; clerks, small tradesmen, etc.; and independent profes- sionals, large employers, etc. Pearson wrote a highly favorable biography of Galtonand thus enhanced the latter's already high reputation. How did the social-political structures of France, Britain, Germany, and the United States affect the establishment and development of the national statisticalbureaus of these four countries? The question is intriguing, and Desrosi\u00e8res's re-sponse is too complex to attempt an adequate summary here. In brief, nationalstatistics were characterized in France, in conflict with local interests, by a \"discreetlegitimacy.\" Britain benefited from a unique contribution of academic science to thepolitical process. The style of Prussian administration was spread to the rest of Ger-many. In the United States the constitutional legitimacy of the census was graduallyextended to an accounting of such \"social problems\" as immigration and unemploy-ment and so to the nation's natural resources. The International Statistical Institute,founded in 1885, helped to consolidate the different kinds of achievement and, also,to legitimize sampling as a new method of gathering more data. One major problem in the development of all the countries' national statistics was what Desrosi\u00e8res calls \"the encoding stage\" in their production, essentiallythe rationale of aggregation. Were categories actual things, as the Durkheimiantradition held, or were they statistical constructs, or\u2014even more confusing\u2014anindeterminate blend of the two? Choosing the method of aggregating data resultsin a distinctive \"knowledge\" and thus, based on those \"facts,\" a specific policy. Forexample, the shift in attention from \"poverty\" to \"unemployment\" resulted in \"thebirth of a new variable.\" In summary, the book presents a graph showing lines ofderivation from eighteenth-century sources (mathematics, classical political eco-nomics, German statistics, English political arithmetic, astronomy, and probabilitytheory) to the probabilistic method in twentieth-century econometrics. This is more a work of sociology and political economy than a technical ac- count of how statistical operations developed. The reification of numbers charac-teristic of the Durkheimian tradition, and thus of much of today's sociology, isdepicted especially well. So far as I know, it is in this respect a pathbreaking book. The one striking lack is that Desrosi\u00e8res omits any discussion of how national bureaus use their products to present a desired profile of the country depicted. The Politics of Numbers (1987), edited by William Alonso and Paul Starr, contains a num- ber of interesting discussions of American statistics, together with a general intro-duction by Starr that parallels the book under review. A still richer crop of ambi-guity/falsity could be garnered from Europe, not to say less developed countries.In his book on Europe's Population in the Interwar Years (1946), Dudley Kirk noted some of the extraordinary devices used to enlarge particular sectors of nations'802 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentspopulations. In the old Austrian censuses, thus, Yiddish speakers were classified as part of the German majority, which thereby increased in size and implicit power.In Germany's censuses the two dialects of Kaschub and Masurian were counted asdifferent from Polish, but no less distinctive dialects of German were incorporatedinto High German. Between the 1910 census of Austria-Hungary and the 1921census of the successor state of Czechoslovakia, the recorded number of Germanspeakers fell by 13.7 percent, the recorded number of Hungarian speakers inSlovakia by 43.6 percent. The interest of the state in the formation of statisticsdoes not always encourage accuracy. Carmel, California WILLIAM PETERSEN HENK A. DE GANS Population Forecasting 1895-1945: The Transition to Modernity Dordrecht/Boston/London: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999. xvii + 290 p. $130.00. Early efforts at population forecasting, in the late seventeenth century, were basednot on calculations but rather on prophecies or descriptions of possible future de-mographic scenarios. Not until the end of the nineteenth century did demogra-phers forecast future population developments on the basis of mathematical cal-culations. As prerequisites for this they needed both data on past demographicpatterns and methods for calculating future population trends. For data to be collected, systematized, and evaluated on a regular basis re- quired statistical offices. Within a few decades of the establishment of such offices,demographers and statisticians were engaged in a scientific discussion of adequatemethods for population forecasting. The earliest methods, based on geometric ex-trapolation, were challenged and new methods and principles were tested and in-troduced into the practice of statistics. This process, which extended from the endof the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, is the temporalfocus of de Gans's study. De Gans also focuses his book geographically, concen-trating on the evolution of population forecasting in the Netherlands. It is now widely accepted that 1895-1945 was roughly the period in which population forecasting occupied center stage in demography and statistics, althoughdebates about demographic forecasting methods continue up to the present. 1 But de Gans's argument that the innovative and essential ideas in this debate camefrom the Netherlands (pp. 2-3 and 111-112) is novel. In his introduction, de Gans outlines the methodological approaches to the geometrical extrapolation of trends that were employed in population forecastingup to the end of the nineteenth century. In 1895, the English economist and stat-istician Edwin Cannan (Amsterdam: Swets Dennis A. Ahlburg and Wolfgang Lutz, \"Introduction: The need to rethink approaches to population forecasts,\" in Frontiers of Population Forecasting , ed. Wolfgang Lutz, James W. Vaupel, and Dennis A. Ahlburg, Population and Development Review , Supplement to Volume 24 (1998): 1-14.BOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )803 Click to return to Table of Contentslation projection,2 ushering in a modernization of population forecasting meth- ods. According to de Gans, however, more than 20 years passed before other sci-entists recognized the innovative nature of the new approach and applied it. De Gans claims that Dutch town planners, insurance experts, and other spe- cialists were the first to reexamine the methodological foundations of populationforecasting in the 1920s, at a time when the \"scientific statistical and actuarialestablishment\" was unwilling to accept the new methods. According to de Gans,the great gulf between the representatives of mainstream statistics and the sup-porters of the new methods developed as a result of the mathematization of de-mography. Those who favored \"modern\" methods were convinced that probabil-ity analysis would allow for more precise forecasts of future demographic trends,whereas more conservative economists and statisticians believed that probabilitycalculus was not a valid component of official statistics. De Gans attributes therejection of the new methods by influential representatives of official statisticalinstitutes to their limited knowledge of mathematics. In their opinion, any obser-vations extending beyond evaluating official statistics were of a speculative natureand incompatible with the traditional objectives of government agencies. The debate between the traditionalists and the followers of modern approaches was triggered by a doctoral dissertation by the statistician Gerhard Adolf HeinrichWiebols (1895-1960). Wiebols calculated future population trends in the Nether-lands on the basis of both the age structure of the initial population and the age-specific mortality and fertility rates of preceding years. This approach was an ex-tension of the methods introduced by Cannan. In the early 1920s, long before R. R.Kuczynski (1876-1947) published calculations of the net reproduction rate, Wiebolsbased his own calculations on this method. Without disputing Kuczynski's accom-plishments in this area, de Gans demonstrates the diversity of research approachesto the NRR and emphasizes Wiebols's contribution in propagating the new method. For the most part de Gans corroborates his argument with references to and quotations from primary sources. However, he is not fully consistent in applyingthese principles of scientific-historical investigation. He fails to follow them whenhis exposition of the graphical representations of the evolution of fertility ratessince the second half of the nineteenth century relies not on Kuczynski's data butrather on Chesnais's compilations thereof, published in 1992 (pp. 86-87). 3 Of greater importance, it seems to me, is the question of how Kuczynski himself in-terpreted his scientific work, especially his contributions to population forecast-ing. According to de Gans, Kuczynski followed the zeitgeist of those years withoutargument; like his contemporaries, he was concerned about the prospect of zerogrowth or population decrease as a result of prevailing demographic trends. How-ever, de Gans presents no quotations to support these assertions. 2Instead of using the normally employed method of mathematical extrapolation, Cannan developed a new approach that was basically aimed at calculating the number of survivors in the 15-45 age range.

(This book is a translation of the French original that appeared in 1986.)804 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsAn original motivation for de Gans's investigation was the question of why scant notice has been taken of the innovative methods developed by Dutch de-mographers and statisticians, either nationally or internationally. The methodol-ogy of demographic forecasting was discussed at the World Population Confer-ence held in Geneva (1927) and at a meeting of the International Statistical Institutein Tokyo (1930). At these conferences, however, the official representatives ofDutch statistics and demography failed to inform participants about the new meth-ods developed by Wiebols and others. This, according to de Gans, is why the inter-national community of scientists had little knowledge of these innovations. It remains unresolved whether the skepticism the traditionalists maintained vis-\u00e0-vis the Dutch representatives of \"modern\" methods was part of official policyand of the associated administrative and planning institutions. The question gainsinterest when one takes note of the discrepancy between the expectations of pub-lic policymakers concerning population forecasting, on the one hand, and out-comes of the new approaches to demographic forecasting, on the other. In con-trast to their counterparts in other European countries, Dutch demographers inthe 1920s were not concerned about a decline of the birth rate but rather about apopulation \"explosion.\" The population of the Netherlands seemed to be growingtoo quickly in relation to the rate of economic development. This population growthwas atypical in Western Europe for the 1920s and 1930s and, apparently, it wascause for concern as the Dutch economy showed signs of stagnation. One mightsurmise that the discrepancies between demographic and economic trends wereexpressed all too clearly by those using modern statistical methods. Could it bethat population forecasts threatened the political and economic establishment andwere therefore not accepted by the representatives of official statistics? This and other questions call for continued research into the history of de- mography\u2014a subject to which de Gans has made an impressive contribution.

Population and Poverty in the Developing World Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999. x + 305 p. $70.00. This volume contains selected papers from a seminar on \"population and poverty\" held in Florence in 1995 under the auspices of the IUSSP, UNICEF, and the Uni-versity of Florence. The seminar brought together a multidisciplinary group, mainlyof demographers, economists, and social scientists. It represented a laudable at-tempt by the organizers to bring poverty-related issues to the demographic re-search agenda, issues that had long been the domain of economists who com-monly defined poverty \"in terms of income or consumption deprivation relativeto a monetary threshold (the so-called poverty line)\" (p. 11).

Under the circumstances, one is bemused to read in the blurb on the dust jacket a statement that the book begins with \"an exact definitionof poverty.\" In fact, several authors of chapters in the book begin with a descrip-tion of \"poverty concepts\" as understood in their particular study. Michael Lipton'schapter, \"Population and poverty: How do they interact?\" illustrates the multifactednature of the relationships between population variables and poverty-related vari-ables. The introductory overview by the editors recognizes the complexity of theproblem, stating: \"At the risk of oversimplification, three main lines of thoughtmay perhaps be identified\" (p. 2). Exclusive reference to the developing world in the title of the book (or to de- veloping countries, as the title is rendered on the spine of the book) is a misno-mer. The chapter by Giovanni Andrea Cornia and Renato Panicci\u00e0, \"The transition'spopulation crisis: Nuptiality, fertility, and mortality changes in severely distressedeconomies,\" deals exclusively with East European countries. In spite of the eco-nomic shocks and subsequent changes in demographic parameters that these coun-tries have undergone after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this chapter canhardly be said to deal with the developing world. Anastasia Gage's chapter on\"The social implications of adolescent fertility\" uses data from sub-Saharan Africaand the United States but fails to make a case for poverty as a social consequenceof adolescent fertility in Africa. In fact, she cites earlier research by Bledsoe andCohen, who conclude that \"for very young married women living in rural areas,where society may define early childbearing as normal and even desirable, thesocial and economic risks of not bearing children probably outweigh the physical risks of bearing children\" (quoted on p. 142). Two chapters do provide a broad sweep of problems of poverty in the devel- oping world: David Satterthwaite and Christine Oppong on \"Household labour allocation andmobility in times of crisis.\" Environmental hazards, particularly those related tohealth that low-income groups face in urban areas of the developing world, arewell documented in Satterthwaite's chapter. The enormity of the problem can begauged by his statement that \"[a]t least 600 million urban dwellers in Africa, Asia,and Latin America are estimated to live in 'life and health-threatening' homes\"owing to environmental hazards (p. 215). The chapter questions two commonassumptions, namely that \"large and often rapidly growing cities in the South havethe most serious environmental problems; and that poverty necessarily contrib-utes to environmental degradation\" (p. 189). W\u00e9ry and Oppong's chapter tracesthe changes in labor allocation arising from globalization and increased poverty inmany parts of the world. Citing a 1992 World Bank study, they state that in sub-Saharan Africa the number of persons below the Bank's poverty line increased by30 million during the five-year period 1985-90 (p. 162). The chapter studies suchcoping mechanisms available within the family as child labor and the increasedfeminization of the labor force. Rural-to-urban migration has created masses ofurban unemployed poor, and international migration offering remittances to thefamily is often considered the only option. W\u00e9ry and Oppong note: \"A generalconclusion of the analysis of urban poverty, at least in Africa and in Latin America,is that poverty is much more linked to the composition of households in terms ofeconomically active and non-active members . . . than to and age composition)\" (p. 171).806 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsThe household as a unit of study is the focus of several chapters from both economists' and demographers' standpoints. Cynthia Lloyd, in her chapter \"House-hold structure and poverty: What are the connections?\" points out that in eco-nomic and \"family economics\" Demographers use the current UN definition of \"household,\"which implies the sharing of residence and food and other resources, whereas theterm \"family\" is restricted to a group of individuals \"related by blood, marriage, oradoption\" (pp. 86-87). The chapter indicates how variants of the relationship be-tween household and family as well as intrahousehold resource allocation couldhave different implications for the poverty of individuals. Focusing on individualswithin households would require modifications in methods used to fill in house-hold questionnaires. Patricia David's chapter, \"High fertility and short spacing: The poverty conse- quences of family-building patterns,\" points out the need to use \"in-depth sur-veys\" to elicit information that usual cross-sectional methods are unable to cap-ture. \"Studies of small homogeneous groups living in poor conditions may help toclarify the mediating processes that families use to cope with limited resources,and the factors that enable them to cope\" (p. 119). She reaches a conclusion dif-ferent from Lloyd's on data-collection methods: \"Focusing on families, rather thanon individual members may provide us with further information on factors thataffect all household members\" (p. 119). Sudhir Anand and Jonathan Morduch's chapter, \"Poverty and the 'popula- tion problem,'\" examines the conflicting economic and demographic interpreta-tions of the oft-cited positive correlation between poverty and household size. Theystate that the \"evidence from Bangladesh underscores the importance of consider-ing the poverty of individuals and not just poverty at the level of households, fami- lies or regions\" (p. 10). They stress the need for the study of negative externali-ties\u2014the notion that \"the actions of a household can have adverse consequencesfor other households\" (p. 18)\u2014particularly as related to \"gender inequality.\" Theyalso note that while \"high fertility can be an important way that households copewith poverty, . . . it is mothers and their daughters who often end up paying thehighest price\" (p. 24). My own work on poverty and widowhood in Kinshasa confirms the need for in-depth interviews as an important instrument in understanding poverty: thusthere is a marked difference, in terms of coping after the death of their spouses,between widows from patrilineal ethnic groups and widows from matrilinealgroups. Widows from the former tend to be immediately left to their own resources,while the latter can count on some family support and safety nets. Further, themacro view that having many children is a burden is not perceived at the microlevel, since widows regard their offspring as their major security, at least in thelong term. Two chapters study the consequences of poverty as related to nutrition. Anna Ferro-Luzzi and Francesco Branca deal with the biological effects of nutritionalinsecurity, while Siddiqur Osmani correctly warns of the long-term negative con-sequences of famine, which the study of purely demographic variables might miss.The volume also contains a chapter by Alaka Basu on poverty and AIDS.BOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )807 Click to return to Table of ContentsSeveral of the chapters in this volume are \"review papers\": there are only 25 tables in all, of which fully 14 are in the chapter by Cornia and Panicci\u00e0. However,the reference list, taking up nearly one-seventh of the book, will be useful to thoseinterested in a multidisciplinary approach to the subject of demography and pov-erty. The absence of an in-depth chapter illustrating the strengths and difficultiesinvolved in interpreting convergent \"soft\" data\u2014often the only data available insub-Saharan Africa to identify and measure poverty\u2014is a shortcoming. Data mea-suring indicators such as income/expenditure, calories consumed per head in re-lation to some standard requirement, and proportion of income/expenditure spenton food may be separately weak, but if they identify roughly the same poverty group,use of the estimates obtained would be justified. Discussions of policy issues related topoverty alleviation, outside those concerned with fertility, are also mainly absent. International Population Concerns STAN D'S OUZA Brussels WILLIAM A. J ACKSON The Political Economy of Population Ageing Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar, 1998. viii + 248 p. $80.00. Written by a British economist, this book extends beyond the conventional terri-tory of works on the economics of aging. This field, Jackson tells us, \"demandspolitical economy rather than economics, that is to say, it spills over into politicsand other social sciences.\" Jackson regards the framework provided by neoclassi-cal economics as inadequate for dealing with the aging of individuals or popula-tions and is skeptical about the practical significance of general equilibrium mod-eling and other attempts to depict the macroeconomic effects of aging. His thesis,not original but still welcome, is that \"Alarmism about population ageing is at leastpartly ideological in character.\" He points out, as have a number of others, that itis inconsistent to tolerate unemployment as a necessary feature of a marketeconomy while focusing on the threat of old-age economic dependency. The book includes chapters on such standard economic themes as productiv- ity and employment and pensions and retirement (although surprisingly little at-tention is paid to wealth, incomes, or expenditure patterns). Additionally, Jack-son reviews sociological theories of aging and briefly discusses current debates aboutmorbidity change in the chapter on health and social services. This chapter fol-lows the standard approach of assuming rising health care costs as a result of popu-lation aging (see Normand 1998 for an alternative view), but also includes consid-eration of other influences on these costs. The section on social services is tiedfairly closely to British experience, although some comparative material is included.Informal economic activity is given a chapter of its own, including rather complicatedsuggestions for estimating the benefits and costs of the contributions of caregivers. Perhaps inevitably, covering such wide territory means that some sections are superficial, including, unfortunately, the introductory demographic review.808 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsJackson's grasp of population dynamics seems shaky in places, and in his discus- sion of the causes of demographic change he follows a traditional line in assumingthat economic change leads to mortality decline, which is then followed by fertil-ity decline. While the book is not intended to be global in coverage, some appre-ciation of the changes in vital rates and age structure now underway in much ofthe less developed world would have been welcome. As it is, Jackson merely as-serts that \"most Third World countries have yet to experience significant popula-tion ageing. . . . Future prospects rest on whether, as Third World countries un-dergo economic development, their fertility declines in the same way that it hasdeclined in the developed countries.\" The book includes extensive references and a reasonable index, though very little in the way of tabular material. It is unlikely to replace the classic texts on theeconomics of aging (Schulz 1976; Clark and Spengler 1980) but would make auseful addition to the reading lists of social science students whose courses in-clude consideration of the effects of population aging.

S OLINGER Contesting Citizenship in Urban China: Peasant Migrants, the State, and the Logic of the Market Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. xix + 444 p. $50.00; $19.95 (pbk.). The recent rise of migration in China has been characterized as the largest labor flow in human history and the most important socio-demographic change in Chinain the last two decades. Alarms abound of millions of aimless Chinese peasants\"on the move\" within China and beyond, leading to massive domestic social un-rest and illegal international emigration. Notwithstanding a recent rise in the schol- arly literature on the subject, only with the publication of Solinger's book can onepoint to a single authoritative source for understanding recent Chinese migration. This original analysis addresses all the common issues a demographic study would con-tain, but within a much broader historical and political framework and in greaterdepth. It is also highly readable. The three key words in the title of Solinger's book, citizenship, state, and mar- ket, capture the main institutional elements involved in understanding peasantBOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )809 Click to return to Table of Contentsmigrants' behavior. Citizenship defines the status of the different actors, while the state and the market furnish the relevant institutional contexts. The state may beconsidered the main culprit in the creation of the two types of citizenship\u2014urbanand rural\u2014but it is also simultaneously an engineer of and an obstacle to marketreforms. The market, which was largely introduced by state reforms in the lasttwo decades, is now a major driving force for migration. One may question whether it is appropriate to employ the term citizenship in dealing with a single national population. But as Solinger documents and explainssuccinctly and convincingly (in the Introduction and in Chapter 2), citizenship,especially in its civil and social senses (identity/membership and distributive rights),applies well in this context. The two kinds of citizenship, urban and rural, thatwere created during the era of state socialism now form the basis of the broadestkind of social inequality in China. Whereas urban Chinese citizenship comes withfull provision of social welfare, rural citizenship, which all peasant migrants share,essentially entails self-responsibility in food supply, housing, employment/income,and lacks most of the welfare benefits enjoyed by urban Chinese. Chinese peas-ants belong to what Solinger characterizes as half-citizenship or second-class citi-zenship. Peasants' migration into cities is, therefore, a process of contesting theircitizenship status. Following a useful section on the definition and numbers of migrants (inserted immediately following the introduction and awkwardly labeled as an appendix),the major body of the book is organized into two parts: three chapters devoted towhat Solinger calls \"Structure\" and three to \"Agency.\" Each part contains threeparallel chapters, addressing state migration policies, urban bureaucracies, and ur-ban rationing regimes. In \"Structure,\" Solinger focuses on the role of the state in turning peasants into subjects and analyzes the state bureaucracies that were created in enforcingmigration control during this process. Moreover, she examines how the rise ofmigration has posed a fundamental challenge to the urban establishment, and howurban bureaucrats reacted, rather than acted, in response to the influx of ruralmigrants. Throughout this process, however, what emerges most clearly is howurban bureaucracies have utilized their powers to control and exploit rural mi-grants. Recognizing the incompetence of the old urban bureaucracies and con-fronting an emerging market economy, bureaucrats began to try to control mi-grants by the use of market forces\u2014allowing full play to the influences of supply anddemand. The result has been what Solinger calls the \"commodification of transients.\" Chinese peasant migrants, however, like migrants elsewhere, are proactive in charting their own lives. In the section on \"Agency,\" Solinger examines why andhow Chinese peasant migrants departed from their places of origin and what theyencountered in the cities. These chapters, like those in the preceding part on \"Struc-ture,\" are based not only on Solinger's thorough understanding of the Chinesepolitical structure but also on the author's numerous interviews of migrants, schol-ars, and officials in the 1990s. Her accounts contain rich information and analyseson the roles played by geography, ecology, and custom in forming different mi-grant streams. They cover a wide range of subjects, including migrants' social net-works, remittances, and labor market experiences, and depict how peasant mi-810 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsSHORT REVIEWS by John Bongaarts, Martin Brockerhoff, Paul Demeny, Susan Greenhalgh, Geoffrey McNicoll TOM ATHANASIOU Divided Planet: The Ecology of Rich and Poor Boston: Little, Brown, 1996. x + 385 p. $16.95 (pbk.). In this vigorous account, part digest, part deft dissection, part polemic, Tom Athanasiou lays out the themes and politics of the environmental debate. It waswritten in \"an odd and bitter moment\" in the history of the green movement, inthe aftermath of the Rio Earth Summit. The author's position might be describedas distributionist: the world's environmental crises and possibilities for their reso-lution are intricately bound up with North-South issues. He is critical both of main-stream opponents of environmentalism among economists and industry lobbyistsand of many among his own ranks who are seen as naive, politically reactionary,or uselessly radical. These latter categories include deep ecologists and environ-mental catastrophists, and, quite prominently, those who trace environmental prob-lems in some measure to overpopulation. Indeed, Athanasiou tries to remove popu-lation from the environmental debate. He complains that environmentalism \"hasgrants cope outside of the urban rationing regime and how they attempt to alter their status as half-citizens. What Solinger concludes concerning Chinese peasants' efforts to achieve full citizenship via migration is rather pessimistic. The pessimism is based on Solinger'sunderstanding of the small steps the state has made so far in granting such statusand on the tenacity of the existing social and political arrangements in China. Thisconclusion and other insightful analyses in the book serve as important lessons forscholars and policymakers. They illustrate how a socialist development policy hasresulted not in decreased but increased social inequality. They elucidate why andhow migration has to be understood within the political and social context. Andthey highlight the enormous challenges still faced by the Chinese reforming statein its so-called transition to a market economy.

Insetting out his own beliefs, Athanasiou is often eloquent. \"Ecological fear is heavywith the decay products of impotence\u2014frustration, anger, and paranoia\u2014and withthe contingencies of class and social position.\" And elsewhere: \"Left to their owndevices, markets shift ecological and social costs into the 'commons,' and destroyboth nature and human communities in the process.\" Index.\u2014G.McN. ESTER BOSERUP My Professional Life and Publications 1929-1998 Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1999. 62 p. $15.00. This slim hard-bound volume, with a cover design that will be familiar to PDR's readers from Ester Boserup's last contribution to this journal (\"Development theory:An analytical framework and selected applications,\" September 1996), offers a re-view by the author of her seven decades of professional work and writing. Thebook contains nine chapters, each with brief commentary on the various issuesthat her work addressed, accompanied by bibliographical citations to publishedwork and to selected manuscripts\u2014a total of more than 70 items. Born in Copenhagen in 1910, Boserup graduated from the University of Copenhagen in 1935. The earliest citation in the bibliography is from 1934, thelast (the present volume) is from 1999. She began her career in the Danish civilservice as an economist, dealing with practical problems related to trade policyand regulatory issues. In 1947 she moved to Geneva, having taken a position withthe newly established United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The movemarked the beginning of several decades of work in various international posts,assignments, and consultancies in the field of development economics, includinglong stays in India and Africa and involving extensive participation in interna-tional meetings, conferences, and committees. Living in Brissago, Switzerland, sheremained active in the latter capacity until the early 1990s and as a productivescholar through her remaining years. Boserup rose to international prominence as an eminent social scientist and a major intellectual figure with the publication, in 1965, of her book The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure . It was a contribution that challenged the dominant Malthusian paradigm on the re-lationship between population growth and technical progress by arguing that popu-lation pressure can lead to agricultural intensification and to the adoption of im-proved methods of production. As Boserup notes in the present volume (p. 21),812 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contents\"my conclusion was the opposite of the general opinion at that time, when it was believed that the carrying capacity of the globe was nearly exhausted and that theongoing demographic transition in developing countries would result in soaringfood prices and mass starvation.\" Two highly influential (and also widely trans-lated) books followed: Woman's Role in Economic Development (1970) and Population and Technological Change: A Study of Long-Term Trends (1981). A selection of Boserup's major essays, Economic and Demographic Relationships in Development , appeared in 1990. Reviewing that volume in the December 1990 issue of this journal, VernonRuttan commented (p. 775): \"Ester Boserup's writings have had a major impactover the last quarter century on the evolution of thought in anthropology, de-mography, economics, and sociology about the interrelationships among economic,demographic, and technical change.\" The present volume will help to maintainand amplify her intellectual influence. Since 1977 Ester Boserup served on the Advisory Board of Population and De- velopment Review. Between 1976 and 1996 seven contributions of hers appeared in PDR's regular issues or in the journal's Supplement volumes. Ester Boserup died on September 24, 1999, at the age of 89.\u2014P.D. JOACHIM VON BRAUN , TESFAYE TEKLU , AND PATRICK WEBB Famine in Africa: Causes, Responses, and Prevention Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. xvii + 219 p. $39.00. Famine in Africa makes an important contribution to a better understanding of the causes of hunger in developing societies, while also providing the most thoroughassessment to date\u2014through a synthesis of empirical research\u2014of policies imple-mented to prevent and mitigate famine in poor countries. On the basis of findingsfrom six African countries in particular, the authors argue against single-causeexplanations of famine (for instance, by application of Sen's concept of household\"entitlements\"). Instead, they propose an ambitious model of the determinants offamine that underscores the linkages between (1) policy, institutional, and orga-nizational failures; (2) resource poverty and climate shocks; and (3) rural popula-tion pressure. From this multi-causal framework with synergistic influences, onecan conclude, for instance, that recent famines in Ethiopia, Sudan, and elsewherein Africa are \"largely the result of military conflicts that arise due to oppressive,unaccountable, and nonparticipatory government,\" while also maintaining thatfamine is \"inseparable from chronic poverty and risk.\" An unhappy conclusion isthat few hunger-related policies and programs can work in politically unstable,war-torn environments (a description that characterizes about half of the coun-tries in the region). More positive evidence points to the growing potential of earlywarning systems to alert governments and the international community to thepossibility of famines before they emerge. The cursory discussion of demographic forces underlying famine, and of ur- ban food insecurity, is likely to confuse population scholars. The authors dismissthe Malthusian scenario of famine driven by accelerated person/cropped-land ra-tios on the basis of a weak relationship observed in a few countries over timeBOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )813 Click to return to Table of Contentsbetween nutritional status and cultivable land per capita. They proceed, however, with a simulation analysis of famine risk in a small region of Rwanda (the Giciyecommune) that predicts an untenable Malthusian situation of no-food/no-jobs/high population growth rates by 2005. Similarly, consistent evidence is presentedfrom 13 countries that urban children are better nourished than rural children,but is then declared invalid because the urban data \"do not distinguish betweenchildren living in slums and shantytowns and those in the more prosperous, middle-class areas\"; most urbanites in Africa, in fact, live in small towns. High urban growthrates in Africa, the authors assert, are \"largely due to the influx of people fromrural regions (particularly areas affected by war, drought, and famine).\" To thecontrary, the most recent data from the United Nations indicate that natural in-crease is the main component of urban growth in Africa, and few urbanites in theregion are actually refugees or displaced persons. The consideration of demographicfactors as an influence on famine is a welcome addition to this study, but it revealsthe need for continued dialogue between demographers and food policy research-ers to avoid inaccurate generalizations regarding the influence of population changeon food security.\u2014M.B.

East West Perspectives on 21st Century Urban Development: Sustainable Eastern and Western Cities in the New Millennium Aldershot, England: Ashgate Publishing Ltd., 1999. xiv + 432 p. $78.95. The 15 chapters of this book are organized around a central theme: The new glo- bal economy, based on the rapid flow of information and capital, is creating newforms of prosperous, \"networked\" cities in Southeastern Asia, cities that increas-ingly resemble those of America's northeastern corridor. While this transforma-tion promises benefits for most residents of Asia\u2014such as raising incomes to West-ern levels\u2014it also carries unprecedented challenges for urban and regional planning.This is evident from Peter Hall's characterization of the Pearl River Delta region ofsouthern China. This string of cities and urbanized zones has experienced the fast-est economic growth in the world since around 1980, but growth has been depen-dent on heavy inflows of foreign direct investment and temporary migrant laborfrom the countryside\u2014both of which could relocate quickly to more promisingeconomic areas. Terry McGee is optimistic that the priority policy objectives ofmega-urban regions\u2014commitment to better governance (that is, decentralizedmanagement and community participation in planning), promoting environmen-tal sustainability, developing rapid transport systems that do not bypass interme-diate villages\u2014can be achieved. McGee warns, however, that the volatile natureof globalization can increase the vulnerability of the urban poor, as in Indonesia,with \"grave consequences to the social stability of these mega-urban regions.\" Cit-ies face growing international competition, and Michael Lindfield and RobertStimson argue that their success in the twenty-first century will require them toassume a form of \"dispersed economic nodes linked by massive networks of air-ports, highways and communications, no longer dependent on central cities, but814 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentson global networks of cities.\" Peter Newton and Peter Manins conclude that \"com- pact cities,\" whose populations reside densely in an inner ring of suburbs, are themost fuel-efficient of all urban forms, and must replace the \"business as usual\"form of urban development that has generated sprawling suburbs with unaccept-able levels of energy consumption and pollution. Case studies of several urbanareas\u2014including Jabotabek in Indonesia, the US National Capital Region, Tokyo,Adelaide, and Stockholm\u2014further illustrate shortcomings of urban planning andsuggest potential solutions to planning problems that can be applied to cities ofboth Asia and the West. On the whole, this book should prove informative to specialists in population studies who seek greater understanding of emerging policy and planning issues invery large cities.\u2014M.B.

Among the array of potential constraints on population size and wellbeing, natu- ral resources, by and large, have steadily lost favor. But there are a few excep-tions: some resources have retained or even increased their claim to significance.Water\u2014more strictly, availability of fresh water\u2014is chief among them. Its rela-tionship to population change, however, is intricate. Direct human water consump-tion competes with agricultural and industrial demands, and these together com-pete with the maintenance requirements of the broader ecosystem. Supplyfluctuations for human use can be smoothed by dams and other managementschemes, but often at a high ecological cost. Technological options such as wastewater treatment or drip irrigation may offer large increases in supply or econo-mies in consumption, impeding any simple calculation of water-based human car-rying capacity. And supply constraints may be masked, as in many situations ofunsustainable use of aquifers. Arrayed over these complexities are human socialand political systems, managing water allocation with more or less considerationof needs. This volume, the report of a 1996 workshop organized by the WorldConservation Union (IUCN) in Montreal, examines these issues through a seriesof case studies: of aquatic ecosystems in Guatemala, Jordan, and Zambia; of cross-national river basin management of the Ganges, Senegal, Niger, and Zambia riv-ers; and of local community participation in water management in Karnataka (In-dia), Sindh (Pakistan), and Morocco. A more general case study by Basia Zaba andNdalahwa Madulu, of water resources in Mwanza (Tanzania), is presented in anoverview section. These authors caution that \"Gloomy prognoses which show that'ideal' consumption standards will not be met if population continues to grow at acertain rate often fail to note that these standards have never been universallyattained in the past, are not realized now for a large majority of people, and possi-bly are not even aspired to.\" The full text of the volume is available online throughwww.aaas.org/international.

In this beautifully crafted study of procreative communication and context in Cameroon, anthropologist Pamela Feldman-Savelsberg argues for the demographicimportance of attending to the ways women talk about reproductive fate and for-tune. In this high-fertility society, she found, the women of Bangangt\u00e9 are preoc-cupied with threats to their reproductive health. They tell stories of stopped-upfallopian tubes, wombs robbed of babies, and royal nurseries short of children.Like their counterparts in other central and east African societies, the Cameroonianwomen she studied use metaphors of kitchen and cooking to depict childbearing:the womb is represented as cooking pot, the ova and sperm as ingredients, givingbirth as serving a meal. Far from being mere curiosity or idiom, the author argues,the ways women talk about such matters have practical consequences, shapingtheir decisions about everything from marriage to sex, childbearing, and repro-ductive health care. More ambitiously, the author connects the talk to largerchanges taking place in Cameroon. She suggests that the narratives of infertilityalso reflect women's struggles to find a way to comment on the effects of large-scale political and economic change on their bodies, health, and lives. In her sen-sitive reading, the idiom of reproductive suffering is a barometer of a many-lay-ered anxiety: over personal reproductive fate, the future of the kingdom, and thesecurity of cultural identity in a time of unsettlingly rapid social change. A signalcontribution of this book is its successful juxtaposition of two specialized anthro-pological literatures that few have managed to join. Wedding the medicalanthropologist's concern for the effect of childlessness on individual lives with thedemographic anthropologist's interest in the role of culture in high-fertility societ-ies, Feldman-Savelsberg makes reproductive talk central to both by showing howit provides the crucial link between social structure and demographic outcome.Based on extensive ethnographic and documentary research conducted through-out the 1980s, this book offers an engaging and informative narrative that shouldinspire more research on reproductive idiom in other parts of Africa and beyond.Notes, glossary, references, index.\u2014S.G.

Public goods are goods that are available to one user without lessening their avail- ability to another and that cannot be reserved to any particular group or categoryof users. Typical examples are flood control, traffic rules, or national defense\u2014goods that markets on their own would not provide enough of (or, in the case ofpublic \"bads\" like pollution, would provide too much of). By implication, the popu-lation to which the benefits accrue is that of a given country or locality. Globalpublic goods, by extension, are those whose publicness applies worldwide. Ex-amples proposed and examined by the contributors to this book include distribu-tive justice, international financial stability, cultural heritage, atmospheric carbondioxide, infectious disease surveillance, \"global health,\" knowledge, the Internet,global communications, and peace.

Chen and colleagues argue that globalization isblurring the line between public and private health, even in the case of noncom-municable diseases. They instance tobacco-related diseases, exacerbated by $6 bil-lion spent annually in global marketing campaigns, and illicit-drug-related deaths,a global \"bad\" byproduct of international trade in narcotics. Health research, likeknowledge in general, has a major global-public-good dimension, although someof its tangible results are inaffordable to the poor. By its conspicuous absence fromthe volume's discussions, curtailment of world population growth would not ap-pear to be regarded as a significant global public good. Large-scale internationalmigration, however, is so regarded. Ethan B. Kapstein, in his chapter on interna-tional distributive justice, writes: \"The role of labour mobility and migration in theglobal economy is an issue of the first order, and it must be addressed in the inter-ests of assuring working people the greatest possible opportunity set.\" In their con-clusion, the editors, who are with the United Nations Development Programme,propose creation of a UN Global Trusteeship Council to act as a custodian of sus-BOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )817 Click to return to Table of Contentstainable development, with a mandate \"to advise the Secretary-General when a prisoner's dilemma threatens to undermine collective action in the long-term in-terest of all.\" Index.\u2014G.McN. PATRICIA W. L UNNEBORG The Chosen Lives of Childfree Men Westport, CT: Bergin & Garvey, 1999. x + 143 p. $35.00. As both a demographic and a cultural phenomenon, voluntary childlessness holdsconsiderable interest. In recent years much has been written about women\u2014inthe United States, now one in five\u2014who opt to have no children. With the grow-ing concern about men's role in reproduction and parenting, the neglected issueof male childlessness is beginning to attract attention. Statistics on men who fa-ther no children remain woefully inadequate. A pioneering U.S. Census Bureausurvey of male fertility revealed that in 1992 some 34 percent of men (and 26percent of women) 18 years of age and older did not have children. But to whatextent that state was voluntary or involuntary we do not know. Nor do we knowwhy some men decided to have no children. In this slim volume, psychologistPatricia Lunneborg reports the results of her conversations with 30 \"childfree\" men,half American, half British. (The term \"childfree\" should be understood as a po-litical statement signaling the author's hope to remove the stigma placed on womenwho opt to have no children. The conventional term, \"childless,\" stigmatizes bysuggesting a lack.) The men were mostly white, well educated, and partnered.They ranged in age from 27 to 55. With a nonrandomly selected sample of suchsmall size, the study must be considered exploratory rather than statistically infor-mative. Yet the results hold substantial interest, for they tell us not only aboutmen's experiences of childlessness, but also about the great gap between the ex-periences of \"childfree\" men and women. Because women bear children and society assigns childcaring primarily to women and stigmatizes those who do not follow societal conventions, a woman'sdecision not to have a child is fraught with significance. That decision, moreover,requires her to forge an alternative feminine identity and to continuously recon-struct and defend that identity throughout life. By contrast, for at least this groupof men, not having children was \"no big deal.\" For most of the men studied,whether to have children was, for most of their lives, not even an issue seriouslypondered. Whereas women feel pronatalist pressure from family, society, and themedia, men who opted to be childfree felt neither pressured to have children nordiscriminated against for not having any. To the contrary, their male friends andcolleagues were either supportive of their decision or unconcerned about it. Despite their preference not to sire a child, only one-third of the men studied had undergone a vasectomy. The diffidence about sterilization was rooted in avariety of factors: a certain squeamishness about the procedure, reluctance to talkabout a taboo subject, the view that contraception was women's responsibility, adesire to leave future options open, and a feeling of threat to their virility. Manyfactors underlay the men's decision to forgo parenthood. Most saw childrearing as818 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentsa responsibility that they did not want to assume. The typical respondent enjoyed his work and was an \"aficionado of adult activities.\" He was a \"lifelong learner\"who wanted time for further education and travel (p. 130). He did not want to betied down by dependents. Over half the men said that they did not like children.Roughly one-half were influenced by their own fathers. All the men whose fa-thers had been abusive vowed early on to have no children themselves. Abouthalf of those whose fathers had been uninterested parents decided against parentingon that account. Twenty percent gave global overpopulation as the principal rea-son for not having children, all of them Americans. Clearly, this book represents just one of the first words on this fascinating sub- ject. Much more research is needed to ascertain the demographic dimensions ofmale infertility, by race, class, age, and other social attributes, as well as the largerhistorical, cultural, political, and economic contexts in which male childlessnessbecomes a demographically and culturally significant phenomenon. Lunneborg'sbook is essentially a research report that lacks in-depth analysis of any of theseissues. While one may not want to lend a copy of the book to one's neighbor, asthe author proposes in her conclusion, for the social scientist the study providesan eye-opening look at an underexamined subject and suggests a wealth of hy-potheses to guide future research.

The prospect of a rise in world temperature as the result of human actions has ledto a contentious debate about the likely extent of global warming, the seriousnessof potential adverse consequences of this warming, and the feasibility and desir-ability of taking corrective action. Environmentalists are concerned about the pro-jected negative effects of warming, such as a rise in the sea level, an increase inviolent storms, the disruption of ecosystems, and damage to agriculture. They there-fore call for urgent and vigorous action to halt and, if possible, reverse the rise inemissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. The international protocolnegotiated in Kyoto in 1997 represents an important step toward curbing theseemissions. A contrary view is held by a small but vocal group of critics who claimthat the evidence for global warming is weak, that any global warming is likely tohave only a modest net impact, and that proposed remedies are undesirable, tooexpensive, and not cost-effective. This volume summarizes the perspective of suchcritics. Successive chapters cover the historical association between human well-being and climate variation; the health, environmental, and economic effects ofglobal warming; and the costs of curbing greenhouse gas emissions. The author'smain conclusion is that, for most of the world, warming over the next centurywould either cost very little or provide an actual benefit. Most informed readersare likely to be unpersuaded by this analysis. A key shortcoming is that much ofthe discussion focuses on the United States and other industrialized countries lo-cated in temperate climates. Little is said about the tropics and subtropics, whereBOOK REVIEWS PDR 25(4 )819 Click to return to Table of Contentsmuch of the world's population lives and where even small disruptions of agricul- ture can have large adverse effects. It is also surprising that the author mentionsbut does not elaborate on the views of fellow economists\u2014most notably WilliamNordhaus and William Cline\u2014whose work strongly supports action to slow emis-sions. Although the arguments presented in this volume are one-sided, they maybe useful for readers who wish to become more familiar with the wide spectrumof views in the debate about efforts to slow global warming.\u2014J.B.

The United Nations first published a set of world population estimates and projec- tions in 1951 and since 1978 has been issuing revised versions biennially. Theseries is the standard, indispensable source of comprehensive world, regional, andnational demographic data in a comparative format. It is distinguished from theDemographic Yearbook of the UN Statistics Division not only in timeliness and user- friendliness but also by its distancing from national statistical offices and its impo-sition of internal consistency and judgments of reasonableness on the data pre-sented. The time series begin in 1950; in the 1998 Revision the estimates extendto 1995, the projections to 2050. The projections by five-year age groups, in Vol-ume II, now include ages between 80 and 100. Detailed data are given for 184\"countries and areas\" with 1995 populations exceeding 150,000, a terminologythat allows for inclusion of (for example) East Timor, Gaza Strip, and Guadeloupe.(UN rules nevertheless intrude: Hong Kong and Macao appear separately, Taiwanis folded into China; and alphabetized under T, between Thailand and Togo, is Theformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.) A more limited array of data is given foreach of 228 countries and areas of the world, down to Pitcairn (population 46). A brief introduction giving highlights of the data replaces the detailed descrip- tion of results, methods, and sources that prefaced the 1996 Revision. However,this material is forthcoming in a promised third volume. Overall changes in esti-mates and expectations in the last two years are in the direction of more moderatepopulation increases. Average annual world population growth in 1995-2000 isput at 78 million instead of 81 million; the medium-variant 2050 population is 8.9billion instead of 9.4 billion. The total fertility rate of the more-developed regions,currently around 1.6, recovers only to 1.8 by 2050 in the medium variant, insteadof to replacement level. Mortality assumptions are little altered. (The demographiceffects of the AIDS epidemic were already considered in the 1996 Revision.) The material is also available in somewhat elaborated form on diskettes. The content of the two volumes, expanded to annual rather than the mainly quin-quennial intervals of the hard copy, is on one diskette, priced at $500; age pat-terns of fertility (age-specific fertility rates and births by age of mother)\u2014data notincluded in the volumes\u2014are on another at $100.\u2014G.McN.820 PDR 25(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsUS A GENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND US D EPARTMENT OF COMMERCE World Population Profile: 1998, with a Special Chapter Focusing on HIV/AIDS in the Developing World Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1999. 165 p. $21.00. This volume summarizes the main findings from the most recent global popula- tion projection exercise undertaken by the U.S. Census Bureau. Introductory chap-ters provide concise overviews of population trends and related issues, while thebulk of the report consists of tabulations of projection results for population sizeand other demographic variables at the country, regional, and world level. Princi-pal results for projections to 2025 are included, and further details including pro-jections to 2050 are available on the web site of the Census Bureau. A specialsection on HIV/AIDS discusses estimates and projections of the epidemic's demo-graphic impact to 2010 in 28 developing countries. The projection exercise of the Census Bureau is similar in nature and scope to those undertaken by the United Nations and the World Bank. While modest dif-ferences in assumptions lead to some differences in projections, the results fromthe different agencies are in broad agreement. For example, the population size ofthe world is expected to be 9.3 billion in 2050 according to the U.S. Census Bu-reau, while the UN and World Bank each expect a slightly lower number: 8.9billion. This difference exists despite the somewhat higher AIDS impact projectedby the Census Bureau. Four appendixes include detailed tables, a description of projection methodol- ogy, references, and a glossary.\u2014J.B.

(TheCDC is an agency of the US Department of Health and Human Services.) This document,titled \"Achievements in public health, 1900-1999: Healthier mothers and babies,\" appearedin the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (a publication of the CDC), 48 (38), 1 October 1999. It is reproduced below in full. (For two earlier issues in this series, one dis-cussing the effect of vaccines on children's health, and another reviewing the evolution ofinfectious diseases, see the Documents sections of the June and September 1999 issues of PDR.) The main findings and the contents of the report are succinctly described in the report's openingparagraph. At the beginning of the 20th century, for ev- ery 1000 live births, six to nine women in the United States died of pregnancy-related complications, and approximately 100 infants died before age 1 year ( 1,2). From 1915 through 1997, the infant mortality rate declined greater than 90% to 7.2 per 1000 live births, and from 1900 through 1997, the maternal mor- tality rate declined almost 99% to less than 0.1 reported death per 1000 live births (7.7 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1997) ( 3) (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Environmental inter- ventions, improvements in nutrition, advances in clinical medicine, improvements in access to health care, improvements in sur veillance and monitoring of disease, increases in education levels, and improvements in standards of liv- ing contributed to this remarkable decline ( 1). Despite these improvements in maternal and infant mortality rates, significant disparitiesby race and ethnicity persist. This report sum- marizes trends in reducing infant and mater- nal mortality in the United States, factors contributing to these trends, challenges in reducing infant and maternal mortality, and provides suggestions for public health action for the 21st century. Infant mortality The decline in infant mortality is unparalleledby other mortality reduction this century. If turn-of-the-century infant death rates had continued, then an estimated 500,000 live- born infants during 1997 would have died be- fore age 1 year; instead, 28,045 infants died ( 3). In 1900 in some U.S. cities, up to 30% of infants died before reaching their first birth- day ( 1). Efforts to reduce infant mortality fo- Click to print article 822 DOCUMENTS Click to return to Table of Contentscused on improving environmental and liv- ing conditions in urban areas ( 1). Urban en- vironmental interventions (e.g., sewage and refuse disposal and safe drinking water) played key roles in reducing infant mortal- ity. Rising standards of living, including im- provements in economic and education lev- els of families, helped to promote health. Declining fertility rates also contributed to reductions in infant mortality through longer spacing of children, smaller family size, and better nutritional status of mothers and in- fants ( 1). Milk pasteurization, first adopted in Chicago in 1908, contributed to the control of milkborne diseases (e.g., gastrointestinal infec- tions) from contaminated milk supplies. During the first three decades of the cen- tury, public health, social welfare, and clini- cal medicine (pediatrics and obstetrics) col- laborated to combat infant mortality ( 1). This partnership began with milk hygiene but later included other public health issues. In1912, the Children's Bureau was formed and became the primary government agency to work toward improving maternal and infant welfare until 1946, when its role in mater- nal and child health diminished; the bureau was eliminated in 1969 ( 1). A proponent of the Children's Bureau was Martha May Eliot. The Children's Bureau defined the problem of infant mortality and shaped the debate over programs to ameliorate the problem. The bureau also advocated comprehensive maternal and infant welfare services, includ- ing prenatal, natal, and postpartum home vis- its by health-care providers. By the 1920s, the integration of these services changed the approach to infant mortality from one that addressed infant health problems to an ap- proach that included infant and mother and prenatal-care programs to educate, monitor, and care for pregnant women. The discovery and widespread use of an- timicrobial agents (e.g., sulfonamide in 1937 and penicillin in the 1940s) and the devel- opment of fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy and safe blood transfusions acceler- ated the declines in infant mortality; from 1930 through 1949, mortality rates declined 52% ( 4). The percentage decline in postneo- natal (age 28-364 days) mortality (66%) was greater than the decline in neonatal (age 0-27 days) mortality (40%). From 1950 through 1964, infant mortality declined more slowly ( 1). An increasing proportion of infant deaths were attributed to perinatal causes and oc- curred among high-risk neonates, especially low birth weight (LBW) and preterm babies. Although no reliable data exist, the rapid de- cline in infant mortality during earlier dec- ades probably was not influenced by de- creases in LBW rates because the decrease in mortality was primarily in postneonatal deaths that are less influenced by birth- weight. Inadequate programs during the 1950s-1960s to reduce deaths among high- risk neonates led to renewed efforts to im- prove access to prenatal care, especially for the poor, and to a concentrated effort to es- tablish neonatal intensive-care units and to promote research in maternal and infant health, including research into technologies to improve the survival of LBW and preterm babies. During the late 1960s, after Medicaid and other federal programs were implemented, in-FIGURE 1 Infant mortality rate,* by year\u2014United States, 1915-1997 *Per 1000 live births.Rate Year120 100 80 6040 20 0 1915 1925 1935 1945 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995 FIGURE 2 Maternal mortality rate,* by year\u2014United States, 1900-1997 *Per 100,000 live births.

From 1970 to 1979, neonatal mortality plummeted 41% (Table 1) because of technologic advances in neonatal medicine and in the regionalization of perinatal services; postneonatal mortality declined 14%. During the early to mid-1980s, the downward trend in U.S. infant mortality slowed ( 6). However, during 1989-1991, in- fant mortality declined slightly faster, probably because of the use of artificial pulmonary sur- factant to prevent and treat respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants ( 7). During 1991-1997, infant mortality continued to de- cline primarily because of decreases in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and other causes. Although improvements in medical care were the main force for declines in infant mortality during the second half of the cen- tury, public health actions played a role. Dur- ing the 1990s, a greater than 50% decline in SIDS rates (attributed to the recommenda- tion that infants be placed to sleep on their backs) has helped to reduce the overall infant mortality rate ( 8). The reduction in vaccine-pre- ventable diseases (e.g., diphtheria, tetanus, measles, poliomyelitis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis) has reduced in- fant morbidity and has had a modest effect on infant mortality ( 9). Advances in prena- tal diagnosis of severe central nervous sys- tem defects, selective termination of affected pregnancies, and improved surgical treat-ment and management of other structural anomalies have helped reduce infant mortal- ity attributed to these birth defects ( 10,11 ). National efforts to encourage reproductive- aged women to consume foods or supple- ments containing folic acid could reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by half ( 12). Maternal mortality Maternal mortality rates were highest in this century during 1900-1930 ( 2). Poor obstet- ric education and delivery practices were mainly responsible for the high numbers of maternal deaths, most of which were pre- ventable ( 2). Obstetrics as a speciality was shunned by many physicians, and obstetric care was provided by poorly trained or un- trained medical practitioners. Most births oc- curred at home with the assistance of mid- wives or general practitioners. Inappropriate and excessive surgical and obstetric interven- tions (e.g., induction of labor, use of forceps, episiotomy, and cesarean deliveries) were common and increased during the 1920s. Deliveries, including some surgical interven- tions, were performed without following the principles of asepsis. As a result, 40% of ma- ternal deaths were caused by sepsis (half fol- lowing delivery and half associated with il- legally induced abortion) with the remaining deaths primarily attributed to hemorrhage and toxemia ( 2).TABLE 1 Percentage reduction in infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality, by year\u2014United States, 1915-1997* Percentage reduction in mortality Infant Neonatal Postneonatal Year (aged 0-364 days) calculated as the reduction from the first year of the time period to the last year of the time period.824 DOCUMENTS Click to return to Table of ContentsThe 1933 White House Conference on Child Health Protection, Fetal, Newborn, and Maternal Mortality and Morbidity report ( 13) demonstrated the link between poor aseptic practice, excessive operative deliveries, and high maternal mortality. This and earlier re- ports focused attention on the state of ma- ternal health and led to calls for action by state medical associations ( 13). During the 1930s-1940s, hospital and state maternal mortality review committees were estab- lished. During the ensuing years, institutional practice guidelines and guidelines defining physician qualifications needed for hospital delivery privileges were developed. At the same time, a shift from home to hospital de- liveries was occurring throughout the coun- try; during 1938-1948, the proportion of in- fants born in hospitals increased from 55% to 90% ( 14). However, this shift was slow in rural areas and southern states. Safer deliv- eries in hospitals under aseptic conditions and improved provision of maternal care for the poor by states or voluntary organizations led to decreases in maternal mortality after 1930. Medical advances (including the use of anti- biotics, oxytocin to induce labor, and safe blood transfusion and better management of hypertensive conditions during pregnancy) accelerated declines in maternal mortality. During 1939-1948, maternal mortality de- creased by 71% ( 14). The legalization of in- duced abortion beginning in the 1960s con- tributed to an 89% decline in deaths from septic illegal abortions ( 15) during 1950-1973. Since 1982, maternal mortality has not declined ( 16). However, more than half of maternal deaths can be prevented with ex- isting interventions ( 17). In 1997, 327 ma- ternal deaths were reported based on infor- mation on death certificates; however, death certificate data underestimate these deaths, and the actual numbers are two to three times greater. The leading causes of mater- nal death are hemorrhage, including hem- orrhage pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension (toxemia), and embolism ( 17). Challenges for the 21st century Despite the dramatic decline in infant and maternal mortality during the 20th century,challenges remain. Perhaps the greatest is the persistent difference in maternal and infant health among various racial/ethnic groups, particularly between black and white women and infants. Although overall rates have plummeted, black infants are more than twice as likely to die as white infants; this ratio has increased in recent decades. The higher risk for infant mortality among blacks compared with whites is attributed to higher LBW incidence and preterm births and to a higher risk for death among normal birth- weight infants (greater than or equal to 5 lbs, 8 oz [greater than or equal to 2500 g]) ( 18). American Indian/Alaska Native infants have higher death rates than white infants because of higher SIDS rates. Hispanics of Puerto Rican origin have higher death rates than white infants because of higher LBW rates ( 19). The gap in maternal mortality between black and white women has increased since the early 1900s. During the first decades of the 20th century, black women were twice as likely to die of pregnancy-related complications as white women. Today, black women are more than three times as likely to die as white women. During the last few decades, the key rea- son for the decline in neonatal mortality has been the improved rates of survival among LBW babies, not the reduction in the inci- dence of LBW. The long-term effects of LBW include neurologic disorders, learning dis- abilities, and delayed development ( 20). Dur- ing the 1990s, the increased use of assisted reproductive technology has led to an in- crease in multiple gestations and a concomi- tant increase in the preterm delivery and LBW rates ( 21). Therefore, in the coming dec- ades, public health programs will need to ad- dress the two leading causes of infant mor- tality: deaths related to LBW and preterm births and congenital anomalies. Additional substantial decline in neonatal mortality will require effective strategies to reduce LBW and preterm births. This will be especially important in reducing racial/ethnic dispari- ties in the health of infants. Approximately half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, including approximately three quarters among women aged less than 20 years. Unintended preg- nancy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality for the mother and infant. Lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, drinking al- cohol, unsafe sex practices, and poor nutri-DOCUMENTS 825 Click to return to Table of Contentstion) and inadequate intake of foods contain- ing folic acid pose serious health hazards to the mother and fetus and are more common among women with unintended pregnancies. In addition, one fifth of all pregnant women and approximately half of women with un- intended pregnancies do not start prenatal care during the first trimester. Effective strat- egies to reduce unintended pregnancy, to eliminate exposure to unhealthy lifestyle fac- tors, and to ensure that all women begin pre- natal care early are important challenges for the next century. Compared with the 1970s, the 1980s and 1990s have seen a lack of decline in mater- nal mortality and a slower rate of decline in infant mortality. Some experts consider that the United States may be approaching an ir- reducible minimum in these areas. However, three factors indicate that this is unlikely. First, scientists have believed that infant and maternal mortality was as low as possible at other times during the century, when the rates were much higher than they are now. Second, the United States has higher mater- nal and infant mortality rates than other de- veloped countries; it ranks 25th in infant mortality ( 22) and 21st in maternal mortal- ity ( 23). Third, most of the U.S. population has infant and maternal mortality rates sub- stantially lower than some racial/ethnic sub- groups, and no definable biologic reason has been found to indicate that a minimum has been reached. To develop effective strategies for the 21st century, studies of the underlying factors that contribute to morbidity and mortality should be conducted. These studies should include efforts to understand not only the biologic factors but also the social, economic, psycho- logical, and environmental factors that contrib- ute to maternal and infant deaths. Research- ers are examining \"fetal programming\"\u2014the effect of uterine environment (e.g., mater- nal stress, nutrition, and infection) on fetal development and its effect on health from childhood to adulthood. Because reproduc- tive tract infections (e.g., bacterial vaginosis) are associated with preterm birth, develop- ment of effective screening and treatment strategies may reduce preterm births. Case re- views or audits are being used increasingly to investigate fetal, infant, and maternal deaths; they focus on identifying preventable deaths such as those resulting from health-care system failures and gaps in quality of care and in access to care. Another strategy is to study cases of severe morbidity in which the woman or infant did not die. More clini- cally focused than reviews or audits, such \"near miss\" studies may explain why one woman or infant with a serious problem died while another survived. A thorough review of the quality of health care and access to care for all women and in- fants is needed to avoid preventable mortal- ity and morbidity and to develop public health programs that can eliminate racial/ ethnic disparities in health. Preconception health services for all women of childbear- ing age, including healthy women who in- tend to become pregnant, and quality care during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpar- tum period are critical elements needed to improve maternal and infant outcomes (see Appendix).

Appendix Opportunities to reduce maternal and infant mortality Prevention measures to reduce maternal and infant mortality and to promote the health of all child- bearing-aged women and their newborns should start before conception and continue through thepostpartum period. Some of these prevention mea-sures include the following: Before conception \u00b7 Screen women for health risks and pre-ex- isting chronic conditions such as diabetes, hyper-tension, and sexually transmitted diseases. \u00b7 Counsel women about contraception and provide access to effective family planning serv-ices (to prevent unintended pregnancies and un- necessary abortions). \u00b7 Counsel women about the benefits of good nutrition; encourage women especially to consumeadequate amounts of folic acid supplements (toprevent neural tube defects) and iron. \u00b7 Advise women to avoid alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. \u00b7 Advise women about the value of regular physical exercise.826 DOCUMENTS Click to return to Table of ContentsDuring pregnancy \u00b7 Provide women with early access to high- quality care throughout pregnancy, labor, and de- livery. Such care includes risk-appropriate care, treatment for complications, and the use of ante-natal corticosteroids when appropriate. \u00b7 Monitor and, when appropriate, treat pre- existing chronic conditions. \u00b7 Screen for and, when appropriate, treat re- productive tract infections including bacterial vaginosis, group B streptococcus infections, andhuman immunodeficiency virus. \u00b7 Vaccinate women against influenza, if appro- priate. \u00b7 Continue counseling against use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. \u00b7 Continue counseling about nutrition and physical exercise. \u00b7 Educate women about the early signs of preg- nancy-related problems. During postpartum period \u00b7 Vaccinate newborns at age-appropriate times. \u00b7 Provide information about well-baby care and benefits of breastfeeding. \u00b7 Warn parents about exposing infants to sec- ondhand smoke. \u00b7 Counsel parents about placing infants to sleep on their backs. \u00b7 Educate parents about how to protect their infants from exposure to infectious diseases andharmful substances.

According to new estimates from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO), 32.4 mil- lion adults and 1.2 million children will be living with HIV by the end of 1999.1 Over the course of the year, some 5.6 million people became infected with the hu- man immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. The year also saw 2.6 million deaths from HIV/AIDS\u2014a higher global total than in any year since the beginning of the epi- demic, despite antiretroviral therapy which staved off AIDS and AIDS deaths in the richer countries. Deaths among those already in- fected would continue mounting for some years even if prevention programmes man- aged to cut the number of new infections toThe HIV/AIDS Epidemic at the Endof 1999 The status of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic is summarized in a report entitled AIDS Epi- demic Update: December 1999 , issued by the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization. The generally bleak but regionally diversepicture is conveyed in the series of bulleted statements at the beginning of the report and intwo summary tables, reproduced below. The rest of the report discusses the regional situa-tions in more detail. An earlier UNAIDS and WHO surveillance report (June 1998) wasexcerpted in the Documents section of PDR 24 (3). zero. However, with the HIV-positive popu- lation still expanding\u2014there were 5.6 mil- lion new infections this year alone\u2014the an- nual number of AIDS deaths can be expected to increase for many years before peaking. Around half of all people who acquire HIV become infected before they turn 25 and typically die of the life-threatening illnesses called \"AIDS\" before their 35th birthday. This age factor makes AIDS uniquely threatening to children. By the end of 1999, the epidemic had left behind a cumulative total of 11.2 million AIDS orphans, defined as those hav- ing lost their mother before reaching the age of 15. Many of these maternal orphans have also lost their father. The overwhelming majority of people with HIV\u2014some 95% of the global total\u2014 live in the developing world. That proportion is set to grow even further as infection rates continue to rise in countries where poverty, poor health systems and limited resources for prevention and care fuel the spread of the virus. HIV is still a challenge in industrialized countries. There is evidence that safe sexual behaviour is being eroded among gay men in some Western countries, perhaps because of complacency now that life-prolonging therapy is available. If this is the case, the complacency is misplaced. The disease re- mains fatal, and information from North1This appears to be a relatively small rise over the global HIV totals at the end of 1998. The real rise is larger, however. Improved surveillance now sug- gests that national infections in a few populous coun-tries of Latin America and Asia were over-estimatedin 1998. Click to print article 828 DOCUMENTS Click to return to Table of ContentsAmerica and Europe suggests that the decline in number of deaths due to antiretroviral therapy is tapering off. HIV infections in the former Soviet Union have doubled in just two years. Inject- ing drug use gave the Eastern European and Central Asian region the world's steepest HIV curve in 1999. Drug-injecting is also a major concern in the industrialized countries, as it is in the Middle East, where total AIDS cases are still relatively low but drug-injecting ac- counted for two-thirds of cases in Bahrain, half in the Islamic Republic of Iran and over a third in Tunisia. Some Latin American countries are managing to expand efforts to provide treat- ment to those infected. However, there is evi- dence that infections are on the rise in Cen- tral America and in the Caribbean basin\u2014 which has some of the worst HIV epidemics outside Africa.Strong prevention programmes seem to have reduced HIV risk and lowered or stabi- lized HIV rates in some countries of Asia, such as Thailand and the Philippines. Other Asian countries have raised warning flags after col- lecting new information showing that inject- ing drug use is spreading and that condom use is uncommon, including among clients of prostitutes and men who have sex with men. In many places prevention efforts are hampered by the shame and stigma attached to AIDS. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to bear the brunt of HIV and AIDS, with close to 70% of the global total of HIV-positive people. Most will die in the next 10 years, joining the 13.7 million Africans already claimed by the epi- demic and leaving behind shattered families and crippled prospects for development. Because of AIDS, companies doing busi- ness in Africa are hurting and are bracing [TABLE 1] Regional HIV/AIDS statistics and features, December 1999 Adults and Adults and children Percent of Main mode(s) ofchildren newly Adult HIV-positive transmission 3 Epidemic living with infected prevalence adults who for adults living Region started HIV/AIDS with HIV rate2are women with HIV/AIDS Sub-Saharan Africa late '70s- 23.3 million 3.8 million 8.0% 55% Hetero early '80s North Africa and Middle East late '80s 220 000 19 000 0.13% 20% IDU, Hetero South and South-East Asia late '80s 6 million 1.3 million 0.69% 30% Hetero East Asia and Pacific late '80s 530 000 120 000 0.068% 15% IDU, Hetero, MSM Latin America late 150 000 0.57% 20% MSM, IDU, Hetero early '80s Caribbean 000 57 000 1.96% 35% Hetero, MSM early '80s Eastern Europe and Central Asia early '90s 360 000 95 000 0.14% 20% IDU, MSM Western Europe late '70s- 520 000 30 000 0.25% 20% MSM, IDU early '80s North America late '70s- 920 000 44 000 0.56% 20% MSM, IDU, Hetero early '80s Australia and late '70s- New Zealand early '80s 12 000 500 0.1% 10% MSM, IDU Total 33.6 million 5.6 million 1.1% 46% 2The proportion of adults (15 to 49 years of age) living with HIV/AIDS in 1999, using 1998 population numbers. 3MSM (sexual transmission among men who have sex with men), IDU (transmission through injecting drug use), Hetero (heterosexual transmission).DOCUMENTS 829 Click to return to Table of Contents[TABLE 2] Global summary of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, December 1999 People newly infected with HIV in 1999 Total 5.6 millionAdults 5 million Women 2.3 million Children <15 years 570 000 Number of people living with HIV/AIDS Total 33.6 million Adults 32.4 million Women 14.8 million Children <15 years 1.2 million AIDS deaths in 1999 Total 2.6 millionAdults 2.1 million Women 1.1 million Children <15 years 470 000 Total number of AIDS deaths since the beginning of the epidemic Total 16.3 millionAdults 12.7 million Women 6.2 million Children <15 years 3.6 millionthemselves for far worse as their workers sicken and die. According to a survey of com- mercial farms in Kenya, illness and death have already replaced old-age retirement as the leading reason why employees leave service. Retirement accounted for just 2% of employee drop-out by 1997. Life expectancy at birth in southern Af- rica, which rose from 44 years in the early 1950s to 59 in the early 1990s, is set to drop to just 45 between 2005 and 2010 because of AIDS. In contrast, South Asians, who could barely reach their 40th birthday in 1950, can expect by 2005 to be living 22 years longer than their counterparts in AIDS-ravaged southern Africa. New information suggests that between 12 and 13 African women are currently in- fected for every 10 African men. There are a number of reasons why female prevalence is higher than male in this region, including the greater efficiency of male-to-female HIV transmission through sex and the younger age at initial infection for women. In 1999, an estimated 570 000 children aged 14 or younger became infected with HIV. Over 90% were babies born to HIV-posi- tive women, who acquired the virus at birth or through their mother's breastmilk. Of these, almost nine-tenths were in sub-Sa- haran Africa. Africa's lead in mother-to-child transmission of HIV was firmer than ever de- spite new evidence that HIV ultimately im- pairs women's fertility: once infected, a woman can be expected to bear 20% fewer children than she otherwise would. In short, the huge gap in HIV infection rates and AIDS deaths between rich and poor countries, and more particularly between Africa and the rest of the world, is likely to grow even larger in the next century. Likely, but not certain. Massive national and inter- national efforts may yet help to end the sti- fling silence that continues to surround HIV in many countries, to explode myths and misconceptions that translate into dangerous sexual practices, to expand prevention ini-tiatives such as condom promotion that can reduce sexual transmission, to create condi- tions in which young children have the knowledge and the emotional and financial support to grow up free of HIV, and to de- vote real money to providing care for those infected with HIV and support to their fami- lies. A trail of successful responses has already been blazed by a small number of dedicated communities and governments. The chal- lenge for the leaders of Africa and their part- ners in development is to adapt and mas- sively expand successful approaches that make it harder for the virus to spread, and that make it easier for those affected to live full and rewarding lives.

At the start of the nineteenth century roughly 80 percent of India's popu- lation had no effective protection against thedisease, and in these circumstances virtually everyone suffered from it in childhood. The main exception was Bengal, where the in-digenous practice of inoculation greatly lim- ited the prevalence of the disease. Smallpox case fatality in India was high\u2014around 25-30 percent in unprotected populations\u2014and significantly higher than estimated for un- protected populations in eighteenth-centuryEurope. Although vaccination reached India in 1802, the practice spread slowly during the first half of the nineteenth century. Fromthe 1870s onward there were considerable improvements in vaccination coverage. The study demonstrates a close link between thespread of vaccination and the decline of smallpox. Whereas at the start of the nine- teenth century the disease may have ac-counted for more than 10 percent of all deaths in India, by the end of the century smallpox had become a comparatively mi-nor cause of death as a result of improved vaccination coverage. The Global and Regional Impact of Mortality and Fertility Transitions, 1950-2000 PATRICK HEUVELINE During the second half of the twentieth cen- tury, world population grew at a record pace,both in absolute and relative terms, from 2.5 billion to 6 billion (or 1.75 percent annually).Demographers have long identified rapid mortality declines as the main explanation.This article finds that one-fourth of today's world population is alive because of mortal- ity improvements since mid-century. Veryrapid growth is unlikely to continue as sub- stantial fertility declines also occurred in re- cent decades. This article finds that alreadyby the year 2000, these fertility declines have almost exactly compensated for the impact of mortality declines from mid-century lev-els. This result may suggest homeostasis, but analyses of underlying trends contradict this impression. First, the impact of fertility de-clines will soon and significantly exceed that of mortality declines. Second, that mortality and fertility declines jointly affect the size ofthe world population by less than one per- cent conceals a significant impact on the population's age composition as well as onregional population sizes. The Persistence of Outmoded Contraceptive Regimes: The Casesof Mexico and Brazil JOSEPH E. P OTTER Two of the most striking characteristics of contraceptive practice in the world today are the wide variation in patterns of use across countries and the tendency of the distribu-tion of use by method to persist or narrow, even as new methods become available. The argument advanced in this article is that thedisposition to commit to a reduced range of methods results from positive feedback in the process of contraceptive choice, and followsthe logic of path dependence. The positive feedback derives, in large part, from social interaction among both the providers andthe users of contraceptive methods. The per- sistence of outmoded contraceptive regimes is illustrated with the experience of Mexicoand Brazil. In each case, it is argued that the conditions, events, and policies in the early832 ABSTRACTS Click to return to Table of Contentsstage of the adoption process have had a de- terminant bearing on the contraceptive prac- tice prevailing in the late 1990s. Longer Life and Population Growth JOSHUA R. G OLDSTEIN WILHELM SCHLAG Enthusiasm about the prospect of large in- creases in human life expectancy is often dampened by fears that lower mortality willincrease population size, hence population pressure. A simple mathematical model of life-cycle stretching demonstrates that if in-creased longevity is accompanied by later childbearing, a trend that is already under- way, future declines in mortality will not in-crease population size. The Long-Term Effect of the Timing of FertilityDecline on Population Size BRIAN C. O'N EILL SERGEI SCHERBOV WOLFGANG LUTZ Existing long-range population projections imply that the timing of the fertility transi-tion has a relatively unimportant effect on long-term population size when compared with the impact of the level at which fertil-ity is assumed eventually to stabilize. How- ever, this note shows that the effect of the timing of fertility decline is a function of theeventual fertility rate: the lower the even- tual fertility rate, the greater the effect of thetiming of the transition becomes. This find- ing has important implications for projection methodology, as well as for policies relatedto the consequences of long-term levels of population size. Urban Growth in Developing Countries: A Review of Projectionsand Predictions MARTIN BROCKERHOFF Comparison of the United Nations' earliest and most recent projections to the year 2000 suggests that urban and city growth in de-veloping regions has occurred much more slowly than was anticipated as recently as 1980. A modified \"urban population explo-sion\" in developing countries since the 1970s conforms to explanatory models of urban growth developed by economists around1980. Trends in productivity and terms of trade, in particular, have been highly favor- able to agriculture as compared to manufac-turing, presumably slowing migration to ur- ban centers. Increases in national population growth rates have produced less than com-mensurate increases in rates of city growth, further supporting an economic and migra- tion-related explanation for unexpectedlyslow recent urban growth. Despite the efforts of the United Nations to maintain reliable statistics on urban and city populations, ur-ban population projections should be inter- preted with caution because of inadequacies of the data on which they are based. More-over, current projections that virtually all world population growth in the future will oc- cur in urban areas of developing countries maybe misconstrued, if the forces that have re- tarded urban growth in recent years persist.ABSTRACTS / F RENCH 833 Click to return to de est la principale cause.
