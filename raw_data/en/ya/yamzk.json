Along with good chiropractic technique, quality care, and communication, homeopathy has provided safe, sound, fast, effective, nontoxic, nonsuppressive, and actual corrective solutions for acute pain. Safe Homeopathy has a proven safety record as the only healthcare solution with no known side effects. In over 240 years of use on a global scale, homeopathy has not had any negative side effects documented. With no known negative drug interactions, a homeopathic remedy can be given along with any other medications safely without apprehension or worry. No known contraindications. That makes homeopathy the only time-tested remedy to complement chiropractic and its fine reputation as a leader in natural health care. Why is homeopathy so safe? Homeopathy uses serial dilutions of substances with intense shaking called succussions, creating an energy imprint called potentization that the nervous system can recognize and utilize to awaken the innate healing response. The perfect chiropractic complement. In my 40 plus years of integrating chiropractic and homeopathy, we have seen recurring subluxation complexes stop recurring, and aberrant reflex anomalies stop and stabilize the majority of subluxations. These observations over time prove that homeopathy corrects nerve interferences throughout the body where the hands and machines of the chiropractor have not reached. This is why I call homeopathy \"chiropractic in a bottle.\" Homeopathy is much different from allopathic drugs, nutrition, and herbs in its actions upon the body. Nutrition, herbs, and allopathic drugs depend on more of a short-term biochemical manipulation to force change upon bodily functions. Homeopathy works bioenergetically to awaken the bioenergetic functions of our control networks, including our nervous system and acupuncture system, to establish or reset homeostasis within our body. I often describe therapeutic actions of homeopathy as it energetically corrects, resets, or awakens our inner healing abilities or \"fills in the holes in our wholeness.\" Like chiropractic, homeopathy works as an energy medicine at a higher level to correct problems more at the source or cause of the problem. We have discovered that when we first work to correct health problems in the energetic control networks with energetic techniques like chiropractic, acupuncture, and homeopathy, that patients responded better, faster, and more permanently. Our energetic control networks are constantly functioning to keep us in balance and healthy homeostasis. As we were taught in chiropractic, the body is a self-healing organism designed to heal and maintain homeostasis when the energetic control networks are functioning correctly. When we correct at the deeper level in the hierarchy of bodily functions, we better fix problems at the source. In fact, when our energetic control networks are functioning properly, then everything we do to improve health wifi work better. Our efforts to eat healthily will bring greater results. Our application of therapeutic techniques wifi work better. Our efforts to exercise wifi work better. Our efforts to manage stress and think more positively wifi even work better. Fastest Acting Homeopathy provides the fastest delivery system known on the planet. Why? Because homeopathy works bioenergetically. This means that homeopathy doesn't have to go through the usual biochemical metabolic pathways of digestion, assimilation, transportation, and cellular absorption. Homeopathy will commonly provide results within a few seconds to a few minutes in many cases. The key to finding the correct remedies. We freely share quick reflex tests to confirm finding the correct homeopathic remedies. When taken orally, homeopathy is absorbed through the sublingual nerve pathways in the mount and then travels through the nervous system and other energetic pathways, such as the acupuncture system. With the average nerve speed of 200 MPH, the healing responses of homeopathy are delivered to all 100 trillion cells of the body in approximately five seconds. That's extremely fast compared to the biochemical pathways that take 15 to 20 minutes to be delivered a chemical response to the cells of our body. When applied topically, homeopathy is absorbed through the nerve endings located in the layers of the skin. It is said that we have so many nerve endings in our skin that a person's physical features could still be recognized and differentiated from others if all the tissues were removed except for the nerves. Even topically, homeopathy performs at bioenergetic nerve speed as compared to the much slower biochemical metabolic speed of transdermal absorption. Homeopathic olfactory dosing was originally done by Dr. Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, during the last decade of his life's work as recorded in the sixth edition of the Organon, the authoritative text in homeopathy. Olfactory delivery is simply performed by a spray or two in front of the face and breathing in a minuscule amount of mist into the nose or olfactory pathways. This goes into the frontal lobes of the brain and awakens the limbic system to provide the deepest therapeutic effects through our inner most primal control networks. These three homeopathic delivery pathways provide a much faster delivery of the therapeutic effects of homeopathy and a much broader spectrum of therapeutic results. Each delivery pathway (orally, topically, and olfactory) provides a therapeutic dimension the other pathways may not. Chiropractors have commonly used camphor and menthol-like products for topical pain relief. Although these wifi give some temporary pain relief, they don't do anything to address the causes or activate the healing of pain. As healers, we want to remind ourselves of the purpose of pain. Pain is the messenger. We don't want to shoot the messenger. Homeopathy does not shoot the messenger. Allopathic drugs shoot the messenger. Allopathic drugs are suppressive in their action and simply suppress pain with a long list of more serious side effects. Homeopathic drugs are not suppressive but expressive in nature. That is, homeopathy expresses our inner innate healing abilities to be expressed that empower the body to heal and be stronger at the end of care. Allopathic drugs, in their suppressive actions, can leave us weaker and with lingering or long-term side effects, toxic effects, and addictive effects. Homeopathic topicals can combine camphor, menthol, and other essential oils without problem and offer the best of both worlds. Some homeopaths have said that strong aromatics like these can antidote the homeopathic remedies. I have found such antidoting to not be true and more of a myth in homeopathy. Where did the myth of strong aromatic antidotes get started? Dr. Hahnemann promoted a certain hygienic lifestyle that recommended not eating strong stimulants or aromatics in the diet. Followers of homeopathy converted this thought to the belief that these stimulants and aromatics may negate the healing effects of homeopathy. No mint (like toothpaste), no coffee, no garlic, and so on. The list was quite long and turned many away from choosing homeopathy as a treatment that they needed. Over much trial and testing, we have concluded that these so-called antidotes were not really antidotes. In the worst-case scenario, they could have maybe antidoted some individual remedies in certain potencies only, and that is still a very big maybe. Some homeopaths and homeopathic patients have said that they were having a healing crisis with a homeopathic remedy, and took some menthol or coffee and antidoted the healing crisis. Upon further muscle testing, we have tapped this belief away. In other words, the human power of intention is very strong, and once tapped away with new positive affirmation, no more antidoting issues.
