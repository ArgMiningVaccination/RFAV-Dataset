G-d has also shown us that our body is His temple (1 Corinthians 9:19-20), our mind is to be His (1 Corinthians 2:16, Romans 12:2), that we are bought with a price (1 Corinthians 7:23) and we are to be good stewards (1 Corinthians 4:2) of our body by caring for it to His glory. As we consider these scriptures I will try and answer some of the questions generally asked by Christians in relation to Homeopathic medicine. For a more comprehensive look into this subject I recommend \"A Christian's Guide to Homeopathy\" - a clear, well researched book that explains why Christians need have no fear of homeopathic medicine written by Alan Crook, MA, MCH, RSHom which is available from [Homeopathic Educational Service.](http://www.homeopathic.com/store/product=1076) On a historical note it would do my readers well to appreciate that Homeopathy Originated from Europe in the early 1800's. During this time, Europe was the centre of Christiainity and many (if not all) of the Founders and teachers of Homeopathic medicine we trained Physicians and well versed Bible Believers themselves. With much of thier understanding of health and disease derived from Biblical Text and sought to relieve human suffering with the G-d given tools at their disposal. To the extent that the central understanding of disease in mankind derives from inherited sin, known as Miasm's in Homeopathy and we term Genetic disease in modern medicine.

When I first came across this question, I wondered were someone would get a thought like that in relation to Homeopathic medicine. As I began to consider what might provoke such a question, these are the points that I have identified. The pivotal point in this question is that the application of Homeopathic medicine seems to fall outside of current medical thinking - that is, you give a molecule (medicine) that changes some chemical pathway and removes the symptom. While in Homeopathy we give the medicine, that as we currently understand it has no molecule of the original substance in it that brings about a change in the person and the patient gets better. So if it is causing some effect and we can't explain it with \"science\" then it must be something of the occult. This is not a good way to approach mans limited understanding of our world. Science, does not tell us how things must be, it is through science that we understand a little better how things are. (Deuteronomy 29:29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our G-d: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.) Homeopathy is the application of principles that G-d has place in nature for the benefit of mankind, and just because we can not explain everything about them does not make them from the occult. This leads us to the next question. - Is there some kind of 'spiritual involvement' in the manufacturing of Homeopathic Medicine? The answer to this question relates to the above question's answer. Moving on from there, if we examine how Homoepathic medicines are made, we can see clearly that there is nothing of a 'spiritual nature' involved in their production. How to manufacture Homeopathic medicine is freely available from a Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, of which there are British, American and Indian standardised publications to name the most common. These have the methodology set out according to stand pharmaceutical practice in the manufacturing of each medicine and are by no means secretive. Another part of the preparation is the serial dilution and vigorous shaking (known as succussion) which forms the process know as potentisation (or dynamisation) is where the supposed 'spiritual involvement' exists. This process can be preformed by anyone with pharmaceutical ability and is not depended on any secretive process for their manufacture. (Please see the video under the \"Medicines\" tab above) - Are Homeopaths involved in various forms of spiritual practices? I would like to answer this question with a question. Are Medical doctors involved in various forms of spiritual practices? Or any other healthcare provider? The answer would be; it depends on the individual, not on the discipline they use to treat the sick. If you wish to consult with a healthcare provider that has the same world view and belief system as yourself, then you should ensure that the individual shares your beliefs. The discipline of Homeopathic medicine is not influenced by the personal beliefs of the practitioners. In Homeopathy it is clear that there are unchanging principles of healing, as much as there are the eternal principles that G-d has given us from His word. In homeopathy we can see the principle of the \"Law of Similar\" as an unchanging principle of healing that is not influenced by the latest trend or drug or medical technology. In fact, there has hardly been any significant change in homeopathic principles or medicines over the last 200 years, except the development of a deeper and wider scientific understanding of their healing capacity. The same medicine that was applied 200 years ago can be (and is) applied today with equal efficacy to its original application. I'm sure there are more questions that need to be answered, but I do hope that this has been of some use. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me. "}
