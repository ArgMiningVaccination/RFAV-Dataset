It is part of the Massey University Research School of Public Health, together with the Research Centre for M ori Health & Development, the Sleep/Wake Research Centre, the Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation (SHORE) Centre and Whariki. The Centre for Public Health Research was established in 2000. Our re search programme covers all aspects of public health research, but with a focus on: Non-communicable disease (respiratory disease, cancer, diabetes) Mori health Pacific health Occupational health Environmental health Socio-economic determinants of health The Centre for Public Health Research recognizes the importance of the Treaty of Waitangi and its relevance to our work. We have a long history of involvement with Mori research and policy dev elopment including the Mori Asthma Review, the Wairarapa M ori Asthma Project, and the Hauora Tamariki project. Much of our Mori health research is done in collaboration with the Research Centre for M ori Health & Development, and our Mori asthma research invo lves a formal link with the Mori Committee of the As thma and Respiratory Foundation of New Zealand. We are also committed to employing and training M ori health researchers. 6 The Centre is based in t he College of Humanities and Social Sciences, but we also work with researchers at other Massey Colleges and campuses, as well as with researchers at other institutions including th e Malaghan Institute for Medical Research (MIMR), the Airway Research Centre (John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, Australia), Public Health Intelligence (Ministry of Health), Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), the Health Services Research Centre (Victoria University), the Popula tion and Environmental Health Group of the Institute for Environmental Science and Research (ESR), the Massey University Veterinary Epic entre, the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS) at the University of Utrecht (T he Netherlands), the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Institut Municipal d'Investigacio Medica (IMIM, Barcelona), the Postgraduate School of Occupational Health (Milan, Italy), the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Turin (Turin , Italy), the Department of Epidemiology and Prevent ive Medicine (Monash University, Melbourne), and the International Agency for Research on Ca ncer (Lyon, France). Although our main activity is research, we also work with organisations su ch as the Ministry of Health, Occupational Safe ty and Health (OSH), the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and various non-governm ental organisations, unions and companies to en sure that the findings of research are relevant to, and applied in, public health policy. In particula r, we have served on a number of advisory co mmittees for the Health Research Council, the Mi nistry of Health, ACC and OSH. 7The Year in Review The last year has seen major developments in the work of the Massey University Centre for Public Health Research (CPHR) with and considerable success in obtaining new research funding. Despite the current severe shortage of health research funding, we had a successful year with $3.5 million of new funding, including the three-year extension of our Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRC) Programme Grant, the award of a major HRC Project Grant for a study of dioxin exposure levels and health effects in phenoxy herbicide production workers, and an HRC Strategic Development Grant for studies of cancer in the Pacific, a Marsden Fund Fast-start grant for a study of the role of the lung macrophage in asthma pathology, and a number of other research grants in asthma, cancer, and occupational health from Lotteries Health Research, the Cancer Society of New Zealand, and the Ministry of Health. Recognition of the work of CPHR has also been reflected in 2005 in the election of Neil Pearce as President-Elect of the International Epidemiological Association, and as a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. 8 Respiratory Disease Our asthma research programme has been enhanced by the award of a Marsden Fund Fast-start grant for a study of the role of the lung macrophage in asthma pathology to Dr Christine van Dalen. We are also currently conducting two HRC-funded projects, both of which are being conducted in collaboration with the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research. The first study is examining the protective factors of farming on asthma in farmers' children and their parents. Phases I and II of the study have been completed, and we are now commencing Phase III of the study which is examining the immune status of babies born on farms and a group of control babies. The second study is investigating the hypothesis that endotoxin exposure later in life may reverse pre-existing allergies and allergic diseases. We are examining this in a prospective cohort of previously unexposed allergic adults who are starting a work career in industries with moderate to high endotoxin exposures. If endotoxin exposure is indeed associated with a lower prevalence of allergies in adults then potentially vaccines could be developed not only to protect but also potentially to treat allergic disease (e.g allergic asthma, hay fever, eczema), both in children and in adults. We are also continuing to work on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). Neil Pearce is a member of the ISAAC Executive and the ISAAC Steering Committee. Sunia Foliaki is Regional Coordinator for Oceania and a member of the Steering Committee. We have completed the ISAAC Phase III study in Wellington, and in Tonga, Fiji Islands, Cook Islands, Samoa, Niue, Tokelau Islands, Nauru, French Polynesia and New Caledonia. 9Cancer Our cancer research programme has been greatly enhanced by the arrival of Dr Mona Jeffreys as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in cancer epidemiology, and the award to Lis Ellison-Loschmann of an HRC Erihapeti Rehu- Murchie Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in cancer epidemiology. The programme now not only includes studies of occupational cancer (see below), but also studies of cancer survival (with funding from Lotteries Health Research) and a case- control study of breast cancer. The M ori component of the latter study is currently funded and the Pacific and non-M ori non-Pacific components are partially funded. In addition we have been conducting a series of analyses, in collaboration with Public Health Intelligence and the New Zealand Health Information Service (Ministry of Health) using routine data to examine ethnic and socioeconomic differences in cancer survival. Other Non-communicable Disease Other non-communicable disease research has included a series of analyses, in collaboration with Public Health Intelligence to examine mortality in patients with diabetes, a series of analyses in collaboration with the New Zealand Hepatitis Foundation to examine mortality, cancer incidence, and diabetes incidence in patients screened for diabetes using the HbA1c test. 10 Occupational and Environmental Health We have received funding from the HRC, Lotteries Health Research and the Cancer Society of New Zealand to conduct a series of case-control studies of bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, and lung cancer, to quantify the proportion of cases of these cancers due to known occupational exposures, and to identify new occupational causes of these cancers. We are also currently conducting a study funded by the HRC/OSH/ACC of the current and future burden of occupational ill health in New Zealand, and an HRC/OSH funded study of health outcomes in former New Zealand timber workers exposed to pentachlorophenol (PCP). Finally, in 2005 we received funding from the HRC for a major study of dioxin exposures and health effects in former phenoxy herbicide production workers. 11Mori Health Dr Lis Ellison-Loschmann is currently based at the Institut Municipal d'Investigacio Medica (IMIM) in Barcelona, Spain, as part of her four-year HRC-funded Postdoctoral Fellowship for studies of cancer epidemiology in M ori. Lis is conducting a case-control study of breast cancer in M ori, and we are seeking funding for the Pacific and non-M ori non- Pacific components of the study. We are also developing a proposal for a case-control study of causes of gastric cancer in M ori, together with colleagues at the Auckland School of Medicine. Pacific Health Dr Sunia Foliaki is coordinating the ISAAC Phase III study in the Pacific. The ISAAC Phase III study is currently being conducted in Tonga, Samoa, Fiji Islands, Cook Islands, Niue, Nauru and the Tokelau Islands. Further studies include an asthma self- management trial in Tonga funded by the Wellcome Trust, and a study of cancer in Pacific populations (Tonga, Samoa, Niue, Fiji) funded by the HRC. Dr Ate Moala is conducting research into the development of a health promotion model for fanau Pasifiki and their families with funding from an HRC Pacific Health Research Training Fellowship. Ridvan Firestone has been awarded an HRC-funded Postdoctoral Fellowship in Pacific Health research, which she will commence in mid-2006. 12 Teaching In 2005 we hosted a short- course in Advanced Methods in Epidemiology and Biostatistics with Professor Sander Greenland (UCLA School of Public Health) The Massey University Research School of Public Health Master of Public Health (MPH) Programme includes a Postgraduate Diploma in Public Health (PGDipPH) which commenced in 2005; it involves the equivalent of one year fulltime study (four 25 point papers of which two are compulsory - the core paper, and a research project). The programme involves an applied approach to public health education and training that is different from existing public health qualifications, integrating public policy more strongly with public health, and also providing the opportunity for a greater emphasis on M ori health and Pacific health. An MPH- by-thesis option has been available since 2004 for candidates who have already completed an equivalent of the PGDipPH. Concluding Remarks In closing we wish to thank all research collaborators involved in our various projects who have played an important role in ensuring a productive year, the agencies who have funded this programme of research, and all those who have participated in our studies. We also wish to thank Massey University and its staff for its excellent support for our research programme. 13Research Projects Projects completed during 2005 1.
