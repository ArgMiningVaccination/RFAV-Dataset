Talk about Ayurveda treatment for anxiety, leucoderma, depression, insomnia, weight gain, weight loss, immunity, muscle strength, bodybuilding, anti oxidants, sexual stimulants and so on. The herb does it all and more. Botanical Name: Withania Somnifera Dunal be taken along with Ashwagandha? Dr JV Hebbar. Chyawanprash itself contains Ashwagandha as an ingredient. In - Chyawanprash is useful in people with depleted tissues, weak, emaciated, very old and children seeking improvement of body growth. Ashwagandha has very similar effects. It is explained by Acharya Bhavamishra as kaypah - relieves tissue depletion, | balya - promotes strength Chyawanprash is indicated by Charaka in hdroga - cardiac disorders. Ashwagandha is a very good antioxidant, can slightly decrease blood pressure and is explained as balya - useful to promote cardiac health. Chyawanprash improves medh - intelligence and smti - memory Ashwagandha is useful to relieve stress, depression, anxiety and to improve quality of sleep. So this combination can be effective to improve brain and mental health. Chyawanprash and Ashwagandha both are explained as aphrodisiac. Both of them are explained as Rasayana - possessing rasayana effect. A possible downside of this combination is an increase of hotness. Chyawanprash and Ashwagandha - both can improve heat and digestion strength. Hence, in people with high Pitta and sensitive stomach, this combination can cause heartburn, loose stools and increased body warmth. How to take it? A teaspoon of chyavanprash can be had with a quarter a teaspoon of Ashwagandha with half a cup of milk in the morning or at night, 10 minutes before food. One Ashwagandha tablet / capsule can be taken in place of its powder. Conclusion: Theoretically this combination can be taken together but an Ayurveda doctor's prescription is highly needed. Take it only if your doctor recommends it.

It is revealed in a collaborative study of DAILAB at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan. The researchers targeted the main SARS-CoV-2 enzyme for splitting proteins, known as the Main protease (Mpro). Mpro plays a key role in replication of the virus. The researchers have discovered that a chemical [Withanone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Withanone) (Wi-N) - C28H38O6, derived from Ashwagandha and Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE), an active ingredient of New Zealand Propolis, has the potential to block the activity of Mpro. Withanone also potentially blocks the entry of viruses through the cell membrane. Withanone is a steroidal lactone, present in the roots of Ashwagandha. It belongs to a group of compounds called Withanolides. Other factors that boost the importance of Ashwagandha in potential prevention of Covid 19: Ashwagandha boosts body immunity and increases the body's natural ability to fight viruses. It is a natural anti-oxidant and is also useful in the treatment of fever and respiratory tract infections. It is widely used to improve body strength, immunity and to relieve stress. With all these positive points, it can be said that it is wise to include Ashwagandha in your herbal tea. How to take Ashwagandha? It can be made into a herbal tea. 1 Teaspoon of its root powder is added to a cup of water, boiled for 3 - 5 minutes. Filtered. This - in 50 ml dose is the adult dose.

Ashwagandha can also be consumed in the form of powder - 3 - 5 grams, along with milk or water. Its capsule or tablet is also available in the market. Adult dose of 250 mg capsule or tablet is - 1 tablet once or twice a day, before or after food. Because of its anti-anxiety properties, being rich in antioxidants and hypoglycemic activity, it is very useful in treating diabetes. Ashwagandha is frequently used in cognitive impairment disorders and bipolar disorder. In such cases, it is made in combination with other nontropical herbs such as Gotu Kola.

Use in depression Withania somnifera for depression: It is widely used in treating anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, and adrenaline fatigue. Hence, it is used as an ingredient in [ Manasamitra vatakam](http://ayurmedinfo.com/2012/06/29/manasamitra-vatakam-benefits-dosage-ingredients-and-side-effects/) and [ Brahmi Vati, two](http://ayurmedinfo.com/2012/07/27/brahmi-vati-benefits-dosage-ingredients-side-effects/) famous Ayurvedic tablets. Ashwagandha for numbness It improves blood circulation, is a very good antioxidant, acts as a nervine tonic and soothes nerves. Hence, it is useful to relieve numbness. Ashwagandha for sleep Because Ashwagandha is useful in relieving anxiety and depression and because of its nerve calming effect, it is used in treating sleep disorders. For weight loss Usually for weight loss, it is administered in capsule or powder form along with milk and water. It improves muscle strength, hence enables one to be more physically active, hence useful in weight loss. It also helps to relieve depression. Many depression patients often put on weight either due to depression itself or due to antidepressant medication. In either case, Ashwagandha is useful to fight both depression and related weight gain. For weight gain Because it improves muscle strength and has nutritive value, when it is used along with other high nutrition foods like large quantities of ghee, milk and sugar candy, Withania somnifera is very useful to put on weight. For this purpose, usually 3 grams of Ashwagandha powder is mixed with a teaspoon of ghee and administered at night, before food for a month. You say Ashwagandha and its related products can be used both for weight gain and weight loss. How? First thing to remember is, in Ayurveda we talk about the whole herbs and not their individual chemicals extracted. The same herb / Ayurvedic medicine, given in different doses, can bring about different effects. For example, Ashwagandha powder with ghee - is useful in targeting mental disorders, stress, infertility issues, muscle weakness, low body weight etc. This combination is useful to balance Vata very effectively, hence can be useful to gain weight. Whereas, Ashwagandha with honey, is more effective in balancing Kapha Dosha, hence useful in losing weight. In like Ashwagandharishta, Ashwagandhadi churna, [Aswagandha ghrita ](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2012/07/21/brihat-ashwagandha-ghrita-benefits-dosage-ingredients-side-effects/)etc, - they can be used both for weight gain and weight loss. If one takes these medicines in low doses - 5 - 10 grams or 10 ml per day and does good diet control and exercise, then these can improve muscle strength, reduce body stress and help in quick weight loss. Whereas, if they are given along with ghee, in high dose, with nourishing foods, can be useful in weight gain as well. Can Ashwagandha increase muscle bulk? For heart care Ashwagandha is a very good anti-oxidant and acts as a heart tonic. It improves the strength of muscles of the heart (cardiac muscles). It can also be useful in high BP and to relieve stress. Muscle pain, strength, wound healing Its external application in the form of root paste or in the form of oil (prepared in sesame oil base) is useful to relieve pain, inflammation, useful in skin diseases and in chronic non healing wounds. its leaf or root paste is used externally to treat painful swellings, abscesses, cellulitis and sinuses. In sexual disorders There are some studies done which proves Withania somnifera's testosterone boosting action. ( [report](http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Research/Ashwagandha-may-promote-healthy-testosterone-production-in-men-Clinical-data)) It improves muscle strength, hence quite useful in treating premature ejaculation and in a few cases of erectile dysfunction. It also relieves anxiety and depression, so helps to improve sexual performance. It is also used in treating and improving female libido. Ashwgandha for tinnitus Does Ashwagandha help in tinnitus? Dr JV Hebbar Tinnitus is a disorder in which the patient hears a peculiar non-existing sound, like the buzzing sound of bees. It has many causes. Only in select causative factors, Ashwagandha is useful. If tinnitus is caused due to old age, then Ashwagandha, being an anti-aging herb, is useful. Tinnitus can be caused due to injury to the head and neck. In wound care and also in recovering from head injuries, Ashwagandha is very useful. It relieves post-traumatic stress and it also strengthens nerves. Read: [Tinnitus Causes, Ayurvedic Treatment, Herbs, Lifestyle Tips](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2015/02/24/tinnitus-causes-ayurvedic-treatment-tips/) If tinnitus is caused due to stress, anxiety and depression, then Ashwagandha is very useful. If tinnitus is caused due to Meniere's disease, a neurological disorder involving dizziness, then Ashwagandha, being a nerve tonic, is useful. Ashwagandha is less effective in treating tinnitus, if it is caused due to bone spur, ear bone deformities, tumors and ear wax buildup. How to use? Ashwagandha powder or tablet / capsule - 1 at night is usually advised Or its formulations such as [Ashwagandharishtam](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2011/06/27/ashwagandharishta-uses-ingredients-dose-and-side-effects/), Ashwagandha Avaleha are co prescribed with Vata Dosha balancing nerve tonics such as Ksheerabala 101 oil / capsule. Bala Ashwagandhadi taila as ear drops, for [Shirodhara](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2016/05/09/shirodhara-procedure-benefits-mode-of-action/), Shirovasti, head massage is also very useful. Does Ashwagandha promote healthy lymph? Lymph is related to immunity and Ashwagandha boosts and corrects immunity( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10616957/)). Hence, it is useful to promote lymph health. Lymphatic channels are responsible for digestion and absorption of fats, removing wastes from cells and tissues and production of cells that are responsible for immunity. Ashwagandha helps in all these functions.

However, the Ministry of Ayush, via notification L-1 1O11/9/2021-DCC, has advised Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani manufacturers to not to use leaves as part of Ashwagandha in medicine. This is because root is the best part of Ashwgandha and all Ayurveda textbooks mention the roots as the used part of Ashwagandha. Dosage Ashwagandha Powder 3 - 6 g in divided dose per day. Capsule - 250 - 500 mg - once or twice a day, based on doctor's advice. Milk, water, yogurt, honey and ghee are a few co-drinks consumed along with Ashwagandha. If it is ghee, mix ashwagandha powder with ghee, make a paste and swallow with a cup of hot water. Used commonly in Pitta disorders. If it is sesame oil, mix ashwagandha powder with sesame oil, make a paste and swallow with a cup of hot water. Used commonly in Vata disorders - brain and neurological diseases, weak muscles etc. If it is honey, mix ashwagandha powder with honey, make a paste and swallow with a cup of cold water. Always remember to use cold water while using honey. If it is yogurt, the yogurt should not be very sour. If it is very sour, it can increase Pitta - heat in the body. Keep in mind that Ashwagandha is also slightly heat producing. Hence, this precaution. Various Co-Drink For Ashwagandha To Improve Strength, Nourishment and Power Remedy Before food or after food? Some people feel a burning sensation if Ashwagandha is consumed before food or on empty stomach. Hence, it is best to take it, 30 minutes after food. If Ashwagandha milk remedy is made, then it can be taken before food, based on your doctor's advice. Is there an age limit for Ashwagandha intake? For children, in the form of herbal ghee or herbal milk, Ashwagandha can be administered from 1 year of age. In elders, there is no age limit. In appropriate lower doses, it can be administered even to very old people, under medical supervision. Legal Substitute for ashtavarga Ashtavarga is a group of eight herbs with very high rejuvenation and anti-aging qualities. Among them, Kakoli-Roscoea purpurea Kshirakakoli- Lilium polyphyllum - White Himalaya Lily - these two herbs are legally substituted with Ashwagandha, because of similar qualities.

Due to sedative benefits the roots are used in anxiety, nervousness, fatigue, giddiness, fainting, loss of sleep etc. In case of Premature ejaculation resulting due to anxiety it has shown very significant benefit. Use in auto-immune disorders Can Ashwagandha be used in Hashimoto thyroiditis? I have heard that it should not be used? A false concept is there, that immune boosting herbs like Ashwagandha cannot be taken in auto-immune disorders. I do not approve of this concept. Ashwagandha in Hashimoto thyroiditis / hypothyroidism would effectively address the symptoms of stress, weight gain, muscle pain, joint pains, depression etc. The regular dose (needs approval by consulting an Ayurvedic doctor) for this is - half a teaspoon (3 g) at night, with a cup of milk or water, 10 minutes after food. For hypothyroidism Ashwagandha is useful to stimulate thyroid hormone secretion and utilization. Ashwagandha relieves stress, it is a very good antioxidant, stimulates thyroid - Decreases TSH and improves T3 and T4. - [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296437/)Hypothyroidism is often associated with fluid retention and increased sensitivity to cold weather. Ashwagandha being hot in potency, relieves cold sensitivity and being diuretic, relieves fluid retention. Hypothyroid people often struggle with depression, stress and weight gain. Ashwagandha with honey, is very useful to address all these three issues. Ashwagandha is often made into a combination with [Varanadi kashayam](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2009/10/20/varanadi-kashayam/amp/), [Kanchanara guggulu](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2009/11/10/kanchnar-guggulu/amp/), [Punarnavadi mandooram](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2012/07/10/punarnava-mandur-tablets-benefits-dosage-ingredients-side-effects/)etc. to address hypothyroidism. For hyperthyroidism It is not directly indicated in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. But it is useful in treating below symptoms which are associated with hyperthyroidism. Nervousness, irritability Fatigue, muscle weakness more frequent bowel movements Difficulty sleeping. For boosting immunity Stimulate immunological activity in mice. Enhances the total WBC count (17125 cells/mm(3)) on the 10th day. Bone marrow cellularity (27\u00d710(6) cells/femur) as Administration of Withania extract also showed an enhancement in phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages (76.5 pigmented cells/200) when compared control (31.5/200 cells) mice. ( [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10904163)) As immuno-modulator - Active paw anaphylaxis and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH). Immunomodulatory effect was assessed. - A significant increase in white blood cell counts and platelet counts was observed in animals treated with Ashwagandha extract. - A protective effect in cyclophosphamide-induced myelo suppression was observed in animals treated with WST and WS2, revealing a significant increase in white blood cell counts and platelet counts. - Significant increase in hemagglutinating antibody responses and hemolytic antibody responses towards sheep red blood cells. ( [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10616957)) Ashwagandha Remedy For Immunity, Strong Body and Mind For anxiety Preliminary evidence suggests potent anxiolytic effects in the context of chronic stress, with lesser potency in standard forms of anxiety not related to stress. There may be more benefit to social anxiety as well with Ashwagandha relative to other anxiolytics For high C reactive protein The reduction seen in C-reactive protein over the course of 60 days has been noted to reach 31.6% with standard oral doses of ashwagandha supplementation. High CRP levels can indicate that there is inflammation in the arteries of the heart, which can mean a higher risk for heart attack. For muscle power output Improvements in power output have been noted in trained persons subject to a sprint test and in sedentary persons who simply took the supplement as well as untrained people who began strength training. Ashwagandha in children Ashwagandha can be useful in children to improve growth etc. But it should only be taken if your doctor prescribes it. Without doctor's consultation if Ashwagandha is given in children, it may lead to constipation, loose stools, abdominal cramps, drowsiness, excess sleepiness or even anxiety episodes. Does Asgandh increase ojas? All Ayurvedic herbs that have Rasayana - anti aging effects in deed increase ojas and immunity. Interestingly there is a set of activities and lifestyle changes that you can adopt, which has rasayana effect and which increases Ojas. It is called [Achara Rasayana](https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=6sNRk&m=3dWRQ_xz7AXmwtK&b=2VmMPqoQu67PEyZ0eYqFRQ) What is actually rasayana? Rasayana means, which helps you to live long with a healthy body and sound mind. Any therapy or medicine or diet that ensures optimum quality of Ojas (immunity factor in the body), which ensures healthy functioning of all body tissues, organs, mind and brain. Read - [Meaning and benefits of Rasayana](https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=6sNRk&m=3dWRQ_xz7AXmwtK&b=UC8tzHJkHn5oY.CO8ztu1w) How can Ashwagandha increase ojas, having post digestive taste as pungent and not sweet? It is true that most of Ojas 's increasing medicines are sweet in taste. But Ashwagandha having pungency improves digestion strength and helps in optimum nourishment of all body tissues. It also has antioxidant properties. If taken for immunity and health improvement, how long can it be continued? Ashwagandha can be continued for a period of 4 - 8 weeks. Ashwagandha Home remedies We have already covered a couple (and lot more to follow) [Ashwagandha remedy for easy conception for women](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2012/07/17/ayurvedic-ashwagandha-home-remedy-for-conception-for-women/) [Boost immunity in children with Ashwagandha](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2012/03/21/how-to-improve-immune-system-in-children-an-ayurvedic-method/) Pharmacokinetics How long does Ashwagandha stay in the body? In what ways is it eliminated? The effect of one dose of 500 mg of Ashwagandha capsule or tablet or 1 dose of 5 grams of Ashwagandha churna is seen for a period of 2 - 3 days. Though much pharmacokinetic data is not available, in an experimental study on rats, it was noted that extracts of Ashwagandha remained for 45-60 minutes. (half life) - 0.046% Withaferin A and 0.048% Withanolide A. It is eliminated largely through liver, bowels and urine. Side effects Withania somnifera Side effects Increased hotness, gastritis: If used alone, for example, Ashwagandha capsule with water, it tends to worsen [ gastritis](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2011/01/05/ayurvedichome-remedies-for-acidity-and-gastritis/) in people with sensitive stomach. It also causes constipation in a few. Because of its innate hot nature, people with Pitta dominance feel increased hotness with Ashwagandha capsule. But if it is taken along with milk or ghee, usually this side effect is very much nullified. Sedative effect: In a very high dose, it may have a sedative effect. Hence some experts advice to avoid it during the day. But I have not seen its sedative effect so big as to put someone to sleep in the daytime. However, it is best to take it during the day, only if your doctor has suggested so. Its sleep promotion effect can be more attributed to its anti anxiety and anti depression properties than to its sedative effect. It can be used safely in children and lactating mothers, under medical supervision. It is best to avoid this during pregnancy. Who should not take Ashwagandha? It, being a Rasayana herb (anti aging), as such there are no definitive contra-indications. Below are the symptoms to watch out for when you take Ashwagandha. Excess body heat (give it 2-3 days to settle, if not stop) If you take it and then develop severe anxiety or unrest (stop it and consult doc) If it makes you drowsy ( if so, avoid it in the morning) If it upsets your stomach (can give a try for a couple of days to see if it settles down) If it causes diarrhea or constipation (can continue for a couple of days to see if it settles down) If it causes Irregular heart beat (very rare) If it lowers blood pressure / sugar excessively (stop immediately and consult doc) Interaction with medicines, supplements Can this be used while taking Homeopathic medicine? Yes. This product does not react with homeopathic medicine. Can this medicine be continued while taking supplements like multivitamin tablets, Omega 3 fatty acids etc.? Yes. Generally, this product goes well with most dietary supplements. However, if you are taking more than one product per day, please consult your doctor for an opinion. With western medicines Seek your doctor's advice if you are taking this product along with other western (allopathic / modern) medicines. Some Ayurvedic herbs can interact with modern medicine. If both Ayurvedic and allopathic medicines are advised together, then it is best to take Allopathic medicine first, wait for 30 minutes and then take the Ayurvedic medicine. Ayurvedic medicines Ayurvedic medicines with ashwagandha ingredient: It is an chyawanprash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aouounrU7E4) [Ajaswagandhadi lehyam](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2009/11/10/ajaswagandhadi-leham/)and [Ashwagandhadi versions - in Avaleha (lickable) form, used pretty much for similar purposes. [Ashwagandharishta](http://ayurmedinfo.com/2011/06/27/ashwagandharishta-uses-ingredients-dose-and-side-effects/)is widely used in treating fainting disorder, mental fatigue etc. [Balaswagandhadi thailam](http://ayurmedinfo.com/2012/06/11/balaswagandhadi-thailam-benefits-how-to-use-ingredients-side-effects/) Time taken to show results How long does Aswagandha take to show results? It depends on the purpose of your usage. As an anti-aging herb, Ashwaganadha is given in low doses for a few months. So, it takes several months to bring about this action, gradually. As an antidepressant, anti stress and sleep aid, usually Ashwagandha starts showing results in about 7 days time. As an energy boosting herb, it starts showing results in about 3 - 5 days time. For weight gain, it may take 1-2 months time, when it is administered along with cow ghee or milk. As a sexual stimulant, it may take about a week to show good results. Research on Withania somnifera [Anti stress activity:](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f038/1e4ec5e6e2d86312d3abd896e70f686ad006.pdf)To evaluate the anti-stress effects of Withania somnifera, an alcoholic extract from roots & seeds dissolved in normal saline was given (100 mg/kg intra peritoneal as a single dose) to 20-25 g mice in a swimming performance test in water at 28'-30' C. It is seen that the extracts approximately double the swimming time when compared to control. It suggested that Withania somnifera induced a stage of nonspecific increased resistance during stress. Glycosides of Withania somnifera exhibited significant anti stress activity in forced swimming induced immobility in mice, restraint stress induced gastric ulcer & auto analgesia in rats. Further clinical studies should be conducted as well as studies in multiple animal based models using a variety of suitable biochemical markers to understand its mechanism of action. [Inhibition of mammary cancer metastasis:](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0075069)Withaferin A showed dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth and metastatic lung nodule formation with minimal systemic toxicity. Dr CP Mathew MBBS, MS, DMR, famous cancer specialist has said on many occasions that he uses immunity boosting herbs like Ashwagandha in many cancers such as lymphoma, after a short course of chemotherapy. [Hypotensive activity](http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/S-EM/EM-06-0-000-12-Web/EM-06-2-000-12-Abst-PDF/S-EM-06-2-111-12-203-Kushwaha-S/S-EM-06-2-111-12-203-Kushwaha-S-Tt.pdf): The main objective of the study was to analyze the efficacy of Ashwagandha root powder with water and with milk in treatment of hypertension. The experiment was conducted on 51 stress-oriented hypertensive subjects in the age group of 40 to 70 years. Subjects were divided into group I and group II. Supplementation of 2gm of Ashwagandha root powder was given to group I and group II with milk and water respectively in the morning. Blood pressure was also recorded over a period of three months. Overall decrease in systolic blood pressure was found though it was non- significant. Further, decrease in systolic blood pressure was significant in group I, whereas decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significant in both the groups. Hence, supplementation of Ashwagandha with milk is recommended in treatment of stress- oriented hypertension Uses as per research Ashwagandha Uses documented as per research - Diabetes - reduces sugar, anti oxidant, relieves stress - High cholesterol - reduces bad cholesterol, anti oxidant, - Male infertility - improve sperm quality in infertile men. - Arthritis - There is preliminary research that ashwagandha taken in a particular supplement (Articulin-F) along with other ingredients might improve arthritis symptoms. - Parkinson's disease. Research suggests that a combination of herbs including ashwagandha improves Parkinson's symptoms. - Tumors and cancer - Tuberculosis - relieves muscle wasting, weight loss - Liver problems (hepato-protective) - Gentamicin Intoxicated Rats - animal study - Swelling (inflammation). - Ulcerations - non healing wounds, abscess - Stress. - Altering immune system function. - Anti aging - Fibromyalgia - body ache Ashwagandha churna Vs capsule Ashwagandha churna Vs Ashwagandha capsule When pure uncontaminated Ashwagandha churna is available, then it is usually preferred to capsule form. But usually Churnas get contaminated easily. When Ashwagandha needs to be formulated as a mix powder along with other powders (such as [Ashwagandhadi Churna](http://ayurmedinfo.com/2012/07/21/ashwagandhadi-churna-benefits-dosage-ingredients-side-effects/), used in indigestion), powder form has advantage over the capsule form. Ashwagandha capsule is usually prepared with its water extract or crude extract, which retains most of its chemical constituents. When it comes to easy dosage fixing and easy consumption, capsule is a lot better than Churna form, because of the bitter taste of Ashwagandha and powder dose fixing is a bit difficult task. If Ashwagandha alone is to be used for treatment, then a capsule can be preferred. But if used alone with water, it tends to cause a burning sensation in the stomach, hence it is advisable to use it along with milk or ghee, or a combination of both.\\ Administration in Ama condition Q: I was taught not to give it in ama conditions, or Kapha vikruti, and that agni needs to be strong when taking Ashwagandha lehyam. - Ashwagandha is Ushna veerya - hot -> Agni promotion. So, Ashwagandha alone is good to use in such a condition, in the form of powder, capsule or tablet. - Ashwagandhadi Lehyam contains jaggery etc that are heavy to digest ingredients -> So, avoid it if you have low Agni (digestion strength). Ashwagandha addiction Q: I took the Ashwagandha capsule for 10 days. I missed the 11th day and felt anxious. Will I be dependent on Ashwagandha forever? Usually Ashwagandha is advised for at least 24 - 6 weeks. After that, gradually the dose is reduced and stopped over a period of 2 - 3 months time. In your case, I would advise to take an Ashwagandha capsule - 1 capsule at night after food for 1 month continuously. For the second month, take it on alternate days for next 4 - 6 weeks and then finally stop it. It is not habit forming. Meaning, it will not cause you to stay addicted to Ashwagandha. Ashwgandha with milk Ashwagandha with milk is a very good combination. There is a dosage form called Ksheerapaka, in which these two are cooked together. This combination can be taken in all seasons. Hotness of Ashwagandha nullifies the coldness of milk. This combination makes the milk more digestible. In what cases Ashwagandha is given readily with milk and when is Ashwagandha boiled with milk and administered? Between Ashwagandha with milk and Ashwagandha processed with milk, which is more effective? Dr JV Hebbar There are two ways in which cow milk is used for administration of herbs. One is, processing with the herb. For example, Ashwagandha is added with milk and water, boiled till the milk quantity remains, filtered and administered. This method is valid for Ashwagandha and this method of boiling herb with milk (called Ksheerapaka) is usually followed 1. When the herb is very hot and spicy and its hotness and Pitta Dosha aggravating effect is to be calmed - for example, Marking nut - Bhallataka Ksheerapaka used for anti-aging purposes or Pippali Ksheerapaka, used in liver and digestive disorders.

When energizing and nourishing qualities of the herb is to be potentiated with milk. For example, Licorice - Yashtimadhu ksheerapaka, used in acid peptic disorders and gastric / duodenal ulcer or Arjuna Ksheerapaka, used as a tonic for heart. Read: [Arjuna milk remedy for heart](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2012/02/22/ayurvedic-cardiac-tonic-home-remedy-for-heart-support-video/amp/) Now, coming to the question, whether Ashwagandha should be boiled with milk or, can it just be taken along with milk, 1. There is no direct reference for Ashwagandha ksheerapaka in major traditional textbooks. However, if you feel gastritis or a burning sensation or stomach upset after taking Ashwagandha, or if you want to negate the slightly hot effect of Ashwagandha, it can be boiled with milk and consumed. 2. There is a direct reference of taking Ashwagandha powder directly with milk. When such a direct classical, direct reference is available, then it is very clear that there is no big need to convert that into a ksheerapaka (milk boiling). 3. Very rarely, an herb is used both along with milk, or used after processing after milk. For example, Pippali (long pepper fruit) is consumed directly with milk, in a process called Vardhamana Pippali Rasayana and Pippali Ksheerapaka is mentioned separately, done reduce the hotness of long pepper. Read: [Pippali Rasayan Benefits, Dose, Side Effects](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2012/05/11/pippali-rasayana-benefits-how-to-use-dosage-reference/) 4. Coming back to the reference of Ashwagandha powder with milk, Acharya Govinda Das, in is consumed payas - along with cow milk arddhamsa - for half a month v - or along with ghtena tailena sukhmbun ghee, sesame oil or lukewarm water, kasya pui vapuo vidhatte - it nourishes the body of the emaciated, weak person yath ambuvi: - just like how watering blasya sasyasya - nourishes a small plant. Above remedies are explained in the context of anti-aging therapy. So, 3 grams of Ashwagandha powder can be administered with half a cup of water, at night, before or after food, for improving body strength and nourishment. It is ideal for all. 3 grams of Ashwagandha can also be administered with 1 teaspoon of cow ghee, mixed and swallowed with lukewarm water. This is useful to pacify Pitta Dosha, to improve brain functions, useful in depression, anxiety, insomnia associated with weakness of the body. 3 grams of Ashwagandha can also be administered with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, mixed and swallowed with lukewarm water. This is useful in Vata Dosha domination. Aches and pains, myalgia, underweight, anxiety, though unstability, excess dryness and weakness of body. Alternatively, if the patient's digestive health is reasonably good, Ashwagandha can be administered directly with lukewarm water. Finally, Ashwagandha can be taken with milk directly, as there is clear traditional indication. It can also be boiled with milk, filtered and consumed, to have a milder effect of the herb, as in case of children, aged people or in patients with highly sensitive stomach. Ashwagandha with Amla Both Ashwagandha and amla are potential ingredients in ayurveda which is used in the preparation of several formulations. Both these have a wide range of actions on the body. Thus its action on the body varies between individuals. Here it is to be noted that Amla juice can be taken on a daily basis as the constitution easily suits the internal body system at its best. Ashwagandha on the other hand is powerful in action and hence it shall be used only for a limited period of time. Basically Ashwagandha is used to relieve stress and secondly as an aphrodisiac. Most of the formulations in Ayurveda which are meant for treating mental conditions have ashwagandha as one of the prime ingredients. When used as an aphrodisiac it shall be used by those above 23 years of age as on an average it is only after this age that means the body becomes suitable enough to handle the action of ashwagandha. When both Ashwagandha and amla are used together, ashwagandha acts as a chief ingredient and amla acts as a medium and catalyst in enhancing the action of ashwagandha. Ashwagandha with Shatavari In which conditions, Ashwagandha is administered along with Shatavari? The below reference is from the textbook Bhavaprakasha Nighantu. [Shatavari is Asparagus racemosus](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2015/01/04/shatavari-asparagus-racemosus-uses-research-side-effects/) Ashwagandha is hot and Shatavari is a coolant. Both these herbs have Rasayana - anti aging effect. Ashwagandha is balya - promotes strength. Shatavari is Stanya - promotes lactation. This combination is used in the post-natal care of the mother to improve lactation and also to improve strength of the organs of the lower abdomen of the mother. Ashwagandha is explained as Atishukrala - promotes sperm / semen production, so also is Shatavari - Shukrakari. This combination is very useful in treating oligospermia and sexual disorders. To improve sperm count, one might think of adding Kapikacchu to this combination and to improve vigor, shilajit can be added. In some people, taking Ashwagandha alone causes loose stools. Shatavari is explained as Atisarajit - wins over diarrhea. In this way, Shatavari is useful to relieve the side effects of Ashwagandha, pertaining to the digestive system. Ashwagandha is an energizer, stimulator. Shatavari is calming, it maintains mental balance. Some people complain of increased thoughts or anxiety with Ashwagandha. It can be negated by adding Shatavari. This combination is perfect for women of menopausal age, when they need improved body strength, mind calmness and decrease in hot flashes. Test for purity How to know if Ashwagandha is genuine? If you buy it from a reputed brand, there is no need to worry about its quality. There are no tests that can be done at home to prove the authenticity of the product. If you have purchased it and are unsure, then send the sample to a nearby analysis laboratory to test for purity and identity. Addison's disease Addison's disease is a disorder of the hormonal system. It is caused due to failure of adrenal glands to produce normal amounts of cortisol and aldosterone hormones. Though there is no definitive role of Ashwagandha, established in the curing the Addison's disease, it is very useful to improve many symptoms of the disease such as fatigue, muscle weakness, lack of strength, loss of appetite, weight loss, etc. Distribution Distribution of Withania somnifera: Throughout the dry and subtropical India.

There is another herb described in dhanvantari nighantu along with Ashwagandha with the synonyms like Medasvi, sthoulyadhyava, Bali, Mamsi, and Rukmini. This is considered as the big variety of Ashwagandha (W. coagulans ) by Sri Singaraja Kama Sastry (1932). The cultivated variety of Asvagandha which is thin and lean is mainly brought from nagori dist. Of Madhya Pradesh. Hence, the name \"Nagori Ashvagandhi Ashwagandha during winter: Ayurveda explains that during winter one does have high vigor and strength.

Dr JV Hebbar Short answer is, yes; these three can be combined. At the outset, all are useful to improve brain functions, memory, concentration and intelligence. But when we dig deep, this combination is useful in a wide variety of illnesses. Let us slice and dice this combination to arrive at where exactly this combination is more useful and where it is not. 1. Strength and immunity - Ashwagandha and Shankhapushpi are explained as Balaprada and Balada. Ashwagandha is Pushtiprada - improves body nourishment. To fight fatigue, muscle wasting and to improve immunity in chronic disorders, to relieve tiredness due to long illness, this combination is useful. Ashwagandha is kshayahara - useful in treating muscle wasting, emaciation, post tubercular treatment to improve muscle mass and strength Ashwagandha is explained as Vranaan hanti - useful to bring about quick wound healing. After an injury due to a fall or road traffic accident, this combination can be helpful. 2. Aphrodisiac - Both Ashwagandha and Shankhapushpi are Vrushya and Vaajikari. Ashwagandha is Ati Shukrala - improves semen quantity and quality. 3.

After a long term illness, this combination can be very useful. 4. Anti inflammatory - Ashwagandha and Brahmi are explained as shophahara. Whenever there is inflammation due to injury, or due to chronic illness, chronic respiratory disorders, asthma, this combination is useful. 5. Cough, cold, asthma - Ashwagandha and Brahmi are explained as Shwasara, kasahara. This combination is useful to relieve inflammation, asthma, cough and cold. 6. Diabetes and hypertension - All three herbs are useful in both these conditions. 8. Intelligence: Brahmi and Shankhapushpi are intelligence and memory. Shankhapushpi is explained as medhya - Paste of Shankhapushpi improves memory and intelligence Smrutiprada - improves memory. Hence useful in Alzheimer's disease, dementia and in students seeking memory improvement. 9. Psychiatric disorders: Brahmi is Unmada vinashini - useful in psychiatric disorders Shankhapushpi is explained as Unmada, Bhutaghna - useful in psychiatric disorders Manasarogahrut - useful in mental disorders, depression Summing up: Ashwagandha, Brahmi and Shankhapushpi together are: Very useful in improving memory, concentration, strength, immunity, muscle strength, to promote life expectancy, to delay aging and to treat irritable bowel syndrome, weak digestion strength, mania, schizophrenia and depression Moderately useful in - wound healing, cold, cough, asthma, to improve digestion strength, Somewhat useful - to improve sleep, voice, speech and to treat epilepsy, fever, vomiting. How to take? There are many medicines with these three herbs together. For example, [Shankhapushpi syrup](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2019/08/12/shankhpushpi-syrup/) [ / Bravobol syrup](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2020/08/25/bravobol-syrup/) / [Brahmi Power Granules](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2016/09/30/brahmi-power-granules-uses-ingredients-dose-side-effects/)- Adult dose is 1 teaspoon once or twice a day after food with milk or water. [Divya 1 at night after food. All these contain the above three, along with many other ingredients. Please consult a doctor before taking any of the above products. Side effects: Ashwagandha, in some people may cause diarrhea / constipation, stomach upset or anxiety. Brahmi in some people increases alertness and hence, not useful for some people with insomnia. Ashwagandha with milk, Honey Can Ashwagandha be taken along with Milk and Honey? Dr JV Hebbar Ashwagandha with milk makes sense. In preparing Ashwagandha ghee (called Ashwagandha ghrita), this herb is mixed with milk and ghee and cooked to prepare the ghee. This remedy is useful for children to gain healthy weight and to improve nutrition and immunity. There is another remedy where, Ashwagandha is cooked with milk and then a little ghee is added and this remedy is used for treating female infertility and to improve chances of conception. [Learn about this remedy here with video](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2012/07/17/ayurvedic-ashwagandha-home-remedy-for-conception-for-women/) For those seeking improvement in nutrition, immunity, muscle strength, sexual wellness and weight, for those seeking relief from stress, extreme fatigue, decreased quality of sleep, then one teaspoon of Ashwagandha is usually advised along with a cup of milk. Ashwagandha with honey is also a famous remedy. Honey has scraping quality (lekhana). Ashwagandha with honey can decrease cholesterol and fat deposits in the body. It helps in weight loss. For people suffering from cough and cold, this combination is useful. Honey is drying in nature. Ashwagandha improves muscle strength and can burn fat. So, those seeking burning fat and cellulite deposits in the body can take 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of Ashwagandha with 1 - 2 teaspoons of honey. One can make a paste of it and swallow it with cold water, usually advised after food. Read: [Honey Qualities, Usage, Remedies, Ayurvedic Benefits](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2010/03/25/health-benefits-of-honey-what-original-ayurvedic-text-book-says/) Ashwagandha with milk and honey together, is slightly different and unnatural. There is no rule that these three cannot be taken together, but it looks a bit uncommon. Ashwagandha with milk is nourishing. Ashwagandha with honey is cleansing, detoxifying. But Ashwagandha with milk and honey? What is your intention of mixing milk and honey? An argument can be made that sweetness of honey masks the bitterness of Ashwagandha. I do not see any problem in making this combination. I just do not see a specific purpose or use case.

Ashwagandha and Gokshura powders 2 grams each can be boiled with milk and consumed or can be taken directly with milk or water. Ashwagandha and Gokshura in tablet form can be taken together, based on your doctor's advised. Ashwagandha with Alcohol I consume alcohol at night, occasionally. My doctor has advised Ashwagandha. When is the best time to take it? Dr JV Hebbar Usually any Ayurvedic medicine should not be consumed along with alcohol. Ashwagandha with alcohol can cause high level stomach irritation and burning sensation. Two possible solutions: 1. One hour before alcohol schedule, have a fruit like an apple or sweet lime, take Ashwagandha. This will benefit liver and the mental health. Here, after taking Ashwagandha, its medicinal chemicals would have entered the bloodstream and this could decrease the alcohol side effects. 2. After having alcohol and dinner, wait for an hour and then take Ashwagandha. This relieves stress and improves the quality of sleep and will also reduce the ill effects of alcohol on health. The negative point about this is, you may be too drunk to take Ashwagandha. Ashwagandha with Shilajit Can Ashwagandha be taken along with Shilajit? Dr JV Hebbar Yes, but there are some ifs and buts. Ashwagandha and Shilajat - both are extremely nourishing in nature. They both improve muscle and nerve strength and help to burn fat at the same time. So, this combination is useful for losing weight, for people who regularly do Yoga, gym, sports people etc. Both are natural aphrodisiacs. So, men can use it for improving performance.

This is the reason, it is an ingredient of [Chandraprabha Vati](https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=MA5gy&m=3fC6FpGatlXmwtK&b=EfKPwhVqtsdwkWxtmqe6iA) - a famous medicine used for treating urinary tract disorders.

Few concerns: Extreme hotness - this combination can increase warmth and burning sensation and heartburn. In some people, it can worsen anxiety. In women: There is no blanket ban on Shilajit for women. It is a false notion. It is very useful nearing menopause, when bone strength declines, fatigue, mood swings are to be addressed. But it is usually not recommended for a very long period of more than 3 months, continuously in women. Usage period: Like any other medicine, however good it may be, I would not recommend this for more than 2-3 months. After a month of its use, I would be intending to gradually decrease the dose before finally stopping it. How to take it? Tablets and capsules of both are available. General dose is 1 tablet of each, once a day, as per your doctor's advice. Combination in medicines "}
