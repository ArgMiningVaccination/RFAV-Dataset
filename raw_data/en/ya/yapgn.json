Those with mutations in the angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor binding doma in (RBD) are associated with increased transmission and severity. In this study, we developed both antibody quantification and functional assays. Analyses of both COVID-19 convalescent and diagnostic cohorts strongly support the use of RBD antibody leve ls as an excellent surrogate to biochemical neutralization activities. Data further revealed that the samples from mRNA vaccina ted individuals had a median of 17 times higher RBD antibody levels a nd a similar degree of increased neutralization activities against RBD-ACE2 binding than those from natural infections. Our data showed that N501Y RBD had 5-fold higher ACE2 binding than the original variant. While antisera from naturally infected subjects had substantially reduced neutraliza tion ability agai nst N501Y RBD, all blood samples from vaccinated i ndividuals were highly effective in neutralizing it. Thus, our data indicates that mRNA vaccinati on is far more effective than natural immunity in generating highly effective neutralizing anti bodies. It further suggests a potential need to maintain high RBD antibody levels to control the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Introduction Humoral immunity against SARS -CoV-2 can be achieved with either natural infection or vaccination. Most people who had COVID-19 de veloped sustained serological responses1-4. While the antibodies can be detected in most SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, the antibody levels are highly variable5. On the other hand, some of the cu rrent assays have limitations in detecting either ci rculating antibodies5 or neutralizing activities2-4 in those individuals. In one instance, those with IgG antibody re sults were semi-quantitative and those with titers of less than 3 1:320 would fail to produce dete ctable neutralizing activities3. There are many studies reporting reinfection by SARS-CoV-26-9, whereas in some of the studies, the neutralizing antibodies were shown to have a protective role 10,11. In one recent report, indivi duals who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive from prior exposure had an estimated 80% reducti on of subsequent risk for reinfection12. Several late stage clinical studies de monstrated the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines13-17. The mRNA-based vaccines, in particular , have achieved remarkable clinical efficacy in protecting the vaccina ted subjects against COVID-1913-15. A previous phase 1 study showed that neutralizing activity elicited by Moderna's mRNA vacci ne was in the upper half of that of convalescent plasma specimens18. There are a few urgent issues to be addressed. First, it is important to understand the differences in specific antibodies and neutralization activities between the vaccine acquired a nd natural immunity against SA RS-CoV-2 infections. This information would help to deter mine the need to vaccinate agai nst SARS-CoV-2 in those with natural immunity, especially against the variants. Second, as there are many SARS-CoV-2 vaccines already administered to the general population, it is impor tant to determine and monitor antibody levels and neutralization act ivities to estimate the durations of protection. While clinical trial outcome is the gold standard for efficacy, these vaccine tria ls take a long time to execute and are subject to extensive variations, especi ally with emerging and different SARS-CoV-2 variants, which make comparisons difficult. Thus , effective surrogates woul d be helpful for their assessment. Third, due to emergi ng SARS-CoV-2 variants , many with increased affinity to the cell surface ACE2 receptor, it is important to adapt the vacci nation strategy accordingly for optimal protection against COVID-19. The spike (S) protein of the vi rus binds to ACE2 through its RBD20,22, which is becoming a key research area for public health due to its roles in de veloping neutralizing antibodies23, and 4 its mutations in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants spreading rapidly worldwide. The first of such variants with a D614G mutation at the spike protein was shown to increase viral titer and infectivity, yet it was effectively neutralized by antisera24. More recently, a UK variant B.1.1.7 was implicated to cause a surge in COVID-19 cases25. It had a mutation N501Y in the RBD region that is directly involved in contacting ACE226. N501Y and two othe r mutations in Brazil (P1)28. The N501Y was of particul ar interest due to its presence in all three variants and its unique ro le in mediating a direct contact with ACE2 receptor. Mutational scanning studies of SARS-C oV-2 RBD domain in yeast showed the N501F mutation resulted in several fold increased affinity to ACE226. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV- 2, the N501Y mutation emerged and conferred increased affinity towards mouse ACE2 receptor29. While several recent studies suggested of v accine antisera that bi nd and neutralize this B.1.1.7 variant30-33, there is a need to investigate the antibody levels afte r vaccination and protection against infections. With over 150 million COVID-19 cases worldwide by May 2021, and difference vaccines availabl e, it is also important to unde rstand the differences between vaccination and natural immunity, between vaccines, and to better predict the ability of acquired immunity to protect the subjects against emerging variants. Thus, we chose the original and N501Y RBD that appeared in B.1.1.7 and other SARS-CoV-2 variants fo r the investigation. Results mRNA vaccination induces higher anti-RBD anti body levels than natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 5 Many of the current serology tests for RBD have limitations on sensitivity, dynamic range, and unprecise or semi-quantitative3,34,35. To accurately determine the levels of anti-RBD antibody in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, we developed an electrochemiluminescence- based serology assay for excepti onal sensitivity and dynamic range . The assay is based on two antibody-antigen interact ions for maximum specifi city (Fig. recombinant RBD from transiently transfected 293 ce lls and labeled it with either biotin for antibody capture or ruthenium (Ru)-tag for antibody D003, were used the calibrator (D00 3) and the reference standard (D001) for accurate quan tification. Extraordinary large lin ear quantification range of at least 1,000-fold was achieved with our assa y (Supplementary Fig. 1). The assay was subsequently simplified from a three-step to a single incubation step without the loss of performance (Supplementary Fig. 2). In compared with a commercially available spike S1 protein antibody test from Ort ho Diagnostics, our RBD antibody test showed strong correlation with it ( r = 0.679, P < 0.0001) (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, our assay exhibited a greater linear dynamic range with COVID se ra samples at lower concentrations and improved sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, our RBD antibody test is quantitative, and has exceptional sensitivity and a larg e dynamic range. The clinical validation study of the test was performed using 41 serum samples from 33 convalescent donors with documented history of COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 1) and from 171 healthy donors collected before January 2020 . None of the convalescent donors received COVID vaccines. The assay is exce ptionally specific, as all negative samples were below of the lower limit of quantification (N = 171). All convalescent donors were positive in the test (N = 41; Fig. 1B). The median RBD an tibody level is 1.3 ug/mL with a large 170-fold range for RBD 6 antibody levels in this small group of convalescent samples (r ange, 27-4,800 ng/mL; Fig. 1B). Similar levels of RBD antibody were detected in blood samples taken from those who went to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinic al Center for COVID-19 tests and were SARS- CoV-2 serology test positive (N = 39, P = 0.973, Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the blood from donors who completed two doses of mRNA vaccines (Pfi zer or Moderna, N = 28, Supplemental Table 2) had much higher RBD antibody levels than that of the c onvalescent group (Fig. 1B, P < 0.0001). The median level of RBD antibody for the mRNA vaccine group was 22.3 ug/mL, which was 16.8-fold higher than 1.3 ug/mL of the convalescent group. We examined the RBD antibody levels of th e vaccine group and tim e association and noticed a correlation ( r = -0.522, P = 0.004; Fig. 1C). There was a difference in the antibody levels from samples taken within 2 months and at 6 months post second dose ( P = 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 4). In contra st, convalescent sera did not e xhibit a correlative between time and antibody levels, with a median follow- up time of 207 days from the disease onset ( r = 0.234, P = 0.141; Fig. 1D). The analysis of paired samp les from same individu als in the convalescent group showed no change in antibody le vels at two different time points ( P = 0.396), whereas the paring was highly effective ( r = 0.912, P = 0.0007; Supplementary Fig. 5). Hence, the data suggests that the antibody levels of convalescent sera di d not decline signifi cantly for at least 8 months post infection, whereas the ultrahigh RBD antibody le vels achieved with mRNA vaccines could be subject to a more rapid decline. Anti-RBD antibody concentration-dependent neutralization agains t RBD-ACE2 binding with COVID-19 antisera from natural immunity 7 To accurately quantify the ability of the an tisera in neutralizin g RBD and ACE2 binding, we developed an electrochemi luminescence based protein binding assay using recombinant RBD and ACE2 proteins as illustrated in Fig. 2A. Wh en RBD was added to the assay wells, there was an excellent linear relationship between added free RBD and the luminescence signal from the RBD bound to ACE2 ( r2 = 0.99; Fig. 2B). Therefore, the AC E2 binding assay provides a precise quantification of free RBD capable of binding to AC E2. To clinically validate the sensitivity and specificity of the RBD-ACE2 binding assay, we anal yzed the percentage of inhibition with the 41 COVID-19 convalescent sera and a comparable number of pre-COVID-19 control sera. The results showed that the 41 COVID-19 sera had a significantly higher inhi bitory effect against RBD-ACE2 binding ( P < 0.0001; Fig. 2C). The median levels of inhibition were 93% for the convalescent sera and 7% for th e control sera. When comparing the convalescent sera with the negative controls, the antibody neut ralization assay showed high sens itivity and specificity, with an area under curve (AUC) in Receiver Operat or Characteristic (ROC) analysis of 0.986 (Supplementary Fig. 6), indicative of high sens itivity and sp ecificity of the assay. The neutralization assay further demonstrated similar consis tency when compared with the RBD antibody test using paired samples, with a correlation coef ficient for pairing r = 0.952 that was highly significant ( P = 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 7). Thus, not only the RBD-ACE2 receptor neutralization assay has excellent sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 antisera, but also is precise with paired convales cent serum samples taken at different time points. From the eight donors with paired samples, it is also apparent that those with high anti- RBD levels (>1,000 ng/mL) showed stronger neutraliza those with low anti-RBD levels (<100 ng/mL) showed much lo wer neutralization activity (Supplementary Fig. 7). The complete analysis of COVID-19 convale scent sera for neutraliz ation activity against 8 RBD-ACE2 binding was The cated that the neutra lization assay for RBD- of the calibrator monocl onal antibody D003, which bound to RBD well, yet exhibited no neutralizat ion activity against RBD-ACE2 binding (Fig. 2D, data point shown with an arrow). As expect ed, there was an association between the anti- RBD antibody level and neutraliza tion activity against nding (correlative analysis, 0.0001; Fig. 2D). Further, the data demonstr ated an extraordinary antibody dose-dependent neutralization activity using the nonlinear regression model with r2 = 0.928. The dilution adjusted (6-fold) and estimated 50% i nhibitory concentration inhibition (IC 50), based on the analyses of 41 samples, was 69 ng/mL. RBD antibody concentra tion-dependent inhibition of RBD-ACE binding was confirmed with the s econd group of diagnostic serum samples (Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, there is a strong RBD antibody concentration-dependent neutralization activity agains t ACE2 binding with two sets of COVID-19 antisera. N501Y RBD significantly increased ACE2 binding and attenuated the neutralization ability of COVID-19 convalescent antisera To investigate the ability of antisera from convalescent patient to recognize the B.1.1.7 N501Y variant, we purified this mutant RBD prot ein and labeled it with the Ru-tag for electro- chemiluminescence assay. We derive d a scheme to compare the levels of antibodies against either the WT or N501Y RBD in the same samp les (Supplementary Fig. 9). The results with the convalescent donor blood sample s showed strong linear corr elation between antibodies recognizing both the WT and the N501Y proteins ( r2 = 0.927). Best-fit ysis 3A), suggesti ng the antisera bind both the WT and N501Y RBD proteins equally well. 9 We further analyzed the ability of COVID- 19 convalescent antisera to neutralize the binding of the N501Y RBD to ACE2, as in the case of the WT RBD. The results showed the specific neutralization of the an tisera from COVID-19 convalescent donors when compared with that of the pre-COVID-19 donor sera samples ( P < 0.0001; Fig. 3B). The neutralization assay against RBD-N501Y and ACE2 binding was both ve ry sensitive and specific with AUC of ROC analysis of 0.948 (Supplementary Fig. 10). There was further a st rong linear correlation between neutralization activ ity against the WT and the N501Y RBD in ACE2 binding with a slope of 1.03 (r2 = 0.896, n = 41; Supplementary Fig. 11). Thus , COVID-19 antisera neutralize WT and N501Y RBD with an equal potency. However, we observed dramatic differences in the ability of the WT and N501Y RBD to bind ACE2. Results from five consecutive e xperiments showed that N501Y RBD bound to ACE2 at an average of 5.1-fold higher ra te than the WT RBD (range, 4.1 to 6.1-fold). A representative result is show n (Supplementary Fig. 12). Thus, it can be concluded that N501Y RBD has a much higher affinity to ACE2. We further examined the absolute level of the WT and the N501Y RBD bound to ACE2 in the presence of COVID-19 antisera. While the antisera neutralized both the WT and N501Y RBD at a simil ar rate, there was four times (slope = 3.99, N = 41) more N501Y RBD bound to ACE2 in the pres ence of the convalescen t antisera (Fig. 3C). This was further confirmed with the COVID-19 di agnostic sera (Supplementary Fig. 13). As the results of increased ACE2 binding affinity due to N501Y mutation, there were far more absolute amount of N501Y RBD bound to ACE2 than the WT in the presence of COVID-19 convalescent antisera ( P < 0.0001, N = 41; Fig. 3D). Thus, natural immunity from the original SARS-CoV-2 infections could not consistently provide suff icient neutralization ag ainst N501Y RBD variant from binding to the cellular ACE2 receptor. 10 mRNA vaccination results in much more effect ive neutralization than natural immunity against N501Y RBD from binding to ACE2 To further determine the difference betw een natural immunity and mRNA vaccination, we selected five samples th at had median levels of an ti-RDB antibody of each group, and performed dilutions and neutra lization studies agai nst N501Y binding to ACE2. The results showed that dilution factors to IC 50 were 25.8 and 402.0 for convalescent and mRNA vaccinated blood samples (Fig. 4A, 4B), a difference of 15.6-fold. This di fference in neut ralization is consistent with that the mRNA vaccinated blood had 16.8-fold higher anti-RBD antibodies than the convalescent blood (Fig. 1B). Thus, the mR NA vaccinated blood is fa r more effective in neutralizing the high affinity N 501Y RBD from binding to ACE2. The mRNA vaccinated plasma is far more e ffective in neutralizing N501Y RBD against ACE2 binding when compared to convalescent mples. There were 31.7% retained over 50% N501Y RBD and ACE2 binding in the presence of convalescent samples, in contrast to a maximum residual binding of 12.6% in the presen ce of mRNA vaccinated samples, a difference that is highly significant ( P < 0.0001; Fig. 4C). Detailed exam ination of antibody concentration dependent neutralization revealed strong co rrelations between RBD antibody levels and neutralization ac tivities for both sample groups ( r2 = 0.926 and r2 = 0.823; Fig. 4D). Thus, the substantially elevated antibody levels in the mRNA vaccine group appeared to be the primary driver of the neutralization activities. Simila rly, improved efficacy with the vaccinated blood was also observed against the WT RBD and ACE2 binding (Supplementary Fig. 14). Therefore, the data indicates the insufficienc ies of natural immunity, and th e superiority of mRNA vaccination 11 in neutralizing RBD and ACE2 binding, particularly against SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased affinity to their cell receptor. Discussion In this study, we showed that mRNA vacci nated blood donors have a median of 17 times higher RBD antibody levels when compared with those who became seropositive due to prior COVID-19. Our results indicated an exceptiona l strong association between high RBD antibody levels in and the ability to biochemically neutralize RBD binding to the cellular ACE2 receptor. The N501Y mutation, while did not alter the ne utralizing antibody bindin g, presented with a 5- fold greater affinity to ACE2, which resulted in a drastically redu ced ability of COVID-19 convalescent antisera to neutra lize its ACE2 binding. Fortunately, the vaccinated blood samples, due to their much elevated RBD antibody levels, we re far more effective in neutralizing both the WT and N501Y RBD from binding to ACE. With an average of 16-fold greater potency than convalescent blood, the vaccinated blood samples were more than sufficient to compensate for the 5-fold increased affinity of N501Y RBD, resulting in the highl y effective inhibition of both the WT and N501Y RBD fro m binding to ACE2. With over 150 million people infected w ith SARS-CoV-2 by May 2021, one of the critical questions going forward is whether the na tural immunity would be sufficient to prevent future reinfections, particularly by more inf ectious variants. N501Y RBD is central to the investigation as it is the key driver to increa sed affinity to cell ACE2 receptors. While the reinfections were seen with the original SARS-C oV-2, our results indicate d that the antisera from natural immunity would be less effective against vari ants such as B.1.1.7 due to its increased affinity to ACE2. Thus, many individuals acquired immunity through prior SARS-CoV-2 12 infections would not be sufficien t to prevent reinfections by new variants, especially in those with low RBD antibody levels. Our findings would bring advances in the understanding of different vaccines and their abilities to fight off differen t SARS-CoV-2 variants. There ar e multiple vaccines tested in various geographic region with different prev alence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. In one study, mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 exhibited 97% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in Israel dominated by B.1.1.7 variant36. Our study showed that not only the mRNA vaccinated plasma has 17-fold higher antibodies than the convalescent antisera, but also 16 time mo re potential in neutralizing RBD and ACE2 bindi ng of both the original and N 501Y mutation that was present in the above studies. Thus, the increased antibody levels were sufficient to compensate for the increase virulence due to highe r ACE2 binding of this variant. In another study, an adenovirus- based vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 exhibi ted 55% clinical activity in the UK16 where B.1.1.7 was prevalent. A plausible explanat ion would be that this vaccine37 and another adenovirus vaccine38 only produced antibody levels that were comparab le to COVID-19 convalescent blood. Thus, the clinical experience with B.1.1.7 suggests that higher levels of RBD antibody would be required to protect the subjects from infections. In the third example, a nanoparticle vaccine NVX- CoV2373 was only 50% effective in South Africa dominated by B.1.35117. The NVX-CoV2373 was be able to induce a 4-fold increase over convalescent sera39. Thought the vaccination works against the difficult B.1.351 varian t, there might be a room for further improvement by achieving higher antibody levels. While there was no trend of d ecreasing RBD antibodies in t hose with natural immunity for up to 9 months, our data reveal ed a large variation of their leve ls that were stable in given individuals. In comparison, while mRNA vaccines resulted in much higher RBD antibody levels 13 than natural infections, this hype r-elevated level appeared to be less stable with samples at 6 months past the second dose. While our work is still very preliminary, it would be interesting to test more cases and over longer duration to see how fast the an tibody levels would decline over time, particular in those with hyper-elevated antibody levels. Likely many other surrogate biomarkers fo r a medical intervention on a disease, our in vitro receptor-binding neutralization has its limitations. There ar e factors that cannot be represented in this model. Thes e include the 3D structures of the viral spike protein and ACE2, the surface density of both molecules, the proce ss of viral entry into the cells and more. In addition, the mutation profiles of the variants are drastically simp lified in our model. Other RBD mutations, K417N/T and E484K, either alone or in combinations, have not been evaluated in this study. Moreover, the IC 50 values that we obtained with in vitro RBD-ACE binding assay, while biochemically informative, is not equivalent to an in vivo protective level. Besides, the quantification of RBD antibody leve ls of antisera is based on the calibration of a monoclonal antibody for consistency and universal adaptabilit y, where the polyclonal nature of the antisera may be simplified. However, the RBD and ACE2 binding is perhaps the mo st crucial step for early viral pathogenesis, and the RBD variants are of the most c oncerns for current global health. Our data showed that the protein biochemical neutralization assay is a sensitivity, specificity, quantitative, and reliable biomarker to determin e the neutralizing ability of antisera against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. It could be used immediately as a surrogate for the clinical investigations of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the protection either by natural immunity or vaccination. 14 Methods Patient or blood donor samples Serum samples were collected at convales cent donors with prior documented COVID-19 under the NIH clinical protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov identifi er: NCT04360278). A total of 41 samples were prospectively collected from 33 donors who had confirmed COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 1). An additional were co llected under the same protocol from 28 people who never had COVID-19 but completed two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vacci nes, either Pfizer or Moderna (Supplementary Table 2). All these samples were and processed at a single site within 4 hrs of blood draw in compliance of Good Clinical Practice. The samples were collected using the Institutional Review Board-approved protocol at the US National Institutes of Health with informed consent. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations . Patient samples were de-identified and tested in an unbiased and blinded fashion. Additional samples from 38 patients were obtained from Department of Laboratory Medicine of NIH as diagnostics samples. The samples were selected based on the positive diagnoses and no personal or medical informati on was made available at any time for this research. RBD protein expression and purification Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-bi (RBD) pr oteins contained a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) signal pep tide followed by amino acids 318-529 of spike (wild type or N501Y mutant) with a HRV-3C prot ease site and a C-termin al His(8)-streptavidin binding peptide tag. Proteins we re expressed in Expi293 cells (ThermoFisher) for 96 hours at 15 32oC and purified as previously described35,40. Final proteins were validated by mass spectrometry and size excl usion chromatography. RBD antibody assay th either or MDS ruthenium-tag as RBD fo r calibration (D003) and reference standard (D001) were acquired from Sino Biological (Wayne, PA, USA). For serology assay to determine the antibody levels of hu man sera, 2.5 uL of serum samp les were diluted with diluent to 25 uL, mixed with 25 uL of 1 ug/mL biotin-R and 1 ug/mL RBD (detection). All reagents st reptavidin-coated assay plates (Meso-Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD, USA). Bo th calibrator and reference standard were added in the place of sera. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 hr with constant shaking. After three washes with 150 uL of wa sh buffer, 150 uL of 2X read buffer was added, followed by reading with a Meso-Sca le QuickPlex SQ120 within 5 min. Neutralization assay The RBD proteins were labeled with MD S ruthenium-tag as described above. The recombinant human ACE2 (aa 18-740) was expr essed in NS0 purified, biotinylated (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, US A). The streptavidin-coa ted was used for the assay, on which 25 uL of 1 ug/mL biotin-ACE2 we re added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. At the same time, serum neutraliza tion was carried out with 60 ng/mL ruthenium-tag RBD mixed with 5 uL of human sera a total of 30 uL (1:6 dilution of sera) and incubated at 37oC for 1 hr. They were then added to the biotin -ACE2 assay plate for a further 1 hr incubation. 16 This is followed by the addition of read buffe r and QuickPlex reading. Standard calibration curves were obtained with diluted ruthenium- tag RBD starting from 200 ng/mL at the highest level without incuba ting with sera. Statistical analyses Data analyses were performed using GraphP ad Prism 8. Mann-Whitn ey non-parametric t test was used to compare results of two unrel ated groups such as the RBD antibody levels of diagnostic and convalescent sample s. Paired t test was perfor med in case of multiple blood samples from the same convalescen t donors over time, to evaluate the changes in antibody levels and in neutralization abilities. Correlative analysis was performed to evalua te the association of medical parameters, such as time to disease onset, age of disease onset, duration, and sex, w ith the levels of antibody. It was also performed to determine the assay specificity in the serum neutralization assay between the COVID-19 antisera and the pre-COVI D-19 controls. ROC analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of neutralization assays against the WT and the N501Y RBD proteins. Four parameter logistic re gression model provided by Meso-Scale Discovery Workbench 4.0 was used to determine the concentrations of anti-RBD antibodies in sera. Linear regression analysis with four parameters was performed to determine the linear ity of both antibody assay and neutralization assay. It is al so used to demonstrate the linear relationship in the activities of antisera in recognizing and in neut ralizing both the WT and the N 501Y RBD. It was further used to determine the relative ratios of these two pr oteins in binding to ACE2 in the absence and presence of COVID-19 sera from convalescent donors or diagnostic patients. 17 A nonlinear regression model with variable slope and four pa rameters was used to curve fit inhibitory dose-response data to determine the IC 50 values for the neutralization of RBD in ACE2 binding. As all samples were diluted 6-fold pr ior to the test, the resu lts in the text were adjusted accordingly from those in the figures. References 1 Gudbjartsson, D. F. et al.
