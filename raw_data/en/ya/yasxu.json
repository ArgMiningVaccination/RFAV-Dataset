Testimonials Meet Kim Grace Founder of Grace Wellness Center After working in traditional western medicine for over 30 years, I began to awaken to my multidimensional healing abilities in 2010. This awakening opened me to opportunities to intertwine my spiritual healing skills into the 1:1 client therapy practice. It was in this shift that I was witnessing a deeper healing in my client's wellness. This led me to shift my focus to mind, body and spirit, and less on insurance visits, and solely physical plane healing. After years of witnessing the limitations of traditional medicine practices and clients not getting well, it became obvious that I needed to create a place for people to come for holistic healing. "}
