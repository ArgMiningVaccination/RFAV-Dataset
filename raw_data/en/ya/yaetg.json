It is not a religion, and does not conflict with any religious tradition. Shamanism is a way of life. Shamanism is about direct revelation. It is a belief that everything and everyone is connected through the sacred web of life. Everything is Spirit. During a Shamanic Journey, a Shaman will go into altered states of consciousness and travel to non-ordinary reality, to retrieve information for the greater good and healing. Shamanic healing focuses on the spiritual side of issues and illness. It is about coming home to oneself and restoring power back to the individual so they can walk in their truth and authenticity.

Medicine Wheel Ceremony Medicine wheel - manifestation & healing The Medicine Wheel has been used throughout history to assist in manifestation and healing. Everything seen and unseen has its place on the Wheel. The Medicine Wheel contains many points and teaches about birth, growth, death and rebirth. There is no beginning or end. What happens on one part of the Medicine Wheel impacts the entire Medicine Wheel. We focus on starting in the East and work our way, in order, to the South, West, North and Center. Working with the four directions is a great way to deepen our connection to the cycles of our life and universe. "}
