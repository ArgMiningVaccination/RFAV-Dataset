This CHNA repor t provides an overview of the process and methods used to identify and prioritize significant health needs across SMMC 's service area. Special attention has been given to the needs of vulnerable populations, unmet he alth needs or gaps in services, and input from the community. The purpose of this CHNA is to identify and prioritize signific ant health needs of the community served by SMMC. The priorities identified in this report help t o guide the hospital's community health improvement programs and community benefit activities, a s well as its collaborative efforts with other organizations that share a mission to improv e health. This CHNA Report meets requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Car e Act (and in California of Senate Bill 697) that notforpr ofit hospitals conduct a commun ity health needs assessment at least once every three years. S MMC partnered with Conduent Heal thy Communities Institute (HCI) to conduct this CHNA. Findings from this report will be used to identify and develop efforts to improve the health and quality of life of residents in SMMC's community. Community Definition SMMC is located in Long Beach, CA. Long Beach is the thirtynin th largest city in the nation and the seventh largest city in Calif ornia. Long Beach is the secon d largest city within the Greater Los Angeles area. It is home to approximately 500,000 people an d one of the most ethnically diverse communities in the United States with a strong sense of community and unique neighborhoods. SMMC also serve s the surrounding communities of Carson, Paramount and Bellflower. While a few of the co mmunities enjoy a higher stand ard of living, the majority of the communities served have greater needs. To determine its servic e area, SMMC takes into account the zip codes of inpatients from the hospital, the most recent CHNA and long standing community programs and partnerships. The Long Beach Collaborative SMMC is part of the Long Beach Co llaborative that convened HCI to conduct their CHNAs for this cycle. This Collaborative c onsists of SMMC, the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services, Memorial Care and The Children's Clinic in Long Beach, California. These entities worked together in conjunction with HCI to perform the essential functions and activities to complete their CHNAs. For instance, their priorit ization methods and results occurred together, bringing conti nuity between the different me dical groups and their efforts. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 5 In compliance with IRS regulations, SMMC's previous CHNA was ma de available to the public via: https://www.dignityhealth.org/soca l/locations/stmarymedical/abo utus/community benefits. To date, SMMC received no pub lic comments regarding their pr evious CHNA. Assessment Summary Secondary Data The secondary data used in thi s assessment includes a comprehen sive set of over 100 community health and quality of life indicators covering over 2 0 topic areas. Indicator values for the service area's zip codes were compared to the city, county, and other zip codes and counties in California and nationwide to compare health topics and relative areas of need. Other considerations for health areas of need included trends o ver time, Healthy People 2020 targets, and disparities by age, gender and race/ethnicity. Primary Data The needs assessment was further informed using two forms of pr imary data\u2014key informant interviews with community members who have a fundamental unders tanding of health needs in SMMC's service area, representi ng the broad interests of the community, and from focus groups with key individuals in the Long Beach community. These primary data processes required much facilitation and c oordination to engage key commu nity members and capture meaningful information to inform this CHNA. These methods sough t and engaged community leaders, nonhealth profession als, and organizations serving th e community at large, vulnerable populations, and/or populations with unmet health needs. See Appendix E for a list of key informants and stakeholders who provided their input for this C HNA. Data Synthesis After obtaining and reviewing the results of the secondary and primary data, HCI synthesized the data by consolidating the results into a Venn Diagram. This Venn Diagram showcased the overlapping areas of need that resulted across the key informan t interviews, focus groups and prioritization survey. Reviewing t hese results may help SMMC de termine key issues to address in its future Implementation Strategy. Summary of Findings Through an examination of the secondary data across the Long Be ach area, the Collaborative identified health needs that would be examined more closely in this CHNA process. These health needs are listed in the following table: St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 6 Long Beach Collabora tive - Health Needs Access to Health Services Chronic Diseases Economic Insecurity Environment Exercise, Nutrition & Weight Food Insecurity Housing and Homelessness Mental Health Oral Health/Dental Care Pregnancy and Birth Outcomes Preventive Practices Public Safety Sexually Transmitted Infections Substance Abuse Prioritization To assess these priorities to a greater extent, the Collaborati ve, in conjunction with HCI developed an online prioritizati on survey to obtain feedback fr om key community members in the Long Beach area. This process was successful with measuring the impact and risk of the significant health issues ident ified by the Collaborative. The criteria for prioritization included to what extent an issu e: Impacts many people in the community Significantly impacts subgroups i n the community (gender, race/ ethnicity, LGBTQ, etc.) Has inadequate existing resources in the community Has high risk for disease or death The results of this prioritization process are discussed in mor e detail later in this report, including the scoring of measures with the greatest need based on these prioritization results. When developing its Implementation Strategy, SMMC will review t hese health issues and consider potential strategies to improve the health outcomes an d quality of measures in the Long Beach area. This CHNA also captured many resources (in Appendix F ) that are potentially available to address the significant health needs identified in this report.

St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 9 Evaluation of Progre ss Since Prior CHNA The CHNA process should be viewed as a threeyear cycle. An imp ortant part of that cycle is revisiting the progress made on priority topics from previous C HNAs. By reviewing the actions taken to address priority areas a nd evaluating the impact of th ese actions in the community, an organization can better focus and target its efforts during the next CHNA cycle. Figure 2. CHNA Process Priority Health Needs and Impact from Prior CHNA SMMC established priority healt h areas during its previous CHNA . Those priorities and their impact are detailed in Table 2. Table 2. SMMC's Priority Areas from Prior CHNA Priority Area Population Impact Example Access to care By providing free and lowcost health care, vulnerable and underserved populations are able to better access services reducing their barriers to services. The Family Clinic of Long B each has been providing primary care to the Long Beach community for over 25 years. The Family Clinic serves as the hub of medical services for our group of clinics, serving as the medical home for adult patients seeki ng primary care services or referrals to specialists in our clinic network. The clinic focuses on internal medicine with additional services such as Travel Clinic, Coumadin Clinic, Diabetes Education Program and Specialty Medicine. Chronic diseases Chronic diseases incl ude HIV/AIDS, asthma, cancers, heart disease and high blood CARE Program is a multidisci plinary HIV care and support project.

By providing health education and selfmanagement workshops, individuals will learn techniques to better manage their conditions leading to reduced emergency room visits and a better quality of life. integrated range of high qua lity medical, dental, health, and psychosocial services to a heavily impacted population of lowincome men, women, and children living with HIV; and for those at high risk for acquiring HIV in the Long Beach, South Bay and South Los Angeles Counties. Obesity and diabetes Being overweight is a precursor to many chronic diseases, includi ng diabetes. Obesity and diabetes greatly impact the SMMC service area and are diagnosed most frequently among the region's lowincome communities of color. Chronic Disease SelfManag ement Program (CDSMP): Based on the Stanford Model, this proven 6week self help program is offered to t he community. The goal of the program is to teach participants the skills they need to know to manage their chro nic condition(s) on a daily basis to achieve the maximum quality of physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. Preventive care Effective and feasible prevention is possible. There is an opportunity to intervene at the prevention level and impact overall health outcomes. Prevention efforts include those that target individua ls, communities and policy efforts. Every Woman Counts Cancer P rotection Program offers mammography screening services to women age 40+ and cervical screenings to women age 21+ who are uninsured/underinsured and of low or no income. Pregnancy and birth outcomes Engaging in early prenat al care is important because health risks to both the mother and infant can be detected early. The Mary Hilton Family Health Center has OB, perinatal and pediatric services: The clinics provide comprehensive services to serve mothers and children from pregnancy through young adulthood. Services include: Benefits assistance Comprehensive Prenatal Services Program (CPSP) High risk care Va ccines Care for diabetic expecting mothers SMMC anticipates that actions tak en to address significant heal th needs will help achieve the following: improve health knowledge, behaviors, and status; increase access to needed a nd beneficial care; and help create conditions that support good health. SMMC is committed to measuring a nd evaluating key initiatives. SMMC creates and makes public an annual Community Benefit Report and Plan and evaluate s impact by setting priorities for its community health program in a triennial Community Healt h Needs Assessment. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 11 Methodology Overview Two types of data were used in this assessment: primary and sec ondary data. Primary data are data that have been collected for the purposes of this communit y assessment. Primary data were obtained through a communi ty survey and key informant inte rviews. Secondary data are health indicator data that have already been collected by publi c sources such as government health departments. Each type of data was analyzed using a uniq ue methodology. Findings were organized by health topics and then synthesized for a comp rehensive overview of the health needs in SMMC's service area. Secondary Data Sources & Analysis Secondary data used for this asse ssment were collected and anal yzed from HCI's community indicator database. This database, maintained by researchers an d analysts at HCI, includes over 100 community indicators from at least 15 state and national da ta sources. HCI carefully evaluates sources based on the following three criteria: the so urce has a validated methodology for data collection and analysis ; the source has scheduled, reg ular publication of findings; and the source has data values for small geographic areas or popula tions. Secondary Data Scoring HCI's Data Scoring Tool\u00ae was use d to systematically summarize m ultiple comparisons in order to rank indicators based on highest need. For each indicator, t he community value was compared to a distribution of California and US counties, state and national values, Healthy People 2020, and significant tre nds were noted. These compariso n scores range from 03, where 0 indicates the best outc ome and 3 the worst. Availabilit y of each type of comparison varies by indicator and is dependent upon the data source, comp arability with data collected for other communities, and changes in methodology over time. Th e comparison scores were summarized for each indicator, and indicators were then grouped into topic areas for a systematic ranking of community health needs. Please see Appendix A for further details on the quantitative data scoring method ology as well as secondary data scoring results. Disparities Analysis When a given indicator has data available for subgroups like ra ce/ethnicity, age or gender - and values for these subgroups incl ude confidence intervals - signi ficant differences between the subgroups' value and the overall value can be determined. A sig nificant difference is defined as two values with nonoverlapping confidence intervals. Only sign ificant differences in which the value for a subgroup is worse than the overall value are identi fied. Confidence intervals are not available for all indicators. In these cases, there is not enou gh data to determine if two values are significantly different from each other. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 12 Primary Data Methods & Analysis Community input for SMMC was collected to expand upon the infor mation gathered from the secondary data. Primary data used in this assessment consisted of focus groups and key informant interviews. Focus Groups Long Beach Forward (LBF), a communitybased organization that f ocuses on producing a healthy Long Beach, was selected by the Collaborative to conduct the fo cus groups for this report. The Collaborative provided guidance to LBF on the populations t o engage for this report and potential survey topics, significant health needs for prioritiz ation, and focusgroup questions. From there, LBF designed the foc usgroup protocol, which includ ed a consent form for participation, a 23question survey, and focusgroup facilitati on guide. The Collaborative provided feedback on the protocol which was addressed and incor porated by LBF. Focus groups were conducted throug h six Long Beachbased organi zations or programs, including The LGBTQ Center of Lon g Beach, Long Beach Alliance f or Children with Asthma, Long Beach Department of Health and Hu man Services' Black Infant Hea lth Program, Project Return Peer Support Network at Century Villages at Cabrillo, Rose Park Neighborhood Association, and United Cambodian Community. LBF selected organizational/program partners that would be able to reach two or more vulnerable populations as defined by the Collaborative and that, as a whole, were as representative of the vulnerable populations as possible within the scope of the project. Each organization secured the pa rticipation of 1220 participan ts using the most effective method for their target audience s. Two organizations used a fly er template provided by LBF, while others used word of mouth, targeted outreach and email in vitations. Partners advertised a $20 cash incentive for participants as well as food and inter pretations as needed. Four of the focus groups were conducted in Eng lish, one in Khmer, and one i n Spanish. Qualitative analysis was performed using a vertical inductive a pproach, where all responses and comments by participants were give n at least one descriptive co de. Quantitative analysis was conducted to describe the key ch aracteristics of the focus grou p participants. As shown in Table 3, a total of 91 participants throughout six focus groups participated in the focus groups. Thirtyseven perc ent of the sample were 1844 yea rs old, while the other 63% were 45 years old and older. The largest group included the 64 74 year old group, which represented 23% of the focus gro up sample. The majority of part icipants were women at 66%. In addition, more than half of participants were renters, and t he racial breakdown was roughly distributed across Asians, White, Hispanic/Latinx, and African American/Black. The largest representation of ethnic groups included Cambodians and Hispani c/Latinx, where almost 95% of the Asian population were Cam bodian. The sexual orientation of our participants was primarily straight/heterosexual, representing 68% of the sample . Sixtyfour percent had a household income of less than $40,000.

Twenty key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted by phone from the middle of Ja nuary through early March of 2019. Interviewees who were asked to participate were recognize d as having expertise in public health, special knowledge of community health needs and/or repr esented the broad interest of the community served by the hosp ital, and/or could speak to the needs of medically underserved or vulnerable populat ions. Efforts were made to ide ntify interviewees working in and/or knowledgeable about the c ounties in SMMC's service area. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using the qualitative analytic tool called Dedoose 1. Interview excerpts were coded by relevant topic areas and key h ealth themes. Multiple approaches were used to assess the relative importance of the n eeds discussed in these interviews. Using multiple approa ches allowed the team to revie w and analyze the interview results from several analytical p erspectives. These approaches included: 1) the frequency by which a healt h topic was discussed across all interviews, 2) the frequency by which a topic w as coded alongside the followin g codes\u2014 Barriers/Challenges, Factors of H ealth Issues, Health Prioritie s for Future Efforts, Strategies for Addressing Key I ssues, and Resources/Community A ssets, 3) the frequency by which a topic was mentioned per interviewee. After completing the analysis for these different approaches, f ive health issues showcased themselves to be more prevalent in the KIIs. As shown in Table 5, Housing, Education, Access to Health Services, Economy and Ment al Health scored in the Top 5 for multiple analysis 1 Dedoose Version 8.0.35, web application for managing, analyzin g, and presenting qualit ative and mixed method research data (2018). Los Angeles, CA: Socio Cultural Research C onsultants, LLC www.dedoose.com St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 16 approaches. Thus, these health issues were considered the Top H ealth Needs from the KII process, and they will be referenced later in this report. Table 5.

Although the topics by which data are organized cover a wide range of health and healthrelated areas, data availability varies by health topic. Some topics contain a robust set of secondary data indicators, while others may have a limited numb er of indicators or limited subpopulations covered by those specific indicators. Data scores represent the relativ e community health need accord ing to the secondary data for each topic and should not be considered to be a comprehensive r esult on their own. In addition, these scores reflect the secondary data results for t he population as a whole, and do not represent the health or soci oeconomic need that is much gre ater for some subpopulations. Moreover, many of the secondary d ata indicators included in the findings are collected by survey, and though specific metho ds are used to best represent the population at large, these measures are subject to instabilit y, especially for smaller pop ulations. The analysis of subpopulation disparities is also limited by data availability, where indicator data varies based on the population groups and se rvice areas being analyzed. Race/Ethnic Groupings The secondary data presented in this report derives from multip le sources, which may present race and ethnicity data using dissimilar nomenclature. For cons istency with data sources throughout the report, subpopulat ion data may use different ter ms to describe the same or similar groups of community members. Zip Codes and Zip Code Tabulation Areas This report presents both ZIP Co de and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) data. ZIP or Zone Improvement Plan Codes were crea ted by the U.S. Postal Service to improve mail delivery service. They are based on posta l routes, which factor in deliv eryarea, mail volume and geographic location. They are not designed to be used for stati stical reporting and may change St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 17 frequently. Some ZIP Codes may o nly include P.O. boxes or cover large unpopulated areas. ZCTAs or ZIP Code Tabulation Area s were created by the U.S. Cen sus Bureau and are generalized representations of ZIP Codes that have been assigne d to census blocks. Therefore, ZCTAs are representative of geographic locations of populated a reas. In most cases, the ZCTA will be the same as its ZIP Code. ZCTAs will not necessarily ex ist for ZIP Code areas with only businesses, single or multiple addresses, or for large unpopula ted areas. Since ZCTAs are based on the most recent Census data, they are more stable than ZIP C odes and do not change as frequently. Demographics for this report are sourced from the United States Census Bureau, which presents ZCTA estimates. Tables and figures in the Demogr aphics section of this report reference ZIP Codes in title (f or purposes of familiarity) but show values of ZCTAs. Data from other sources is representative by ZIP Codes and are labeled as such. Prioritization To identify the significant health needs or priorities for the Collaborative CHNAs, each Collaborative agency reviewed the secondary data results for th eir perspective service areas. In collaboration, the Collaborative partners then selected fourtee n health needs that would be reviewed more thoroughly during their CHNA processes. These hea lth needs are listed below. Long Beach Collaborative - Health Needs Access to Health Services Chronic Diseases Economic Insecurity Environment Exercise, Nutrition & Weight Food Insecurity Housing and Homelessness Mental Health Oral Health/Dental Care Pregnancy and Birth Outcomes Preventive Practices Public Safety Sexually Transmitted Infections Substance Abuse Prioritization Process To examine the health needs more closely, the Collaborative and HCI developed an online survey using the results from the secondary data analysis. Afte r key informants completed their interviews, HCI invited them to complete a prioritization surve y to provide more input on the health needs identified by the C ollaborative. Primarily, the pr ioritization survey contained a prioritization matrix and four c riteria by which to rate each n eed. Survey participants scored each issue for each of the criter ia on a scale from 15, with 1 meaning the respondent strongly disagrees to 5 meaning the respondent strongly agrees that the health need meets the criterion. Respondents were also able to select \"Don't Know/Uns ure\" for each health need. The criteria for prioritization included to what extent an issu e: Impacts many people in the community Significantly impacts subgroups i n the community (gender, race/ ethnicity, LGBTQ, etc.) Has inadequate existing resources in the community Has high risk for disease or death St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 18 Completion of the prioritization matrix resulted in numerical s cores for each health need that corresponded to how well each hea lth need met the criteria for prioritization. The scores were ranked from highest to lowest (see table). As shown in Table 6, Housing/Homelessness, Mental Health, and Economic Insecurity had the highest matrix scores a cross all health topics, indicating that participants felt that these topics presented t he Long Beach community with the most needs or problems to address. Table 6.

Thus, the results of th is CHNA report are organized by \"significant health needs\" and \"identified needs.\" The signific ant health needs are listed below. St. Mary Medical Center - Significant Health Needs Access to Health Services Chronic Diseases Economic Insecurity Exercise, Nutrition & Weight Food Insecurity Housing & Homelessness Mental Health Public Safety In addition to rating each need in the matrix, prioritization p articipants were asked to rate the level of importance of addressing the health topics in the prio ritization matrix. As shown in Table 7, 100% of participants marked the following topics to be \"important or very important\" to address moving forward\u2014Access t o Health Services, Chronic Di seases, Economic Insecurity and Housing/Homelessness. When as ked about a group that is most affected by poor health outcomes in the Long Beach commu nity, survey participants liste d racial/ethnic minority populations, persons who are hom eless or precariously housed, a nd older adults as the top three groups for this issue. Table 7.

Fif ty percent of participants St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 20 supported the idea of improving economic inclusion, such as the creation of livingwage jobs in Long Beach for youth and adults and increased small business an d entrepreneurial support. Data Synthesis After reviewing and analyzing the results from the key informan t interviews, focus groups and prioritization survey, HCI synthesized these results together u sing a Venn Diagram. This Venn Diagram, in Figure 3, shows the overlapping areas of need acros s the different data methods for the Collaborative. In addition, t he Collaborative reviewed the secondary data results to help select the health topics for the prioritization survey. Thus, t he secondary data results influenced the formation of this diagram too. Figure 3. Venn Diagram for Lon g Beach Collaborative CHNAs As shown in Figure 3, Access to H ealth Services, Housing and Me ntal Health all surfaced as top priorities for each one of the d ata capture measures. The prior itization survey and key informant interviews both reveal ed Economy and Education to be top priorities, while the focus groups and prioritization survey showed Chronic Diseases and Pu blic Safety to be of high concern. Reviewing this diagram may help SMMC determine which h ealth issues to address when conducting its Implementat ion Strategy later this year. Potential Resources Appendix F includes resources that were id entified through the key inform ant interviews and focus groups with the ability to address the significant health needs in this CHNA. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 21 Demographics Demographics are an integral par t of describing the community a nd its population, which is critical to forming insights into the health needs of the commu nity to best plan for improvement. Different race/ethni c, age, and socioeconomic grou ps may have unique needs and require varied approaches to health improvement efforts. Th e following section explores the demographic profile of the 39 ZIP Codes that define the SMM C service area. Please note that demographics and data source d from Claritas\u00ae derive from t he Claritas Pop Facts\u00ae data set which provides demographics dat a based on Census and American C ommunity Survey (ACS) data. This data set provides cu rrent year (2018) estimates usin g the 2010 Census and the incorporation of newly available ACS data. Population The population of the entire SMMC service area i s 721,974, with ZIP Code 90650 containing the most people (106,360) and ZIP Code 90755 containing the fewest (11,491) (Table 8). This range shows the extensive diversity i n sizes of ZIP Codes in the serv ice area. It is important to disallow smaller, less densely populated Z IP Codes to be overlooked when examining health needs and social determinants of health for the area being served. Table 8. Population by ZIP Code (20122016)1 ZIP Code City/Community Population Estimate 90723 Beach 39,822 [1] American Community Survey, 20122016 Age Table 9 presents the age breakdo wn for each ZIP Code in the ser vice area. Notably, ZIP Code 90813 is the only ZIP Code in the service area with greater tha n 10% of its population under the age of five, while ZIP Codes 90744 and 90805 both also have gre ater than 8% of their population under age five. Furthe r, six of the 16 ZIP Codes in the service area have a greater St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 22 percentage of their populations in the 517 age range than the City of Long Beach (16.9%). ZIP Code 90813 has the highest perce ntage of this population at 22. 7%, with the following ZIP Codes having greater than 25% o f their populations under the ag e of 18: 90723, 90744, 90805, 90806, 90810, and 90813. This highlights the need for child, t een, and adolescentfocused health care and services in thes e parts of the service area. Fu rther, half of the ZIP Codes have higher percentages of older adults (65+) than Long Beach City, while ZIP Codes 90745, 90803, 90807, 90808, and 90815 have larger proportions of older adults than the city, county, and state. These areas may require d ifferent strategies and service s for this vulnerable population. Table 9. Population by Age by ZIP Code (20122016)1 ZIP Code City/Community 0 to 4 5 to 17 18 to 24 25 to 44 45 to 64 Race/Ethnicity Table 10 presents the breakdown of the population in SMMC's ser vice area by race and ethnicity. Six ZIP Codes in the service area have over half of their populations identifying as Hispanic or Latinx. Additionally, only four ZIP Codes have grea ter than half of their populations that identify as White, NonHispanic. The range of the percenta ge of the population that is Black or African American is f rom less than 2% (90744) to over one fifth of the population (20.2% in 90805). The racial and ethnic breakdowns of ZIP Codes served are crucial to review when analyzing health needs due to the fact that race/ethnicity is a major risk factor for many health issues including cancer and mental health. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 23 Table 10. Population by Race/Et hnicity by ZIP Code (20122016)1 ZIP Code City/ Community Black or African American American Indian/ Alaska Native Asian Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander Other Race Two+ Races White, Non Hispanic 20122016 Language Language concerns as they relate to healthcare and access are m easured by the percentage of residents (ages five and older) w ho have difficulty speaking En glish. Given the current health care system's reliance on English and the frequent difficulty o f navigating healthcare literature and understanding diagnoses and tr eatment choices for those who se native language is not English, it is crucial to identi fy areas where m ore resources m ay be needed to ensure that all populations, regardless of languag e, are being effectively reac hed. In SMMC's service area, ZIP Code 90813 has the highest percent age of its population with En glishspeaking difficulties, at 36.0%. ZIP Codes 90723, 90744, 90806, 90810, 9 0745, and 90805 a ll have greater than a quarter of their populations with Englishspeaking difficulties . ZIP Code 90803 has the smallest percentage of those who have di fficulty speaking English (2.9%) . In comparison, the entire city of Long Beach as a whole has 18.3% of its population who have d ifficulty speaking English.1 St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 24 Disability Status The share of persons with any ty pe of disability living in each ZIP Code in SMMC's service area is also helpful in determining where and what type of specialized resources or assistance may be needed to ensure healthcare access and ability to access for al l. The ZIP Code values are compared to the value for the entire city of Long Beach, which is 9.9% of people with a disability of any kind. ZIP Code 90804 has the lowest percent o f persons with a disability living within its boundaries at 6.4%, while ZIP Code 90802 has the hig hest with a value of 12.4%, followed by ZIP Cod es 90810 and 90745.1 Social & Economic Determinants of Health This section explores the social and economic determinants of h ealth in SMMC's service area. Social and economic determinant s are the conditions in which pe ople are born, grow, work, live, and age, including the wid er set of forces and systems th at shape the conditions of daily life for children and women. The se social determinants and othe r factors help build the context of the service area to allow fo r better understanding of the re sults of both primary and secondary data. Life Expectancy Life expectancy is a quality meas ure of a population's longevit y and general health and wellbeing. It is highly dependent on infant mortality rates and allcause death rates and can vary greatly between racial and ethnic groups. For Long Beach C ity, there are also great variations by geography, given th e wide range of differences in public health infrastructure, medical care availability and access, and other social determin ant of health issues in differing parts of the city. Income & Poverty Long Beach City has a median hous ehold income value of $55,151. Seven of the 16 SMMC ZIP Codes have values higher than the overall city value. ZIP Code 90808 is the highest of these with a median household income of $97 ,500. Conversely, ZIP Code 9081 3 has the lowest median household income ($31,775), creating a gap of $65,725 between t he highest and lowest ZIP Codes in the service area. Table 11 shows the percentages o f people and families in each S MMC service area ZIP Code who are living below the poverty level, as compared to Long Bea ch City. ZIP Code 90813 has the highest percentages of both peo ple and families living in pover ty, both over 30% of the ZIP Codes' populations (34.5% and 30 .8%, respectively). ZIP Codes 9 0744, 90804, 90 802, 90805, 90806, and 90723 all also have greater than a fifth of their fa milies living below the poverty level. This is a crucial measure when focusing on the health of children and women as a high percentage of families living in poverty signifies likely syste mic health issues in these populations, which adversely affect more vulnerable populations . Conversely, ZIP Code 90808 has the lowest percentages of peop le living below the poverty l evel (4.9%) and families living below the poverty level (2.9%). St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 25 Table 11.

Darker shades of blue represent higher percentages o f housing unit changes. Housing unit change refers to the negative or positive growth o f housing in an area. Positive percentages show places where mor e housing units exist now than in 2010. Smaller percentages indicate areas where there have been fewer addition s of housing units. These geographical areas are where hou sing, or lack thereof, may stil l be an issue, and where issues associated with housing, such as homelessness, lack of health i nsurance, and poverty are exacerbated.

This measure can indicate geographical areas, where it may be more o r less difficult to sustain housing in the same residence, due to rising housing costs or o ther expenses. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 27 Figure 5. Median Length of R esidence by ZIP Code (2018)2 [2] Claritas\u00ae Population Estimates, 2018 ZIP Code 90755 has the fewest hou seholds of any ZIP Code in the service area (4,102), while ZIP Code 90805 has the most (26,343) . While fewer households may ju st indicate areas of smaller populations, it is important to examine those ZIP Codes with re latively low numbers of households compared to their populations such as ZIP Code 90810 which has 37,422 people but only 9,132 households. ZIP Code 90808 has the highest pe rcentage of homeownership in t he service area (75.3%), while 90813 has the lowest percen tage (12.2%). Compared to Long Beach City, nine ZIP Codes in the service area have higher p ercentages of homeownership. H omeownership can be a proxy measure for other social determi nants of health such as poverty , employment, and health insurance. Rising housing costs are forcing more people to rent long term as opposed to own their own homes. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 28 Employment Figure 6 shows the percentage of the population 16 years and ol der from each Long Beach City ZIP Code that is unemployed. Th e highest rates of unemployment are concentrated in the north and west parts of the city, wi th ZIP Codes 90805, 90813, and 90 810 having the highest percentages, all over 10.0%. ZI P Codes 90808 and 90815 have the lowest rates of unemployment. Figure 6. Percent of Population 16+ that is Unemployed by ZIP C ode (2018)2 [2] Claritas\u00ae Population Estimates, 2018 While ZIP Code 90805 and 90813 have the highest percentages of unemployment, they also have the highest raw numbers o f workers (39,081 and 23,376 peop le, respectively). ZIP Codes 90810 and 90814 have the lowest number of workers in the City.2 Education The share of residents in each ZIP Code in the SMMC service are a aged 25 or older with at least a high school degree or equivalent (including general equivalen cy diploma (GED)) and the share of residents aged 25 or older with at least a bachelor's degree or equivalent are shown in Table 12. ZIP Codes 90813, 90744, and 90 723 are in the bottom three Z IP Codes in the service area St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 29 for both those with a high school degree or higher in the servi ce area and those with a bachelor's degree or higher. O n the other hand, ZIP Code 90803 has the highest percentages of both measures (95.7% and 59.2%, respectively). Table 12. Education Leve l by ZIP Code (20122016)1 ZIP Code City/Community High School Degree or Higher Bachelor's Degree or Higher Paramount Insti tute developed the SocioNeeds Index\u00ae to easily compare multiple socioeconomic factors across geographies. This index i ncorporates estimates for six different social and economic determinants of health that may i mpact health or access to care. Indicator estimates from Claritas \u00ae, covering income, poverty, u nemployment, occupation, educational attainment, and linguistic barriers, are standardiz ed and averaged to create one composite index value for every ZIP Code in the United States w ith a population of at least 300. ZIP Codes have index values rangi ng from 0 to 100, where ZIP Co des with higher values are estimated to have the highest so cioeconomic need and are correl ated with poor health outcomes, including preventable hospitalizations and premature death. According to the index, ZIP odes 90813, socioeconomic need in the area served by SMMC (Table 13). Three of these ZIP Codes are in the City of Long Beach, while the ot her two derive from the Wilming ton and Paramount communities. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 30 Table 13.

After completion of the data scor ing process, topic areas were assessed based on their scores and relation to one another. T he following sections will explor e the secondary and primary data findings more closely. These results will guide the community h ealth improvement efforts of SMMC. The following health topic results, (significant healt h needs) and (identified health needs), are presented in the ord er they occurred in the priorit ization findings on Table 6. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 34 Findings of Significant Health Needs Housing & Homelessness Table 15 shows the Housing and Homelessness indicators of need for SMMC's service area. Compared to the city, county, state, and national values availa ble, these indicators fared worse for the overall grouping of ZIP Codes that comprise the service area. Table 15. Housing and Homelessness Indicators of Need Indicator SingleParent Households1 Homeownership1 Median Household Income: Supplemental Median Household Income1 [1] American Community Survey, 20122016 Notably, when examining indicators of need in addition to previ ously discussed economic issues, the percentages of single parent and singleparent fema le households, along with homeownership, are important indi cators for the housing and hom elessness issue in an area (Table 16). Notably, ZIP Code s 90802, 90813, and 90804 are the three ZIP Codes of most need for all three of those measure s. ZIP Code 90813 has the lowest percentage of homeownership of any ZIP Code in the service ar ea (12.2%), along with the sec ond highest percentages of both singleparent female households ( 38.5%) and singleparent house holds (52.5%). Those in single parent households are at a higher risk for adverse health effec ts, notably emotional and behavioral problems, compared to their peers, in addition to ha ving less housing security due to only one adult income propping up the household. Additionally, lack of homeownership has negative consequences for both individuals and communities surr ounding civic engagement, housing and structural improve ment, and monetary stability.

The percen tage of disabled persons living in poverty is also higher in the city than the county and the s tate. This is an important metric for housing and homelessness because disabled persons are a vulnera ble population that may be more likely to struggle to make a living wage and, therefore, a fford adequate housing. While the housing costs for homeowners with a mortgage in Long Beach City are lower than the median costs for the county, they are higher than the state ave rage, and are a crucial cost that needs to continue to be tracked. High costs for those with a mo rtgage can strain both the homeowners and the local housing market. If homeowners are unab le to make their mortgage payments, it can lead housing ma rkets to crash and cause many f oreclosures. Further, it exacerbate the homeless problem greatly if those who are curren tly housed end up homeless because of the inability to conti nue to afford their housing an d basic costs of living.

Additionally, there was a 20% decrease in Other Ser vice Sites (OSS), also known as nonresidential locations where h omeless persons may be located , from 2015 to 2017. These day shelters or service center s are crucial components to suppo rting the homeless population in the city. Table 18.

However , there was a 3% increase from 2015 to 2017 of homeless veterans. The numbers of adult s with serious mental illness and substance use disorder decreased in the homeless populat ion, but those with HIV/AIDS a nd those who are victims of domestic violence in the homel ess population both increased. By geographic area, west, centra l, and north Long Beach contain the majority of the population experiencing homelessness. In 201 3, the majority of the homeles s population was concentrated in central Long Beach, southwes t of Signal Hill, mostly in ZIP Codes 90813 and 90802. However, in 2015 and 2017 measurements of those experiencing homelessnes s, a greater range of locations containing this population was seen. While the denses t concentrations of the homeless populations still existe d in in the central and west p arts of the city, greater numbers of those experiencing homeless wer e measured in north Long Beac h (ZIP Codes 90805 and 90810). By 2017, this spread had c ontinued to even include some ZIP Codes in east Long Beach as pockets of homelessness. 16 Additional descriptive demographi cs of the 2017 homeless popula tion of Long Beach City can be found in Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 37 Figure 8. Age of Long Beach Ci ty Homeless Population, 2017 [16] Department of Health and Human Services, Homeless Services Divi sion, Homelessness Data Exchange (HDX) Over a quarter of the homeless population in Long Beach in 2017 was between the ages of 45 and 54 years of age, while just over 10% of the homeless popula tion were children under the age of 18. Figure 9. Gender of Adults of Lo ng Beach City Homeless Populati on, 2017 [16] Department of Health and Human Services, Homeless Services Divi sion, Homelessness Data Exchange (HDX) Nearly three quarters of the hom eless population in Long Beach in 2017 were male, with just over a quarter female, and one percent transgender.

The real cost measur e, unlike poverty measures which do not accurately account for local costs of living, fact or in the costs of housing, food, health care, childcare, transportation, and other basic needs t o determine what it really costs to live in the city, county, or state. North and central Long Beac h (along with Signal Hill City) both also have higher percentages of households below real cost meas ure than the whole of Los Angeles County (38%) and the state of California (33%).17 Figure 12. Household s Below Real Cost Measure by Location [17] Struggling to Stay Afloat: The Real Cost Measure in California 2018 Further, when looking closer at households below real cost meas ure, the households that are above the federal poverty level, but below the real cost measur e, are often in more need than those below the poverty level due to their inability to access as many programs and policies that help prop up those officially below the poverty level. Wit hin the city, the southwest and port areas has the highest perce ntages of households above pove rty but below real cost (36%), with the north and central Long Beach (plus Signal Hill) both w ith 29% of their households above poverty but below real cost.17 Homeownership broken down by race and ethnicity shows that just over half (55.5%) of White households are owned by those wh o live there, while only 24.3% of Black households and 29.3% of Latino households ar e owned by their residents.13 Further, while Black households spend over half of their income on housing costs, White househo lds only spend 31.7% and Asian/Pacific Islander households only spend 38.2% (Figure 13). St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 40 Figure 13.

Notably, 13.7% of Lat ino households lack Internet access while 11.2% of Black households lack this utility. Figure 14. Internet Access by Ra ce/Ethnicity in Long Beach City [13] City of Long Beach, Advanci ng Economic Inclusion in Long B each Infographics St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 41 Primary Data Snapshot: H ousing and Homelessness o Living in the city is stressful while trying to raise one's fam ily and hold a job. It takes luck, support and diligence to break the cycle of homelessness and/or poverty . o The minimum wage should be increased, which would help some peo ple afford to stay in their apartments. o Lack of housing is driving up co sts and creating more homelessn ess. o Keeping people from being homeless helps prevent many other iss ues related to nutrition, chronic disease treatment, and safety from interpersonal violence. o It is important to keep people housed, as it is more humane and less costly in the end. o It is imperative to help those who are homeless or have mental health or drug addiction issues through resources and education. o The rising cost of rent in Long Beach is a major issue. The lim ited number of shelter beds and the amount of time and resources it takes to build more emergency s helters are also problematic in Long Beach. o The mayor's task force on homelessness released a report with 1 2 recommendations to improve this problem in Long Beach, addressing prevention, development and a ffordable housing. They are moving forward with implementing these recommendations. o The Homeless Emergency Assistance Program (HEAP) is a solid res ource to help address this issue in Long Beach. o People with mental illnesses may be more likely to be substance abusers and homeless. o Lack of housing and healthy food can cause behavioral health is sues. o Increasing access to services ca n help prevent homelessness. Ro ot causes of homel essness in Long Beach involve social determinants of health, including insuffic ient access to health services, poverty, social structure and crowded conditions. o Having policymakers, in both the city and county, on the same p age when it relates to addressing homelessness is a challenge. o The city development rate on housing has made the issue worse. o Many residents and small busine sses are being pushed out their communities because of new developments in the area. Instea d, more resources should be all ocated to build up the community through equitable housing in all parts of the city. o Children who experience homelessn ess also deal with lots of tra uma and stress. o Affordable housing is difficult a nd virtually nonexistent in L ong Beach. o The MultiService Center in Long Beach is a one stop shop for t hose who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. o Housing was identified as one of the top five community needs/i ssues. o Rising rent and home costs, poor facilities management, and inc reasing homelessness were identified as persistent and urg ent health needs affecting all communities. o Understanding and building credit was presented as a unique bar rier and opportunity to help residents build financial security, intergenerational wealth, a nd housing stability. o Proposed solutions to improving housing and reducing homelessne ss included offering more supports to help renters transition into homeownership, buildi ng more housing and more types of housing, building empathy amongs t the community for those exper iencing homelessness or unstable housing conditions throu gh normalizing others' experie nces and their own nearness to the risk, and more supports to increas e credit and financial litera cy.

Mental Health & Mental Disorders Table 19 lists the indicators related to Mental Health & Mental Disorders that were identified as those of definite concern for the SMMC service area. Notably, h ospitalizations and emergency room visits due to mental health and mental healthrelated issu es, as well as general psychological distress, are probl ematic for numerous ZIP Codes within the service area.

This combination indicates a definite mental health care need for these seven ZIP Codes: 908 13, 90731, 90802, 90806, 90804, 90805, and 90810 (Table 20). There is clearly a need for more or improved specialized mental health care in these areas to avoid hospitalizations or other emergencie s, either due to suicide or other mental health issues that end up needing care that cannot be handled in home or by a primary care specialist. I n addition to these seven ZIP Codes, there are five other ZIP Codes with higher rates of hospitalizations due to suicide than the state value, and one other ZIP Codes with a higher rate of ER visits due to mental health than the county value. \"The price of rent is increasing so much; I'm having difficulty paying.

For the SMM C service area, the following ZIP Codes had increases in their hospitalization rates due to m ental health over a four time period span 21). These ZIP Codes may be areas of the service area St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 44 to focus better mental health care and increase availability of services since they are areas where those with mental health issues are ending up needing mor e intense hospital care to deal with issues stemming from th eir diseases. Notably, many of these ZIP Codes trending in the wrong direction are located within the city of Long Beach. Although the city rates overall have also increased slightly across the four time period span, the county and state rates have actually decreased. Table 21.

St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 45 Figure 15. AgeAdjusted Death Rate due to Suicide in Long Beach City [18] California Department of Pub lic Health, VRBI S Death Statis tical Master File 2012-2016 Notably, the ageadjusted death rate per 100,000 population due to suicide in Long Beach was higher than the Healthy People 2020 target of 10.2 in 2013 (14. 5), 2014 (10.5), and 2015 (10.9). However, in 2016, the death rate dropped below the target to 10 .1 deaths per 100,000 population, showing an improving trend in the city since 2013. For the threeyear suicide rate (20142016), the City of Long Bea ch had a value of 10.5 deaths per 100,000 population, which was higher than the Los Angeles County value of 7.8 deaths and the overall California state value of 10.4 deaths.11 Extrapolating by gender, death rates due to suicide for the Cit y of Long Beach vary by injury type, or injury cause. Notably, males have a much higher percen tage of suicide by firearm than females, while females have higher rates of suicide by falls, p oisoning, and suffocation. 18 By examining demographics of suicide deaths in Long Beach City even more closely, it is seen that males are nearly four times more likely than females to co mmit suicide (15.5 deaths per 100,000 population versus 4.2 deaths per 100,000 population in 2016). Additionally, the highest rates by age in 2016 come from the 55+ age group (17.3 deaths p er 100,000 population) and the highest rates by race and ethnicity in 2016 come from the W hite race group (20.0 deaths per 100,000 population). 1 Lastly, when looking at geographical trends for death by suici de, ZIP Code 90802 had the highest aver age suicide rate from 20122016 with 18.5 deaths per 100,000. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 46 Primary Data Snapshot: Mental Health o People with mental health issues usually go to the emergency ro om or get stopped by cops. They may not know how to access the ne cessary healthcare services. o Lack of screening people for cer tain conditions is difficult. A ccessing and treating mental health patients are challenging. Lack of training and limited time are also factors along with high turnover rates in hospitals. o People are becoming more aware o f pressing issues related to dr ugs or opioids, alcohol use, and mental health disorders, recogni zing that these issues need att ention now. o It is imperative to help those who are homeless or have mental health or drug addiction issues through resources and education. o There are not many mental health facilities for adults in Long Beach. We need a stronger care coordinated program for those wh o are homeless or returning to society from prison. o Alzheimer's mortality is a risi ng issue that should garner more focus. o More interventions around mental health and behavioral health a re needed. o The county gets funding for mental health, not the city. If the city received funding, the city could deliver it well and be successful. o Addressing mental health with people of different cultures can be challenging, as discussing it in people's native languages can be very stigmatizing. o It is important to provide servi ces for people at all stages of mental illness. Mobile vans are available to reach people in the community. o Family centered approaches around mental health would be useful . o Mental health affects many diffe rent communities across the boa rd, regardless of their race or income level. Due to cultural ba rriers, some communities are ju st learning about different resources for mental health, particularly the Cambodian community. o Police travel with mental health clinicians who are better trai ned to deescalate situations regarding those with mental health issues. o Mental Health was identified as one of the top five community n eeds/issues. o Individual and community trauma, and cumulative chronic stress were mentioned as conditions that negatively impact the occurrence of mental illness in specific demographic communities. o There was a highlighted intersect ion between access to health c are and mental health, where community residents reported ba rriers to obtaining mental healt h care due to hours of service, availability of specialists, qua lity of care, and cultural comp etency. o Members of the LGBTQ community were more likely to raise stigma as a barrier to mental health care access. o Some effective strategies to addr ess mental health and mental h ealth conditions included better use of technology to disseminate information, decentralizing care c enters, offering holistic care, working to destigmatize mental health co nditions, and providing communi ty education to increase understanding of mental health c onditions and available resourc es. \"I think people need to recognize that there are shifts [in mental health] so you know that if you are not feeling well it's absolutely okay to ask for help, to tell somebody and to say something.

Economic Insecurity Table 22 shows Economic Insecuri ty indicators of concern for SM MC's overall service area. Of note, the service area has high weighted values for the indicat ors: Poverty Status by School Enrollment and Children Living B elow Poverty Level. Children an d adolescents are especially vulnerable to economic insecurity, with poverty affecting child ren's ability to learn and advance in school, get proper health care , and have proper nutrition. Table 22.

These t wo ZIP Codes, along with 90744, 90804, 90805, and 90806 all have greater than a fifth of the ir child populations, families, and general populations living in poverty. Notably, 90813 has nearly half (46.3%) of its children living below poverty with over a third (34.5%) of all people in its population also below that t hreshold. Broken down by ZIP Code, economi c insecurity for youth is probl ematic for parts of the region. Those enrolled in school but livin g below the poverty level are likely having their wellbeing affected by their family's income, potentially do not have heal th insurance coverage, and are more likely to have physical heal th problems like low birth wei ght, lead poisoning, and behavioral problems - in additi on to the obvious consequence of economic insecurity St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 48 throughout adolescence. ZIP Co des 90813, 90802, a nd 90744 are t he worst performing ZIP Codes in the service area for this metric, with over a third of those schoolaged children, aged 5 to 19, facing the short and longterm barriers to success and economic wellness based on lack financial stability during their formative years. Further, it i s seen that the median household income for households with an ol der adult as the head of the ho usehold is of particular concern in ZIP Code 90813, the value of which is only $21,552 - less th an half of the state value and nearly less than half of the ci ty, county, and U.S. values (Tab le 23).

ZIP Code 90813 nota bly has the lowest homeownership percentage (12.2%), but the highest percentage of households receiving supplemental security income (12. 4%) to help them meet basic ne eds, including shelter. Only 12.2% homeownership - defined as the percentage of all housing units that are occupied by those who own the home - is less t han a third of the city (37.7 %), county (43.0%), and state (49.8%) values and indicates a dearth of the benefits that ofte n come with homeownership for both individuals and communities, including involvement in civi c affairs, repairs or upgrades to the housing unit, and tax benefits. Table 24 shows indicators found t o have more than average need for the City of Long Beach. Notably, the percent of adults w ho have been homeless in Long B each City (8.9%) is almost double the value of the county as a whole (4.8%). Further, food insecurity and those with a disability living in poverty both have higher rates for the cit y than the county. Table 24.

Examining these key indica tors can help increase access to economic opportunities in lowinco me communities through econom ic vitality, readiness, and connectedness. Median income for L ong Beach City, broken down b y race/ethnicity, shows that American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Latino groups all fal l below $50,000 medians and all have more than values more than $14,000 less than the median in come for Whites ($57,643). The Asian ($59,479) and Native H awaiian/Pacific Islander ($73,0 61) groups have the highest median income values.13 Another important economic measu re is the percentage of workers in each race/ethnic group that make at least $15 per hour at their jobs by gender. Notabl y, less than 75% of Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Blac k workers overall earned $15 or more per hour, while 85% of all St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 50 White workers earned this much. By gender, it is seen that the Latino group is the only one that has a higher percentage of female workers (57%) than male worke rs (53%) making $15 or more per hour. Fewer than 70% of Lati no, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black female workers earned at least $15 per hour.13 Figure 16 displays the percentage of each race/ethnicity group in Long Beach City that lives in a high poverty neighborhood. Five times the percentage of Latinos and Native Americans live in high poverty neighborhoods compared to Whites. Figure 16.

Unemployment Rate by Race/Ethnicity in Long Beach Ci ty, 20112015 [13] City of Long Beach, Advanci ng Economic Inclusion in Long B each Infographics Primary Data Snapshot: Economic Insecurity Lack of housing is driving up co sts and creating more homelessn ess. Poverty, access to healthcare, a nd healthy foods all influence one's health. Living in the city is stressful while trying to raise one's fam ily and hold a job. It takes luck, support and diligence to break the cycle of homelessness and/or poverty. The vast majority of people in Lo ng Beach are living paycheck t o paycheck. Due to this, it is difficult for people to stay healthy. The minimum wage should be increased, which would help some peo ple afford to stay in their apartments. The rising cost of rent in Long Beach is a major issue. The lim ited number of shelter beds and the amount of time and resources it takes to build more emergen cy shelters are also problematic in Long Beach. African Americans, Hispanics and seniors are most vulnerable to economic issues in Long Beach. It is important to create econo mic opportunities, so people can go to work and break the cycle of poverty. If people are more productive, the economy gr ows, generating more resources in the healthcare system. Many families are spending roughly 90% of their income on housi ng, making it hard for them to invest in their health. There are racial, economic and gender injustices in the communi ty, creating geographic divisions among those popula tions and health issues. It is important to proactively address racial equity and econom ic inclusion in the community. The city council in Long Beach has an initiative called Divide by Nine, addressing the concept of equality not equaling equity. Efforts should be made to inve st in youth through education, prevention and early intervention strategies. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 52 Public Safety Public Safety measures are defin ed as those that relate to ensu ring a safe learning, working, and living environment, as well as injury, crime, and emergency prevention. Table 25 shows Public Safety indicators of need for Long Beach City. The prema ture death rate due to homicide in total years of potential life lost (YPLL) is almost double f or the City of Long Beach (445.26) compared to the Los Angeles County value (239.52). The trends o ver time for both premature death rate due to homicide and pr emature death rate due to drug overdoses are both moving in unfavorable directions, with values for the City of Long Bea ch increasing. The violent crime rate in the city also increased each year from 2014 to 2017, wi th the rate rising from about 482 violent crimes per 100,000 populat ion to over 661 violent crime s per 100,000 population in that span. Parent engagement with their children is difficult, when they a re overly consumed with their jobs. Long Beach should support healthy communities with its funds, e specially environmental health and justice issues. Wealthbuilding education and knowledge on how to build credit scores are significant to economic stability. Community members acknowledged that a lack of economic opportun ities leads to increased crimes, and a way to address crime is to provide jobs. The cost of living is r ising at a disproportionate rate to inco me levels. o 100% of survey respondents stated that it was \"Important\" or \"V ery Important\" to address economic insecurity in the Long Beach area. o 14% of survey respondents felt low income residents were most a ffected by poor health outcomes in the Long Beach area. o 75% of survey respondents felt L ong Beach could support policie s that increase the availability of affordable housing for families with low income s, such as requiring developers to include low income units in ev ery new housing development or caps to rental increase rates in Long Beach. o 50% of survey respondents felt Lon g Beach could support economi c inclusion, such as the creation of livingwage jobs in L ong Beach for youth and adults and increased small business and entrepreneurial support. \"It [financial education] needs to be back in the schools, like junior high, high school.

Robbery an d aggravated assault cases both peaked in 2017 and then slightly fell through 2018 (Figure 19). Figure 19. Violent Crimes by Typ e in Long Beach City, 20132018 [12] Long Beach Police Department, 2018 Additionally, the annual average over the same time period of e ach type of violent crime as a percentage of all violent crimes shows that over half (52%) of all violent crimes on average annually are aggravated assault, with aggravated assaults and r obberies making up 92% of all St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 55 violent crimes. Rapes, on averag e, only account for 7%, with mu rders making up the last 1% of all violent crimes annually.12 Looking at data specifically on deaths considered violent (homi cide and suicide), it is seen that males were victims in the vast majority of both homicides and s uicides in Long Beach City from 2010 to 2015. 145 of 170 homicide death victims were male, whil e 183 of 223 suicide death victims were male. 19 Further examining breakdowns of homicides and suicides by age, over 40% of homicide deaths in Long Beach from 2010 to 2015 were under the age of 25 and ju st over 83% of homicide death victims were under the age of 45. For suicides, although the most cases in the city during that time period were in the 45 to 64 age range, it is notable that 15.7% of suicide deaths were over 65 years of age and 12.1% were under 25 years of age. 19 Figure 20 displays the race/ethnicity breakdown of these same h omicide and suicide deaths. Nearly three quarters (74.7%) of homicide deaths in Long Beach were either Black or Hispanic, whereas only 10.6% of deaths were White. Conversely, over half (58.3%) of suicides were White, followed by Hispanics and then Asians. Figure 20. Number of Homicide a nd Suicide Deaths by Race/Ethnic ity, 20102015 [19] Violent Death Reporting Syst em Data for City of Long Beach , 2010-2015 The percentage of homicides in L ong Beach City from 2010 to 201 5 by weapon type and leading circumstance can also provide in sight on how to best improve pu blic safety in the City. Three quarters of all homicides in this time period were committed us ing a firearm, with nearly half (49%) of all homicides being gang related. Also notable is that 11% of homicides were due to intimate partner violence, with 24% being due to an argument, w hether between partners or those with other relations or no relation at all.19 St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 56 Other public safety concerns in Long Beach include traffic coll isions, as well as walker, biker, and rider safety. In 2018, three distinct check times in the ci ty found an average of 3,172 pedestrians and 1,101 bicyclists . Additionally, of the 486 scoo ters tracked in Long Beach in 2018, nearly three quarters (73.9% ) of riders were male, and of the 3,182 bicycles tracked in the city, just over 80% of bikers were male as well. Further, Figure 21 shows that 84% of scooter riders tracked wer e not wearing a helmet, while over half (55%) of bikers were a lso not wearing a helmet. Over a quarter (26%) of scooter riders were riding on the sidewalk, while 8% of bikers were riding the wrong way on the street. Figure 21.

Of the 346 injured in all traffic collisions during this stretch, nearly 14% were pedestrians, alm ost 10% were bicyclists, 2.3% o f all injuries were under 18 years of age, and 1.7% of injure d persons were over 65. The rem aining number of those who were injured or killed in these traffic collisions that were no t pedestrians or bicyclists comes from those who were operating or inside the motor vehicle invol ved.20 Primary Data Snapshot: Public Safety o Keeping people from being homele ss helps prevent many other iss ues related to nutrition, chronic disease treatment, and sa fety from interpersonal violen ce. o Support agricultural tax break policies in Long Beach, where pe ople can get tax breaks by growing healthy foods on their l and. These kinds of projects he lp reduce crime while improving perceptions of safety. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 57 o Perception of crime is actually a bigger issue than crime itsel f in many communities in Long Beach. Adopting a more robust, h olistic approach on violence pr evention would be ideal. o Participate in the urban agricultural incentive zone partnershi p, cultivating opportunities to grow food and be physically a ctive in the community. o Chronic stress is a major issue living in Long Beach due to man y determinants, including a lack of green space and opportunities in the area. o Affordable housing is difficult and virtually nonexistent in L ong Beach. o Creating social connectedness is i mportant, involving issues su ch as complete streets, well lit streets, public safety and cleanliness. o The Safe Long Beach Collaborati ve addresses critical issues in Long Beach, including access to health services, social co nnectedness, public safety and the criminal justice system. o Insufficient police presence and ineffective use of police reso urces were offered as conditions that result in reduced public safety. For example, p articipants were concerned why multiple police vehicles wou ld arrive at a scene regarding a homeless Black individual but would be less likely to opera te surveillance and patrols at night. o Black participants shared a complex relationship with the polic e. Some shared that they want more police in their neighborhoods, but all agreed that po licing practices need to be changed to stop the targeting of Blacks. o As a solution to improve Public Safety, participants suggested that police preparation should include cultural sensitivity and mental health training to prop erly engage with residents, where there is historical trauma from police or higher levels o f mental illness. Police were also mentioned as key partners in supporting individuals facing homelessness as a method to reduce crime. Prioritization results o 86% of survey respondents stated that it was \"Important\" or \"Ve ry Important\" to address public safety in the Long Beach area. o 17% of survey respondents felt Lo ng Beach could support policie s that create more equitable opportunities for health across Long Beach neighborho ods such as increasing access to lowcost healthy foods, safe sidewalks, bicycle lanes , and fitness loops. o 8% of survey respondents felt Lo ng Beach could strengthen commu nitypolice relations, including increased collaboration and implementation of communi ty safety work in partnership with police and community residents to improve publ ic safety. o 8% of survey respondents felt Long Beach could promote youth di version programs that build youth skills and reduce interactions with the criminal ju stice system. \"If a Hispanic or a nonBlack person called [police] on a Bl ack person, it's like they would believe that nonBlack person instead.

An indicator is designated as having need, if the service area as a whole is fairing worse compared to the Long Beach City value, the Los Angeles County v alue, the California state value, and does not meet any Healthy People 2020 objectives, if applicable. Table 26. Access to Health Se rvices Indicators of Need Indicators of Need Preventable Emergency Room Visits5 Adults 65+ without Health Insurance1 Children and Teens Delayed or had Difficulty Obtaining Care4 [5] California Office of Statew ide Health Planning and Developm ent [1] American Community Survey, 20122016 [4] California Health Interview Survey, Neighborhood Edition In particular, ZIP Codes 90744, 90723, 90813, and 90805 all have higher percentage s of older adults who do not ha ve health insurance than the city, county, state, and national averages (Table 27). Given th at the Healthy People 2020 target for all adults is to have 100% ins urance coverage, only two ZIP Codes (90755 and 90814) in the service area are meeting this goal for their older adult popula tion. Insurance coverage is crucial for older adults given their increased likelihood of experienci ng adverse health events and their increased vulnerability to disease and need for care. In addition, ZIP Codes 90803, 90 813, 90804, 90814, 90731, and 9 0806 have higher percentages of children and teens under 18 wh o reported having delayed or n ot received medical care they felt they needed than the City o f Long Beach, Los Angeles Count y, and the state of California. Utilizing appropriate clinical and Preventive services in a tim ely fashion can have important implications on the progression and treatment of many diseases, especially in children and adolescents. Delays in care lead to increased risk of complicat ions and higher changes of chronic issues that could be avoided with detection and treatme nt during earlier stages. For preventable emergency room visits for adults 18 years of ag e and older, ZIP Code 90813 has by far the highest value of all ZIP Codes in the service area w ith a rate of 895.5 emergency room visits per 10,000 population. This value is more than double th e Long Beach City, Los Angeles County, and California state values. Preventable emergency room visits are a significant indicator of lack of access to primary care or ability to acces s primary care, as well as other health care to address issues tha t can be prevented without an emergency visit. This implies a severe need in this ZIP Code for additional primary and Prevent ive care, as well as enhanced ability of citizens of this ZIP Code to be able to access this care. Table 27.

Most notably is Adults who Visited a Dentist, for which the City of Long Beach has a lower percentage of adults w ho visited a dentist in the past year than the California average by more than five percent. Add itionally, while there is no significant negative trend over time for this measure for Long Beach, there is also no positive trend, meaning that there is a stagnation of adults who are acc essing regular dental care that needs to be addressed. One notable trend over time is t he trend of preventable emergen cy room visits for the SMMC service area (Table 28). Broken d own by ZIP Code of residence, nine of the 16 ZIP Codes in the service area saw steadily increasing preventable emergency room visit rates time period after St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 60 time period from 20102012 to 2 0132015. These nine ZIP Codes h ad a higher rate each time period than the previous time period. Although this same trend was seen in Long Beach City - with the MannKendall statistical test determining that the tre nd for the city was increasing at a statistically significant pace - Los Angeles County, and the st ate of California, it is still a worrying trend for the service area as it indicates a lack of primary an d Preventive care availability or utilization. Notably, ZIP Codes 90744 and 90813 all had more th an 100 visits per 100,000 population increases from the 20102012 time period to the 2013 2015 time period. These ZIP Codes display the greatest need f or more affordable primary car e facilities, as well as education about accessing care and not u sing emergency rooms as a place f or primary care. Table 28. Preventable Emergency Room Visits per 100,000 Populat ide Planning and Developm ent Primary Data Snapshot: A ccess to Health Services o Increasing access to services ca n help prevent homelessness. Ro ot causes of homel essness in Long Beach involve social determinants of health, including insuffic ient access to health services, poverty, social structure and crowded conditions. o Universal healthcare would be a game changer for the Long Beach community and American society as a whole. o Children and adolescents, specifically in the Latino community, need healthcare and preventive care from primary to dental. Having better access to urgent and outp atient care would also reduce overcrowding in emergency rooms. o Providing healthcare for all you th should be a systemic, longt erm goal. o Use an integrated approach to provide healthcare. Provide healt hcare units, where social workers, police and nurses work together in the field. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 61 o Learn and teach how access to he althcare relates to immigration and misconceptions of citizenship status. Immigration st atus creates fear and prevents some peopl e from accessing health services. o Providing and improving language resources help people better a ccess health services. o African Americans have less acce ss to appropriate health care. o Institutional racism produces di fferent levels of healthcare ac cess. o Transportation and language issues are main barriers to healthc are. o Transportation barriers, employe r constraints, access to intern et and technology, and language barriers limit access to health services. o Affordability of services was me ntioned as a barrier to accessi ng health care. Primary highcost services included: medications, mental health services, dental care, and the cost of healthy food. o Access to services for children with Autism was brought forth a s a unique challenge to accessing health services. o Members of the LGBTQ community a lso raised cultural competency as a barrier to accessing health care, indicating they do not feel safe around physicians who do not fully understand their identities. o Cambodian participants raised wait times for medical care as a major barrier, citing difficulty with obtaining initial and followup vi sits for months after initial ly requested. o Black participants had the highest frequency of noting discrimi nation as a factor that impacts their health care. They expressed experiences of bias, unequal treatm ent, and a feeling that their lives were not equally valued. o Black participants acknowledged cultural competency as a factor that needs to be addressed. They also shared how they need to fight to be heard by physicians, a nd there are no accountability measures for the disparities that are created. o Potential solutions for improvi ng access to health services inc luded health care reform, operating services in more locations, or l ocations that are in closer pro ximity to the communities facing the most barriers. Additional strategies included: more comprehensi ve insurance, increasing access to the internet, improving the ease of system navigation, or provi ding access to care coordinators to advocate for and connect to s ervices across Long Beach. Prioritization results o 100% of survey respondents stated that it was \"Important\" or \"V ery Important\" to address access to health services in t he Long Beach area. o 25% of survey respondents felt L ong Beach could increase coordi nation of mental health resources with LA County to increase access to behavioral health services including drug and alcohol detox and recovery beds. \"The location of the health services should be close to our homes. Our insurance should be mindful of placing us at facilities that are near us so it could address the transportation issue.\" \"I need someone to help me navigate the healthcare system and I would hope that a community or agency group can help me.\" St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 62 Chronic Diseases Table 29 shows indicators of need for the SMMC service area for the health topic of Chronic Diseases. The overall service area, level of need was determine d for each indicator by examining how each ZIP Code in t he service area compared to the indicator values for Long Beach City, Los Angeles County, a nd the state of California, as well as applicable Healthy People 2020 targets. Emergency room vis it rates due to various diabete srelated conditions (general diabetes, longterm complication s of diabetes, and uncontrolled diabetes), as well as emergency room visit rates due t o heartrelated conditions (hyp ertension and congestive heart failure) are areas of great need due to rates in many ZIP Codes in the service area exceeding those rates of the city, county, and state.

The populations of all of these ZIP Codes are more than 50% Hispanic or Latino, with the exception of 90810 and 90745, and ZIP Code 90805 also has more than one fifth of its populati on identifying as Black or African American. Race and ethnicity are proven risk factors of hyperte nsion that increase the risk of heart disease, heart attack, a nd stroke in an individual. Due t o these correlations, it is important that areas of such racial and ethnic makeup, as well as overlap ping conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, be the focus o f education efforts like health y eating and physical activity.

Wh ile most of those eight ZIP Codes are the same ones that hav e higher ER rates due to diabet es than the city, county, and state, it is notable that both ZIP Code 90802 and ZIP Code 9080 4 have lower percentages of adults with diabetes than Long Beach City, but higher rates of ER visits due to diabetes than the city rate (Table 30). This indi cates that those with diabetes i n these areas may not be getting the proper treatment or care and are thus ending up in the emer gency room due to complications or using the emerge ncy room for their primary car e for the disease. Further, the City of Long Beach has a higher rate of emergency room visits due to pediatric asthma than the county and state as well (Table 31). Additional ly, there is an unfavorable trend over time for this rate for the city, with the rate of ER visit s increasing over the last four periods of measure. Other chronic diseas esrelated indicators of concer n for Long Beach City include St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 64 Cholesterol Test History and High Cholesterol Prevalence. Long Beach City fails to meet the Healthy People 2020 for both of these measures, falling nearly 10% short of the goal of 82.1% of adults having had their blood cholesterol checked in the pas t five years, and having a high cholesterol prevalence rate of a lmost double the Healthy People 2020 goal of 13.5%. Given that high blood cholesterol does not cause symptoms but is one of th e main risk factors for developing heart disease or having a heart attack, it is crucia l for people to learn their cholesterol numbers.

More efforts should be focus ed on them. o Other chronic conditions that n eed to be addressed include asth ma, high blood pressure, and hepatitis B & C. o Good recreational opportunities are scarce in some parts of the city. It is imperative for Long Beach to create easytoaccess, highqua lity programs and services, s o people can exercise and eat well. o In the Cambodian culture, childre n typically care for their eld erly. However, older adults in this culture do not always follow thei r children to new communities, leading to more chronic issues among this population. o Homeless people and those in the lowincome category have less health insurance and worse health outcomes than others in the counter groups, which is reflected in the lowincome zip codes with low life expectancies. o Stress, linked to race and/or the economy, is a huge burden tha t exacerbates al ready existing chronic health issues. o The increased risk of cancer aro und the two ports in Long Beach contributes to the premature death rates in the area. Public health efforts should review and util ize the Clean Air Action Plan. This plan specifically recognizes how these environmental hazards impact the most sensitive populations, including the elderly, children, pregnant women and people with chronic illnesses. o Residents noted the link between high stress, as early as child hood, and the development of chronic disease. Lowincome communities who face more challenges and ch ronic stressors are more likely to develop these diseases. Resid ents also noted that children a re more frequently developing chronic diseases. o Poor air quality and pollution wer e discussed as they influence chronic diseases su ch as asthma and obesity. o Residents noted technology is an asset and resource for address ing health. They also referenced an overusage of technology (i.e. phones, gaming, computers) as a related aspect leading to low physical activity levels and poor mental health in adults and c hildren. o Access to safe, clean spaces for recreation and physical activi ty, as well as, access to affordable, healthy foods were highlighted b y Cambodian participants as a c ontributor to chronic disease development. o Due to the complexity of the dis eases, residents suggested whol eperson, comprehensive care when approaching and developing solutions.

Of note, children in some areas of the serv ice area are overweight, whil e adults are not taking the opportunity, or do not have the realistic ability, to commute u sing a more active method than driving or public transportation. Table 32. Exercise, Nutrition & Weight Indicators of Need Indicator Workers who Walk to Work1 Workers who Bike to Work1 Children who are Overweight for Age4 [1] American Community Survey, 20122016 [4] California Health Interview Survey, Neighborhood Edition At the ZIP Code level, lack of physical activity during commute s is prominently seen in ZIP Codes 90745, 90803, 90805, 90 807, and 90808 (Table 33). Those ZIP Cod es all have less than 2% of their workers who walk to work and less than 1% of workers of b ike to work. Further, all ZIP Codes in the service area excep t 90813 and 90802 fail to meet t he Healthy People 2020 target of having 3.1% of workers walk to work. Commuting by walking, b iking, or other forms of riding, particularly in an area like Long Beach with oftlong commute t imes and transportation issues, can enhance a person's health and provide that need physical ac tivity per day. Additionally, a lack of those commuting by the aforementioned means can indicat e public safety concerns limiting people's willingness to commute out of a vehicle. Further, the percentage of children aged 211 who are overweigh t for their age - where weight is greater than or equal to the 95 th percentile, considering sex, age , and weight - is a concern in much of the SMMC service area. In particular, 10 of the service area's 16 ZIP Codes have higher percentages of children who are overweight for age compared to the city, county, and state values (Table 33). Of notable con cern are ZIP Codes 90802 and 9 0805, which have 15% or greater of their youth who are c onsidered overweight. Obesity i s a serious health concern for both children and adolescents, with obese children more likely to become obese as adults. Physical inactivity during childhood, as well as lack of proper nutrition and the social environment of the child, can lead to these weight issues. Table 33.

The city has higher percentages than the county of children who consume soda or sugarsweetened beverages at le ast one time per day and lowe r percentages of adults who consume five or more servings of fruits or vegetables per day. This makes sense given the city's comparatively low percentage of adults with easy access to fres h produce. It is likely that adults are not able to access or afford healthy, fresh foods, such as fruits and vegetables, which leads to them and their families consu ming more processed foods. Comb ined with the high percentage of neighborhoods in the city without places where ch ildren would normally be physically active (i.e. playgro unds, parks, sports fields), thi s signifies a need to focus on a combination of nutrition and physical activity to ensure proper weight and health among the population.

Food Insecurity The following table lists of all Food Insecurity indicators, wh ere the SMMC service area scored poorly according to the secondary data scoring methodology (Tab le 35). Based on the data, rent and housing costs, in addition t o lack of income, are clearly a ffecting the ability of residents in the service area to afford or ha ve reliable access to healthy, fresh, and nutritious foods. Table 35. Food InsecurityRe lated Indicators of Need Indicator Poverty Status by School Enrollment1 Median Household Income: Householders 65+1 Households with Supplemental Security Income1 Median Household Income1 [1] American Community Survey, 20122016 In particular, ZIP Code 90813 has by far the lowest median hous ehold income for both the general population and over adul ts, with values of $31,775 and $21,552, respectively (Table 36). These values are over $10,00 0 and over $5,000 lower than t he next lowest median household incomes of ZIP Codes in the service area, respectivel y. Additionally, and perhaps unsurprisingly, that ZIP Code als o has the highest percentage o f schoolaged children (ages 5 19) who are living below the fede ral poverty level and are enro lled in 0723, 90731, and 90805 also all have high er percentages of this population than the city, county, and state averages. Compared to their peers, children in poverty are more likely to have physical health problems due to lack of food security and nutrition, which can often lead to behavioral and emotional pro blems. Residents in ZIP Codes with the ab ovementioned concerns are li kely to be unable to afford all basic amenities of life and are likely fighting for secure hous ing, food, employment, health care, and more. These areas are likely hotbeds for food insecurity is sues, as the majority of renters \"I appreciate having libraries and parks, because it keeps me physically active by having somewhere to go. I want safe places to exercise, do yoga, and have picnics.\" \"I want public parks to be clean, because I enjoy the opportunity to get physically active. But I feel uncomfortable, if it is not clean.\" St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 70 have limited money to spend on food due to high rent costs and low incomes, as residents are being forced to choose and prioritize between housing and rent related costs and proper nutritious food.

Additionally, almost half of children in the city d rink soda or sugarsweetened beverages daily, while only 82.5% of adults have easy access to fresh produce. Given that food insecurity is defined as limited or uncertain availability of n utritionally adequate foods or uncertain ability to acquire the se foods in socially acceptable ways, both lack of fresh produce access and frequency of nutrition ally inadequate beverage intak e are important indications of food insecurity issues in the city. The poverty rate for very y oung children (under the age of St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 71 five) is higher for the city com pared to the county and the sta te, likely indicating food security issues for this vulnerable population.

Findings of Identified Health Needs Environment The indicators in Figure 22 are the Environmentrelated indicat ors, where the SMMC service area showed need based on the se condary data. The overall servi ce area need was calculated for each indicator by using a wei ghted average of need for each individual ZIP Code within the service area based on each ZIP Code's population per ZIP Code. The data shows that emergency room visit rates due to asthma f or all ages are of high concern for the service area. Figure 22. EnvironmentRelated Indicators of Need Indicator AgeAdjusted ER Rate due to Asthma5 AgeAdjusted ER Rate due to Adult Asthma5 AgeAdjusted ER Rate due to Pediatric Asthma5 [5] Office of Statewide Heal th Planning and Development Notably, ZIP Code 90813 has the h ighest rates of ER rates due t o both all asthma (109.2 ER visits per 10,000 population) and adult asthma (106.4 ER visits per 10 ,000 population 18 years of age and older) (Table 40). This ZIP C ode has rates more than double the county and state rates for both measures. It also has the se cond highest rate in the servi ce area for emergency visits due to pediatric asthma. Additiona lly, ZIP Codes 90731, 90806, and 90805 are all in the top five of the highest rates in the SMMC service area for all three of the se asthma measures. Reducing exposure to poor housing conditions, traffic pollution, secondh and smoke, and other factors impacting air quality - as well a s decreasing the existence of these environmental harms in the first place - can help prevent asthma and also help those with it better manage the health condition in order to prevent emergency situations.

For SMMC's service area, all but nine ZIP Co des have higher percentages of the houses in their service area that were built prior to 1950 than the state of California aver age. This indicates a lack of new and affordable housing in the ZI P Codes and the City of Long Be ach and a propensity for those who own buildings and land to con tinue housing tenants in unsaf e environments due to the demand in the area for housing. ZIP Codes 90806, 90221, 90807, and 90813 all have over 40% of their houses that are greater than 65 years old. For PBT and recognized carcinoge ns released, ZIP Code 90810 sta nds out as a geographical area of concern. There were 1,754.65 pounds of PBT released into the environment in 90810 in 2014, which is more than four time s as much as any other ZIP Co de in the service area. Additionally, 90810 had the seco nd most pounds of recognized ca rcinogens released into the air in 2017 in the service area, with 14,501.75 pounds. Hazmat sites, or areas contaminated with hazardous substances a nd pollutants making them unsafe for people to live or work, are a proxy measure for othe r potential environmental issues St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 75 in a geographic area. The number of Hazmat sites by ZIP Code fo r the City of Long Beach in 2017 provides an enhanced picture that ZIP Codes 90813, 90805, 90802, and 90806 are particularly environmentally uns afe in relation to the rest of the city. Each of these ZIP Codes have greater than 100 Hazmat sites in their boundaries, whereas the highest number in any other ZIP Code in the service area is only 82.14 Of these, ZIP Codes 9 0813, 90802, and 90806 all also have some of the highest rates of people and families livi ng in poverty in the city. This correlation between areas that are potentially environmentally less safe and poor people and families living in those areas mar ks a clear concern about the health of populations based on their geographical location. Lead poisoning is an environmental health problem due to exposu re to dust from deteriorating lead paint in older homes, such as those built prior to 1950. F rom 2012 through 2018, lead poisoning cases were tracked in L ong Beach City. ZIP Code 90813 again has had the most cases (11), accounting for nearly one t hird of all cases in the city during that time period and contributing to the environmental health concern for that speci fic ZIP Code. ZIP Code 90806 had the second most, with six total cases. 14 While the number of case s over this time period is not notably large, ZIP Code 90813 is also the same ZIP Code wit h the most Hazmat sites and the highest percentages of people liv ing in poverty in the city. Fu rther, 40.2% of houses in this ZIP Code were built prior to 1950 - a major contributing factor to lead poisoning as well as other environmental health issues - the third highest percentage of a ll ZIP Codes in the SMMC service area, and much higher than the city value (34.2%), county value (25.8%), and state value (15.5%). Other environmental indicators o f note for Long Beach City are shown in Table 41. The city has a greater percentage of neighborhoods without walking paths, pa rks playgrounds, or sports fields than the county average, and it also has a higher percen tage of adults who have been told by a health care provider that they currently have asthma than the state of California average. Additionally, there is a lower percentage of adults wi th \"very or somewhat\" easy access to fresh produce than the percentage for the county as a whole. While access to parks and fresh produce are not direct natural environment measures, they both provide an insight into the build environment, which can impact people's health in similar ways. Access to parks and fresh produce can both indicate areas that may be more envi ronmentallyfriendly, with green spaces and land that is potentially not as polluted and b uilt up by industry.

Childhood asthma rates are a lso high in Long Beach. o There are many health issues associated with the particulate ma tter pollution from the area's industry. The city can, should and does play a leadershi p role in this matter. o Overcrowding is also an environme ntal concern in central Long B each, as about a quarter an acre of land is associated with about 1,000 residents. o Many discussions are occurring regarding the placement of freew ays and power plants compared to parks and open spaces . The historical context is st rong in these conversations. o Structurally disempowered communi ties are generally lowincome communities of color, geographically located in central, west, and north Long Beach. o Support agricultural tax break policies in Long Beach, where pe ople can get tax breaks by growing healthy foods on their l and. These kinds of projects he lp reduce crime while improving perceptions of safety. o Houses are old and often do not meet code standards in Long Bea ch. These old housing units expose tenants to pests, m old and other kinds of problems that cause chronic conditions. o There is much air pollution due to proximity to the port, rail, and trucking corridor along the 710 due to the emission from diesel. More financial support is needed to support this issue. Those living closer to these areas are at greater risk f or exposure and adverse health outcomes. o It is important for residents to access healthy foods and green spaces, while being able to go outside and play without breathing toxic emissions. o More research and feasibility assessments will be done to deter mine the impact on environmental hazards on the popu lation, helping to determine t he future interventions to address this problem. o The environment elicited respo nses and comments on environmenta l health hazards, particularly outdoor air polluti on and the impact pollution has on the quality of life. o Placebased health, specifically that living in particular zip codes impacts health outcomes. \"Sometimes you don't want to go outside or workout, because you don't want to breathe the air.

Substance Abuse Table 42 displays indicators, wher e some ZIP Codes in the SMMC service area have significantly higher values than the city, county, and state values - despite these indicators not being considered of need for the overa ll service area as a whole. In addition to the measures listed below, the smoking rate among adults is still a problem in some parts of the service area, such as ZIP Codes 90813 (19.5%), 9080 4 (17.5%), 90806 (16.7%), and 9 0731 (16.5%), which all have higher rates than the Long Beach City value (14.2%). Further, o nly six ZIP Codes in the service area meet the Healthy People 2020 target of maximum 12.0% of ad ults who smoke.4 Table 42.

ZIP Code 90813's value is more than double the city and county values for alcohol abuse and more than double the county valu e for substance abuse. Addition ally, this ZIP Code has the second highest hospitalization rate for alcohol abuse and the t hird highest for substance abuse as well (Table 43). Clearly, ZIP Code 90813 is an area of major concern for substance abuse issues, and the high rates of em ergency room visits and hospita lizations indicate that those suffering from substance abuse are not getting the help they ne ed in order to avoid extreme health emergencies. ZIP Code 9073 1 is also a notable area of co ncern for these substance abuse issues. Table 43.

Opioid Prescripti on Rate shows the number of opioid drug prescription per 10, 000 population by patient's loc ale, while Opioid Prescription Patients shows the percentage of the population that is a patie nt who has been prescribed an opioid. In the service area, ZIP Code 90731 has the highest opi oid prescription rate (417.4 prescriptions per 10,000 population), as well as the highest pe rcentage of patients who have been prescribed opioids (3.4%). Other ZIP Codes of 90755, 90802, a nd 90806. For Long Beach City as a whole, it is notable that the percenta ge of adults who smoke in the City (15.1%) is higher than both the Los Angeles County value a nd California value (both 11.7%), and 3.1% higher than the Healthy People 2020 target of 12%.4 Additionally, the trend of adults St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 79 who smoke is increasing over time, although not in a statistica lly significant manner. Further, the number of total years of potential life list (YPLL) due to drug overdoses is over 80 more per 100,000 population in the City than in Los Angeles County, with a trend that is also increasing unfavorably over time.9 Focusing on marijuana knowledge and use, a Cannabis education s urvey done by GreenlightLB found that 72.5% of participants k new the legal age to use cann abis is 21 years or older.23 Additionally, 21.3% believed th at Cannabis is harmful, while 15 % believe it to be harmless, and 85.9% thought that frequent or heavy cannabis use is harmful to youth. Further, the majority of the respondents, of which 46.6% have used cannabis to some exte nt, reported that it was false that cannabis smoke contained many of the same harmful chemical s as tobacco smoke, while 21% admitted they did not know. 39.4% of respondents did not kn ow that THC can pass to babies through breast milk, 75.1% answered that is not legal to use nonmedicinal cannabis in public, 91.7% answered it is not legal to drive while high from cannabis, and 87% believe that it is not safe to drive high from cannabis use.23 The survey also asked about mar ijuana usage, categorized under the following categories: former user or nonuser, moderat e user, or heavy user. 100% of respondents from ZIP Code 90810 were either moderate or he avy users per the survey, while ZIP Codes 90803 and 90804 had greater than two thirds of their survey respondents who eit her use cannabis moderately or heavily. Further, the survey asked about marijuana usage on the basis of if the respondent has ever or has never used marijuana. Greater than 50% of responden ts all reported having used marijuana at least once. Lastly, for cannabis usage method by a ge group across all ZIP Codes in the city, the survey results found that 25 to 34 year olds are most likely to use cannabis via smoking or vaping (59.5%), while 18 to 24 year olds are most li kely to use cannabis by concentrates (42.9%). At least a fifth of users in the followin g age groups prefer edible or beverage usage: 17 and under, 35 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 64, and 65 plus. 23 Primary Data Snapshot: S ubstance Use and Misuse o People are becoming more aware o f pressing issues related to dr ugs or opioids, alcohol use, and mental health disorders, recognizing that these issues need attention now. o It is imperative to help those who are homeless or have mental health or drug addiction issues through resources and education. o Long Beach does not have enough detox beds for people who want to recover from substance abuse. Getting the county and state to work together with policymakers would be ideal to make substance trea tment beds more accessible. o Substance use is a rising issue in Long Beach. There is not eno ugh substance abuse help in the city. o There is a need for more acute detox services, which are very l imited compared to long term rehabs that are also needed. o The Housing First Model Program offers housing and support with out the previous requirements that prevented many p eople from getting the necess ary substance abuse St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 80 treatment. o Support groups such as Alcoholics A nonymous are available in ma ny locations, which helps to break isolation and bring people together. o More trained people and longterm rehabilitation services are n eeded for substance abuse issues. o There are not many mental heal th facilities for adults in Long Beach. We need a stronger care coordinated program for th ose who are homeless or returnin g to society from prison. o People with mental illnesses may b e more likely to be substance abusers and homeless. o Prescription drug abuse is a gateway to substance abuse and an issue that residents face. o Community members acknowledge the intersections of substance ab use, mental health, and homelessness. Prioritization results o 86% of survey respondents stated that it was \"Important\" or \"Ve ry Important\" to address substance use and misuse in the Long Beach area. o 25% of survey respondents felt Lo ng Beach could increase coordi nation of mental health resources with LA County to inc rease access to behavioral healt h services including drug and alcohol detox and recovery beds. Pregnancy & Birth Outcomes Maternal health before, during, and after pregnancy, as well as infant mortality are widely used indicators of the overall health status of a community. Materna l complications during pregnancy can lead to infant deaths, and lack of access to prop er pre and postnatal care can cause adverse birth outcomes. In the City of Long Beach, there were 113 infant deaths from 20 13 to 2017. The leading cause of infant mortality in the city was Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ( SIDS), as it is in many places across the state and country. Ther e were 16 deaths due to SIDS in Long Beach over the time span, followed by 15 deaths due t o complications from extremely low birthweight and premature births. 32 Broken down by Long Beach City ZIP Code, the most infant death s derive from ZIP Code 90805 (26.5% of in fant deaths for the (14.2%), Code 90802 has the highest infa nt mortality rate of any ZIP Code at 6.9 deaths per 1,000 live births. Additionally, Figure 23 shows the breakdown of all infant deaths in Long Beach over the fiveyear time period by r ace/ethnicity. Notably, more than half of all the infant deaths in Long Beach have been Hisp anic/Latino, for a rate of 4.0 deaths per 1,000 live births for that subgroup. With 30 infant deaths during the same span, the infant mortality rate for the Black/AfricanAmerican group is 7 .3 deaths per 1,000 live births, by \"Fairly recently, I lost a dear friend from suicide and it was all behind pain meds.

Infant Deaths in Long Beach City by Race/Ethnicity, 2013201732 [32] Long Beach Department of Hea lth and Human S ervices, Vital Statistics Report, 2013-2017 The overall teen pregnancy rate declined by 45.6% from 2013 to 2017 for the City of Long Beach and for each racial/ethni c subgroup. However, some subgro ups still have much higher teenage pregnancy rates than others, notably those of Hispanic/ Latino ethnicity who had a rate of 23.0 pregnancies per 1,000 po pulation in 2017. This is subst antially higher than the overall city rate of 14.6. By ZIP Code, 90813, 90806, and 90805 have th e highest teen pregnancy rates, at 29.0, 21.0, and 20.3 pregnanc ies per 1,000 population, respe ctively.32 Figure 24 shows the low (less than 2,500 grams at birth) and ve ry low (less than 1,500 grams at birth) birthweight rates broken down by race/ethnicity for the City of Long Beach from 2013 2017. Notably, the Black/African American subgroup has the high est low birthweight and very low birthweight rates in the cit y across the time period. These measures, which are associated with poorer outcomes disproportio nately affect Black/African Am erican infants in the city, which is an issue that can be addressed with various methods du ring pregnancy and also birth. Across age groups for the very low birthweight measure, the rat es are fairly similar for the five year time period, with those 35 years of age and older slightly more at risk of having a very low birthweight baby (1.8 versus 1.4 for the city overall). 32 St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 82 Figure 24. Low and Very Low Bir thweight Rates by Race/Ethnicity for Long Beach City, 2013201732 [32] Long Beach Department of Hea lth and Human S ervices, Vital Statistics Report, 2013-2017 Another metric to help measure p regnancy and birth outcomes is length and frequency of prenatal care. In Long Beach Cit y, teenage mothers are much les s likely than mothers aged 20 and above to start prenatal care in the first trimester (68.6% versus over 80% for all other age groups).32 Additionally, those in the Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian rac e/ethnicity group are substantially less likely to start prenatal care in the first t rimester than other race/ethnic subgroups (Figure 25).

Public health efforts should review and utilize the Clean Air Action Plan. This plan specif ically recognize s how these en vironmental hazards impact the most sensitive populations, i ncluding the elderly, children , pregnant women and people with chronic illnesses. o All populations, but especially the sensitive ones such as the elderly, children and pregnant women, need additional protectio ns from the environmental hazar ds in the Long Beach area. o Black or African American partic ipants cited discrimination bas ed on income, race, and insurance type as a direct condition that contributes to poor p regnancy and birth outcomes in the community. o Providers' lack of cultural competence inhibits full understand ing of Black or African American family experiences. o A solution proposed for improvin g birth outcomes for Black or A frican American families was to diversify the health care workforce. Prioritization results o 71% of survey respondents stated that it was \"Important\" or \"Ve ry Important\" to address pregnancy and birth outcomes in the Long Beach area. Preventive Practices Table 44 displays indicators relat ed to the topic of area of Pr eventive Practices, where SMMC's service area showed more than average need. While there is need for increased insurance coverage and easier access to ca re, particularly for older adul ts and children, there are other measures more directly related to prevention that are also of c oncern. For instance, the behavioral health issue of preve nting adverse health effects vi a physical activity is an issue in the service area. Further, immuni zations are a consistent issue for those that SMMC serves, especially related to preventable illnesses such as pneumonia a nd influenza. Table 44.

This is twofold: on the one hand, the se are diseases that can be pr evented before they occur with immunizations, and secondly, it can show the use of the emergen cy room as a primary care facility when looking at diseases that can normally be treated at home or in a doctor's office. In the SMMC service area, half of th e ZIP Codes (eight of 16) have hospitalization rates due to immunizationpreventable pneumon ia and influenza greater than 1 .6 hospitalizations per 10,000 adult population (the Los A ngeles county value), and ove r half the ZIP Codes (nine of 16) have emergency room visit rates due to the same conditions grea ter than 8.9 visits per 10,000 adult population (the Los Angele s county and Long Beach City va lues) (Table 45). Notably, ZIP Codes 90731 (16.4) and 90813 (16.1) have ER visit rates almost double the city and county values of 8.9. Additionally, when focusing on children a nd immunizations, ZIP Codes 90803, 90808, 90814, and 90815 all had fewer than 40% of their children (ages six months to 11 years) who received an influenza vaccination in the past year. The seasonal influenza vaccine can prevent serious illness and death, especially in children, with CDC recommending annual vaccinations to prevent the spread of the disease and adverse s ide effects that it causes. Education and awareness about the importance of this vaccinatio n is important for adults and families with children in these Z IP Codes of need in the servic e area. Physical activity is another asp ect of the preventive practices category that is an area of need. In SMMC's service area, behavio ral practices, such as walking o r biking to work and engaging in physical activity each day, are a particular issue in ZIP Code 90745. This ZIP Code has the lowest percentage of workers who walk to work (with the only value in the service area less than 1%), and the second lowest percentage of workers who bike to work (l ess than 0.5%) (Table 45). Further, for the service area as a whole, only four ZIP Codes h ave higher percentages of workers walking to work than Long Beach City, and only four also have h igher percentages of workers biking to work than the city ave rage. Any daily physical activi ty, even if just in the form of commuting to work, can drastica lly improve health and wellbein g of those who might otherwise be sedentary.

Tuberculosis is preve nted via screening for those at high risk, early detection and treatment through awareness and access to care, and vaccination for those at high risk.

They may not know how to access t he necessary healthcare servic es. o Lack of screening people for cer tain conditions is difficult. A ccessing and treating mental health patients are challenging. Lack of training and limited t ime are also factors along with high turnover rates in hospitals. o It is important to keep people housed, as it is more humane and less costly in the end. o Keeping people from being homeless helps prevent many other iss ues related to nutrition, St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 87 chronic disease treatment, and sa fety from interpersonal violen ce. o Use an integrated approach to provide healthcare. Provide healt hcare units, where social workers, police and nurses work together in the field. o Continue to support government sectors and nonprofits that prov ide activities and facilities for free or low cost to seniors, youth and families, including gyms and daycare centers. o Providing healthcare for all youth should be a systemic, longt erm goal. o Continue to support and/or suppor t agricultural tax break polic ies in Long Beach, where people can get tax breaks by grow ing healthy foods on their lan d. These kinds of projects help reduce crime while impro ving perceptions of safety. o There are many parts of Long Beach with limited access to healt hy foods. Improving access to healthy food is critical for p eople to improve and manage th eir health. o Perception of crime is actually a bigger issue than crime itsel f in many communities in Long Beach. Adopting a more robust, h olistic approach on violence pr evention would be ideal. o The city council in Long Beach ha s an initiative called Divide by Nine, addressing the concept of equality not equaling equity. Efforts should be made to inve st in youth through education, prevention and early intervention strategies. o Education on resources available to promote health and wellbei ng was acknowledged throughout focus groups. o Residents suggested working to sh ift public perception of \"safe ty\" to include public health, which would take an upstream, preventive approach. Prioritization results o 69% of survey respondents stated that it was \"Important\" or \"Ve ry Important\" to address preventive practices in the Long Beach area. Sexually Transmi tted Infections For Long Beach City, indicators in Table 47 are those related t o Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) that showed as having the highest need in the city.

St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 100 o Some of the greatest needs in Lo ng Beach involve preventable ch ronic diseases like diabetes, obesity, heart disease and stroke. More efforts shoul d be focused on them. o Other chronic conditions that need to be addressed include asth ma, high blood pressure, and hepatitis B & C. o The increased risk of cancer around the two ports in Long Beach contributes to the premature death rates in the area. Public health efforts should review and utilize the Clean Air Action Plan. This plan specif ically recognize s how these en vironmental hazards impact the most sensitive populations, i ncluding the elderly, children , pregnant women and people with chronic illnesses. o Poor air quality and pollution were discussed as they influence chronic diseases such as asthma and obesity. o Alzheimer's mortality is a rising issue that should garner more focus. Vulnerable Populations As a part of the IRS CHNA require ments, special attention shoul d be made to vulnerable and marginalized communities in data gathering and analysis. The he alth needs of vulnerable and marginalized communities were identified through two methods in this CHNA process: (1) the analysis of secondary data indicators for any disparities by ag e, race/ethnicity, or gender; and (2) community input participants were asked how health issues i mpacted particular communities. The following section presents the findings around these vulnerable populations and how they should be considered for future implementation pla nning. LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, T ransgender, Queer or Data was specifically for the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bis exual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning) population to determine needs for this vulnerable group in Long Beach. In terms of demographics of this subpopulation, a random sampling of 76 persons accessing mental health services at The LGBTQ Ce nter Long Beach in 2017 found th at 40% reported their cultural identity as White, 34% as Latinx, 11% as Black, 9% mixed race/e thnicity, Islander, and 1% Middle Eastern. Additionally, 21% selfidentif ied as transgender or gender nonconforming. When looking closer at other attributes of this population, 42% reported earning less than $13,000 per year, 63% less than $23,500 per y ear, and 56% reported depression and/or anxiety.24 Further data found that there were 117 new survivors and victim s of domestic violence in the LGBTQ domestic violence program in Long Beach in 2016. Two thir ds of those survivors and victims are between the ages of 25 and 39, 9% are transgender o r Black/Afr icanAmerican. Of the survivor s, 72% have the sexual orientation of gay, lesbian, or bisexual, while only 16% identi fy as heterosexual. 3% had undocumented immigration status a t the time of data collection, and 6% are HIVpositive, with 23% not knowing their HIV status. 25 St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 101 The 2017 Transitional Age You th (TAY) Needs Assessment conducte d by The LGBTQ Center Long Beach showed that nearly half of respondents in this population identified as multiracial, with an additional 22.86% identifying as Latino. More respondents we re unemployed (29.41%) than were employed with fulltime job s (23.52%) at the time of the a ssessment. Importantly, barely over half of participants were a ware of employment resources av ailable to them such as Pacific Gateway and The Center, and of t hose, only 12.2% had accessed a ny resources for employment help.26 Further of all TAY cases intake in 2017, only 37.7% of clients were retained past intake, which means that nearly twothird s of those who came in as TAY cases did not attend at least one follow up appointment with y outh services, either in person or remotely. This further indicates a lack of utilization, or inability to utilize, resou rces available to those in need in this community.26 Over half (54.25%) of participants noted housing or rent as the ir most pressing financial need, symbolizing the dire housing issue in Long Beach and the height ened housing issue for this subpopulation. Further, 14.2% of participants had experienced a t least one night of homelessness, including couch surfing and living on the street, in the last five years.26 Additionally, TAY case management tracking found that 29.0% of clients were homeless upon intake, with 39.3% reporting hou sing insecurity, which includes hostile home environment, inability to maintain rent or finances, couch surfing, and othe r issues that threaten stable housing. To further the point of the housing crisis, nearly thr ee quarters of TAY case clients in Long Beach reported needing housing resources - the top most ne ed - followed by mental health services (68.9%) and empl oyment resources (59.0%). Becau se of the lack of youth shelters in Long Beach, many hom eless TAY client intakes are re ferred out to other agencies that have housing placement.27 Older Adults According to the secondary data an alysis results, the indicator s listed in Table 49 are those in the Older Adults & Aging topic a rea that are of concern for SMM C's service area. The service area's older adult population i s afflicted by issues related to the social determinants of health, including linguistic barriers, i nsurance coverage, and income. Table 49. Older Adults Indicators of Need Indicator People who have Difficulty Speaking English: 65+1 Adults 65+ without Health Insurance1 Median Household Income: Householders 65+1 [1] American Community Survey Given that the value for the Cit y of Long Beach's older adults (65+) without health insurance is 1.4%, this is an area of particu lar concern for SMMC's service area. ZIP Code 90744 has 4.4% of its older adults without health insurance, while nine other ZIP Codes have percentages higher than the city value. The value s for this indicator show a need for better assistance programs, or awareness of the existence of such programs, that can provide i nsurance to those who are retired or no longer able to wor k. Older adults are an especial ly vulnerable population that St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 102 require more care than the gene ral population and thus will suf fer disproportionately from a lack of insurance. Economic factors are also a soci al determinant of health issue for older adults in some areas of the service area. Most notably , ZIP Codes 90813, 90802, and 908 06 are the ZIP Codes of most concern in the area in terms of older adults' household income, with median values less than $30,000 per year - over $10,000 le ss than the city, county, and state medians. ZIP Code 90813 also has the highest percentage of those over the age of 65 who have difficulty speaking English - another factor that can exacer bate healthcare issues in addit ion to insurance and money. With over half of the older adult population unable to speak En glish very well in ZIP Codes 90813, 90723, and 90744, those populations are at more risk of being unable to adequately or easily navigate the healthcare system. For the City of Long Beach, both male and female older adult gr oups in Long Beach City have a lower percentage of those who ha ve received the recommended pre ventive services than the national average (Table 50). Furt her, the hospitalization rate among adults 65 years of age and older due to immunizationprevent able pneumonia and influenza i n Long Beach City (6.7 hospitalizations per 10,000 popul ation 65 plus) is greater than the rate for both Los Angeles County (6.5) and the state of California (5.8).

Older adults who are eligible for CalFr esh signifies a certain level of need, either in terms of poverty, lack of support, to help with a disability, or to help with med ical expenses for that older adult population. When broken down by Z IP Code, the percentages of th e older adult population who were eligible for, but unenrolle d in, CalFresh in 2017 indicat e stark contrast in awareness of, St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 103 access to, or ability to enroll in the CalFresh program based o n geographical location. While the east pat of the city does not ha ve any areas where greater than 13% of the eligible senior population is not enrolled in the program, both central and nor th Long Beach have geographical areas where more than a fifth of the eligible CalFresh populati on is not enrolled.28 This signifies that these percentages of people are in need, but are not utili zing the resources available to them through CalFresh to help address those needs. Further CalFresh data shows that overall for all census tracts in Long Beach City, 7.72% of the population 60 years of age and ol der who are eligible for CalFr esh are unenrolled. Additionally, only 8.53% total of households w ith a person over 60 years of a ge living in the household are enrolled in CalFresh. Further, in Long Beach City census tracts , 13.74% of the population over the age of 60 is living in poverty. 1 Purposeful Aging Los Angeles (PALA) provides data from 2017 on the oral health of adults over 50 years of age in Long. 29 Analysis was done to determine if there was statistical signif icance between the ZIP Code of respondent s to an older adult survey an d whether they have dental insurance or have had a dental exam in the past three years. Cr osstabs analysis and Chi Square tests showed that there was not enough evidence to declare that there was a statistically significant relationship between ZIP Codes and dental insurance , however trends showed that the lowest percentage of respondents reporting having dental in surance were in ZIP Codes 90806 and 90803 (Figure 32). Figure 32. Older Adults Survey Re spondents with Dental Insuranc e by ZIP Code, 2017 [29] Purposeful Aging Los Angeles (PALA), Oral Health report However, tests showed that ZIP C ode did have a statistically si gnificant relationship with dental exams. The ZIP Codes with the hi ghest percentage of responses i ndicating they had not had a dental exam in the last three years were 90806 and 90804 (Figur e 33). Of note, ZIP Code 90806 showed up as an area of concern and need for both low dental in surance and low dental exams. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 104 Figure 33. Older Adults Survey Re spondents with Dental Exam in Past 3 Years by ZIP Code, 2017 [29] Purposeful Aging Los Angeles (PALA), Oral Health report A test was also conducted to deter mine if there was a relations hip between age of respondent and dental insurance status, and the results showed that there was a statistical association. The results found that older age gro ups were generally less likely to have dental insurance, with only 47.1% of respondents aged 7079 and 55.6% of respondents a ged 8089 with dental insurance. More than 60% of thos e under the age of 70 responded that they have dental insurance.29 Persons with Disabilities According to the secondary data analysis results, the indicator listed in Table 51 is the indicator of most need in the Persons with Disabilities topic area for SM MC's service area. Additionally, a number of ZIP Codes in the servic e area have higher values than the city, county, and state for people with a disability who are living in poverty. Table 51. Persons with Disabilities Indicators of Need Indicator Households with Supplemental Security Income1 [1] American Community Survey In comparison to Long Beach City (29.3%), Los Angeles County (2 7.0%), and the state of California (26.3%), ZIP Codes 9 0813, 90802, 908 06, 90731, and 9 0804 have higher percentages of people with a disability living in poverty. Those with disab ilities are often more susceptible to other health issues and are thus e ven more vulnerable to health issues stemming from poverty or exacerbated by the lack of ab ility to pay for proper medicin e, care, and services. Additionally, Households with S upplemental Security Income (SSI ) is the disabilityrelated measure showing most need for SMMC 's service area. SSI is a Fed eral income supplement program designed to help older adults, blind, and otherwise dis abled people who have little or no income. This proxy measure fo r those with disability who nee d help meeting basic needs St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 105 such as food, clothing, and shelter, shows that again ZIP Codes 90813 and 90806 are the two ZIP Codes of most need, with 10% or more of households receiving SSI - over three percent more than the city value of 6.7% and nearly double the national average. Race/Ethnic Minority Populations According to the secondary data for Long Beach City, in Long Be ach Unified School District, Black or African American fourth graders had the lowest percent age of any subgroup of students who are proficient in mat h (65%), followed by the Hisp anic or Latino subgroup (69%). In comparison, the overall valu e for all students in the school district is 74%. In terms of English and language arts proficiency, the Hispanic or Latino subgroup had only 54% of its students proficient, with Black or African Americans next at 55%. Both o f these values are substantially below the overall school district value of 62% for all students .30 For physical fitness and healthy weight among students in the s chool district, the Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander s ubgroup has high need for the Cit y of Long Beach. For 5 th grade students, only 29.0% of that subgroup is at a healthy weight or underweight, compared to 55.2% overall for all students. For 9th graders, 41.1% of Native Haw aiian or Pacific Islanders were at a healthy weight or underw eight, the lowest of any race /ethnicity group, compared to an overall value of 66.8%. Lastly, among 7th graders who are physically fit, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders are again the subgroup of most need with only 53.2% of the students in the school district from this subgroup physically fit (compared to 66.4% for the entire student population).31 For rates of hospitalization due t o hypertension, the Black or AfricanAmerican subgroup fares significantly worse than the ove rall city value, with a rate mo re than double any other race/ethnicity group. Additionally , for alcohol abuse hospitali zations, the rate for Whites is significantly worse than the ove rall city value and all other s ubgroup rates. 5 Veterans According to the secondary data scoring results, the indicator in Table 52 is the veteransrelated indicator of most need for the SMMC service area. In addition t o the issue of veterans living in poverty, there are also parts of the service area that struggle with veteran unemployment and lack of educational attainment for veterans. Table 52. VeteransRelat ed Indicators of Need Indicator Veterans Living Below Poverty1 [1] American Community Survey ZIP Codes 90813 and 90802 all have m ore than a fifth of their v eteran population living below the poverty level, while ZIP Cod e 90814 has 17.7% of veterans l iving in poverty, with 14.9% unemployed - the highest veteran unemployment percentage in the service area. Further, six other ZIP Codes have higher unemployment rates for their vetera ns than the City of Long Beach as a whole. Additionally, the unemployment trend over time has not been notably changing for St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 106 this subgroup population, despite the overall employment rate i mproving over recent years. Unemployment and poverty levels a re particularly striking for t he veteran population as it is often more difficult for those r eturning from service to gain a nd hold steady jobs, and this population is often in need of mo re economic help due to other issues they must deal with upon returning home. Similarly, nine of the 16 SMMC se rvice area ZIP Codes have lowe r percentages of their veterans with at least a high school degr ee than Long Beach City's value of 95.5%. Notably, only 88.8% of veterans in ZIP Code 90723 have a t least a high school degree, over four percent less than the city, county, and state values. Ve terans are a vulnerable popul ation that often suffer from health issues stemming from thei r service or side effects to th eir service. A high school degree provides the potential ability for veterans to find and maintai n work, allowing them to earn an income and gain health insurance that can help deal with health issues later in life. Women & Children According to the secondary data an alysis results, the indicator s in Table 53 are those related to women and children that are tro ubling for the SMMC service area . For children, economic security is an issue in the region, along with problems related to vaccinations, access to care, asthma, and regular exercise and physical activity. Table 53. Women & Children Indicators of Need Indicator Children with Influenza Vaccination4 Children Living Below Poverty Level1 Children and Teens Delayed or had Difficulty Obtaining Care4 SingleParent Female Households1 Young Children Living Below Poverty Level1 AgeAdjusted ER Rate due to Pediatric Asthma5 Children who are Overweight for Age4 [4] California Health Interview Survey, Neighborhood Edition [1] American Community Survey, 20122016 [5] California Office of Statew ide Health Planning and Developm ent ZIP Codelevel data shows areas w here these measures are of par ticular need when focusing on children in SMMC's service area. As previously discussed, influ enza vaccination in children is crucial to preventing serious illness and potential death, espe cially in very young children. Additionally, as mentioned, utilizing appropriate clinical and preventive services in a timely fashion can have important implications on the progression and treatment of many diseases in children, with delays in necessary care increasing risk of comp lications of otherwise more easily treatable conditions. ZIP Code 908 03 has the lowest percentage of children with an influenza vaccination at only 36.3%, compared to the county value of 47.9 % and the state value of 55.4%. That same ZIP Code, 90803, also ha s the highest percentage of c hildren and teens who report having delayed or had difficulty obtaining care they needed (13 .7%). St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 107 Additionally, economic insecur ity - summed up by the indicators Children Living Below Poverty Level and Young Children Living B elow Poverty Level - is proble matic for parts of the region. ZIP Code 90813 has the highest percent ages for both these measures with 46.3% children living in poverty and 44.9% young childre n facing this challenge. ZIP Cod es 90744 and 90805 are also both of concern for these metric s. This group of the youth popu lation represents those who potentially do not have health in surance coverage, may be invol ved in lifestyles that are not conducive to good health and welln ess, and may not be receiving needed care or education about favorable behavioral practices. Lastly, ZIP Codes 90731, 90813, 90805, 90806, 9 0802, and 90804 are the ZIP Codes in the service area with higher rates of emergency room visits due to asthma for children under the age of 18 than the city, county, and state values. These areas are likely those more prone to environmental concerns, as well as lack of preventive care, ser vices, or treatment to prevent emergency situations from occurring. Table 54 shows women or children indicators of need for Long Be ach City. Notably, both ER visit and hospitalization rates due to pediatric asthma were higher f or the City of Long Beach than the both the county of Los Angeles and the state of California. Additionally, the rate for ER visits due to pediatric asthma for Long Beach has been increasing unfa vorably over time. Other measures to note are preventive services for both women and chi ldren. Percentages of children who have received an influenza v accination and older females (6 5+) who have received their recommended preventive services a re both lower in comparison to the county, state, and nation. This indicates a need to increase awareness for and abi lity of women and children to receive vaccines and other prev entive immunizations and service s that can prevent other diseases in these vulnerable groups.

Notably, the hospitalization rates due to urinary tract infections and adult asthma are both double for females compared to their male counterparts.5 Additionally, only 60.7% of 7th grade females are physically fit, an indicator of current and future health f or youth, compared to 71.9% for males.31 Conclusion This CHNA for SMMC utilized many processes and indicators to me asure the health and quality of life needs for its service area .

St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 111 Data Scoring Detailed Methodology Data scoring is done in three stages: For each indicator, the Long Beach census place and each ZIP Co de in the service area is assign ed a score based on its compari son to other communities, whether health targets have been met, and th e trend of the indicator value ov er time. These comparison scor es range from 03, where 0 indicates the best outcome and 3 the wo rst. Availability of each type of comparison varies by indicato r and is dependent upon the data source, comparability with data coll ected for other communities, an d changes in methodology over time. ComparisonsQuantitatively score all possible comparisons IndicatorsSummarize comparison scores for each indicator Topics Summarize indicator scores by topic area St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 112 Indicators are categorized into topic areas and each topic area receives a score. Indicators may be categorized in more than o ne topic area. Topic scores are deter mined by the comparisons of a ll indicators within the topic. Comparison to a Distribution of County Values: Within State and Nation For ease of interpretation and analysis, indicator data on the Community Dashboard is visually r epresented as a greenyellowr ed gauge showing how the community is faring against a distributio n of counties in the state or the United States. A distribution is created by taking all ZIP Code values within the county, state or nation, ordering them from low to high, and dividing them in to three groups (green, yellow, red) based on their order. Indicators wi th the poorest comparisons (\"in th e red\") scored high, whereas indicators with good comparison s (\"in the green\") scored low. Comparison to Values: Stat e, National, and Targets Long Beach City and each ZIP Cod e are compared to the city valu e, county value, state value, the national value, and target va lues. Target values include the natio nwide Healthy People 2020 (HP20 20) goals. Healthy People 2020 go als are national objectives fo r improving the health of the nati on set by the Department of Hea lth and Human Services' (DHHS) Healthy People Initiative. For a ll value comparisons, the scoring de pends on whether the city or Z IP Code value is better or worse than the comparison value, as well as how close the city or ZIP Cod e value is to the target value. Trend Over Time The MannKendall statistical test for trend was used to assess whether the city or ZIP Code value is increasing over time or decreasing over time, and whethe r the trend is statistically si gnificant. The trend comparison uses the four most recent compa rable values for the city or ZIP Code, and statistical significance i s determined at the 90% confidenc e level. For each indicator wi th values available for four time periods, scoring was determined by dire ction of the trend and statistical significance. Missing Values Indicator scores are calculated using the comparison scores, av ailability of which depends on th e data source. If the comparis on type is possible for an adequate proportion of indicators on the com munity dashboard, it will be inc luded in the indicator score. A fter exclusion of comparison types w ith inadequate availability, all missing comparisons are substitu ted with a neutral score for t he purposes of calculating the indi cator's weighted average. When information is unknown due to lack of comparable data, the neut ral value assumes that the missing c omparison score is neither good nor bad. St. Mary Medical Center - CHNA 113 Indicator Scoring Indicator scores are calculated as a weighted average of all in cluded comparison scores. If none of the included comparison ty pes are possible for an indicator, no score is calculated, and the indicator is excluded from t he data scoring results. Topic Scoring Indicator scores are averaged by topic area to calculate topic scores. Each indicator may be inc luded in up to three topic are as if appropriate. Resulting scores ran ge from 03, where a higher sc ore indicates a greater level of need as evidenced by the data. A topic score is only calculated i f it includes at least three in dicators.
