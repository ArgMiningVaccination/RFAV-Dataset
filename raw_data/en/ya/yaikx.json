Pa\u00ad tients and Methods: In this prospective case study, we per- formed qualitative interviews with clients and healers about perceived outcomes of spiritual healing treatments. A direct- ed qualitative content analysis was used. In addition, we ap- plied questionnaires (WHOQOL-BREF, General Self-Efficacy Scale, Sense of Coherence 13, SpREUK-15, intensity of com- plaints on visual analogue scale) at baseline and after week 1, month 2 and month 6 which were analysed descriptively. Results: Seven healers and 7 clients participated, 42 inter- views were analysed. In the interviews, the clients described positive body sensations, greater relaxation and well-being as short-term effects of healing treatments. Perceived lon- ger-term effects were related to making significant life changes, creating new meanings, activating resources and improving social relationships. Patients in pain described a reduction of pain intensity. In the questionnaires, the clients reported improvements in quality of life and self-efficacy, to a smaller extent improvements of intensity of complaints and sense of coherence. Conclusion: The results from this pilot study could be useful to choose outcomes of future prospective studies with a larger sample: qualitative assess- ments combined with global and broad quantitative out- comes such as quality of life, self-efficacy and intensity of complaints could be applied. \u00a9 Introduction A healer, often called a \"spiritual\" healer, is defined as a person who exercises the practices of laying hands on, prayers, and/or meditation while most importantly con- sidering himself connected to a transcendent or spiritual power [1-4]. Due to globalization, the techniques and methods of healing have diversified and are now derived from various spiritual and religious practices [5]. Under- standing the field of healing and its practitioners in the German context is difficult due to its variety [5-7]. The field of healing in Germany is often described by the term \"Szene\" (scene), which denotes an indistinct field with a limited degree of organization and a loose, translocal community [5]. From a medical researchers' perspective, spiritual healing can be described as a \"blind spot,\" not only in the German health system. Frequency and cir- cumstances of use, effectiveness and especially the rele- vance of its use to patients, but also potential risks have not been reliably investigated nationally and internation- ally. This may be due to the fact that spiritual healing practices are often perceived as quackery by health pro- fessionals. Spiritual healing does also include religious as- pects, which is difficult to handle by medical profession- als. However, in our experience, a wide range of spiritual self-help techniques are applied by patients, mostly out- side the official medical system. The importance is also reflected in the medical self-help literature that extensive- ly covers healing practices dealing with hand and energy healing (e.g., reiki), prayer, shamanism or spiritual heal- ing practices derived from traditional therapies such as qigong, tai chi or yoga. In a recent qualitative study on spiritual healing in Germany, we focused on the emic perspective to better understand what it means to be a healer and to experience healing treatments as a client. We have previously inter- viewed and observed participants who considered them- selves healers and their clients and reported their subjec- tive experiences, perceived outcomes and explanations [8], biographies [3] and therapeutic relationships [4].In that study, healers and their clients reported per- ceived outcomes of healing treatments including: positive body sensations such as \"warmth\" or \"light,\" increased well-being, more positive emotions and symptomatic re- lief of medical complaints [8]. Clients and healers de- scribed themselves as being connected to transcendent sources (e.g., god, a universal energy, light), which em- powered them to change. Clients reported that they made personal changes by going through a spiritual healing process, reframing their concepts of health, disease, real- ity and identity and reported that they reconsidered what they considered to be important, and subsequently changed their lives. A limitation of our former cross-sectional qualitative case study was a potential community bias (e.g., following recommendations in a healer network) and a potential selection of clients with successful healing stories by their healers. We were unsure whether most clients consulting a healer undergo similar experiences as were described in our previous study. We were also interested in how the perceived healing process would develop over time. Based on our former findings, we planned to observe the outcomes of spiritual healing prospectively in a pilot case study qualitatively. In addition, we wanted to see whether previously identified quantitative questionnaires measure changes when applied in this setting. The aim of this study was to (1) qualitatively observe perceived client-reported outcomes of spiritual healing before and after the healing procedure in interviews and (2) to triangulate the qualitative data with data from vali- dated questionnaires. Methods Design We used a non-controlled, exploratory prospective case study design with a mainly qualitative research focus and conducted in- terviews with clients and healers. In addition, a set of quantitative questionnaires was distributed to the clients. The study was ap- proved by the ethics committee of the Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsme- dizin Berlin (EA1/238/10; 29.07.2013). Sample A snowball sampling technique was used to recruit healers [9]. This technique is useful for recruiting hidden populations that are difficult to access. We first contacted the healers from our first study and asked them to participate. We also contacted new healers, who were identified through German healer organizations with membership lists and a Google homepage search (search terms: \"Geistheilung,\" \"Geistheiler\" and \"place\"). Healers wishing to par - ticipate in our study were asked to invite new clients to participate and contact us prior to the first healing session if interested. Inter - ested clients were contacted by our researchers by telephone and asked to participate. Participating clients were then visited in per - son and included after informed consent had been given. We paid an expense allowance of EUR 100 each to healers and clients for participating in the interviews and completing the questionnaires. Perceived Outcomes of Spiritual Healing267 Complement Med Res 2019;26:265-275 DOI: 10.1159/000496736The following inclusion criteria were applied. Healers should be at least 18 years of age or older and provide written informed consent. Clients should be 18 years of age or older, have had no previous treatment by their new healer and provide written in- formed consent. The following exclusion criteria applied: healers with lack of knowledge of the German language; clients suffering from diseas- es that would not allow them to participate in the study (e.g., being unable to speak, cognitive impairment, loss of orientation).Outcomes Clients and healers were interviewed both after the first treat- ment, at month 2 and month 6. Our interview guideline had a semi-structured approach and consisted of open-ended questions for healers and clients (Table 1). We intentionally did not inter- view clients at baseline because we suspected that an in-depth in- terview with a researcher might influence their expectation of, per- ception of and meaning taken from the first healing session. Inter- views were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim including a pseudonymization of personal data. The text files were then add-Table 1.

Written memos of the interviews provided further information on the set- ting, non-verbal expressions of the interviewees, as well as the re- searchers' subjective experiences.Questionnaires were distributed to clients at baseline, after week 1 (after the first treatment session), at month 2 and at month 6. Interviews were performed during client visits at week 1, month 2 and month 6. If a personal visit was not possible, a telephone in- terview was conducted. Based on the results of our previous qual- itative study [8], we chose the following questionnaires to quanti- tatively document client outcomes: average intensity of complaints in the last week on a visual analogue scale (0-100 mm; 0 mm = no complaints, 100 mm = worst intensity of complaints), health-re- lated quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF [10]), General Self-Efficacy Scale [11], spiritual and religious attitudes towards dealing with illness (SpREUK-15 [12, 13]), sense of coherence (SOC-13 [14- 17]) and Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE [18], based on [19]). Data Analyses Qualitative analyses were based on a directed qualitative content analysis [20] using MAXQDA software (MAXQDA 10, Berlin). A combination of deductive and inductive coding strategies was used. The main categories and first level of subcategories for coding the data were predefined by the research team according to our research questions. The coding of the following subcategories allowed for a continuous process of extracting codes from conducted interviews and discussing them among the team members. The team, consist - ing of three medical doctors and one anthropologist, discussed the data collection and analyses every 4 months in 1-day research work - shops. All coded interviews were reviewed and co-coded by ran - domly assigned members of the research team to improve the qual - ity and validity of the analyses. The codes and subcodes relevant to the content analysis of perceived effects and process of change are shown in Figure 1 (subcodes relevant to other analyses such as ther - apeutic relationship or biography are not shown). The quantitative data derived from the questionnaires were an- alysed descriptively (SPSS 22.0) using means, standard deviations and proportions (%) for baseline, week 1, month 2 and month 6. Results Recruitment and Sample Altogether, 22 healers identified by our search were asked to participate. Of those, we were able to recruit 2 healers from our former study and 5 new healers. Reasons for not participating in the study included the following: too few clients in therapy, personal reasons, study expect- ed to be too time intensive, having other fields of interest. Three healers did not want to be engaged in our question- naire-based outcome assessment. The 7 participating healers asked 10 clients to participate, of whom 7 agreed to participate. Reasons for non-participation were dis- trust of the questionnaires for 2 clients and not attending the planned healing session for 1 client. The group of healers consisted of 3 men and 4 women (mean age \u00b1 SD 55.3 \u00b1 5.9 years). Among them were 2 non-medical com- plementary medicine practitioners (German: \"Heilprak- tiker\"), a family physician, a dental technician, a social worker, a seamstress and a businesswoman. Most healers practiced a mix of healing methods (healing with hands n = 5; working with spiritual agents/superhuman beings Fig. 1.

In total, 22 interviews with healers were conducted. The interviews took place in the healers' clinics or their homes; the interviews took be- tween 30 and 90 min of time. Interviews were taken by B.S., M.T. and F.B. The 7 participating clients were all women (mean age \u00b1 SD 53.1 \u00b1 4.9 years). Their professions included 5 employees, 1 housewife and 1 retired woman. Six clients suffered from physical symptoms, such as pain for 4 of the women (2 with osteoarthritis and 2 with back pain). Six clients described mental concerns (2 with depressive symptoms, 2 with anxiety, 2 with social problems). In to- tal, 20 interviews with clients were conducted. The inter- views took place in the patients' homes; the interviews had a length between 30 and 90 min. In a few cases, pa- tients were difficult to reach for follow-up interviews, and in those cases, interviews were taken by telephone and also audiorecorded. Interviews were taken by B.S., M.T. and F.B. In total, 20 healing treatments were carried out during the observation period.

One client con - tinued the therapy with another healer who was not in - cluded in this study, but we continued interviewing that client. Outcomes Table 2 summarizes the individual qualitative out- comes and changes in the quantitative assessments for each client. Table 3 contains the results of the quantitative descriptive analysis. Client A_H4_K1 was excluded from the quantitative analysis because of concerns with the va- lidity of her data; she reported maximum values for all questionnaires at all time points. Six out of 7 clients described both mental and physical symptoms and complaints at the beginning and through- out the treatment process. Four of them made a direct link between the mental and physical complaints. Two clients had depression at baseline, and 2 clients had anxiety and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder. A client de - scribed her mental illness as a result of the arthritis com - plaint that affected her self-confidence and social behav - iour. Four patients described psychological, emotional or social improvements Two clients did not experience sus - tained, long-term mental changes during therapy. These 2 clients did not experience any lasting improvement in their physical symptoms either (back pain or ocular skin disease). All but 1 client had physical symptoms and com- plaints. Four of the clients were pain patients with de- tailed previous, unsuccessful conventional medical ther- apy, 2 with osteoarthritis and 2 with back pain. Regarding her physical complaints (back pain) only 1 client did not experience any changes in the course of the study; all the others reported improvements. In 2 clients, the course of the symptoms was very variable. The above-mentioned client FB_H4_K1 with the eye and skin disease regularly experienced an improvement in their symptoms after the treatment, sometimes to a very noticeable degree. The reported individual outcomes from the qualitative interviews were summarized as short-term (related di- rectly to the actual healing treatments) or longer-term (describing longer-lasting changes or changes that oc- curred within the 6 months of healing treatments and were perceived by clients as effects of the healing treat- ments).Table 3.

Clients also described the feeling of \"filling up with energy,\" \"restoring energy balance\" and feeling more centred. ... and then I just noticed how the whole crap left the body, as if ... [everything was] ... rinsed out. I had that feeling. But with a comforting warm feeling. The whole thing took over two hours. But I felt great. And I feel good too, I have to say quite honestly. [B_H13_K1, client] This lying on the back. This relaxed me anyway, then came the tears and then came this absolute letting go. [A_H6_K1, cli - ent] Summary of Perceived Longer-Term Qualitative Outcomes The most important perceived and described longer- term effects were those related to changes the clients made in their lives, new meanings they found, resources they activated and new abilities they developed or gained that they related to the healing treatments. Table 2 pro- vides an overview of the details for each individual client. Many of those outcomes were related to each other. Cli- ents described the following changes due to the healing treatments: being more accepting of their disease, being able to distance themselves from family problems, being able to integrate different parts of their personalities, learning to better understand and accept themselves, changing their social life, improving financial status, re- organizing life in a positive way, feeling more spiritual or mindful, falling in love, taking in a foster child to care for at home, and starting a diet. Well, now I'm full of verve, I can now pinpoint decisions, which was not possible before. I have regained the joy of life again. I did not have it before. (...) And I have everything that I have planned for this year, (...) I pushed everything. I have done everything. [B_ H13_K1, client] Yes, that gives me courage and strength and joie de vivre, so desire to attack life, to tackle things. Just like now the foster child, who has just entered my life and I'm getting involved. [C_H2_K2, client] At some point then a rethinking took place and then I have changed my whole life peu \u00e0 peu in the right direction, I would say now. And that works quite well. Yes. And as I said, now the [treat- ment] is a week ago and I feel like I've stepped out of the treatment much stronger, definitely. I am walking! I did not know that was possible before either. [B_H13_K1, client] Out of the 4 clients suffering from pain, 3 clients de- scribed a relevant reduction in pain. Two clients were able to stop taking their pain medication and attributed that to the healing treatments. Altogether, the clients consid- ered the changes in their lives and the development of a new understanding of their symptoms to be more impor- tant than symptomatic relief. [The back] is also better. Goes dazzling! Everything feels very different. (...) And I also play quite differently now table tennis (...) everything is much freer from the movements [ago]. [A_H6_K1, client] Quantitative Outcomes Table 3 shows the descriptively analysed pre-post data of the questionnaires used for 6 clients. The intensity of complaints occurring in the previous 7 days on the visual analogue scale (0-100 mm, 0 = absent, 100 mm = maximum intensity) decreased from 53.9 \u00b1 21.8 at baseline to 26.5 \u00b1 28.2 after 2 months but returned to 47.7 \u00b1 25.1 after 6 months. This finding indicates that the clients reported a relevant reduction of symptom in- tensity after 8 weeks, but this reduction did not persist to 6 months. The WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires showed global improvements in quality of life over time across the phys- ical, psychological and social relationship domains. How- ever, no improvements were reported for the environ- mental domain. In addition, the client's overall percep- tion of quality of life improved over time. Interestingly, all 6 clients reported improvements in the quality of life domains at least at one time point (Table 2), with im- provements in the psychological and social relations do- mains being the most common reported. On the General Self-Efficacy Scale (Schwarzer) clients reported an improvement from 24.4 \u00b1 4.9 at baseline to 30.4 \u00b1 6.5 after 2 months which persisted to month 6. Table 2 shows that improvements were reported by 5 out of 6 clients. On the Sense of Coherence Questionnaire (SOC-13) a small improvement from baseline (49.3 \u00b1 11.6) to week 1 (56.6 \u00b1 12.2) was reported and persisted throughout the follow-up period. Of the 6 clients, 4 showed individual improvements over time. On average, the clients reported little change in spiri- tual and religious attitudes in dealing with illness (SpREUK). There were improvements in the search and trust domains from baseline through the 6 months of fol- low-up. However, due to the large standard deviations in this small study population, these changes should be in- terpreted with caution. At the individual level, it is interesting to see that client C_H2_K2, who otherwise showed no longer-term im- provements, improved on all aspects of the SpREUK questionnaire (Table 3). The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) scores remained quite stable, with mean scores between 45 and 47. No assessment was conducted at baseline as there was not yet a rapport between the clients and healers.Perceived Outcomes of Spiritual Healing273 Complement Med Res 2019;26:265-275 DOI: 10.1159/000496736Discussion In the interviews, all clients described short-term ef- fects experienced within the treatment or directly after the treatments such as increase in relaxation, well-being and positive body sensations. The most important long- term effects perceived by 6 of the 7 clients were related to making significant life changes, creating new meanings, activating resources and improving social relationships. These effects were also reflected in the quantitative data with the most relevant changes relating to quality of life and self-efficacy across all clients. The qualitative findings fit very well the results of our former cross-sectional qual- itative study, where patients reported as perceived effects of spiritual healing (1) changes in sensations and feelings, (2) changes of self-concepts and values, and (3) changes of medical symptoms and complaints [8]. Based on both our studies we hypothesize that, besides instant relaxing effects, spiritually or religiously oriented clients may uti- lize spiritual healing treatment to change their life, re- frame meaning, increase empowerment and self-control. This may reduce stress and decrease the intensity of com- plaints and diseases. A central element of healing, in the perspective of our clients, is the feeling of connecting to a transcendental source such as god, angels, light or love [8]. Our hypothesis from the qualitative data is that in- creased well-being, relaxation, spiritual reframing and change of life may contribute to increased quality of life and also mental and consequently physical health status. The additional quantitative data of our pilot fits this hy- pothesis. On the visual analogue scale, symptomatic im- provements were observed in clients with pain. The short version of the WHOQOL-BREF has been shown to be a cross-culturally valid assessment tool for measuring four domains of quality of life: physical, psychological, social and environmental. At baseline, the clients scored below the German average for women between 46 and 55 years of age [10] for the physical domain (means: 60.7 \u00b1 23.3 for our sample vs. 77.1 \u00b1 16.7 in the German average), the psychological domain (48.2 \u00b1 13.8 vs. 73.4 \u00b1 15.3, respec- (56.0 \u00b1 9.3 vs. 72.2 \u00b1 19.1, respectively), but not for the environmental domain (72.3 \u00b1 11.5 vs. 70.2 \u00b1 13.8, respectively). After 6 months, the clients almost reached the average for all four do- mains (Table 2). The General Self-Efficacy Scale is a 10-item psycho- metric scale that was designed to assess optimistic self- beliefs used to cope with a variety of difficult demands in life. It especially refers to personal agency, the belief that successful outcomes are a result of one's actions [21]. At baseline, the clients had lower scores on the General Self- Efficacy Scale compared to the German average for females between 41 and 60 years of age (24.4 \u00b1 4.9 vs. 28.8 \u00b1 4.9, respectively) but reached the German average after 6 months (30.5 \u00b1 7.1) [22]. Sense of coherence is the core construct of An- tonovsky's salutogenetic model. SOC has three compo- nents: (1) comprehensibility: a belief that things occur in an orderly and predictable fashion and a sense that you can understand the events in your life and reasonably pre- dict what will occur in the future; (2) manageability: a belief that you have the skills or ability, the support, the help or the resources necessary to take care of things and that things are manageable and within your control; (3) meaningfulness: a belief that things in life are interesting and a source of satisfaction, that things are really \"worth it\" and that there is good reason or purpose to care about what occurs [8, 15]. On the SOC-13, our clients were be- low the German average for women between 41 and 60 years of age at baseline (49.3 \u00b1 11.6 vs. 64.4 \u00b1 10.95, re- spectively), but almost achieve the reported average after 6 months (58.3 \u00b1 19.0) [23]. In contrast, the pre-post comparisons of sense of co- herence, and the spirituality (SpREUK) showed inconsis- tent results. SpREUK a contextual naire and differentiates three factors: search (for support/ access), trust (in higher guidance/source) and reflection (positive interpretation of diseases). The questionnaire is a good tool for assessing patients' interest in spiritual/re- ligious concerns. B\u00fcssing et al. [13] reported demograph- ic data and SpREUK scores of 257 subjects with medical histories. In comparison with the B\u00fcssing et al. [13] sam- ple, our female clients clearly had higher search scores (69.3 \u00b1 39.5 vs. 54.7 \u00b1 26.0 for clients and average female patients, respectively), which increased further over time to 79.2 \u00b1 22.2 after 6 months. This change could reflect the spiritual search and openness of the clients in this study that lead them to the spiritual healers. Scores for the trust and reflections domains were similar to those re- ported by the B\u00fcssing et al. [13] study. However, trust scores increased over 6 months from 65.0 \u00b1 30.0 to 78.3 \u00b1 25.4. The large standard deviations show that the scores in the 6 clients were very heterogeneous and should be interpreted with caution. The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure was originally developed as a tool to assess pa- tients' perceptions of relational empathy in the patient- doctor dyad [24]. We adapted this questionnaire to apply to the healer-client relationship. Empathy measures re- mained unchanged throughout the observation time. Mercer et al. [25] has reported that for general practitio- ners in UK, the mean score from female patients between 45 and 60 years of age was 40.7 \u00b1 7.0 and 41.8 \u00b1 8.1 in the general adult population. Clients in the present study re- ported mean scores higher than those reported by Mercer et al. [25], between 45 and 47, which indicate a high level of empathy (range: 30-50). This may reflect the empa-Teut/Besch/Witt/St\u00f6ckigt Complement Med Res 2019;26:265-275274 DOI: 10.1159/000496736thetic approach used by the healer throughout the treat- ments. However, it should be noted that the question- naire was made for doctor-patient relationships, but we adapted the questionnaire to suit the healer-client rela- tionship measured in this study. In this case, study, spiri- tuality seemed to have been less important than we ini- tially assumed. In our previous study, we concluded that healing treatments, healing experiences and therapeutic talks with healers may have resulted in a process of spiri- tual reframing, that may have helped clients to activate resources, process change and increase their self-efficacy and empowerment [8]. In this study, the main motive for seeking a spiritual healer was not a spiritual quest but rather the need to alleviate medical or psychological com- plaints. Relaxation, connecting to transcendent sources (e.g., \"filling up with energy\"), increasing self-under- standing, self-experience and self-acceptance, and mak- ing psychological and social life changes were reported as important factors for healing. Still, 4 clients entered the therapeutic process with the healer with a spiritual atti- tude and reported an encouragement of their spiritual at- titude as well as support in dealing with their problems during the therapeutic process. However, as a pilot study using mainly a qualitative approach and supplementing with quantitative question- naires in a very small sample of participants, this study has several limitations. Because it is a very small pilot case study with no control group, the results should be inter- preted with caution. The results of this study are purely descriptive and do not allow for the drawing of causal in- ferences about clinical efficacy or effectiveness. Also, the recruitment of clients by the healers itself might be seen as a potential community bias. They may have selected clients being more responsive to their first suggestions at the phone or even being more spiritual orientated. How- ever, the fact that only new clients were allowed that had never been to the healer before and not had a treatment by the healer before should have reduced this bias. An- other limitation is that all clients were women. This is a typical finding for complementary medicine therapies, but the inclusion of male clients might have changed the qualitative and quantitative findings. A strength of this study was the additional use of quan- titative questionnaires, which allowed us to combine and compare healers' and clients' narratives with data from questionnaires. This naturalistic approach, including se- lecting only clients who had not participated in previous healing treatments, allowed us to observe naturalistic healing settings and minimize potential community bias. Many of the quantitative studies on spiritual healing showed inconclusive or heterogeneous results. Spiritual healing itself is not well understood and remains even dif- ficult to define. Qualitative research strategies might help to better understand the phenomenon and to develop better hypotheses and study designs [25]. When design- ing this pilot study, we believed that a mixed methods ap- proach combining qualitative and quantitative methods would be best suited to get broader outcomes. The results of this study support this approach. Spiritual healing sessions are usually seeked by a small subgroup of the population, especially by those individu- als who look for spiritual answers to their complaints and diseases. Therefore, a naturalistic research design appears to be crucial, but the results will not be transferrable to more sceptical and/or non-religious individuals who will not make use of the respective setting and the meanings offered by the healers. For future prospective studies on spiritual healing hav - ing much larger samples, we believe that - as quantitative global outcomes - quality of life, self-efficacy and inten - sity of complaints on a visual analogue scale are suited best to describe the changes patients reported and that they could be used in addition to qualitative observations. Based on our studies, we hypothesize that the WHO Qual - ity of Life Questionnaires may be especially useful for mea - suring general quality of life in a cross-cultural population of clients using spiritual healing. Quality of life is defined and constructed by WHO researchers as \"an individual's perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns\" [26, 27]. The WHO has also developed the WHOQOL-SRPB BREF Questionnaire, which could be another useful as - sessment tool for future research [28] on spiritual aspects of healing. Conclusion In this small case study, clients receiving spiritual heal - ing reported increased psychological and physical well- being in the qualitative interviews and felt empowered to change their lives. The questionnaires indicated improve - ments in disease symptoms and quality of life. The typical clients who visit healers are usually spiritually or religious - ly oriented and may utilize spiritual healing treatment to relax, change their life, reframe meaning and increase em - powerment and self-control, which may improve quality of life, well-being and health. For future quantitative stud - ies, global outcomes such as quality of life, self-efficacy and intensity of complaints on a visual analogue scale may best reflect the reported and perceived changes.
