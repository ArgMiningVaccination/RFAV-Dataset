NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE WITNESSES DONALD A.B. LINDBERG, M.D., DIRECTOR KENT A. SMITH, DEPUTY DIRECTOR DAVID J. LIPMAN, M.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATION DONALD C. POPPKE, EXECUTIVE OFFICER SUSAN U. LEVINE, BUDGET OFFICER HAROLD VARMUS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NIH DENNIS P. WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DHHS Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. We're very pleased this afternoon to welcome Dr. Donald Lindberg, the Director of the National Library of Medicine, who will be the first of three institutes to appear this afternoon. Dr. Lindberg, why don't you introduce the people at the table with you and then proceed with your statement. Introduction of Witnesses Dr. Lindberg. Yes, sir. We have on the far left Don Poppke, our Executive Officer, next, Sue Levine, our Budget Officer, next, Kent Smith, our noble Deputy Director of NLM, and on my right is Dr. David Lipman, who is the Director of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Opening Statement Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much for the privilege of appearing before you. My full statement for the record reports the status of many aspects of the Library's work in the past year and our plans for the new year. In this brief oral statement, I would like to highlight four items, with your permission--the Visible Humans, the Internet Grateful Med, our telemedicine projects, and the Human Gene Map. National Information Infrastructure I should say that all four of those are the result of NLM's commitment to develop and support the best biomedical application of the National Information Infrastructure, NII. The NII was the result of the High Performance Computing and Communications program. As you will remember, the Congress authorized this program in 1991 permitting 12 Federal agencies to join forces and funds to develop improved computing and communications to address problems that are common to the agencies in the country. Inevitably, however, this work becomes dominated by the funds and the mission and concerns of what are called the ``Big Four'' science agencies--Department of Defense, Department of Energy, NASA, and NSF. Still, with the support of this Committee and HHS, the NLM and other NIH institutes have also participated. So there is a biomedical component, and I'm grateful for that. The developments I will show you today represent HPCC work from the National Library of Medicine. There are others, but I think these four highlight the developments. visible humans First, the Visible Humans. This is a blow-up of the cover of the February issue of LIFE magazine. I should explain a little bit about the project. Visible Human is a fully computer-digitalization of the interior of a three-dimensional structure of a human being, one male and one female, including CAT scanning and MRI. This was originally designed to assist medical students and surgeons to learn and remember anatomy. Yet, now there are more than 750 licenses to individuals, institutions, and companies. This is in 26 countries I might say. So the applications far exceed what we originally imagined. You have before you the LIFE magazine. In this issue, they state my opinion correctly, ``Visible Humans forever change the way we see ourselves and the way doctors heal us.'' [See figure 1.] [Page 1311--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] The following are examples of applications that others have developed using this database. First, planning and rehearsing prostate and brain surgery; the same for radiotherapy of brain tumors; design and testing of automobile crash dummies; battlefield trauma management; a virtual or fly-through colonoscopy in place of the uncomfortable and less complete procedures with a rigid tube. In summary, this is a milestone development. It is relatively cheap, $1.4 million over the course of three to four years; it has stimulated good scientific ideas and commercial products; it is all in the public domain and it is available via the Internet; and it was made possible by the HPCC money, the improved networks and the improved computer capability. internet grateful med Next, I would like to draw attention to our work in the Internet Grateful Med. Grateful Med is a system that allows doctors and, indeed, the public to search MEDLINE, the Library's largest and most consulted database, and other databases as well. Senator Bill Frist, who, as you know, is a physician, demonstrated Grateful Med at a recent TV broadcast. He said, ``MEDLINE can be critical for doctors in reaching the correct diagnosis and developing a soundtreatment plan, resulting in lives saved, limbs spared, and disease prevented, unnecessary treatment avoided, and hospitalization reduced.'' We agree. Internet Grateful Med is easy to use as well. The instant appeal of Internet Grateful Med has resulted in a dramatic increase in use, as you can imagine, and a little extra increase occurred after Ann Landers printed a letter from Dr. Michael DeBakey, a member of our Board of Regents, praising the new system. The display shows the letter. [See figure 2.] [Page 1313--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] We are almost ready to introduce yet another MEDLINE- related service. This is known as PUBMED, the name I attribute to my colleague Dr. David Lipman, who has a fertile imagination. This will allow the Nation's health professionals and the general public to request from publishers the full text of medical journal articles cited in the database. Congress has asked the Library to facilitate access to its health information at minimal cost. With this in mind, we're actually now exploring whether it might actually be possible to offer MEDLINE without charge in the U.S. to those who use our inexpensive Internet connection service. So it would be limited to the U.S. and those that come to us through Internet. telemedicine Next, I want to highlight telemedicine. I'll talk about some projects that NLM has funded, but I should say first that this is really the best strategy for getting excellent health care applications onto the National Information Infrastructure. Telemedicine involves three things--information in support of decision-making, exchanging signals, which could be images or blood pressure, and, lastly, arrangements to practice medicine at a distance. With this in mind, it is obvious that these projects don't arise within the Library; they arise in competitive grant and research contract proposals from the universities and the great hospitals. About 70 such proposals were peer reviewed last year. We were able to fund 19 really good projects this past year. The map shows the country-wide distribution of the work in 13 States and the District of Columbia. You have a listing of the detail of the projects, but I'll mention just a few things. [See figure 3.] [Page 1315--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] The telemedicine projects include efforts to send vital signs from ambulances to the emergency room, to facilitate renal dialysis, to assist in home-care of high risk newborn infants, to give specialty consultation in rural areas, and to prevent drug interaction complications in the elderly. I could give you details on any of those. I should say, too, that NLM sponsored, along with HCFA and VA, a study by the National Research Council attempting to set out ways to evaluate telemedicine projects and the institutions that accepted these grants agreed to implement those NRC evaluation criteria. human gene map Lastly, I want to draw attention to the Human Gene Map. Scientists at the NLM National Center for Biotechnology Information, which is headed by Dr. David Lipman, on my right, have recently released the Human Gene Map. This, too, is based on daily use of the high-speed Internet to exchange data between research centers around the world. The project uses high performance computers to compare each new sequence submitted to those already known, and to compute comparisons between all of the known information from the literature, other relevant molecular biology databases, and the known relevant chemical structure. Then, lastly, the use of Internet supports the tens of thousands of inquiries per day into this database. To see the gene map, one metaphorically dials up NLM and NCBI Home Pages on Internet. You see before you a picture of what that Home Page looks like. This display was, if you will, a centerfold of Science Magazine a month ago, its molecular biology issue. Here, we see graphical presentations of the 23 human chromosome pairs and a picture plot of the number of genes at each point on the chromosome. This is of great use to the scientists who can kind of point and click and get down to the actual sequence that may characterize those genes. He or she can then see what that all looks like and even do searches and comparisons. Morethan one scientist has said that the existence of such a map would have saved years of research for any particular one of these genes. [See figure 4.] [Page 1317--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] The Home Page also has information about the general nature of the disease, references to foundations and patient advocacy groups, and to the scientific and popular literature. Thus, the public and the scientist may use precisely the same database and each may pursue the topic to the extent he or she desires and in the fashion their interest and education permits. In many respects, the Human Gene Map tries to take a complex subject out of the lab to make it understandable in the classroom and the home. I should also say that in the work with these advanced information systems and our outreach, and the use of the new technology such as the Visible Human and Internet Grateful Med, we work in partnership with the National Network of Libraries of Medicine and particularly the medical library community. NLM's request is for $152,689,000 for fiscal year 1998. I would, of course, be pleased to attempt to answer any questions you might wish to raise. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 1319 - 1323--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] outreach Mr. Porter. Dr. Lindberg, thank you for your good statement. You might be interested to know that I was at a community health center in the inner-city in Chicago about three weeks ago, they were receiving an award from HRSA for working on an award-winning outreach program with Americorps volunteers, and as we went through the health center, there were television screens and NLM was on those screens. Dr. Lindberg. Great. Mr. Porter. They said they use your services all the time. Dr. Lindberg. Must be a good place. [Laughter.] human genome map Mr. Porter. Excellent place. Dr. Lindberg, the publication last fall of the Human Genome Map with over 16,000 genes was an enormous technical feat. What were the major challenges in coordinating all the data from multiple sources and in setting up World Wide Web accessibility? Dr. Lindberg. Well, I'm going to give a quick answer and invite my colleague, Dr. Lipman, to answer you more fully, if you agree. It seems to me that looking at it slightly from the outside that his biggest challenge was to establish scientific credibility with a number of top genome research centers around the world. First, you have to have people trusting you and working with you, and then technology permitted the cooperation amongst those people that wanted to cooperate. So it was really a very international project, as I understand it. But I would like to invite Dr. Lipman to comment further. Dr. Lipman. As you know, collaboration is very important but it is not always achieved. In this particular case, our group, which had a very large collection of EST sequences, which are partial gene sequences, had done a lot of computational work to select particularly promising snippets of DNA sequence which could be used for mapping. We then contacted the groups who do the mapping and told them that we had done this work which would facilitate their work, and we got into sort of a quid pro quo situation where we would provide them with the agent, so to speak, to map and they would provide us back the information. Initially, in this mapping world, a lot of people have their own maps, their own sort of coordinate systems, and it is hard to integrate that information. In cross-checking trying to cross-validate the information we were getting, we could point out that there were errors at times and that it would benefit everybody if they would work with a single coordinate system. And so we managed to in fact get them all to do that and, in so doing, improve the accuracy of everybody's work. Dr. Lindberg is of course right that the collaboration happened because in fact we were really seen as scientists participating and not just technicians. And then I think the basis was really the basis of all scientific collaborations, which is that both parties could benefit. Mr. Porter. Once the genome map is five times as big when it includes all genes, will the map be too big to be manipulated on the Web? Dr. Lindberg. I think I can handle that one; that's easy. No, certainly not. Although I think part of the gamble is, of course, that the computing power keeps going up without our doing much of anything about it. There is enough of a market that the companies do that. The communications take a lot more effort. But, again, the country is pretty much committed to maintaining and advancing Internet. The President has announced the next generation Internet to go 100 times faster, and 1000 times faster in some cases, with more security than the present ones. So we think NCBI and the others will keep out ahead of the problem. bioinformatics Mr. Porter. The job prospects for those in the field of bioinformatics are extremely strong. Private industry is scrambling to find Ph.D's trained in computer science, information technology, and genetics to help them manage overwhelming quantities of data being produced from genetic sequencing. Is NLM participating in training these bioinformatics experts? Dr. Lindberg. Yes, sir. I think we saw the problem, Ican't say we're out ahead of it because I think it is a serious problem. The young men and women with knowledge of molecular biology and informatics are hot items and are definitely sought after. I should say that 20 such individuals are training at NCBI, the National Center for Biotechnology Information, at NLM under Dr. Lipman. NSF funds another 11. The Library of Medicine has supported training grants in medical informatics for over 20 years, 25 years. They are now renewed competitively every five years. There are 12 sites, 12 American universities with medical informatics training. About 100 post-docs total are supported by that program. We allocate slots especially toward molecular biology, so that adds another probably two dozen to the pool. The Department of Energy and the Sloan Foundation support another five. So these are smallish numbers, although they are very, very good people being produced. I think essentially the post-doc experience of working in Dr. Lipman's lab is really wonderful, and the systematic, I would say more formal, educational work in the universities is our best bet, those two combinations. But we are aware of the problem and certainly working it. Mr. Porter. Are you at all concerned that industry will lure these specialists out of academia, depleting the talent needed to educate the next generation? Dr. Lindberg. That's always a problem. In our country, we really don't assign people to their jobs; we let them go where they want to go. So I imagine that there will be attractive enough jobs in the Federal labs to attract a cadre. Mr. Porter. Provided we give you the resources you need to pay for them. Dr. Lindberg. Right. Exactly. Mr. Porter. Recently some pharmaceutical companies have begun to support academic informatics programs. Will this ease the problem of maintaining strong academic training programs? Dr. Lindberg. I think that they will. A lot of the people at least that I see in NCBI are really so thrilled to be there that we have to go around and ask them to turn the lights out every once in a while and go home and get some sleep. It's really an exciting place, an exciting time for people in that field. I think everybody realizes that, just as in former days when we were trying to discover and produce antibiotics, it will inevitably shift to an industrial base, as it must. Any drugs that result are multi-billion-dollar enterprises. So I think most people in the field welcome the participation of a profit-making company, a pharmaceutical company, especially those that have committed themselves to placing the results of these studies in the public domain. Merck particularly, as you know, has insisted that the ESTs that they paid for be placed in the public domain available to them and their competitors. internet users Mr. Porter. You reported a 20 percent increase in users in 1996 fueled by the popularity of your Internet service. Can you keep up with this level of user growth or do you risk having some of the same capacity problems as America Online? Dr. Lindberg. I'll tell you where they've got their problems is in the network and usually it is at local routers. We have actually studied this pretty carefully. We're not having those troubles, with the exception of our support of users overseas. There, an interesting proposition, but basically they don't have the good infrastructure that the U.S. has and of course there will always be difficulties in both places. But we've looked at it quite carefully and, generally speaking, the limit in capacity is not our computers or the raw capability of Internet, but rather local routers. The problem will correct itself in time. next generation internet initiative Mr. Porter. Last October the administration announced its Next Generation Internet Initiative to create high-speed networks that are 100 to 1,000 times faster than today's Internet. NLM was originally included in the initiative but the President's budget doesn't seem to allocate funds for this purpose. Can you tell us what is the status of this initiative and NLM's involvement in it? Dr. Lindberg. I can tell you only what I know publicly, that the President made a release to the press announcing the next generation Internet. We were quite happy to read that it would involve $100 million a year in new money, and it would be managed by the four agencies I mentioned plus mine. I was sort of surprised when, as the budget subsequently was distributed, NIH dropped out and NIST dropped in. Obviously, I think that NIH and NLM as part of it have a great deal to contribute to at least the applications that will be part of this next generation Internet. I just don't think medicine will be included if there is nobody medical at the table. So the original level that was discussed of $5-$10 million a year certainly wouldn't be excessive, it might be an appropriate level to support biomedical applications. But we'll do the best we can with whatever budget we have and we'll give it as good a priority as we can. Mr. Porter. As an aside, Dr. Lindberg, let me say that we do not find it surprising at all that the President's budget doesn't reflect his rhetoric. In fact, two weeks before his State of the Union address and two weeks and a couple days before he submitted his budget, he was in my district saying how important biomedical research was and then submitted a budget that I think vastly underfunds the importance of priority of biomedical research. So I'm not surprised that you don't find the money in the President's budget. We're simply going to have to do a better job than the President has done in this regard and provide you the resources that you need. Mr. Bonilla. telemedicine Mr. Bonilla. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I ask Dr. Lindberg a couple of questions, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for trying to delay and wait for me this morning. I could not attend this morning's hearing because we had a memorial service for Frank Tejeda, Congressman from my home town, and then I was unavoidably detained by a meeting with the Majority Leader and the Speaker on another issue. So I appreciate your patience with me today on these matters. Dr. Lindberg, I would like to start out by asking about telemedicine. According to a GAO study, there is no Federal strategy currently existing to maximize the Federal investment in telemedicine, which is amounting now to about $646 million spread across 9 Federal departments and agencies government- wide. I have an interest in this not only because of this subcommittee, but also the National Security Subcommittee of which I'm also a member. The Department of Defense is the largest Federal investor in telemedicine with $262 million and is considered a leader in developing this technology. The GAO suggests that DOD is in the best position to develop a telemedicine strategy due to the major investment and that it manages the largest health care systems in the world. The major medical facility in my district is hundreds of miles away from those that need the medical attention the most. I represent an area that is 58,000 square miles, 600 miles of it the Texas-Mexico border. My district is larger than all 29 States East of the Mississippi individually. The medical schools in my district tell me that they have the technology to implement telemedicine technology but lack a strategy at this time. Many in my district agree that this technology has the potential to overcome any professional isolation of rural doctors by allowing them to participate in immediate consultation with specialists. My question is, what is the level of cooperation and coordination with DOD? Do you have a shared vision on telemedicine's potential and its application? Dr. Lindberg. Right. Well, it's an interesting question. I think that I'm pretty well aware of the work in the DOD that you refer to. Certainly, I understand why it is highly appropriate for DOD to be interested in telemedicine. NASA also for similar reasons; you can't reach out in space to reach your astronauts. The GAO report you refer to I have read. We were, in fact, asked to comment on it before it was released. It is specific to DOD. It isn't really a careful study of the whole U.S. Some of the numbers, for instance, are a little bit jumbled because of the different ways of accounting. While I respect the DOD work, in fact, Rick Satava, one of their chiefs, is a good friend and I've seen his work up close, they have their mission that is different from problems of domestic U.S. nonmilitary medicine. Our problem will not be solved by battlefield management strategy. We'll benefit from their instrumentation, we pretty much know about that. So far as the exchange of information, there really is a joint working group on telecommunications within the Department of HHS and shared with Commerce. We meet very, very regularly. NIH and NLM have representatives on that group. So I think that the information is exchanged quite sufficiently. We do not have unnecessary duplication and/or waste, none of that. There's another factor that makes me say don't try to make a global plan for the whole country, particularly leading with DOD. The reason I think it is such a wonderful area is that every week I see a brand new, innovative, wise application that I wasn't smart enough myself to think of. So if I picture some small group going off making a plan and a strategy for the country, it worries me a whole lot that they will think about it as it is now rather than as it might come to be. There is one other area in which I have met with the DOD Acquisitions Deputy Secretary, and they are aware that they will need to get a commercial industrial component to telemedicine strategy. That doesn't take a highfalutin committee to come to that conclusion. Somebody has got to manufacture the instruments. The Pentagon has a program, which we have met with them and NASA, to look into considering whether we perhaps should be working with companies directly to enhance their ability to produce instruments that DOD then wants to use. So I think that we're on top of that problem. I don't advise that it should be this national strategy at the moment until we know how far and how good the field really is. The only part of the strategy I would say that should be national is the commitment to evaluation, which is why we work with the National Research Council. All this sounds newer than it is. As an idea, telemedicine was quite apparent in the 1965 regional medical program days and I have many, many pictures of friends and colleagues, including Mike DeBakey doing instruction in surgery from Texas to Geneva over the satellites. That's telemedicine. NLM worked also with NASA for a satellite that operated over the whole Western U.S., the WICHI and WAMI program. These were great ideas. They were pretty expensive. Everyone was enthusiastic. I personally believe telemedicine is a great strategy. I don't want to see it go away again the way of the hula hoop. I think that it will have the best outcome if we force ourselves to evaluate what's the medical benefit. Is there a dollar savings or additional expenses, and to whom? That's as far as I would recommend going on a national strategy. nlm telemedicine projects Mr. Bonilla. It's interesting that you seem comfortable then with just the exchange of information. I can assure you that we're not going to let this go the way of the hula hoop either. I think it is very, very important. I'm not a medical expert, but from what my researchers and doctors tell me, this is something that is necessary not just to survive, but to thrive in the future. I have another question about that. How effective are the 19 telemedicine projects currently funded by NLM? I guess you touched on that in general terms, but I would like to hear more specifics. Dr. Lindberg. I think the main appeal to me is that we didn't particularly set out to scatter them around the map of the U.S. That is the beautiful part of the United States and NIH, that if you just evaluate the scientific merit of these proposals, everybody kind of comes into play reasonably well. NLM actually funds a Circuit Librarian Program out of San Antonio, Texas, that is kind of long-lived and very useful I think. But if I look at those particular ones that are on the map and the little listing that you have, let me mention just a couple that struck me as innovative and surprising. One says ``Massachusetts. Provide care to high risk newborns and their families.'' It seemed odd to me, first of all, because it comes out of Boston which is very much of a city, not a rural area. Yet, what they are actually doing is pretty inexpensive but good telecommunications sending equipment home with the families of high risk newborns so that they can essentially get a consultation with the hospital before they double panic and hop into a taxi cab or an ambulance to bring the baby back and forth to the emergency room, which is very, very common. They've actually made feasibility studies of this and it is a fairly low-cost proposition. So that in a sense you have the same communication difficulties within a big city as you do in a more rural area. We've done work in West Virginia. There, the application is attempting to get specialty consultation to very rural areas. We have quite a bit of experience with that. It works quite well. I know that the Congress is very receptive I think to the telemedicine ideas, I think rightly so. I think it is delivering a benefit back home where it is needed. Mr. Bonilla. There is a lot of interest not just on this subcommittee, but with members of other committees in this Congress on advancing telemedicine. I did notice that noneof these projects is in the State of Texas. I'm wondering if you see any future projects, starting any new ones, and, if so, what are the chances of having them in the State of Texas? Dr. Lindberg. I'm not sure that we got an application from Texas. We did not get an application from San Antonio which is where I would have expected it to come from. I should mention one other, if you'll permit. Mr. Bonilla. Sure. Dr. Lindberg. The one in Oregon is teledermatology, how to diagnose skin and so forth. That has an additional feature because in telemedicine typically you will expect to try to achieve very high band-width rate or speed of transmission so you can see high resolution, color, and sometimes even some applications require you see the patient walk in front of the camera. Of course, that's expensive. The cheapest of the applications would be if you could use ordinary telephone lines. That's what this one in Oregon does, the so-called ``store and forward'' technology. The expert is at the Oregon Health Sciences University and then the users are in small towns in eastern and western Oregon where there are no dermatologists. We have had this young man come and give a presentation to our Board of Regents. It was quite amazing. The pictures were taken, of course with some training, of the patients out in the small places with a computer digital camera, then sent by ordinary phone line so the dermatologist can see it whenever he or she needs to as kind of an appendix to e-mail, and then he showed some of the diagnoses that were made. These are patients in some cases who had the same complaint for ten years who had seen three or four doctors without any relief. Once the picture arrived in Portland, it took three seconds to give a diagnosis of treatment. It was nothing. So what a grateful patient. In a couple of cases, they unfortunately were malignancies that had been missed and not diagnosed and treated correctly. So we were tremendously impressed that at the low end of the thing, the low cost end, it still was working very surprisingly nicely. That's another reason that I think we should not prematurely spell out exactly how it should be done, because these bright ideas are coming up all over the country. outreach Mr. Bonilla. That's very interesting, doctor. I appreciate your examples. I have a question in another area, my last question, Mr. Chairman. I understand that NLM has made great strides in the past year with its Visible Human project and the Internet Grateful Med program. Can you tell us if the Library has engaged in active outreach activities designed to ensure that the Nation's health care providers and health information specialists are aware of these and other NLM services? Dr. Lindberg. Yes, sir. In the case of Visible Human, this is going rather well already on its own. We have made presentations at library associations which I think have in turn brought this to the attention of the hospitals and the doctors. The major users of Visible Human really have been surgeons and radiologists. So they are selling themselves. It was first introduced, actually, I did it at the Radiological Society of North America, RSNA. There were something like 85,000 radiologists present and I think I met them all in one half hour. [Clerk's note. Later corrected to ``55,000''] It is, again, a case where the new applications are being discovered by those who are out in the world using it. We have a licensing agreement, although there is no exchange of money, so we do know how the applications are used. We share that information on a Home Page, and we've had one meeting with all those licensees. So I think that is probably our outreach there. The more traditional outreach work that we do is pointed at Internet Grateful Med. We have given actual grants to connect people to Internet and then to give training for health care professionals' use of these systems. There have been about 300 such outreach awards. There are special areas of outreach, for instance in toxicology, in some areas of the country. I am reminded that the reason you don't see Texas on that particular map is that we just completed a project with the Texas Department of Health, that ended in March 1996 and that involved 10 public health sites, so that was an outreach area. And 70 percent of those participants who had training said that they would continue to use Grateful Med. So we think that's probably working. Participating sites I guess would probably be areas that would be familiar to you--San Angelo, Tom Green County Health District, Texas Department of Health Field Office in Fort Stockton, MARFA Rural Health Clinic, Guadalupe Valley Hospital, these are all I think pretty small places, Texas Department of Health Field Office in Beaville and Laredo, Rio Grande, Eagle Pass. So that's pretty rural and has met with success we think. Mr. Bonilla. Dr. Lindberg, thank you very much. Dr. Lindberg. Thank you, Mr. Bonilla. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Bonilla. Mrs. Lowey. internet grateful med Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Dr. Lindberg. I have been absolutely intrigued by the whole MEDLINE issue and the issues surrounding it. The availability of MEDLINE on the World Wide Web is just an amazing development. What it does is make a wealth of information available to the general public which was once the province of medical professionals only. Could you share with us your views about how will access to this information change health care. Will it make Americans better consumers? When you write your reports for the medical journals, do you keep in mind the fact that these are going to go on the Web and the average consumer is going to be reading it? Could you discuss that with us. Dr. Lindberg. Yes. I think those are very perceptive remarks. We are concerned about the opportunities that Internet Grateful Med offers for communicating starting out with patients and families and having as an ultimate goal the public. But there's a lot of the public, so we have to be a little bit modest. NLM has historically tried to serve the public through the health care profession. It is hard enough to do that but I think we're now doing a good job with it. I think you're right though that the public now is so much better educated and more receptive to medical knowledge than they were when even I was a medical student, the opportunities are much greater. We used to still have conversations about should the patient be told the truth. Most patients didn't want to be told the truth, we believed. I think that is all in the past. I think now you have a well-educated population that seeks information. As a library, we've always held to the tradition that no information is secret or privatized. It has always been opento anyone who wants to use it. The patient groups, the sort of help yourself groups or the disease-oriented groups we know to be very effective, starting out with ileostomy clubs and that sort of thing. We haven't been able to work effectively with them up until now because one of the things is that the literature gets out of date, they don't use bibliographical standards that even identify the date and the place things were published to know whether they're accurate and timely or not. All that is beginning to change as the Web allows the central creation and maintenance of a database and the access by others without having to physically be connected to it. A bigger problem we think is the highly variable quality of the information on the World Wide Web. I guess it is commonplace to say that, but you can get 1,000 hits but how many of them are actually worth reading? We wish that we could say that we have a plan whereby NLM would certify all the medical knowledge. We're trying an experiment that is not yet ready for a public test. I'm associated with a group in which an attempt has been made to issue a kind of a medallion agreeing that the site obeys a certain set of ethical constraints or discloses when they are commercially biased. This is working. There are 21,000 sites on the Web that actually say that they comply with this medical standard. The next issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association will have an editorial by George Lundberg urging that attention be directed to exactly that problem, although he doesn't spell out a prescription that solves the problem. So I guess I have to just agree with you that it is a wonderful challenge and opportunity. We're sort of barrelling in to try to find out how much work would be involved in doing a really excellent job. There are a certain set of areas that I would describe where we really are seeking to give information directly to the public. The first, because it had special appropriations, is AIDS. If you didn't give information to the people, what good would it be? The second is in our support of work of the National Cancer Institute in their PDQ. It has a formal section for the patient and for the doctor and either could go to either section. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research produced clinical practice guidelines which, again, we worked with them on. It is modeled on the cancer model so that there is a formal section well-said for the patient and a formal section well-said for the doctor. We did another experiment starting four years ago, I guess almost five now, with EPA. EPA was given an authorization by the Congress to collect certain data about the release of 400 toxic chemicals it turns out are released, amazing large amounts, in 45,000 places in the country and then the data are collected quarterly. We accepted EPA's request that we assist in making this available to the public. We do that through a computer database, CD-ROMs, and a variety of other things. The library community helps us greatly by trying to give instruction on how to use that as an outreach effort that I could describe in further detail with Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In any case, the attempt there is to bring the information to the public. We don't do it as well as we would like to be able to do it. You run up against the fundamental difficulty that the data are really about chemicals. If you will only talk to the machine about chemicals, it will love you and give you the information right away. But if you talk to it in ordinary terms, it is obtuse. To some extent we get around it by letting people enter their zip codes and it will immediately tell you where are the sites that are releasing chemicals and so forth. But ultimately it gets down to chemicals. Some of this is easier said than done. So there is a particular case, of course it's more difficult than other things, but if we really want it to be done right and to be understood and to be kept at a high quality, we really have a lot of work still to do on that. monitoring information on the world wide web Mrs. Lowey. I just wanted to follow up because I'm not sure if I heard correctly. You said something a couple of minutes ago about there is a stamp of approval. In other words, one of my concerns is, whether it is cancer or ileitis or any other illness, there can be, in addition to the group, some 50 remedies, I don't want to call them witch doctor remedies or whatever. Could you back up and explain that to us. You said there is some kind of a---- Dr. Lindberg. I agree with what you said. We do not feel that we could issue such a seal of approval. Mrs. Lowey. Oh, there is not one, then? Dr. Lindberg. Not from NLM. There are from some other groups. Mrs. Lowey. Like? Dr. Lindberg. Well, one outfit is called HON, Health On the Net. It is a foundation in Geneva. I am an advisor to that. But that is not U.S., it is not government, it is not world-wide. It is accepted by some 21,000 sites, so it is kind of a voluntary yielding to standards. But to do what you really want us to do, we don't know how to do it yet, how to say what is really valid, what is the best, what is reliable, what should the patient act on. I should say that part of this is getting the raw information to the patients. For instance, supposing that you get a citation to MEDLINE. Well, you have to go to the library, get out the article, try to understand it. A lot of times you just would like to see the full text and PUBMED is an attempt to do exactly that. So that would be available to the doctors, the patients, the families, anyone. Mrs. Lowey. Do you or does anybody monitor? I'm wondering, Mr. Chairman, if anyone really monitors what's on the Web. For example, if you see a proliferation of some kind of information cure that is suddenly everywhere on the Net and you know it is patently false, dangerous, whatever, is anybody monitoring this? Dr. Lindberg. Well, NIH is not a regulatory agency and FDA is. So I would guess that would fall under FDA jurisdiction and that they would look after such a matter. Mrs. Lowey. Then we will pursue it. Dr. Lindberg. I don't like to pass the buck to my colleagues in other agencies, but NIH is not a regulatory agency. I think when we include journals in MEDLINE, that is indication that they are of good quality, that they are peer reviewed, that they are acceptable and have a good track record. That is quite different from saying that everything in all those articles is quite correct. But at least they are peer reviewed and they are properly presented. We index something under 4,000 journals. We subscribe to around 27,000. The world probably has around 50,000 or 60,000. So what we present is sort of creme de la creme. Mrs. Lowey. Along with that, I don't know if I've used up my time or you've used up my time, but I think---- Dr. Lindberg. I apologize. I'll give yes or no answers. [Laughter.] telemedicine Mrs. Lowey. If the Chairman would indulge me, I was also very involved with telemedicine. I wonder if you care to briefly talk with us about that whole area. What are the limits of telemedicine? What do you think are its most effective applications? Or, Mr. Chairman, do you think we should leave that discussion for another day? Mr. Porter. I would just say to the gentlelady that Mr. Bonilla ventilated that subject very thoroughly but he did it before you came in. Mrs. Lowey. Oh, did he? Okay. I apologize. Mr. Porter. I think Dr. Lindberg would be willing to highlight it again. Mrs. Lowey. If there is anything that you didn't mention with regard to telemedicine--[Laughter.] Mrs. Lowey. For example, I was recently talking with some people at the Strang Clinic who were discussing the whole area of genetic counselling. They were telling me that there are so many people in need of genetic counselling and we can't possibly find enough doctors who can respond. He mentioned this as an area where telemedicine and use of the Internet and dispensing information through that is invaluable. Dr. Lindberg. I agree. I'm very enthusiastic personally about telemedicine projects. I think that is the very best strategy for getting good medical health-related use of the National Information Infrastructure. I think we all recognize that you want to amplify the powers of an expert, you want to deliver the care to remote areas or even hard to get to areas of big cities. The best is yet to come. We're not certain how to do this. I was describing a little bit before you came about some applications that require very high band-width and high resolution and, therefore, are expensive, others that are store and forward technology, like teledermatology, that are essentially very high benefit and very inexpensive. I think the cities are as interesting as are the rural areas. There, the challenges are just getting around, how big an obstacle is it to get from their apartment back to the hospital. So one of the applications that I mentioned in that respect is in Boston. There is an application in New York that has to do with chronic illness in home settings. There, too, this home care is an application that I must say I would not have thought of. I am pleased that innovative, good new applications come up every month or so. Chicago also has applications of telemedicine that are focused on outpatients. I just think it is a marvelous area. You speak about the genetic counseling. I don't know anyone who is doing that using telemedicine techniques, but I do know of a tremendous amount of worry that people have about the medical data privacy issues connected with genetic counseling and testing. We are looking into that as well but not as a telemedicine project. Mrs. Lowey. I was just thinking that between the Internet and telemedicine, I was talking recently to a parent who is desperately worried about a young adult, not even so young adult, with Crohn's Disease in London and worried about what is the treatment there, is it as sophisticated as ours. I wonder to what extent would a physician take a file and send it through whatever means you have now to someone at the National Institutes of Health, to a hospital where they're expert in that, and whether you can't essentially do a teleconference. Dr. Lindberg. Oh, sure. Mrs. Lowey. In the old days, you used to have to fly to New York, fly here, go to this clinic. I would imagine, or I should ask that in the form of a question, is this technology being used right now where you can essentially have a teleconference with a file remaining in London, for example, and let there be a conference with experts in several places? Dr. Lindberg. Yes. There are several good examples of that. In our country, Mayo Clinic operates in four places--Rochester, Minnesota, Florida, Arizona--and they set up exactly that sort of system for their own patients. They are already able to deal with this problem across state lines. Are the doctors licensed properly to do all this? Is there a secure line? There is, they own it. So working within that corporation, exactly what you describe is being done on a daily basis. In other cases, like Columbia Presbyterian, they actually have referral systems set up to the Middle East. So for special cases that is being done. But I think you want a more general solution. I think we want a solution that makes this available to really every American that needs it. That's coming. Mrs. Lowey. I thank you. Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey. Dr. Lindberg, we have many more questions that we're going to have to ask you to answer for the record. Mr. Porter. We very much appreciate your good testimony, Dr. Lindberg, and your wonderful leadership at the National Library of Medicine. I think you are at the epicenter of this revolution of knowledge and technology that is happening across the world, and I am sure that you find your work fascinating every single day. We very much appreciate the leadership you are providing, and your good staff. Dr. Lindberg. It is kind of you to say that. Thank you very much. Mr. Porter. Thank you, sir. The committee will stand in recess briefly. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 1336 - 1376--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Wednesday, March 5, 1997. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH WITNESSES DR. PATRICIA A. GRADY, DIRECTOR MARY CUSHING, EXECUTIVE OFFICER ELLEN MOUL, BUDGET OFFICER DR. RUTH KIRSCHSTEIN, M.D., DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NIH DENNIS P. WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DHHS Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. We would like to next welcome Dr. Patricia Grady, the Director of the National Institute of Nursing Research. Dr. Grady, if you will introduce the people you have brought with you, and then proceed with your statement. Introduction of Witnesses Dr. Grady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On my left is Ms. Ellen Moul, our Budget Officer; Ms. Mary Cushing, our Executive Officer; Dr. Ruth Kirschstein of course you know well, and Mr. Williams, who is from the Department. Opening Statement Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to be here today to describe for you NINR-supported research that demonstrates the relevance and the extent of our research endeavors. I look forward to discussing our current and planned research for fiscal year 1998. These proposed programs reflect our prior research investment, emerging scientific needs, and opportunities available for pursuit. Nursing research focuses on the patient and involves clinical research directly related to the Nation's major health issues. Several changes are occurring in our society that underscore the importance of this. First, the mean age of our population is shifting to the upper decades of life. With longer lives, we can expect an increase in chronic illnesses which require more frequent and more costly health care. Second, the cost is requiring us to examine health care delivery. The demand for therapeutic innovations through nursing research discoveries has never been greater. pain research Let me provide three examples for you of our unique contributions in the area of pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and reducing risk for cardiovascular disease. First, I would like to highlight a health concern that is common to all of us, that of pain. Pain generates nearly 40 million yearly visits to health care providers, can prolong hospital stays, and may impede recovery. Research on pain is complicated, because although we all share a basic common physiology, the responses to pain may differ. Recently, an NINR-supported study on pain generated a great deal of interest across the Nation. Investigators found that gender plays a key role in pain relief. Women in this study obtained satisfactory relief from seldom used kappa-opioid drugs while men received little benefit. An advantage of kappa- opioids is that they have fewer side-effects compared to the more typically used morphine-like opioids. Additional work is needed to better understand the underlying reasons for this, such as the possible role of estrogen or testosterone in mediating pain, and whether or not women, for example, may have additional kappa receptors on certain nerve cells more than men, thus enabling kappa-opioids to block pain better in this population. This is an important area of research with many yet unanswered questions about better management of pain. This research also underscores the importance of including subjects of both genders in clinical studies. irritable bowel syndrome Another health problem that affects 10 to 15 percent of Americans and two to three times more women than men involves understanding a cluster of symptoms known as irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. Scientists found that women diagnosed with IBS have a heightened activity of the sympathetic nervous system, the so-called flight or fight system, which appears to be linked to higher levels of stress. This study's findings can impact positively in the area of cost-effectiveness. Currently, IBS is diagnosed indirectly through a process of excluding other causes. If a positive diagnosis were possible based on scientific methods, the result could be fewer doctors visits with subsequent savings in time for patients, and dollars to the health care system. cardiovascular disease My third example is that of reducing risk for cardiovascular disease. The roots of adult cardiovascular disease often go back to childhood, making interventions early in life key to achieving a healthy adulthood. Researchers have designed and tested an eight-week intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in more than 2,200 third and fourth graders in rural and urban areas, almost 20 percent of whom were African-American youngsters. By the study's end, students showed reductions in total cholesterol levels, body mass index, and body fat, as well as increased physical endurance. This type of study has a profound potential impact on the health of our future citizens. cultural diversity As you can see, nursing research encompasses both behavioral and biological aspects of health. Threaded through NINR's research portfolio is an interest in the relationship between ethnic and cultural diversity and health. For example, if questionnaires and health assessments are in English only, non-English-speaking subjects will be excluded from health research findings and miss participating in studies which may benefit them. NINR-supported researchers successfully translated and tested an English language arthritis self- management program into Spanish for Hispanic patients with arthritis. This program is now useful for Spanish-speaking arthritis patients, thus addressing their health needs and improving their quality of life. future research emphases The continuing vitality of nursing research stems from the many questions that remain to be answered. To this end, future NINR research emphases include: research on symptoms associated with such neurological problems as stroke and traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, motor problems such as Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury, chronic debilitating problems such as diabetes and AIDS, and studies of factors related to successful family caregiving. NINR, in collaboration with others at NIH, supports development of promising ways to prevent progressive deterioration caused by these problems. transplantation With 12,000 organ transplantations each year and the improved technology available, many of these patients are surviving into their 50s and 60s, and face long-term drug regimens which can have serious side effects. These include osteoporosis, cancer, neurologic problems, and cardiac dysfunction. The NINR will explore ways to improve the quality of life of long-term transplantation survivors. end of life End of life issues will encompass bioethical, biological, and behavioral studies. We plan to identify research needs in, and address the transition to: palliative care, management of pain and other symptoms, measurement of relief from symptoms, and documentation of financial burdens for patients and family caregivers. As NINR begins its second decade at the NIH, current and emerging research and societal issues intensify the need for nursing research. Clinically-based, patient-oriented nursing research is well positioned to make important contributions to improving the health and the quality of life for all our citizens. fy 98 budget request Mr. Chairman, the fiscal year 1998 request for NINR is $55,692,000. I will be pleased to answer any questions you might have. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 1380 - 1383--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] justification of the budget estimates Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Grady. Dr. Grady, you are a relatively new director of a relatively new institute. How would you feel if Congress gave you only 2.2 percent more than last year to work with this year? Dr. Grady. Mr. Chairman, we would be grateful for any increase over last year's budget. Mr. Porter. Dennis isn't listening. [Laughter.] Dr. Grady. But we do have big plans for growing. We have experienced growth in a constrained economy since we came on board. We have been very fortunate with the support of the NIH and the budget. But we also do have very large plans that we could implement in terms of training and in terms of initiatives. So the more that is available, we will promise to put it to good use. professional judgment budget Mr. Porter. How much did you ask Ruth to provide to you initially? Dr. Grady. Well, our professional judgment budget was approximately 9 percent over this year. In fact, you mentioned being new, there's another aspect of the newness that I could add to that. That is the fact that the field of nursing research is still a relatively new and growing field. We are in the very interesting situation of funding nearly as many trainees as we fund active researchers. So you can see that what we're really dealing with is a field that is justabout to explode, and we have a number of people in the pipeline and a number of really good ideas to be able to fund. communication with health care providers Mr. Porter. It is important that the results of your research studies on patient care are communicated to major health care providers like hospitals and HMOs. What mechanisms have you established to encourage this transfer of information? Dr. Grady. We have several ways that we are attacking that situation. As you have mentioned, it is a very large audience. There are 2.2 million nurses across the country that we need to reach, as well as other team members, to inform them of the results of the research and to be able to implement them. We have a number of conferences that we participate in each year. We also have a Home Page and are using the Internet very actively in addition to the usual peer review publications. I also regularly write columns for the major publications in nursing and also interdisciplinary publications such as newsletters. We have a nursing outreach newsletter that we do have online. And we also are very responsive to the many inquiries that we get. Mr. Porter. Have you found that providers are reluctant to adopt your research findings if they have an adverse impact on their bottom line? Dr. Grady. An interesting thing about nursing research is, that compared to what you've been hearing about high technology, much of nursing research really is relatively low technology. There are interventions that are used that are patient-specific that tend to often effect better outcomes for patients but without being as expensive as some others. They are, however, somewhat more time intensive. That is an issue that we do need to deal with. We are funding a number of studies, for example, of nurses working with inner-city students who are at risk for HIV or, in fact, are HIV infected, counseling them to see if techniques with one-on-one counseling versus small group counseling would be more effective. In fact, we have found that working with small groups, which is much more effective in terms of time, has just as good outcomes as the one-on-one. So we're experimenting with ways to deal with these issues. clinical research conference Mr. Porter. Your Institute co-sponsored a conference several weeks ago at the Clinical Center to explore the options available to maintain the continued health of clinical research given the changes in the health care marketplace. Can you share with us the ideas that were generated at this conference? Dr. Grady. Yes. There were a number of very interesting ideas generated at that conference. The major issue was attempting to deal with the changing health care landscape, that of managed care and HMOs coming into the marketplace. As it turns out really, a number of issues that are dealt with by nursing research, are very germane to, and would be helpful to the new circumstances in which we find ourselves. Much of what nurses do is to deal with reducing risk, promoting healthy life styles, and prevention. So that much of what we are engaged in is, in fact, very cost-effective and is something which used appropriately could be useful in the new circumstances. I will give you one example. One of our long-time funded researchers from University of Pennsylvania, who has moved to Ohio to Cleveland Clinic, has a model which is called a ``transitional model'' of care in which patients using this model, which is a nurse-managed model, patients are able to leave the hospital earlier, have fewer unplanned return visits, and in general, fare quite well compared to patients discharged early without this type of model. The populations that have been addressed successfully are: mothers who would have low birth weight infants, resulting in follow-up ahead of time, resulting in a lower number of low birth weight babies; also, women who have come into the hospital for unplanned Cesarian sections, hysterectomies, and other moderate types of surgical interventions and/or illnesses. These patients have fared quite well with this model, and, in fact, it has turned out that it is cost-effective. So there was a great deal of interest in hearing the results of those particular research studies. nursing publications Mr. Porter. Your Institute celebrated its tenth anniversary last fall. I'm sure you've seen an increasing maturity in the nursing research you supported during that period. In what journals does nursing research tend to be covered? Have nurse researchers broken into the ``big league'' journals? Dr. Grady. Yes. The lead study of the group that I just mentioned to you was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. There have been subsequent publications from that type of research published in that journal. Also, a number of other journals, Lung, and some of the physiology journals related to cardiovascular health, are also regularly published in by nurses. The major leading journal that nurses publish in, the research journal, is Nursing Research. However, the work is finding its way into many other journals. Much of what is going on now in the field is multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. So many of these studies, in order to address the appropriate audience, need to be published in multidisciplinary journals. So we are covering the waterfront, as it were. traumatic brain injury Mr. Porter. One of your areas of research priority is traumatic brain injury. New legislation focuses attention on brain injury throughout the Public Health Service both in terms of research and services. What is already known about managing the care of traumatic brain injury victims that could be useful for the service demonstrations being operated by HRSA? Dr. Grady. There are several studies in this area that are relevant. For several years, we have funded studies related to patients following traumatic brain injury in acute care settings relative to suctioning procedures and other intensive- care procedures that result in an increase in intracranial pressure. As you may know from the background materials from that group, one of the major dangers in the early post- traumatic period is a further increase in intracranial pressure resulting in further brain damage. That's an area in which several changes in care delivery as a result of these studies have shown the ability to either prevent the increase or actually result in a reduction of increase while care is being given. There are other areas of study which impact on this. One of our major initiatives is that of cognitive impairment, measuring changes in brain function as it relates to learning, memory, and awareness of one's environment. That is a major initiative of the Institute. The difference there now from earlier days is that the tools that are available to measure levels ofconsciousness and responsiveness of individuals following injury are much better. So that one can actually determine if an intervention or a way of caring for someone is actually beneficial. Earlier on, one could imagine that it might be or one could make an educated guess, but now one can actually measure that. In the coming year, we plan to encourage more applications in that area. We are collaborating with several institutes on campus in planning for that. currency with research Mr. Porter. This is a question for both you and Dr. Kirschstein. All of the directors that have testified before us appear to us to be extremely knowledgeable in their fields, including Dr. Grady. I wonder, Dr. Kirschstein, if you could tell us how they receive their information. Is it sitting down with researchers who are working on particular projects and learning directly from them? Is it all read? How do they keep up with the expanding knowledge in each of their fields? It seems to me very difficult to keep up with, there is so much going on. Dr. Kirschstein. First of all, Mr. Porter, I think all of us find it is extremely difficult to keep up. But the best way they do it is by working very, very hard. They do, indeed, spend hours and days in all sorts of settings--meeting with researchers, going to research conferences, reading the literature, calling in groups of experts, interacting constantly, and then finding time, as they can, to think about it all, synthesize it, and put it into some planning effort and some sort of priority setting that you've been very interested in. It is a formidable task and they all do it extremely well. One of the reasons I think they are all so successful at it is that they have remarkable backgrounds to begin with. They have been well-trained, either as physicians or as research- trained nurses, or as research scientists with other doctoral level degrees. They have probably all had quite distinguished careers, some more than others, nevertheless, as researchers, and have kept their interest and their enthusiasm and their excitement about science very current. Mr. Porter. I might add that applies to you and Doctor Varmus, obviously, more than perhaps anyone, because you have got to know all of the different fields and keep up with this vast amount of knowledge. Dr. Grady, would you like to add to that at all? Dr. Grady. Just that I would agree that Dr. Kirschstein never rests. In all honesty, to pick up on that, we do find ourselves in a number of settings. I think the best way I find to stay informed is to be able to collect the data from a number of sources, both from the literature, from meetings, in person, getting out to the sites. I find that it is often very helpful. If you are available on the Internet, or when I go to a scientific meeting I try to visit the nearby universities and speak while I'm there, people will bring concerns to you or they will bring the excitement of what they're doing in the clinic, in the laboratory to you. It helps, I think, to keep the vitality to hear it firsthand and to be able to share in that excitement. It makes it much more real. Mr. Porter. Thank you very much. Mrs. Lowey. Mrs. Lowey. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I, too, would like to join the Chairman in welcoming you, Dr. Grady, and your colleagues. I have been a long time supporter and advocate for the nursing profession. I do feel that with our focus on quality yet cost-effective care the nursing profession has an extraordinary amount to contribute. So I really do appreciate it. And as we move forward, I think your work on the nursing profession will become even more invaluable and will be paid attention to. So I thank you very much. Dr. Grady. Thank you. research training issues Mrs. Lowey. Along with that, the Nurse Education Act is a major source of support for programs for baccalaureate nurses who become the graduate students, nurses with advanced degrees, and faculty who perform nursing research. Would the NINR research agenda be hurt by a decrease in the number of nurses able to pursue a graduate degree or to move into faculty at schools of nursing? The administration's fiscal year 1998 budget reduces spending for nursing education by 88 percent--88 percent. If that budget were to become law, what would be its effect on nursing research? Dr. Grady. We depend for our research practitioners on those graduates of baccalaureate schools across the country. The average individual entering a doctoral program already has a bachelors and a masters degree in nursing. So we do rely on that. For us, it is a pipeline issue, that we do need to keep the supply coming. As you have implied by your question, the number of nurse researchers that are in demand exceeds the supply that is available. So we do very much need to keep that group coming. As I mentioned earlier, we are a young field and so the pipeline effect is really an important issue. We have many people who are entering training but we're just barely getting to where we need to be. women's health issues Mrs. Lowey. Can you please update the subcommittee with regard to your work to improve women's health. For example, several years ago you were involved in an initiative with the Office of Research on Women's Health to examine whether women should undergo hysterectomies for noncancerous conditions. What is the status of that project, and could you please highlight your work on other women's health issues? Dr. Grady. Yes. Regarding the issue of hysterectomies in women, the report has now been published and it was found that there are fewer hysterectomies being performed on women for noncancerous conditions now than there were previously. There are a number of questions being asked before that is done. It is not the obvious first choice option which reportedly it had been in the past, although the data was more hearsay then than now. We are involved in a number of women's health areas. We, in fact, are one of the recipients of a fair number of resources from the Office of Research on Women's Health who co-funds through us to address several areas of women's health. Let me take the issue of screening for breast cancer for older women who are obviously at risk. This has been a problem group both in cities and also in rural areas. We are funding, for example, one study which is a, let me use the word, linkage study, meaning something different than you've heard earlier this week. Basically, this is a study to test whether linking up young women who are very aware of the risks and the dangers and accept this as an important tool, linking up younger women with older women to try to use a sort of mother-daughter approach to getting those women in for testing. The preliminary results are encouraging. We also are participating in the Swan-Study of Women Across the Nation, that is a consortium with the Aging Institute, addressing the health of older women.We fund one of the seven clinical sites. The area that we fund focuses primarily on the health needs of African-American older women. We also are funding a study looking at sleep disturbances in women with fibromyalgia. This, as you know, is a problem that has a much higher incidence in women than men. Sleep disturbance and pain are associated problems. We're funding a study in that area, one of only a few studies looking at those issues. We also are funding a number of studies looking at improvement in prenatal care to try to identify women at risk for low birth weight babies, women who are part of underserved rural populations, getting them in. We have one such study that is funded in Hawaii that resulted in a decrease in the number of low birth weight babies and also in a large increase in women in that group coming in for prenatal care. That was an interesting study in that what it did was to use specifically tailored approaches to the population so that it incorporated not just the well-known principles of promoting health in prenatal women and early child birth, but also looked at the cultural component and investigated the use of native healers in that population. By incorporating them on the team, there was a much larger response to that initiative. I could go on. Women's health is a major focus of many of our studies. breast self-exams Mrs. Lowey. I was disturbed by the report yesterday that the results of a study that took place in Shanghai, China, challenged whether breast self-exams are effective in detecting cancer. News reports stated that there are few studies on the efficacy of breast self-exams. This would seem to be a necessary area of research, perhaps between your Institute and the National Cancer Institute. Could you please comment? Dr. Grady. I think that is an interesting observation. Because of the availability of many high technologies now, there has been a period of time when less attention has been paid to breast self-exam as a way of detecting small cancers. I think that for populations, as an adjunct to other technologies, that it still is thought by many to offer a useful screening approach. We do not currently fund studies that specifically are looking at the efficacy of that, although we do fund studies which are encouraging women to do breast self-exam along with the other healthy life style choices. In fact, we do co-fund with the Cancer Institute one such study which looks at a variety of screening methods to encourage people to use them, but it does not specifically look at the efficacy of one versus the other. But it is something that we do need to attend to. counseling for genetic screening Mrs. Lowey. In the area of genetic screening, as we all know, genetic tests for breast cancer are available in the private market. Additional genetic tests for diseases such as Alzheimer's will be available soon. I am very concerned about the development of counseling strategies to help individuals and families decide whether or not to undergo these genetic tests. If they decide to, how do you deal with the possible results. Nurses, it would seem to me, can play, and should play, a significant role in helping to develop such counseling programs. Perhaps you could discuss with us the role the Nursing Institute is playing in this area. To what extent are you coordinating your work with the Human Genome and National Cancer Institute? Dr. Grady. We agree with you that nurses could, and should, play an important role in that area. We are collaborating with the National Human Genome Research Institute and the National Cancer Institute as well in this area. Specifically, we have collaborated with the Genome Institute in bringing nurses together from across the country who are involved in genetics in any way to look at what will ultimately be a core curriculum for nurses in genetics, and to look at the areas of need for counseling and to identify issues involved. We also participate with them in funding several grants under the ELSI program that is a part of the Genome Institute. We also fund several others along the lines of using a decision-making approach. One such grant is looking at the decision-making for those people who are considering BRCA-1 testing. So we are addressing this from a number of areas and expect to continue to do that as time goes on. As you all have heard on several occasions from Dr. Collins, the percent of the genes that are identified as part of the Human Genome that actually are one gene-one disease is probably roughly as low as 10 percent. The other 90 percent of the genome will code for a predisposition. A misspelling in a particular gene will result in a predisposition to developing a disorder but not necessarily a certainty. The other factors that would play into it are factors such as diet, exercise, environment, and many others that we have not yet identified. As this body of information grows, the role of individuals, in this case it would be specifically the nurse, to identify what factors can be modified and to try to work with patients to intervene to either diminish the risk or introduce a healthy life style will become much more important as time goes on. Mrs. Lowey. I thank you, Dr. Grady. I think, as the population is getting older, the role of nurses working with chronic illness, with the patient, with the families will become increasingly important. I thank you again. I look forward to working with you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Grady. Thank you. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey. Dr. Grady, we have many more questions for you for the record that we would ask that you answer. Thank you for the fine job you're doing at NINR. We hope to do better by you than the President has done in his budget. That, of course, depends upon the overall budget and the budget allocations. Obviously, you, along with the other directors of the institutes, are doing wonderful work. You need resources to advance that work. You need resources to keep good people involved. We want to do the best that we possibly can to help you do that. Dr. Grady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We appreciate that. Mr. Porter. Thank you. The committee will stand in recess briefly. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 1391 - 1442--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Wednesday, March 5, 1997. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER WITNESSES PHILIP E. SCHAMBRA, Ph.D., DIRECTOR STEPHANIE J. BURSENOS, DEPUTY DIRECTOR RICHARD MILLER, EXECUTIVE OFFICER RUTH KIRSCHSTEIN, M.D., DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH DENNIS WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. Next we are pleased to welcome Dr. Philip Schambra, the Director of the Fogarty International Center. And Dr. Schambra, why don't you introduce the people you brought with you, and then proceed with your statement. Introduction of Witnesses Dr. Schambra. Thank you very much, Mr. Porter. To my left is Mr. Richard Miller, the Executive Officer of the Fogarty Center. To my right is Ms. Stephanie Bursenos, the Deputy Director of the Fogarty Center. And of course, you know Dr. Kirschstein and Mr. Williams, to her right. Opening Statement Mr. Chairman, if I may I'd like to submit my full statement for the record and give a brief oral presentation, starting out by commenting that once again it's my distinct privilege to present the programs and accomplishments of the Fogarty International Center. As you know, our namesake, John Fogarty, served as Chairman of this committee for 18 years, from 1949 to 1967. He was the first of a continuing lineage of Congressmen and women who have enabled NIH to become the world's leader in the pursuit of health through biomedical research. The Fogarty International Center was established by Congress specifically to improve health through international scientific cooperation. This broad mandate has required us to set priorities and concentrate our resources on strategic health areas. As an outcome of our long-range plan, we've identified scientific training programs with developing nations as our foremost priority to prepare the United States to meet urgent global health challenges. Our working principle is to coordinate our programs, not only across NIH, but across the Federal Government. In fact, almost 60 percent of the funds managed by the FIC, including AIDS funding allocated by the Office of AIDS research, are derived from other NIH or Federal components, who view FIC as a means of advancing their international goals. Moreover, these intra and interagency alliances reduce administrative costs and streamline management. The model for FIC's global health efforts is our AIDS International Training and Research Program. Since its inception in 1988, more than 1,000 scientists from over 80 countries have received training in the United States, and now assist us in our international prevention efforts. This past year, the program documented a substantial decrease in the prevalence of HIV in the population of one foreign country as a result of a systematic prevention strategy. The long-range objective is to create these same partnerships to meet the challenges of new and emerging infectious diseases, environmental pollution and unsustainable population growth. The aim is to demonstrate a compelling leadership role for the United States in reaching global solutions to global problems through biomedical research training. Since the completion of our long-range plan, we have launched research training programs on population and health with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of NIH, and on environmental and occupational health with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences at NIH, and the Centers for Disease Control, and in new and emerging infectious diseases with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH. These early investments are already yielding public health benefits. For example, in 1996, a scientist from Gabon received research training on Ebola virus at Yale University under our training program in new and emerging infectious diseases. Upon return to Gabon, he traced the origin of an Ebola-infected patient to a rural lumber camp. And because of his special training, he was able to perform the required laboratory studies in collaboration with CDC scientists. As a consequence, Gabon was able to confirm the Ebola outbreak, take appropriate treatment and prevention measures, and undertake a research program to identify the natural history of the virus. In addition to these research training programs, FIC undertakes concerted efforts to bring new resources and scientific perspectives to global health through allianceswith other Federal agencies. In cooperation with the National Science Foundation and the Agency for International Development, and with the strong endorsement of this Committee, in 1993 the FIC initiated the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups Program. Its purpose is to discover new drugs from the earth's biological resources, while preserving national ecosystems and promoting economic growth through drug development. Since its inception, over 3,000 species of plants and insects have been examined for their potential therapeutic properties. Bioactive samples are now being tested as candidate drugs against certain cancers and viral diseases, malaria and degenerative neurological disorders. Finally, Mr. Chairman, last year, Dr. Varmus noted to the committee that a special panel would be established to review the ways in which the NIH carries out its commitments to international health. The report of the panel, co-chaired by Dr. Joshua Lederberg of Rockefeller University and Dr. Barry Bloom of Albert Einstein Medical College is now completed. And I'm pleased to note their strong recommendation of a strengthened international role for all NIH components. I'm particularly pleased that the panel endorsed the directions pursued in the FIC long-range plan. They cite the plan as a thoughtful and forward-looking approach for guiding FIC's future activities and commend the Center for demonstrating a leadership role. The report does recommend that FIC reassess several longstanding fellowship programs in light of its more recent global health priorities. This recommendation is consistent with internal discussions currently underway with Dr. Varmus and others within the NIH leadership. I'd like to conclude by noting that the political basis for public investment in biomedical research emerged from our Nation's critical needs during World War II. Today, the pursuit of health through research again is essential for our Nation's security. Scientific solutions to global health threats require a coordinated global response. Congressman Fogarty once remarked that our international health programs can be characterized as enlightened self- interest, since it can be amply demonstrated that we receive as well as give. With the support of Congress, FIC will continue to advance this important mission through international cooperation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our fiscal year 1998 budget request is $16,755,000. And I'll be pleased to answer any questions that you or members of the committee may have. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 1446 - 1449--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] other countries leading in biomedical research Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Schambra. I will forego my usual question about your 2.3 percent increase, because I think Mr. Williams has coached all of you to answer roughly the same way. Let me ask a general question that I'm just kind of curious about. What other countries, in the order of magnitude and quality, have research communities that are somewhat comparable to the United States? Japan, Germany, France? Dr. Schambra. That is certainly an easy one to answer, and you've started---- Mr. Porter. There are none? Dr. Schambra. Japan has a superb biomedical research enterprise as a whole, indeed, in all fields of science, developed since the Second World War. Canada is certainly a leading scientific power. In fact, second to none as the largest foreign collaborator with the United States. A great number of our research grants given to foreign scientists, about half, go to Canadian scientists. Germany, France, very predominantly. The United Kingdom and other countries in Western Europe, Holland and the Netherlands are all leading countries in biomedical research. The Scandinavian countries are important powers in this field as well. Mr. Porter. Now, since World War II, 30 percent of the Nobel prizes awarded to scientists for research discoveries under NIH support were received by foreign researchers. This seems like quite a remarkable statistic, given that less than 1 percent of NIH extramural grants in that period went to foreign investigators. How should we interpret this statistic? Should we assume that competition for NIH grants is so intense that only the very top international grantees win grants? Or should we be concerned about the competitive standing of U.S. researchers? Or is this a function of some other factors? Dr. Schambra. I think first and foremost, what it means is that NIH research administrators know how to pick winners. And in fact, it also illustrates, I think, very vividly, the importance of international collaboration between scientists, in this case, leading scientists who have made major discoveries that have led to the ultimate recognition of winning the Nobel prize. It is important for the NIH to support that type of international collaboration. Dr. Kirchstein. Mr. Chairman, if I may add something. There are policies at NIH that only a certain number of awards will be made to scientists abroad, so that the vast majority of the money can be provided to United States investigators. fellowship programs Mr. Porter. Under the NIH Visiting Program, more than 2,000 foreign scientists are supported each year in fellowships and assignments to the NIH intramural program at a cost of more than $70 million. Does this large international training program swamp the impact of the smaller Fogarty training programs, which also bring foreign scientists to the United States? Dr. Schambra. Well, yes, I think in fact it does, Mr. Chairman. And the realization of that fact alone, in conjunction with other considerations, has led us to modify some of our fellowship programs in recent years. When I became Director of the Fogarty Center in 1988, our major investment, in fact, was in training foreign scientists in the United States. But it represented only about 130, at the most, foreign scientists coming to the United States, and them mostly from the developed regions of the world. About three-quarters of the scientists came from Western Europe and Japan, and other developed countries of the world. These were small numbers compared to the very large numbers you cited who come from abroad to work just in the intramural research program at NIH. So we felt that given that fact, and the much more demonstrable need to provide training for scientists from developing countries and countries that had just emerged into the democratic sphere of international life in EasternEurope and the former Soviet Union, that we would in fact reduce our programs and focus on those scientists to the preference of offering fellowships very broadly in competition with the intramural research program at NIH. Mr. Porter. Do you have any data on the number of trainees, or the proportion of trainees that stay in the U.S. after completing their training rather than returning to their home countries? Dr. Schambra. We looked at that question in connection with, in fact, a program I just cited a few years ago. I don't have up to date, that is current figures, but then in excess of 90 percent of the fellows that we were training under our programs returned to their home country. Even today, the nature of the foreign scientists who we bring under our various training programs to the United States for training come under visa provisions that require them to return to their home country after finishing their training. In addition, we usually make it a condition of their training here that in fact they have a place to go back to, and they in fact intend to go back to their home country. But that can't, of course, be 100 percent. But I'd say 90, 95 percent is probably a pretty good batting average. Mr. Porter. Do you have data on the percentage of international trainees in Fogarty programs who go on to compete successfully for NIH research grants? Dr. Schambra. At one time, and in fact also in connection with this particular program, we did look at that question. Frankly, I don't remember what the data at that point showed, Mr. Porter, but I'd be pleased to provide that for the record. [The information follows:] Fellowship Programs The study I have referred to focused on the percentage of fellows who returned to their home countries and the types of employment pursued following their return. However, we now have begun to monitor the number of FIC-supported fellows who are subsequently supported by other NIH institutes. Under the AIDS International Training and Research Program, an important share of former trainees now participate in international research projects supported by NIAID. These include, for example, studies of natural history of HIV in Haiti and in Senegal, prevention research in Thailand on vaginal microbicides and studies in Uganda on the relationship between HIV and tuberculosis. Dr. Schambra. As Dr. Kirchstein pointed out, the number would be extremely small, in view of the fact that about 1 percent of NIH research grants in total go to foreign scientists. Mr. Porter. Yes, I understand that the number is relatively small. But you could still see how many go to ones that you've trained. Dr. Schambra. Right, absolutely. external panel review Mr. Porter. As you mentioned, the Lederberg panel commissioned by Dr. Varmus to review the structure of the Fogarty Center recommended last September that the Center's current mission and structure be retained in large part. It did, however, suggest that three training programs, Scholars in Residence, Senior International Fellowships, and International Research Fellowships, be reduced significantly. The 1998 budget appears to straight line these three programs. Do you disagree with the panel's judgement? Dr. Schambra. Having developed a long-range plan, we have been looking particularly at those programs for their validity and relevance in today's situation. As far as the budget projections for fiscal year 1998 are concerned, some of the money that is in that straight line is for the purpose of paying for commitments that have been made in prior years. In the case of the International Research Fellowship Program, that is the program that I referred to a moment ago as having already been very substantially reduced to about a third of its size from some five years ago. We are in discussion with Dr. Varmus and the leadership at NIH about the future of these programs and alternatives that might be in fact more pertinent to today's needs on the international scene. Mr. Porter. The Lederberg panel also recommended that a critical review of Fogarty's functional units be undertaken in the near future to determine the most efficient use of its resources. Do you plan to follow up on this recommendation? Dr. Schambra. Yes. In fact, we do. I'm pleased to say that that, too, can be seen as an encouragement to continue the process that we've already started several years ago with our long-range plan, and which, in fact at that time, we did reorganize the Fogarty Center, reducing the number of operating branches from five to three divisions. As you know also, Dr. Varmus, with the support and encouragement of this committee, is arranging for a complete review of the administrative functions of the entire NIH. And we would certainly be a part of that process as well. Mr. Porter. Finally along this line, the Lederberg panel recommended that the Fogarty Center should take a more active role with the National Library of Medicine in exploiting contemporary methods of communication to facilitate international science. In what ways have you observed the Internet changing international research communication? Dr. Schambra. Well, clearly, this has been perhaps one of the most profound technical developments, even aside from the international aspects, in terms of communication between scientists. But now, when scientists can communicate with relative ease and relatively low expense over long distances, it brings a whole new perspective to the meaning of international collaboration. It is one of the topics that we again, I'm pleased to say, identified in our long-range plan as one that needs much closer analysis to see how it would, in fact, change the way we would go about supporting and conducting and encouraging international scientific collaboration. I'm very pleased that Dr. Lindberg invited me to be a member of a planning panel, chaired by Dr. Donald Frederickson, and on which Dr. Lederberg also sits, to look at the future international activities of the Library, and through that and subsequent discussions we hope to develop a joint approach to addressing exactly this question. human frontier science program Mr. Porter. Dr. Schambra, the Human Frontier Science Program is an effort to encourage global science collaborations funded mostly by the Japanese government. Is the Fogarty Center involved in this project? Dr. Schambra. To the tune of a half a million dollars a year we are, which is currently a third of the NIHcontribution to that program. Mr. Porter. Should your resources be used--well, I guess you're saying yes. Dr. Schambra. I was going to say that also, in fact our involvement has been much more than that. That was sort of a flip answer. But when the program was first discussed among the various governments, following the proposal by the Japanese Prime Minister in 1987, the Fogarty Center, on behalf of NIH, played a leading role in developing the concept of the program and the mechanisms through which it would operate. And in fact, assisted them in setting up a grants program modeled very much along the lines of NIH's. We're certainly pleased to see the program prosper and grow, because we, the United States, have been the principal or predominant beneficiaries of the program. The decision for the Fogarty Center to contribute half a million dollars, I think it was made by the leadership of NIH. I have no argument with it. Because I think it's a very, excellent program and it ought to be supported in one fashion or another. And whether it comes from our budget or collectively from the Institutes, I think is an administrative judgment. Mr. Porter. Are there other similar programs funded outside of Fogarty and NIH that provide resources for international research collaboration? Dr. Schambra. Outside Fogarty and outside NIH, the answer is yes. I would say that probably every agency in the Public Health Service, in this Department, has an international office and is involved to a greater or lesser extent in international scientific collaboration. Every Department of the Government has a strong international presence and office. I would say that there are very few of them that have a direct appropriation to support international scientific collaboration, but would have to depend on funds that are appropriated to other components of the agency, for the most part. former soviet union--state of science Mr. Porter. What is your assessment of the state of scientific enterprise in the former Soviet Union? From press reports, it sounds like a massive brain drain is occurring as government funding for science there evaporates. Dr. Schambra. Well, I think that's a very pertinent and very serious question for the Russians these days. There's no question that the state of science all told in the former Soviet Union is in a state of near disaster. It's a question of funds being made available to pay a payroll, it's funds being made available to keep the electric power on and the heating on in facilities, to buy supplies and reagents. I think that one of the things that we have been able to do and do very quickly through the appropriation of the Fogarty Center some years ago, in fact, was to provide small grants that were given to American scientists who wanted to collaborate with known competent Russian scientists, and help them through a period of time until other sources of funding could come to their support. George Soros, in the private sector, for example, the National Science Foundation, and other sources in the European Community as well. It is indeed a constant matter of concern that Russian science not disintegrate. Because there is a great deal of good science and good potential in the future. We just want to make sure that it goes into useful purposes. Mr. Porter. Are you training Russian scientists now as part of your program? Dr. Schambra. Yes, as part of our program, speaking very broadly, for NIH, we have about, I think six, they're number six in the order of countries with scientists in the NIH intramural research program. I think at the last count there are somewhere between 130 and 150 Russian scientists working in the intramural program at NIH. Mr. Porter. The problem is when they return, where do they get the resources to pursue any kind of research at home? Dr. Schambra. That is a concern. And one of the ways that they would get resources is through the Fogarty International Research Collaboration Award program, the FIRCA program. We have this program now, I believe it's in its fourth year, it started out as a program specifically focused on developing relations with Latin American scientists, but then when the opportunity arose in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, it was made available to them as well. These grants, while given to American researchers who want to collaborate with Russian researchers, are intended to provide support principally for the foreign scientists, the Russian scientists, in the form of the types of materials, the types of supplies that he or she would need to conduct research, to travel and stay in contact with their American or foreign colleagues. Mr. Porter. Maybe in their case, for the short term, we ought to encourage them to stay here, the good ones. Dr. Schambra. Better here than some other places in the world. biodiversity program Mr. Porter. Your budget justification states that a significant percentage of most prescribed drugs, such as antibiotics, have their origin in natural products. We are familiar with the cancer drug, taxol, which comes from the Pacific yew. But what are some other examples? Dr. Schambra. In fact, just to provide an overall figure, I'm not sure that I could provide the names of the prescription compounds, but our latest studies show that something like 57 percent of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States today come originally from natural compounds. Quinine is originally from a natural compound, aspirin is from a natural compound. The rosy periwinkle, which was discovered in Madagascar, provides vincristine and vinblastine, which is a very effective treatment for certain types of cancer. Dr. Kirchstein. You may remember that many of the antibiotics came from fungi; penicillin was originally bread mold, streptomycin is from a fungus that was discovered in New Jersey many, many years ago. So large numbers of them came, many of them have not been synthesized and had custom designing done to them. But the source is there. Mr. Porter. How much funding does your budget include for the biodiversity program? How much is spent on this effort throughout NIH by other institutes like Cancer, which has a substantial drug testing program for natural products? Dr. Schambra. To answer your latter question, in fact, we did a survey when we began our biodiversity cooperative group's program several years ago. I think at that time we found out that there were 12 Institutes, about half of the Institutes at NIH, were involved in developing pharmaceuticals from natural products for their particular purposes. I think the total dollar amount was about $60 million. And a third of that represented the Cancer Institute. As far as our international biodiversity program is concerned, Mr. Porter, that is funded currently at the total level of $2.5 million a year, of which about $1.5 million comes in a direct appropriation to the Fogarty Center. And as you know, the remaining amount comes from other Institutes at NIH, Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institute, the Heart Institute, the Cancer Institute, from the National Science Foundation and at one time from the Agency for International Development. And we haven't given up trying to attract them back to that program when it's up for renewal. [Clerk's note.--Later corrected to ``$1.3 million''] Mr. Porter. Well, if we give them some resources, they could participate. Dr. Schambra. That's right. Mr. Porter. Some of the drug companies are participating in your biodiversity program. How much do they invest in this on their own each year, independent of the Fogarty program? Dr. Schambra. We've estimated that to date, they have invested in kind or in cash probably about $1.5 million in total that we can clearly identify. Mr. Porter. How does the technology transfer aspect of your biodiversity program work? Do you sell licenses to drug companies to develop the substances identified by the Fogarty research? And is this a source of royalty income for NIH? Dr. Schambra. The way the program works is through five cooperative agreements, which are neither contracts nor grants, but something in between. They fall under the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act, in which any intellectual property developed under those agreements belongs to the grantee. Between the grantees themselves, where there is a university component, probably an academic component, and an industrial component, they will have developed among themselves an agreement for revenue sharing or income sharing for any product that arises. I might mention incidentally that in my opening remarks, I commented that we have about 3,000 samples that have been investigated for their pharmacologically active properties. Twenty-five of those have shown real promise and are in further tests right now. And we have one that has proceeded to the stage of applying for a patent. Mr. Porter. You tested 3,000 natural substances in two years. How many acres of rain forest are lost to development each day, and at the current pace, will you lose the race against deforestation before you can test the unique substances these forests contain? Dr. Schambra. That's a very good, hotly debated question. I think that one hears a wide range of answers to the question of how much are we losing on a daily basis. Let me try to answer it from the point of view of biological species, many of which, in fact, probably most of the undiscovered species are found in these tropical rain forests. It's estimated that there are somewhere between 10 million and 30 million species of various diversity around the world. Of that number, perhaps 10 percent are known to science, of that total number of 10 million to 30 million species, only 1 percent or less have actually been explored for their pharmaceutical potential. It's estimated that in the next 30 years, that we could lose as much as 20 percent of the planet's biological diversity at the rate that it is disappearing today. I think that will give you a sense of how quickly the rain forests and other natural environments are disappearing as well. Mr. Porter. And even our ability to clone won't help this? Dr. Schambra. That's right. [Laughter.] Mr. Porter. Dr. Schambra, thank you very much, both for your good testimony this afternoon, for your very direct answers to our questions and for the excellent job you're doing at the Fogarty International Center. We thank you, sir. Dr. Schambra. Thank you very much, Mr. Porter. Incidentally, before we close, if I might give you one of the tangible products that has come from our international biodiversity program, it is a publication on biodiversity and human health that reflects the proceedings of a symposium that we ran in conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution. I think that you might find it very interesting reading. It makes the case very cogently for the importance of the relationship between biodiversity and human health and the health of all. Mr. Porter. Thank you very much. If it's informational, I can receive it under House rules. Dr. Schambra. Strictly informational, sir. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Schambra. The subcommittee will stand in recess until 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

I'm pleased to introduce Ms. Kerza-Kwiatecki, who is our Executive Officer; Ms. Robyn Strachan, who is our Budget Officer; Dr. Steve Hausman, who's the Deputy Director; and of course, Dr. Varmus and Mr. Williams. Opening Statement I'm delighted and honored to appear before this committee. Our research areas cover many common and very chronic diseases that affect our joints, bones, muscles and skin, and compromise daily life for many Americans. I would like to share some of the progress made in our plans for seizing upon scientific opportunities in four areas: osteoarthritis, autoimmunity, skin cancer and osteoporosis. osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent disease of the joints. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the cartilage, which results in pain and dysfunction. It can affect any joint, but most commonly affects the hip or the knee joint. It takes a staggering toll in human suffering and economic costs. Osteoarthritis and related disorders account for more than half of all of the total hip replacements and over 85 percent of all the total knee replacements that are done in this country. It is predicted that osteoarthritis will affect 70 percent of our over age 65 group in our country, an astounding number of Americans. We've developed a multi-pronged approach to osteoarthritis in terms of the research agenda. Recent research results have provided some important clues to help understand and develop new strategies or innovative strategies to the prevention and treatment of osteoarthritis, and also to the basic understanding of osteoarthritis. Highlights during this last year include finding that a normal cellular component, nitric oxide, can affect cartilage cells. Cartilage cells are the cells that line the joints. It can affect it in many ways. It can affect how it produces certain of its products. It can also kill these cells. By killing these cells, and not having any replacement for these cells, there's nothing left of the cartilage. So nitric oxide, from many different studies that have been reported this year, has been a central focus for many different laboratories as a potentially important molecule to look at as far as its causing destruction. Laboratory studies have supported these findings in that, if one takes antioxidants and uses antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, beta carotene, in a test tube you can reverse some of these effects. Amplifying these findings, there are recent reports indicating that dietary factors, particularly antioxidants like vitamin C, may play an important role in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. And we do have some preliminary clinical studies that have recently been reported. total joint replacement A major advance also in the treatment of osteoarthritis is of course total joint replacement, in which damaged joint surfaces are replaced with metal and/or plastic components. These joint replacement procedures have generally been regarded as a very effective means of reducing pain and functional limitation associated with severe osteoarthritis. A NIAMS supported study verified the cost-effectiveness of total hip replacement. So if one takes a 60-year-old woman who needs total hip replacement, gets total hip replacement, over a 20-year period there is a cost savings of $117,000, just for medical costs. That has nothing to do with quality of life, and of course, quality of life is markedly improved in that she can then care for herself. Total joint replacements, however, are not without their problems, including concerns for the effect of the implant on the body. There is concern that a patient may develop osteolysis. Osteolysis is the disappearance of bone around the implant. And we are particularly interested in understanding why that happens. Because once it happens, it's very hard to do a second implant. The revision surgery becomes very, very expensive. We're also exploring the utility of non-surgical approaches to osteoarthritis. Since previous studiesindicated that certain antibiotics, such as doxycycline, inhibit the enzymes that are produced within the joint which destroy the cartilage, we are co-sponsoring an ongoing clinical trial on the effects of the antibiotic doxycycline on osteoarthritis. And I look forward to reporting progress about these studies to you next year. genetic studies As you've heard in prior testimony during this past week, genetic studies have provided important insights in many areas of medicine. The same is true for us in the area of autoimmunity, that is, in lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in skin cancer. systemic lupus erythematosus In lupus, very recently UCLA scientists have provided the first evidence linking a particular chromosomal region to lupus susceptibility. This is a particularly important finding, because it's found across all ethnic groups, that is, in African-Americans, in Asians, and Caucasians. This should facilitate identifying the specific gene involved, and from there, the even more difficult step will be pursued, and that is, identifying the function of the gene. rheumatoid arthritis This knowledge may open up new ideas regarding treatment or even prevention strategies. The same types of advances have been made in our intramural research program in rheumatoid arthritis. In this case, the genes have been identified in animal models rather than human beings. These animal models with rheumatoid arthritis show that susceptibility and severity is associated with certain gene types. I should say that we have made a major commitment to identifying susceptibility genes in lupus and in rheumatoid arthritis patients through various consortia that have been organized by extramural scientists since these studies require large numbers of patients and particularly important, families, to look at. skin cancer Also in the area of gene study, in the skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common form of human cancer, scientists this year have discovered that there are mutations in the human version of a gene that has its analog in fruit flies. And it was the gene that was first identified in fruit flies that now has translated to our knowledge of human disease. This gene is thought to be important for controlling cell growth. And with the mutation of this gene, there is no longer control of cell growth. These studies were initially identified in a very rare disease, very, very rare disease that probably doesn't occur in a thousand people in the country. But these findings are now extrapolatable to the very common form of basal cell carcinoma, and should provide us with a better understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases, and potential new approaches to therapy. osteoporosis Finally, I want to say a few words about new findings in osteoporosis, the leading cause of bone fractures. The clinical activity and mechanism of action of estrogens, which are important determinants in bone integrity in women, have been a major focus of our Institute's supported research. Since not all women are suitable candidates for estrogen replacement, it is important to determine the mechanism of estrogen action and determine alternative therapies. The effects of estrogen are complex, but there is much to be learned about the biochemical pathways through which they act. In recent research results, investigators have shown that estrogen induces death in the cells that actually break down bone. As you know, bone is a dynamic process, it's being broken down all the time, it's being built up all the time, and it's being broken down by cells called osteoclasts. And recent studies have demonstrated that estrogen and also estrogen analogs have an effect on these osteoclasts. They may produce premature death in the osteoclasts, which breaks down bone, and as a consequence, the buildup is much better. So that's one of the mechanisms by which estrogen produces good bone. These findings should provide us with new information on not only estrogen but also other drugs that may be used to produce the same types of effects. In conclusion, let me say that significant strides have been made in our understanding of diseases of bone, joints, muscles and skin. I am confident that the initiatives I have shared with you will do much to advance our knowledge of fundamental life processes and how they go awry in disease. Diseases that affect these tissues have the capacity to profoundly alter quality of life. The goal remains as always to improve the health of the American public, to reduce the burden of disease, and to enrich the quality of life of all Americans. fy 1998 budget request The budget request for NIAMS for fiscal year 1998 is $258,932,000. I would be pleased to answer any questions you might have. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 1495 - 1498--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] Mr. Porter. Dr. Katz, we're going to have to stand in recess because of a vote on the House Floor, so I'll leave you with a thought that you can ponder, your answer to my usual first question, what would you really like to have, rather than 2.4 percent. And the subcommittee will stand in recess until I return. [Recess.] Mr. Bonilla [assuming chair]. Dr. Katz, I ran into Mr. Porter on the way out and he said to go ahead and begin questioning. Dr. Katz. Thank you. Mr. Bonilla. I did review your testimony in advance, and I'm sorry I wasn't here to actually hear you. But the committee will now resume order, and I'd like to ask you a couple of questions, if I can. Dr. Katz. Of course. repetitive motion injuries Mr. Bonilla. Last year, Dr. Katz, you testified before this committee that there were important questions that remain unanswered about the causes of and preventive measures for repetitive motion injuries. Since your testimony last year, have we learned any more about the causes of these injuries? Dr. Katz. Yes. We are constantly learning more. At the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, we are supporting a broadarray of studies in terms of repetitive motion injuries that are looking at very molecular as well as clinical studies. So for example, in carpal tunnel syndrome, we've learned from a study in Boston the effect of certain types of surgery in terms of producing trigger fingers, which are often produced in carpal tunnel syndrome. We've learned that this type of surgical procedure is beneficial in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. We have also learned since last year that certain types of repetitive injury, for example, thrust injury, can produce certain types of molecular changes in cellular components. So we're constantly learning more about repetitive motion disorders. We are supporting a broad portfolio of research that goes from the very fundamental to the clinical. Mr. Bonilla. You touched on a couple of specific causes and effects that result in injuries. Are the causes of these disorders clearly identified and quantitatively related to their occurrence? You touched on that and gave a couple of examples, but if you would elaborate a little bit more, I would appreciate it. Dr. Katz. In certain industries where there is repetition and high force and awkward posture, it is thought that there is very good evidence that there is association between repetitive motion disorders, which affect mainly upper extremities, from the wrists to the elbows to the tendons to the carpal tunnel syndrome, to the tension neck syndrome, all of that related to repetitive motion, and sometimes low back pain is thought to be due to repetitive motion. So in those industries, such as the meat and poultry industry or automobile manufacturing, where there is repetitive motion and also in data entry and computers, it is thought that there is an association between repetitive motion disorders and repetitive motion injury. Mr. Bonilla. Is it fair to say, Dr. Katz, that we need additional research before we can answer the fundamental questions about what causes both upper and lower body extremity complaints, and what measures we can use to manage and prevent them? I understand we're making progress, but do we have a long way to go? Dr. Katz. We are making progress as a consequence of a joint conference in 1994 that we supported along with the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. As a consequence of recommendations from that conference, we have put out, or it will be out very shortly, a program announcement targeting many of the areas that you've talked about: in terms of learning, of gaining new information on the pathophysiology, that is the mechanisms involved in what these injuries are; the standardization of definition for disorders, identifying tissues that are injured, the nature of the injury, etc.; the diagnosis of the disorders; prospective studies of the value of functional capacity assessments, and predicting the successful return to work in patients who are affected; clinical studies to identify the optimal therapy; and the development of further delineation of ergonomic changes that are required in order to prevent these types of problems. Mr. Bonilla. There's a lot more to be done in the research area, based on this long list of questions that remain. Dr. Katz. There is a lot of research to be done. ergonomics products Mr. Bonilla. I'd like to refer now to a recent Washington Post article on this subject. There's been a lot of conflicting information about so-called ergonomic products. You've probably seen some of those on the market that claim to do one thing, but you're not really sure what they can do when you wind up buying them and putting them in your home or office. Last week's Washington Post had an article about how confusing this information is for consumers. In particular, there seems to be a debate about keyboard design. What, in your view, Dr. Katz, is the state of the art regarding knowledge about the optimal design for a keyboard that would minimize an individual's risk of developing repetitive motion complaints, such as carpal tunnel syndrome? Are there other equally or more important factors that could contribute to that risk? If so, what are they, and can we distinguish among these causes as to their relative contribution to a specific individual's complaint? Dr. Katz. That's a difficult question for me to answer, because I'm not an expert in that particular area. In terms of the design of keyboards, I would have to leave that to the ergonomics experts. Mr. Bonilla. And there are ergonomic experts out there, Doctor? Dr. Katz. There are said to be ergonomics experts. musculoskeletal disorders Mr. Bonilla. Who are some of the leading researchers in the field of MSDs who have received grants from NIAMS, Dr. Katz, and how are they selected? Dr. Katz. They're selected through a peer review process. Some of our experts on musculoskeletal disorders, when it comes to repetitive motion disorders, are supported through our centers program. We have a centers program in Boston, that is, at Harvard Medical School. Jeffrey Katz--no relationship--has a part of that project, and he is looking at the carpal tunnel syndrome. He's looking at all aspects of carpal tunnel syndrome, looking at outcomes of treatment, and also looking at studying the person's attitude towards work in terms of its effect on return to work from carpal tunnel syndrome. Other people around the country are also working on it. There are actually in some of our other centers, people who are looking at various aspects of carpal tunnel syndrome on a molecular basis. The names specifically, actually I can give you, if you give me one second. We do have a portfolio in that area. Mr. Bonilla. I only have about 10 minutes to go, Mr. Chairman--I'm kidding. [Laughter.] Dr. Katz. Let me give you a sense of what the people are doing in this area. Dr. Arthur Veis is an expert in the structure and assembly of collagen molecules and fibrils, and the project is being supported to understand the basic events involved in the formation of the supporting tissue in the body. Dr. Evan Flatow is supported on a career award to study the pathobiology of rotator cuff tendon injury. In other words, all of the injury of the rotator cuff is in the upper extremity, and all of these--tendonitis, rotator cuff injury--are thought to be related to this area. Arthur Olenick is an investigator at one of our centers. He is looking at the long-term goals of describing the epidemiology of musculoskeletal disorders in the State of Michigan,characterizing the resulting disability and to assess the role of various risk factors, that is, gender, age, source of injury, industry, occupation, etc. Dr. Julia Fawcett is looking at the disability of carpal tunnel syndrome. She's an investigator at one of our centers as well. I've already talked about the studies at Harvard, the outcomes of therapy for carpal tunnel syndrome, which investigators are looking at as a part of a centers project-- Drs. Vogel, Burke, Baines, and there are many others whom we are supporting through various mechanisms in the Institute. Now, how we make those decisions was the last part of your question. We make those decisions through the peer review process. Many of these grants are for research project grants which are submitted and reviewed by our Division of Research Grants study sections. They're given a high priority score and are consequently funded, because we think these are important areas of research to pursue. Mr. Bonilla. What studies does NIAMS currently have underway that could shed light on the issue of the cause or prevention of RMIs or MSDs, and when will those studies be completed? If no studies are underway, are there plans to initiate such studies? Is this an important avenue of research for NIAMS, or should it be, if it's not currently? Dr. Katz. Well, it is an important area, and that's the reason why we're putting out this program announcement. If it were not an important area for study, we wouldn't have supported and co-sponsored the meeting in 1994 on repetitive motion disorders. So we view it as a very important component of our work. We have recently hired an orthopedic surgeon who is in charge of our orthopedics program. And he interacts with NIOSH in terms of letting them know what we are doing in the way of this type of research. ergonomic standards Mr. Bonilla. Thank you. As you know, Dr. Katz, I'm asking a lot of questions about this, because it's a question that we all have about ergonomics standards. I am willing to consider turning the entire issue over to science to look at perhaps developing some standards for workplaces down the road. My concern is that we're not at the point yet where science supports promulgating rules or standards by OSHA or any other regulatory body. And I just want to make sure that it's the scientists and the people who are experts at it that are involved, as opposed to anyone else who just may think they understand the issue and really don't understand it. Dr. Katz. I should tell you that my understanding is that NIOSH has recently done a comprehensive study, what's called a meta-analysis, in other words, an analysis of many studies. I have not seen the conclusion of that. But they have done that in order to assess what is the state of science in terms of the relationship with ergonomics. So I look forward to that, and I'm sure that that will be transmitted to you as well. Mr. Bonilla. Do you know when that's going to be complete, or is it already complete? Dr. Katz. I think it's under review now. Mr. Bonilla. Okay. Dr. Katz. I am in contact with Dr. Rosenstock, and she told me that it was under review now. So it shouldn't be too long. Mr. Bonilla. Thank you, Dr. Katz. Dr. Katz. Thank you. human cloning Mr. Porter [resuming chair]. Thank you, Mr. Bonilla. Before I begin with questions for Dr. Katz, I want to ask a question of Dr. Varmus. I understand, Dr. Varmus, that over on the Senate side, Senator Frist is going to have Ian Wilmot in next week to testify from Scotland. I think we're going to be embroiled in this over a long period of time. But I want to give you an opportunity to clarify your remarks yesterday to the Science Committee about human cloning. Last week, before this subcommittee, you stated you found the notion of human cloning to be repugnant. You also cautioned against rapid legislative action before the scientific and ethical issues involved were thoroughly considered. From press reports yesterday, you reiterated your concern about precipitous legislation, but also opened the door to the possibility there might be some very limited circumstances in which human cloning would be ethically permissible. You cited as an example untreatable infertility in couples intent on having genetically related offspring. I think that particular circumstance is one that many people would include in your characterization as being repugnant. Did the Washington Post accurately report your comments before the Science Committee, and can you describe more fully what circumstances you feel might justify human cloning? Dr. Varmus. Mr. Porter, let me try to outline what I said and what I intended to say. My personal view is that there is a very clear case to be made against the use of human cloning for research purposes. I have an open mind about the possibility that in the minds of some, that's not myself, but in the minds of some, there might be a utility for the technology in certain very limited situations of reproductive incapacity. I don't presume to make a judgment. I haven't taken a stand on this. But I do feel that we have time for a debate in which all sides can be heard to address the issue. As I pointed out yesterday, my personal bias in situations of profound infertility is that there are other options, the most obvious being adoption or in vitro fertilization, in which, for example, a sperm donor's contribution replaces the contribution from the parent. I also think it's very important, as I tried to point out yesterday, to use this occasion to come to grips with what I perceive to be an excessive devotion to the idea of the gene, perhaps an idea that we as scientists, excited about genetics research, have fostered in public discussions. We ought to be more concerned with passing on our principles than passing on our genes. In the context of the family life, experience that generates human beings is most importantly carried out. I'm concerned that our current obsession with genes is diverting us from the need to focus on the experience and the education and the instruction that is involved in raising children. That having been said, some people still desire very strongly to have what they consider their own children. I sometimes find it difficult to see my genes in my own children, perhaps because I haven't spent enough time educating them, I don't know. But the point is that we need to reflect on some of the historical precedents here, in two contexts. First, we need to remember that about 20 years ago or so, when in vitro fertilization was introduced, there was a high degree of abhorrence of the idea of test tube babies. And yet in vitro fertilization is now commonly accepted by virtually everyone as a reasonable course in situations oflow sperm count or other obstacles to having children by the most natural process. I think it's also important to remember these historical precedents of in vitro fertilization, of gene therapy, and of recombinant DNA, when considering whether it's appropriate to proceed to legislation. I worry about legislation in the context of scientific issues because of the possibility that we will create laws that are difficult to reverse before we have had the kind of discussion of other kinds of voluntary or rule- determined regulation processes that we've achieved regarding other controversial areas of research, such as gene therapy and recombinant DNA. human cloning for transplants Mr. Porter. Luckily, the founders of our country made our legislative system so cumbersome that it's very unlikely we pass anything very quickly in any case. I was going to follow up with a question, then I'll recognize you, Mr. Miller. Dr. Varmus, would there be a situation where you had a need for a transplant, like bone marrow transplant, where cloning would ensure that there would be no rejection of the tissue? Is there any possibility, or would that be a gene that's already damaged, and you wouldn't want to deal with anyway? I'm not sure how it would work. Dr. Varmus. Let me expand on that a little bit. When you and I discussed these issues last week, I pointed out that the excitement in the scientific community about the results reported from Dr. Wilmot's lab are especially exciting because those experiments tell us that there may be ways to, in a sense, reprogram the genes. It might be possible, by making use of what we learn from a deeper study of the observations that Dr. Wilmot has made, to design tissues required for medical uses. So, for example, a patient who needs a bone marrow transplantation could conceivably, with a deeper understanding of those rules, receive a transplant in which the nucleus from some unaffected cell perhaps a skin cell, has been transferred into some neutral recipient cell under conditions that would instruct the reconstructed cell to become the cells that would normally be present in the blood, recreating bone marrow, but bone marrow in which every cell has the surface antigens of the recipient. That would be an ideal match. Mr. Porter. You're creating bone marrow, not an individual? Dr. Varmus. That's correct. That's point number one. I don't think anybody would have any reservations about that, although I could imagine legislation that created a fence around research that would prevent the use of human DNA, for example, to do such experiments. That worries me. The second issue is one that I think many people have talked about as a possible situation in which human cloning would be acceptable. I myself have grave reservations, for reasons I'll mention in a minute. But one could imagine, for example, parents who had, say, a three-year-old child who had leukemia. The child might be under treatment, doing all right, but the parents anticipate a need for a bone marrow transplantation at some point. The parents might indeed be trying to have another child, and they might say, well, why don't we have a child who is compatible antigenically with the child we already have. In a sense, the parents might think, we are going to give to our three-year-old child a twin, three years later, that he unfortunately did not already have. There are some children with leukemia who have a twin and have the advantage of receiving a bone marrow transplant that offers very little risk to the recipient. But our child doesn't have such a twin. So let's have one. That new child will be different in the way it's brought up and will have different experience. It will be a different child. We must get beyond the fantasy that it will be an instant new three-year-old that looks identical to and acts exactly like the three-year-old the parents already have. I can imagine that. I think there are some profound issues raised by that kind of a decision to have children. It creates an expectation for the marrow donation that requires the newborn child to be a willing donor. And I think that's the kind of ethical issue that does need to be discussed. This is not dramatically different from an ethical issue that has already been considered, and that is the possibility of parents having another child who might have a one in four chance of being a histo-compatible donor to an already living ill child. It raises the stakes a bit, because now there isn't the roll of the dice--the child would have a totally compatible set of genes. Now, I hasten to add with all this that there are still many unknowns in cloning, even in animals. The fact that Dolly is alive has not told us all we need to know about the efficiency of the process, whether mutations might have occurred in that famous udder cell used as a donor; whether changes have occurred in chromosomal structure, particularly at the ends of chromosomes, that would affect the aging process. All of those are unknowns, and I think any contemplation of human cloning, even if there were to be agreed-upon rare circumstances in which it might be permissible, is still going to be many, many years off. Mr. Porter. And we don't yet know, because I understand that this was one out of 270 some odd attempts, whether this can be replicated. This may be just something that---- Dr. Varmus. We don't know. Mr. Porter. We don't know yet. Dr. Varmus. There could be considerable variation among species, there may be technical advances that allow it to occur more efficiently. I think we're still in an extremely early phase. position on human cloning Mr. Porter. Well, we'll call this, your example, a late twin example. My last question is, do you know yet what Ian Wilmot will say when he comes to testify before Senator Frist's committee? Is his position on human cloning---- Dr. Varmus. I have not discussed it with him, but he is going to be visiting NIH next week. It turns out that he was invited by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development many months ago, based on his earlier work, to come and speak at the NIH next Thursday. Mr. Porter. I bet there won't be much interest in that. [Laughter.] Dr. Varmus. Well, we decided to move it to a smaller room. [Laughter.] But I look forward to meeting him then. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Varmus. I yield to you, Mr. Miller. president's actions on human cloning Mr. Miller. What was the President's Executive Order, what did he do the other day? Dr. Varmus. The President did two things. First, he issued an executive order that would make it impermissible touse Federal funds for human cloning. Now, as you and I know, the NIH is forbidden to use Federal funds for research that leads to the creation of human embryos including research that might lead to human cloning. So we could not do any research in this area. But the President and his advisors felt it was appropriate to make the ban very clear, applying to all agencies, and applying to any circumstance of human cloning, research or not, to reassure the public. I think this was a fair thing to do. I don't believe the Federal Government is or would be likely to support human cloning through any vehicle other than our Department, but I think it was definitely a reasonable thing to do, to provide public confidence that the Government is holding things in abeyance until the National Bioethics Advisory Commission can have a full debate on the issues. The other thing that he did was to ask for a voluntary moratorium on human cloning and research related to or involving human cloning in the private sector. I believe that the important issue was, again, to reassure the public that the biotechnology industry is not busily working in these areas. In fact, as you have no doubt observed, the biotechnology industry was highly supportive of the President's action, because it provides them an opportunity to say publicly that they are not even interested in doing such research, that their concerns are elsewhere. I don't think they wanted to be tainted with any public perception that they approve human cloning. Mr. Miller. What input did you or Dr. Collins have in those decisions? Dr. Varmus. We were involved in the discussions about how they should be carried out. And as you know, I was with the President, as was Secretary Shalala and Harold Shapiro from the National Bioethics Advisory Commission and Jack Gibbons from the Office of Science and Technology. Mr. Miller. Were you called in after the decision was made? Dr. Varmus. We were consulted throughout the few days before. Mr. Miller. I saw in the Post this morning, a front page article, a news analysis article, that mentions this. But it mentions it from a political perspective, which raises the question that, and Dick Morris even makes a comment, in the article, that the President is trying to do little things to distract the media attention away from his other problems, and doing things like he did in the campaign about talking about school uniforms. And Dick Morris' quote in this article is, well, ``the headline in the article is, `President forbids human cloning,' rather than what took place at the White House in the Lincoln Bedroom.'' It bothers him that decisions are being made for political reasons like this rather than the well thought-out type of policy decisions. That's what the inference of that article was, and I just raise that question. Dr. Varmus. I think there's good reason not to go along with that. I think, first of all, that by making pronouncements, the President appears before the press and opens himself to questions, some of which were about his pronouncement, and some which were about the other policy matters that you mentioned. So I think if he wanted to remove himself---- Mr. Miller. I don't mean to put you in the political predicament, it raises the question that we want to have good policy on these types of things. Dr. Varmus. The President has a serious interest in these issues. He is very concerned about the public reassurance and the opportunity for his Commission to debate these questions in an open forum without the threat of pending experiments that would be repugnant to the public. professional judgment budget Mr. Porter. Dr. Katz, question number one---- Dr. Katz. Let's see, where were we? [Laughter.] Mr. Porter. I figured I could just say question one and you'd know what I was talking about. Dr. Katz. I got it. Mr. Porter. Professional judgment budget, or---- Dr. Katz. I got it. Well, of course we do fund the very best that we think will yield important information in all areas. And we're constantly reprioritizing in terms of funding the best. We have many exciting and outstanding research proposals that we cannot fund. And our professional judgment budget would get us to the NIH average in terms of the success rate, with an amount of $280 million, which reflects a 9 percent increase in our budget. Mr. Porter. And that is what Dennis Williams knocked down? [Laughter.] Dr. Katz. No, I wouldn't say that. I would say that discussions go on frequently with Dr. Varmus in terms of discussing our budget, our needs, the areas of emphasis that he talked about in his opening statement, that all of the Institute directors are addressing. They are broad areas of emphasis in which the budget is organized. Mr. Porter. My real question is, what was submitted by NIH to the Department for your Institute? Do you know that? Dr. Katz. I don't. Dr. Varmus. There was no submission by Institute, just one overall number. Mr. Porter. Just one number for NIH. Dr. Varmus. Initially. antibiotic treatment Mr. Porter. All right. You mentioned doxycycline. It is destructive of what tissue or cells? Dr. Katz. Doxycycline is an antibiotic. So it destroys bacteria. But many of these chemicals have other effects. And it was shown some years ago that doxycycline has an effect on inhibiting certain types of enzymes, which are called collagenases. And that's the reason for the interest in doxycycline in osteoarthritis. One of the pathways to destruction of cartilage is thought to be due to enzymatic degradation of the cartilage cells, and doxycycline is thought to block this process. And it's been shown to be effective in a form of osteoarthritis in dogs. As a consequence, there was a proposal sent to us--a research project grant--which received a very high priority score, and that's why we funded it. Mr. Porter. And that is going on right now? Dr. Katz. That is going on right now. Mr. Porter. Dr. Katz, you weren't here then, but 15 years ago, almost before this subcommittee, was a Dr. Brown of Virginia who was doing exactly that. I don't know if doxycycline was the antibiotic of choice, but he was providing treatment to his patients, and we had his patients in here to testify, telling us that he had miraculously cured them after years of suffering. Dr. Katz. I think that was a different form of arthritis. Mr. Porter. Different form? Dr. Katz. That was for rheumatoid arthritis. And the basis of that treatment, as I understand it, was because it was thought to be a disease in which bacteria or some type of organism which was sensitive to an antibiotic, was part of the causative agent. So it's a completely different form of arthritis. And in fact, the Institute was asked a few years ago to do a study using doxycycline in rheumatoid arthritis. And such studies are going on right now. I will report those results to you when they come out. In rheumatoid arthritis, there are two main studies. One is in North Carolina, done by Dr. St. Clair, and the other is done within the clinical research center at NIH. Mr. Porter. My recollection is that the issue revolving around those studies is the question of time. Because if I remember, Dr. Brown's patients and Dr. Brown, who testified one year before the subcommittee, this was a long-term kind of treatment that lasted four or five years. Is your clinical trial lasting that long a time? Dr. Katz. No. The study that's going on now, the IV study, is a double-blinded study that's going on for 12 week periods. But there was another study that was requested by the Congress about seven years ago. This was a multicenter study using antibiotics, again in rheumatoid arthritis, different disease than osteoarthritis, to test an antibiotic for rheumatoid arthritis. And this is what we call the MIRA study, that is, minocycline in rheumatoid arthritis. That was a multicenter study that's been completed. It showed a very marginal benefit of minocycline, long-term, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Mr. Porter. But now you're finding that the antibiotics may work very well in osteoarthritis? Dr. Katz. In osteoarthritis, in the dog model, they have been shown to be effective. And we have no clue as to whether it will be, but we thought it was a very good scientific opportunity to pursue, since it does affect so many people and there is a good basis for those studies. Mr. Porter. Antibiotics are being tested as a treatment for both osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Is there a common mechanism at work? Is it thought the antibiotics somehow inhibit the substances that degrade both bone and cartilage? Dr. Katz. I'm not familiar with the antibiotic studies in osteoporosis. Mr. Porter. It's over in the Aging Institute, my staff tells me. Dr. Katz. There is a study that was just started in osteoporosis, because there was a preliminary finding that was thought to be beneficial in terms of building up bone. So they are pursuing that. And I can't tell you which antibiotic it is. osteoporosis Mr. Porter. We've heard testimony about osteoporosis, largely in the context of it being a women's disease. Your justification indicates that men also suffer from osteoporosis, and that one-third of all men will be affected by the age of 75. Given the focus on estrogen as a treatment for osteoporosis in women, will entirely different treatment regimens be needed to be developed for male patients, or can estrogen be used there, too, and if so, what are the side effects? Dr. Katz. We know that history tells us that estrogens have been used in men, in older men, for prostate cancer. This was years ago. And there were many side effects from the estrogens. What we've done with this, through the Federal Working Group on Bone Diseases, which includes many of our NIH Institutes as well as 10 other Federal agencies, is we have put out a program announcement to study osteoporosis in men, because they do represent 20 percent of people who are affected. Men are about a decade or a decade and a half behind women in terms of osteoporosis. And through studies like those I talked about with regard to the role of estrogen in blocking osteoclasts, or in causing osteoclast death, we're looking for other agents that may be used that can simulate those findings, that can be used in men without having the other side effects that one gets, the feminization, etc. Also, there are forms of estrogen now that are being developed that have specificity for certain types of tissue. In other words, as opposed to current estrogens, which have an effect on all tissues, there are estrogens that are being developed that will specifically bind to receptors in bone, for example, rather than in breast tissue. And that's the goal for the future, in terms of developing more specific therapies. They may be called estrogens now, in the future they may be called something else. Mr. Porter. Does Shannon Lucid, the space shuttle astronaut, provide any lessons for osteoporosis researchers as her accelerated bone loss in space is analyzed and treated? Dr. Katz. I think she represents what many of the astronauts have taught us in terms of bone, in terms of weightlessness and loss of gravity, and in terms of the importance of load on bone formation. We have had cooperation with NASA for a long time in terms of co-sponsoring studies that look at just this question of bone loss and weightlessness. There are many studies now that have shown that certain types of exercise are very helpful in terms of building the integrity of bone. And I believe---- Mr. Porter. Even at an advanced age? Dr. Katz. Yes. And I believe that she, as a consequence of some of these studies, rigorously exercised while she was in space, using some of these load concepts that have been developed through NASA and through the NIAMS and through other Institutes' research in this area. Mr. Porter. Mr. Miller, I yield to you. Mr. Miller. No questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Mrs. Lowey. osteoporosis Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank you, Dr. Katz, for appearing before us. I'd like to follow up on the osteoporosis question. We're aware that, as has been discussed, that osteoporosis is the leading cause of bone fractures in older women and older people in general. And while hormone replacement therapies can help women to gain bone mass and thereby decrease their risk for fractures, there is evidence that for some women, estrogen supplements can unfortunately increase their risk for breast cancer. What has your Institute learned that would help women to prevent osteoporosis so they could avoid the difficult choice about whether or not to take estrogen supplements, at least until more evidence about the risks of estrogen are known and perhaps you could also discuss any work that's being done concerning estrogen replacement therapy. I think what we find too often is that there are a great many questions involved, and women are puzzled because of the inadequate research concerning estrogen replacement therapy. And if there's a history of breast cancer in their family, this is not the direction that most choose to pursue. Dr. Katz. You've gotten to the real issue of the concern with regard to estrogen and osteoporosis. But there are other means that women and men have to reverse susceptibility to osteoporotic fractures. A recent study reported from Dr. Recker and Dr. Haney from Creighton University in Nebraska showed that if one adheres to an adequate dosage of calcium in patients who have already had one fracture, once you have one vertebral fracture, you're very likely to get another one within a very short amount of time--a calcium dosage of 1,500 milligrams per day would prevent a second fracture in a significant number of them. So that's one issue that's obviously being looked at. Another issue was one that I addressed in my opening statement, which is the interesting and important findings that open up many scientific opportunities with regard to understanding how estrogens work. Because once one understands how they work, one can try to devise other chemicals that will do the same thing. Estrogens recently have been demonstrated to cause death of the cells that actually break down bone. One has a constant breakdown and buildup of bone. If you can kill off the cells that are breaking down the bone and continue building up the bones, you're not going to have as much osteoporosis as long as the integrity of the bone is still good. And what these scientists have found is that estrogen will kill off these osteoclasts, which are the bone degrading cells. This provides us with an opportunity to look for other chemicals that will interfere with the osteoclast formation and get the beneficial effect of blocking the degradation of bone while continuing to get the buildup. So there are estrogens that are actually being developed that have been reported to have a specific effect on bone as an end organ as opposed to breast tissue. So all estrogen receptors are not exactly the same. There was a very good review in the New York Times this week in the science section, showing what companies are actually trying to do in terms of looking specifically at end organ effects of estrogens. stress and arthritis Mrs. Lowey. Thank you. In this month's publication of the Arthritis Foundation, there is an article about the role of stress in arthritis. It points out that while many sufferers of arthritis believe stress plays a key role in their disease, researchers have had a difficult time substantiating a link, because stress is a difficult thing to measure. If stress is something that people can control, or at least try to control. Dr. Katz, can you please comment on whether or not you think that more research should be done on the link between stress and arthritis, either with regard to preventing the disease or treating the symptoms? Dr. Katz. I would say there have been many studies that have tried to address the issue of stress. Often it's the control group that's the difficult group to really compare the tested group to. It is clear, though, in rheumatoid arthritis in particular, that there is a certain empowerment of patients if they take control of their disease. There are studies that we have supported through educational programs, particularly the ones at Stanford from Kate Lorig, that have shown that patients who take charge and become more involved in their disease--obviously you can't do this if you're depressed with stress, but you can in other circumstances--have a much better outlook and a much better prognosis in terms of dealing with their rheumatoid arthritis. So clearly, one can, in a positive way, say there is something that one can do about one's symptoms and dysfunction from arthritis by taking charge of it. Mrs. Lowey. You're talking about dealing with the symptoms? Dr. Katz. Right. Mrs. Lowey. You're not relating it to the actual---- Dr. Katz. To the actual cause and effect. Right. Mrs. Lowey. I know there are people that have worked with hypnotherapy and other forms of stress reduction, because they feel its impact. But again, you're talking about the symptoms? Dr. Katz. Right. gender and autoimmunity Mrs. Lowey. You're not talking about the actual illness. We know that women are more likely than men to develop lupus and other autoimmune diseases. In your budget justification, you note that your Institute joined with several other Institutes at NIH to issue a program announcement inviting applications for basic research on the ways in which gender influences the development of autoimmune disease. What is the status of this endeavor? Did you receive many applications? How much money will be allocated to this research, and when will you begin to have research findings? Dr. Katz. As a consequence of a conference that was sponsored by several groups at the NIH, including the NIAID, the Office of Research on Women's Health, the Office of Research on Minority Health and the NIAMS, there was a program announcement in May of 1996, for soliciting studies on gender and autoimmunity. So far, we have not gotten much in the way of response to that program announcement. But we look forward to it. As you know, a program announcement is in existence for quite some time, and to get the community interested in looking at that, sometimes it takes some time. Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Dr. Katz. Dr. Katz. Thank you. Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. cartilage repair Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey. Dr. Katz, last month research findings were reported from the Mayo Clinic of a technique called biological resurfacing that successfully restored joint cartilage damaged in injuries, thus delaying the need for joint replacement. How wide an applicability does this technique have? Dr. Katz. Those studies from the Mayo Clinic are supported by our Institute, and are really just starting. There are many studies that we are supporting that are addressing this question. Cartilage is a tissue that when it's destroyed, it's not replenished like some of the other tissues, like liver that's replenished, like skin that's replenished. Once the cartilage is gone, it's gone. So we are supporting many studies that are looking to replenish the cartilage. There is a study from San Diego by Dr. Coutts who is looking at rib perichondrium. These are rabbit studies, as are the Mayo Clinic studies. They're taking the very superficial parts of a rib, the chondrocites, which are part of the cartilage, and they are transplanting them into specific injuries that are made in rabbits in the joints. The same is being done by Dr. Driscoll, I believe it is, at the Mayo Clinic, who is looking at the bone periosteum, that is the most superficial layer of bone. He thinks these cells may be precursors to cartilage cells. But these types of studies are really in their early stages, and I would say that the reason we are supporting them is because they offer a high likelihood of success in terms of resurfacing of cartilage. breast implants and autoimmune diseases Mr. Porter. Dr. Katz, the debate about the dangers of breast implants has been heated. Women who feel they have been injured by the implants often cite symptoms that fall within the jurisdiction of your Institute, autoimmune diseases such as lupus and scleroderma. On the other hand, the scientific evidence on breast implants is sometimes derided as junk science. What does your review of the evidence lead you to believe about the health impacts of breast implants? Dr. Katz. Well, there are several studies that have addressed this head-on. And our conclusion from all these studies is that there is no causal relationship between implants and well-defined rheumatic disease, that is, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Despite that, there is a lingering doubt as to whether there is an association between silicone breast implants and an atypical or an undifferentiated form of rheumatic disease. Because of our concern about this lingering doubt, we have organized a round table discussion on April 17th, which is going to be chaired and paneled by people who have had no particular stance one way or the other. They are going to hear from the community of scientists and clinicians about this undifferentiated rheumatic disease and help us determine if there is anything that we can do to further elucidate whether there is an association. So we are addressing that issue head-on--the lingering doubt of atypical, undifferentiated or ill-defined rheumatic disease and whether it can in fact be defined. We utilize people from our Advisory Council, Dr. Arend, for example; from our Advisory Council, and people from the community who are good scientists, who are good clinicians, who can assess information for us as a panel. gulf war syndrome Mr. Porter. Dr. Katz, we've discussed with the Environmental Health Sciences Institute the general scientific evidence related to Gulf War Syndrome. Has your Institute done any work on the particular symptoms of joint stiffness and pain and skin rashes to determine whether they are caused by exposures in the Gulf War? Dr. Katz. We have not addressed any studies on the Gulf War syndrome specifically. But many of the symptoms that are defined in the Gulf War syndrome, that is, cognitive disabilities, specific types of muscle and joint pains, and skin rashes, are a constant concern to us, because these cover many of the symptoms that we are concerned with within the Institute. And there is a disease, for instance, fibromyalgia, which is a now well-defined disease that has many of the symptoms that relate to some of the symptoms of Gulf War syndrome. And I think that from our activities in fibromyalgia--for example, from our workshop, from the support of many studies in fibromyalgia, from our recently held conference that I talked about in my Congressional justification statement on the neuroscience and endocrinology of fibromyalgia syndrome-- something may be learned about some of these symptoms that are said to be related to the Gulf War syndrome. So the symptoms, we are addressing those symptoms. depression and osteoporosis Mr. Porter. Representative Lowey raised the question of stress. I've been interested in the ways that stress and emotional states may affect physical health as well. But even I wouldn't have expected the research finding from the Mental Health Institute linking depression to a significantreduction in bone mass in women. The average age of the women in the study was 41. But they had bone loss equal to that of a 70 year old. What are the scientific explanations for why depression might lead to bone loss? Dr. Katz. That's a very interesting question. I think even in that paper, there were some speculations, but there was no cause and effect relationship. That is, there are two findings that may be true, true and unrelated, or they may be true, true and related. If they are related, theoretically they could be due to some neuroendocrine problem, or they could be due to the fact that people are not taking care of themselves in terms of being depressed--not eating properly. But that would just be all speculation on my part. Mr. Porter. Are you doing any studies in this area? Dr. Katz. We are not. central nervous system lupus Mr. Porter. Two-thirds of patients with lupus are now thought to suffer some sort of brain or behavioral problems as result of the disease, in addition to the skin and joint ailments we more commonly associate with lupus. How does this autoimmune disorder affect the brain, and do physicians know how to treat this aspect of the disease? Dr. Katz. That's a very important question. I think that central nervous system lupus has been known for quite some time. In fact, I should tell you that one of the first patients whom I ever saw in the clinic had lupus erythematosus, and she had central nervous system lupus with coma at times. The mechanism by which the brain is affected is not known. It's undoubtedly related to the inflammation that occurs elsewhere, because virtually every organ system is involved in lupus. Organs can be involved as a target of autoimmunity, in other words, the cells of the body are attacking itself; this could happen in the kidney, in the brain, in the lungs, etc. So the mechanism of injury is presumably a similar mechanism as is found in other organ systems. I know that the American College of Rheumatology has discussed with our program director convening a conference that will address how to diagnose CNS lupus more specifically, number one, and number two, about a year and a half ago, we co-sponsored a meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences that directly addressed central nervous system lupus to direct attention by investigators to this important area. fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva Mr. Porter. Dr. Katz, Science magazine reported last August on the identification of a signalling protein that erroneously signals the formation of bone, causing a rare disease which converts soft connective tissues into bone, fusing the skeleton and leading to complete immobilization. There is apparently hope that a therapy may some day be developed to block the production of this protein. Beyond the small population of people affected with this disease, could this finding have implications in the opposite direction for those facing deterioration of bone through osteoporosis or other diseases? Dr. Katz. I think that's a very good example of how studying a very, very rare disease, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva--is that okay? [Laughter.] It's a disease that is studied by Dr. Kaplan at the University of Pennsylvania; he has really been the champion of the small number of patients who have this disease. And much of his research is supported by our Institute. But all of his research for years has had a focus on these patients, although he has not been able to directly develop any sorts of mechanisms related to this disease. And it's because of his long-term interest in studying what's called the bone morphogenetic proteins, that is, proteins that help produce bone, that he realized that in these patients, wherever they have inflammation, wherever these lymphocytes go to an inflamed area, the lymphocytes start producing bone. So understanding the mechanism for these patients, that's number one important, number two important is the potential of interfering with these bone morphogenetic proteins that are produced by T cells in areas of inflammation for these patients. But then as you say, one would like to convert these findings to some way of building bone. We know that the immune system and the blood system have a lot to do with bone, in terms of the precursors of bone producing cells found in the bone marrow. And in this regard, our Institute is sponsoring a workshop this summer on bone and the hematopoietic and the immune systems, to look at these particular points of the interaction between T cells and other cells of the immune system and of the bone system, and of the bone marrow with bone. So Dr. Kaplan's discovery is a very important advance in a very rare disease. It could have wide application. collaborative research Mr. Porter. Perhaps more than most, you seem to coordinate with other Institutes on a whole host of disease areas. Allergy for autoimmune diseases, Cancer for skin cancer, Aging for osteoporosis, NIDDK for estrogen replacement, for example. When grant applications are received in these disease areas, how do you decide which Institute will fund them? Dr. Katz. The application is sent to the Division of Research Grants, which has well-defined criteria as to which Institute has a primary and which Institute has a secondary or tertiary interest in that particular area. So for example, when it comes to bone formation, in terms of NIDDK and NIAMS, when it involves endocrine factors like parathyroid hormone, usually NIDDK is given a primary designation for that type of research. When it comes to estrogen, we are often given the primary, because that is our particular focus. There are many institutes that have an interest in bone--The Dental Institute, Child Health--for example, many Institutes have an interest. And there is a Division of Research Grants guideline which the primary reviewer looks at and then makes the designation. Our program people will then look at that designation, if there's some sort of a mistake or controversy, then it is discussed. To the investigator this process is transparent; the investigator really doesn't care who funds that application, as long as it's funded. So it does make it transparent to the investigator. Mr. Porter. How often do you co-fund projects with other Institutes and how much funding do they contribute to activities that are part of your Institute's mission? Dr. Katz. We do a lot of that. In the fiscal year 1996, there was almost $2.5 million co-funded. And in the same year, we received in reimbursements from various Institutes and various offices within the Office of the Director about $3.8 million. And this type of activity goes on because ofthe interactions between program staff and various offices. So for example, the Office of Research on Minority Health, John Ruffin's office, or the Office of Research on Women's Health, Vivian Pinn's office, we have a lot of interaction with them. They don't have authority to directly pay applications. There are many applications that we receive, in terms of areas of research on women's health and on minority health that they are interested in and we are interested in, so they will co- fund many of those applications. Our total co-funding for 1996 was over $6 million. And this is really how we can work together, number one, and also make the dollars go much farther. Mr. Porter. Dr. Katz, you have answered all of our questions very well and forthrightly. We appreciate your testimony this morning. We particularly appreciate the excellent job you are doing at your Institute. And thank you very much for your appearance here. Dr. Katz. Thank you very much. Mr. Porter. Thank you, sir. The subcommittee will stand in recess. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 1517 - 1572--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Thursday, March 6, 1997. NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES WITNESSES DR. JUDITH L. VAITUKAITIS, DIRECTOR DR. LOUISE E. RAMM, DEPUTY DIRECTOR DR. DOV JARON, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ANNE E. SUMMERS, BUDGET OFFICER DR. HAROLD VARMUS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NIH DENNIS P. WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DHHS Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. We are pleased to welcome Dr. Judith Vaitukaitis, Director of the National Center for Research Resources, and we apologize to you for all these votes, but there isn't much we can do about them. I am able to stay until 12:30, and we'll just do our best to get as far as we can. Dr. Vaitukaitis. Certainly. For the record, I will submit my opening statement---- Mr. Porter. I think I would prefer hearing your oral summary, at least, if you would like to do that. Introduction of Witnesses Dr. Vaitukaitis. Okay, fine. Before I do that, I would like to introduce Dr. Dov Jaron, farthest down to my left, who is the Associate Director for Biomedical Technology; to my immediate left is Anne Summers, our Budget Officer; on my immediate right is Dr. Louise Ramm, who is our Deputy Director; and, of course, Dr. Varmus, and Mr. Williams from the Department. Opening Statement Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to appear before you today on behalf of the National Center for Research Resources in support of the fiscal year 1998 budget. NCRR has a unique responsibility for biomedical research infrastructure at the National Institutes of Health. That infrastructure can be compared to a great locomotive that transports passengers--in this case scientists, who explore disease and its remedies-- toward ever-changing destinations. Investigators depend on NCRR to create, develop, and provide the ``engine'' or infrastructure of modern science. In 1998, NCRR's programs will continue to foster development and access to critical research resources and tools ranging from those for clinical research, animals, repositories, and high-end biomedical technologies. In addition, NCRR will develop and continue an initiative that will focus on understanding the structure and function of the brain and its dynamic changes with time, the fourth dimension. That effort will lead to improved knowledge about neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, as well as many others. Another initiative will focus on development of innovative software and techniques for use with high performance computers and telecommunications facilities to increase the number of biomedical technology resources and their applications that can be remotely accessed by investigators across the country over the next generation of the Internet. Magnetic resonance imaging resources and other imaging and modelling resources essential for structural biology are candidates for that kind of approach. In conjunction with the Regional Primate Research Centers, investigators will focus on the development of novelvaccines for AIDS. Studies that may pave the way for developing vaccines against HIV in humans were recently reported by scientists at the NCRR- supported New England Regional Primate Research Center. Investigations with rhesus monkeys showed that vaccine protection against intravenous challenge with simian immunodeficiency virus, similar to its human counterpart, could be attained with live attenuated vaccine from which certain viral genes had been deleted. These and other related efforts will be extended to help identify an effective vaccine for HIV. There are several other priorities that are outlined in our justification and in our longer opening statement. Now, Mr. Chairman, the fiscal year 1998 President's budget request for NCRR is $333,868,000. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. [The opening statement follows:] [Pages 1575 - 1578--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] use of animals in research Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Vaitukaitis. Contrary to the expectations of several years ago, will the use of vertebrate animals in research stay constant, or increase, because of genome research with its emphasis on knockout mice? Dr. Vaitukaitis. The use of transgenic and knockout mice has increased markedly over the past several years with the advent of that technology. The number of animals being used in research, based on USDA data, has stayed relatively level or decreased somewhat. The mice that are being used are much more complex and much more costly to develop, and are used to address specific questions that could not be addressed with other forms of animal models. So with the mouse models and other invertebrate and vertebrate models, the total use of all animals in research will probably continue to decline somewhat. The use of primates in research has been declining for the past several years because of the marked cost of holding these animals for investigators in specialized facilities. chimpanzees in research Mr. Porter. That's my next question. We have been approached by groups who have developed draft legislation which they believe will resolve the problem of the long-term care of research chimpanzees who are no longer being used in research, but who have a life span of as much as 50 years. We understand that the National Research Council will soon issue a report on the subject. Do you have some idea of what they will recommend? And when do you expect NIH to develop a response to the report? Dr. Vaitukaitis. To answer the last question first, we are expecting the report from the National Research Council later this month. I will have to take a look at the scope of that report before we can know the timeframe it would take to develop a response. Chimpanzees in research is a complex issue, because in the wild there are only about 125,000 to 150,000 chimps, and in the U.S. there are about 2,100 chimps; of those, 400 are in zoos, and the remainder are used for biomedical research. In 1975, the U.S. Government signed an international treaty prohibiting the importation of chimpanzees, so consequently, since 1976, there have been no imported chimps. When the AIDS epidemic--or pandemic--raised its head in the 1980s, the National Academy of Sciences did a study looking at the resource needs for addressing that whole area of research, and one of the recommendations from the National Academy was to provide chimpanzees to investigators for research, noting that the number of chimpanzees available was restricted. Consequently, the Division of Research Resources, a predecessor organization of NCRR, was directed to start a chimpanzee breeding program. Currently we have 538 chimpanzees in that breeding program. When it was begun, the animal rights people were concerned that the animals could not reproduce in captivity, and that their life span would be shortened. However, they were wrong on both counts. In captivity the chimpanzees live longer, for over 50 years, and they reproduce so well that we are now actually giving them contraceptives so that they will not breed, to try to keep the population that we have in our chimpanzee program constant. The cost of supporting these animals averages about $20 per day, per diem costs, and we maintain this breeding colony in the southern part of the United States, where costs are more favorable for that activity. There have been about 115 chimpanzees used for vaccine research over the last several years, and about 145 or 150 animals used for HIV research. Now, the ones that have been used for HIV research are actually being used again for other HIV-related activities; just because an animal has been infected with HIV does not necessarily mean that that animal is permanently retired from research. So we have to look at this precious pool of animals, and it's a conundrum in terms of what to do with it. That's why we sought the advice of the National Research Council on this very important issue. Mr. Porter. Does your daily cost of caring for research chimpanzees--does that compute to a lifetime cost of $300,000 to $400,000, as we've been led to believe? Dr. Vaitukaitis. Per animal? No. It's roughly, in current dollars, about $20 per day. Mr. Porter. They live 50 years, though. Dr. Vaitukaitis. The animals aren't retired until they are probably--it would be variable--probably in their 20s and 30s. So it's the last 15 to 20 years of their life span that they would need to be supported. There is an arrangement with the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to provide what is termed ``lease fees'' or endowments for animals that are returned to the source for housing the chimpanzee. The current going price for that is about $55,000 per animal to assure the retirement of that animal. chimpanzee retirement Mr. Porter. We understand that Jane Goodall is in town right now, and that there's a proposal that she has made to provide a kind of ``reserve'' for chimpanzees that are no longer used in research. Have you talked to her and do you know about this? Dr. Vaitukaitis. No, I have not recently talked to her, but I know of her interest in that. That is an issue that the National Research Council report will address. As I said, it's a conundrum in terms of what to do with these animals, since we'll never be able to get these animals again because they're limited in the wild. We can't import them from the wild. There is a limited resource in this country, and the chimpanzee has been an invaluable model for vaccine development against hepatitis. There may be another virus that is not currently evidenced, like HIV, that chimpanzees may be the ideal model for. So we have to figure out ways of making sure that we have access to those animals if we need them, but also to keep the cost down and support them in a way that would be most cost-effective. Mr. Porter. I guess there are many issues associated with this. For example, do you put chimpanzees that have been made HIV-positive back into the wild? What happens to that population? I can see a lot of very great difficulties in how you deal with these animals. Dr. Vaitukaitis. We don't think that the HIV-infected animals should be placed back in the wild. In fact, it's not clear that the animals, even those that are not HIV-infected, could be placed back in the wild, based on studies with other nonhuman primates. Mr. Porter. I would imagine there's an issue as to whether some of these chimpanzees that have been bred and never been in the wild, what effect that would have upon their existence. Dr. Vaitukaitis. Absolutely. Mr. Porter. Do NIH grants for researchers using chimpanzees include any component for care of the animalsonce the experiment ends? Dr. Vaitukaitis. I can't address that specifically. I know that for the animals used by intramural scientists, funds are provided for them through the Allergy Institute or the Cancer Institute, and I know that some of the other animals--about 150--are endowed in this way, but some of these certainly have been used for extramural research purposes. The funding source does make provision for retiring the animal to New Mexico State University or the Coulston Foundation or the Southwest Foundation, or wherever the animal would be housed. Mr. Porter. But if there is an NIH grant to an academic medical center that involves the use of chimpanzees in their research, you don't have any responsibility for those animals at all? Or later? Dr. Vaitukaitis. We at NCRR do not. Mr. Porter. No? You would only have responsibility for those used intramurally? Dr. Vaitukaitis. Currently, in the breeding colonies that we have, we own none of those animals. However, we feel a moral obligation to help support those animals, unless the institutions that are hosting those colonies wish to assume that responsibility. This is an area where we need help through the National Research Council report. Mr. Porter. So there is no national repository of research chimpanzees where there is some clear policy affecting all of them? Dr. Vaitukaitis. That covers the entire group? No, because most of the animals are actually owned by the site where they are hosted, the universities, or by private companies. Mr. Porter. Exactly. So there is no national policy on what happens to the chimpanzees after they've finished their scientific role? Dr. Vaitukaitis. That's correct. Mr. Porter. Should there be? Dr. Vaitukaitis. There probably should be, to be certain that the animals are treated humanely for the remainder of their natural lives. chimpanzee retirement Mr. Porter. Do you have any knowledge what some of the academic health centers or research centers do with animals like these after they have finished their scientific role? Dr. Vaitukaitis. They just maintain them as best they can. I know that some of them look to see if there are zoos nearby that would be willing to take them on, at least on an interim basis, to help alleviate some of the costs of maintaining these animals. Mr. Porter. Because, as you say, they probably have 20 to 30 years of remaining life, and in some cases maybe even much longer, after the research role is completed, and that's both a huge cost and a huge responsibility, it seems to me. Dr. Vaitukaitis. That's absolutely true. Some of these animals can be reused for other kinds of research studies. Once they are HIV-infected, they can be used for other HIV studies, and the other animals could be used for linguistic studies, other vaccine studies, and other behavioral studies. Mr. Porter. Can I ask Dr. Varmus--Dr. Varmus, do you think there ought to be a national policy and something done to provide a way to take care of research chimpanzees? Dr. Varmus. We're hoping the NRC report will address that. Mr. Porter. Do you think they're looking to all the animals involved--in other words, those all around the country? Dr. Varmus. That's my assumption. The charge was fairly broad. We asked them to look at national policy regarding chimpanzees used for research. Mr. Porter. Now, how many of the entire population that you've described are considered surplus now? That is, their role has been fulfilled? Dr. Vaitukaitis. We technically don't consider any of them surplus---- Mr. Porter. Well, that's probably a misuse of the word. I meant those whose scientific role has been fulfilled---- Dr. Varmus. Retired. Mr. Porter [continuing]. And they are retired, yes. Dr. Vaitukaitis. All I can tell you is that there are about 150 animals that have been returned to the source from which they were leased in the first place. But those animals can still be reused for other research, HIV research or some other related research. That would be out of a pool of roughly 1,700 animals in the biomedical research arena. ncrr strategic plan Mr. Porter. All right. You're beginning a process to update your 1994 strategic plan. If you are doing strategic plans every three years, does that indicate that the pace of change in your programs which provide research resources and technologies is so rapid that you need to rethink your approaches almost constantly? Dr. Vaitukaitis. Our strategic plan is really a living document. It has to evolve constantly. The strategic plan we published in 1994 was such that we have completed--have implemented, or are in the process of implementing--about 90 percent of the recommendations within that plan. So it takes about a year and a half or two years to move forward, to update that plan, in concert with the research community. That's basically where we are at this point. transgenic research animals Mr. Porter. A number of years ago, when the Jackson Lab in Maine burned, there was great concern that there would be an inadequate supply of specialized lab mice for NIH grantees. Since that time there has been an explosive growth in the development of even more specialized knockout mice, as we mentioned. Has the supply of all these specialized lab animals kept up with the demand? Dr. Vaitukaitis. The demand is increasing steeply. We have funded Jackson Labs as a shared resource to take on established knockouts and transgenics that then can be made available to the general biomedical research community. Through our construction program we have also provided them substantial levels of construction money to enhance their facilities. We have actually had to increase the level of support to Jackson Labs for this activity, over a very short period of time double it, and we seem to be holding at a reasonable level right now. But these technologies are very expensive, and investigators would prefer that a resource like the Jackson Labs handle the animals, validate them, and share them with other investigators around the country. This need is a continuing one, and as the techniques become even more sophisticated, better mouse and other models will be developed. There is also a need for other models that are larger animal models, other than just the mice. euthanasia of research animals Mr. Porter. Is euthanasia of so-called ``surplus'' laboratory animals prohibited under animal use guidelines or Federal policy? Dr. Vaitukaitis. Euthanasia is permitted for terminal experiments and for animals that are in pain or in discomfort. Euthanasia of chimpanzees is something that we do not do because there are no guidelines for that. It's an endangered species, and it's a concern of both investigators, as well as animal rights individuals. general clinical research centers Mr. Porter. Dr. Varmus' Advisory Panel on Clinical Research has made several recommendations about the NIH General Clinical Research Centers, which are administered by your center. They suggest that the NIH centers should be more broadly available to investigators supported by non-NIH funds. What is your reaction to this proposal? Dr. Vaitukaitis. This is actually an ongoing activity for investigators at the General Clinical Research Centers, or GCRCs. In 1990, the level of support to investigators using the centers was a little over a billion dollars. Of those funds, 72 percent came from the NIH, and the other sources were about 5 or 6 percent from other Federal agencies, and the remainder of the funds were from the private sector. Between that time and 1995, in a little over a five-year period, the level of support to investigators has increased from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, and the portion from NIH has stayed relatively the same, about 70 percent. But the increased funding to investigators using GCRCs from drug companies has almost doubled, from about 8 percent to almost 16 or 17 percent. There is also other funding from the private sector. It is the standard practice for investigators to get other sources of funding for pilot studies or other related activities, in addition to competitive funding from the National Institutes of Health. That is not a problem for the GCRCs; that's a standard operating procedure for them. Mr. Porter. The panel also recommended that General Clinical Research Centers should shift their orientation more heavily to outpatient care. I know that the centers have been moving in this direction the last several years. What share of their patient load is presently outpatient, and how much more will they be able to increase that proportion? Dr. Vaitukaitis. Outpatient-based research is the major form of research at GCRCs. In fiscal year 1995, for which we have complete data, there were 270,000 outpatient research visits as opposed to 82,400 inpatient research days. The rate of increase of the outpatient visits is almost at a 45 degree angle, and we suspect that when we get the reports for the last fiscal year, that those numbers will continue in that same direction. My guess would be that we will approach about 290,000 to 300,000 outpatient research visits for 1996, and stay steady in terms of the number of inpatient research days. Mr. Porter. With the current pressures on clinical research in academic health centers, are you considering increasing the number of your General Clinical Research Centers to help support the clinical research enterprise? Dr. Vaitukaitis. We are receiving more applications from institutions that do not currently have GCRCs because of the impact of managed care and the cost of doing clinical research. We are trying to accommodate these institutions as best we can within the framework of what we have available. Mr. Porter. Do the General Clinical Research Centers enter into agreements with private industry to conduct clinical trials or test experimental surgical procedures? Dr. Vaitukaitis. Yes. We have a category of research in the GCRCs called ``Category D''--it happens to be D for drug company-related research. The drug company is responsible for paying the cost of doing that research, and there is an offset back to the GCRCs for hosting that research. The research must be done in such a way that it does not restrict the investigators reporting their findings through the scholarly process of reporting in peer review journals. Mr. Porter. And is this a mechanism that will be used more broadly to supplement the resources of the centers? Dr. Vaitukaitis. The Category D days, as well as the Category C days, in the outpatient units, have been the major source of third-party funding for GCRCs. In 1995 there was about $15 million in third-party offsets to operate the GCRCs and help them keep cost-effective. Of that $15 million, about $9 million was for Category C, or boarder, patients; $2 million was from Category B, or research patients who had to be hospitalized because of their underlying disease, and were also research patients; and about $4 million was for Category D patients. Category C and D patients are those that are helping offset the costs of operating the GCRCs, both on the inpatient and the outpatient sides. extramural facilities construction Mr. Porter. Your budget requests $4 million for extramural facilities grants. Given the pending backlog of facilities requests and the small number that can likely be accommodated with this funding, would it be more cost-effective to allocate this funding to a program such as the Shared Instrumentation Program, which could help more institutions? Dr. Vaitukaitis. The research facility needs are considerable, and to shift that to Shared Instrumentation, I think--although $4 million is not that great a level, and it would make it easier to handle administratively, but programmatically, there is a huge need for construction out there. For instance, HBCUs have 40 percent of their research space whichis not acceptable for modern research. That's been an unmet need for some time, and those institutions are not covered, for the most part, by the Centers of Excellence setasides through the construction program. A recent report from the National Academy of Sciences has estimated that there is about $10 billion of research facility needs that has been pent up across biomedical research. For the first time in their tracking of that data there has been a 40 percent decrease in research construction carried out by medical centers, and a 9 percent decrease across all academic institutions in the country. We are seeing that there is a need out there, but there are priorities that we have in putting the NIH budget together in terms of funding investigators through the research project grants. So it's a question of priority-setting at this point. Mr. Porter. What does the President's 1998 budget request for the facilities construction program operated by the National Science Foundation? Dr. Vaitukaitis. The comparable program of the National Science Foundation contains no funds in their request. There were none in 1997, and there was $50 million in 1996. virtual laboratories Mr. Porter. You have funded some of the first work in virtual laboratories, that is, the sharing of sophisticated equipment like electron microscopes and MRI systems, over the Internet, with digital controls run through a personal computer. How widely used is this technology in biomedical research? Is it an eligible item for reimbursement under a regular grant application? Dr. Vaitukaitis. There is no charge to investigators for access over the Internet. This approach to creating virtual laboratories over the Internet is an evolving process. The current Internet has difficulty handling information exchange in real time. It really won't be until the next generation of Internet, which is 1,000 times faster, that we can really handle the large amount of information that would go over the Internet. This would create access for a wider array of investigators to high-end technologies over the Internet and provide online collaborations among individuals from different disciplines by using this kind of technology. It would be a very cost- effective way to approach some aspects of research. Mr. Porter. So it's not today an eligible item for reimbursement? Dr. Vaitukaitis. That's correct. coordination of imaging activities Mr. Porter. As we discussed with Dr. Varmus last week, some in the radiology community are interested in the creation of a separate institute at NIH for diagnostic radiology and imaging, to draw together these activities which are currently dispersed throughout the NIH. To what extent does your center already perform this coordinating role? Dr. Vaitukaitis. Our role at NIH is to develop high-end technologies, including those for imaging, which includes a whole host of technologies for whole animal, human organ, or molecular structure imaging. We coordinate with the other parts of NIH to determine the needs of their investigators who are funded predominantly through the research project grant mechanism. Some of the institutes have developed some very specific imaging technologies that are within the direct mission of their institute, but our role is to provide the research infrastructure, and hence our interaction with the other institutes is one of a collaborative approach in that we are trying to develop those technologies that investigators who are funded by the other institutes can gain access to. regional primate research centers Mr. Porter. We understand that you have begun a major evaluation of the NIH-funded network of primate centers. Has the mission of these centers changed since the original facilities were funded in the 1960s? Are separate primate facilities still the most efficient way to conduct this type of animal research? Dr. Vaitukaitis. The seven regional primate centers are really a set of seven national laboratories that are unique. They would not be able to be reproduced anyplace else in this country, or anyplace else in this world, for that matter. As primate-based research has become more precious--there are fewer investigators doing it because they can't afford to do it within their own institutions--primate centers host probably a third of all biomedical research that relates to primate-based research in this country. We are looking at a way of more cost-effectively arranging how the primate centers operate in order to accommodate more investigators, if possible. The tension on these centers is that they can't accommodate many more investigators within their current configuration, and we're trying to see if there's a better way of doing it. Mr. Porter. Dr. Vaitukaitis, I think you've answered our questions. We have a few more for the record. We very much appreciate your answering the questions, the good testimony, and the fine job that you're doing. Thank you very much. Dr. Vaitukaitis. Thank you. Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will stand in recess until 1:30 p.m. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 1587 - 1634--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Thursday, March 6, 1997. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT WITNESSES DUANE ALEXANDER, M.D., DIRECTOR DR. YVONNE T. MADDOX, DEPUTY DIRECTOR DR. FLORENCE P. HASELTINE, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR POPULATION RESEARCH BENJAMIN E. FULTON, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATION DONNA S. CASADY, ACTING BUDGET OFFICER DR. HAROLD VARMUS, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH DENNIS WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. We have now confirmed a new hearing date for the NIH groups that were originally scheduled to testify tomorrow morning, including the Office of AIDS Research, the Office of the Director and Buildings and Facilities. These will now be heard on Thursday, March 20, at 10:00 a.m. This afternoon we are pleased to welcome Dr. Duane Alexander, the Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Dr. Alexander, it's good to see you. Dr. Alexander. Good to be here, Chairman Porter. Introduction of Witnesses Mr. Porter. If you will introduce the people that you brought with you, and then proceed with your statement, please. Dr. Alexander. Thank you. Beginning on my left, I'd like to introduce Dr. Florence Haseltine, the Director of our Center for Population Research; Mr. Ben Fulton, our Executive Officer; Ms. Donna Casady, our Budget Officer. To my right, Dr. Yvonne Maddox, our Deputy Director. And you know Dr. Varmus and Mr. Williams. Opening Statement Mr. Chairman, the NICHD is charged by the Congress to conduct research on maternal and child health, the population sciences and medical rehabilitation. Last year, during our appropriations hearings, I reported good news of research advances and the awarding of the Nobel prize to two of our long-time grantees. I'll be continuing many of those same themes this year, as these positive trends continue, including reduction in the Nation's infant mortality rate and high honors for NICHD-supported scientists. Following on the 4 percent decline in infant mortality in 1994 that I reported last year, the trend continued with a 6 percent decline from 1994 to 1995, and the preliminary data for 1996 looks similarly encouraging. Since the NICHD was established in 1962, the U.S. infant mortality rate has declined by 70 percent. Most of this decline can be traced to NICHD research advances, particularly to improvements in preventing or treating respiratory distress syndrome and the Back to Sleep campaign. This campaign is based on NICHD research, and recommends that healthy infants be placed on their backs to sleep, to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS. Stomach sleeping has changed from 80 percent of babies to 25 percent of babies, and deaths due to SIDS have declined by 30 percent in the last three years. Since the campaign, 1,600 fewer babies annually die of SIDS. The introduction of surfactant treatment developed from NICHD and NHLBI research continues to reduce deaths from RDS. Still, nearly a thousand infants a year suffer from a breathing problem called hypoxic respiratory failure. A new therapy, using inhaled nitric oxide, has just been shown by NICHD research to rescue many of these infants, and avert the need for a costly surgical procedure used to oxygenate the infant's blood. A brief historical note dramatically illustrates the progress from NICHD research. In 1963, President Kennedy's infant son Patrick was born prematurely and died of respiratory distress syndrome. Despite all his advantages, his doctors and his parents could only watch helplessly as Patrick struggled to breathe, because we didn't know the cause of RDS, and there was no treatment. Now, with treatment with surfactant, new respirators, better isolettes and advanced intravenous fluid therapy, premature babies have a far better chance to live. When Patrick Kennedy was born, an infant with RDS at his weight and gestational age had a 95 percent chance of dying. Today, an infant at that weight and gestational age has a 95 percent chance of living. This has been a year of unprecedented acknowledgement of research supported by NICHD. It began with the award of the 1995 Nobel prizes to Dr. Eric Wieschaus and Dr. Edward Lewis, whose basic research on birth defects had been funded by NICHD for decades. The awards continued last fall, when two NICHD intramural scientists, Dr. John Robbins and Dr. Rachel Schneerson, received the 1996 Albert Lasker Clinical Research Award for their landmark development of a conjugate vaccine for Hemophilus influenza type b, or Hib. The Lasker prizes are often referred to as the American Nobel prizes. For many years, the leading cause of acquired mental retardation in the United States was brain damage from meningitis due to Hib. The Hib conjugate vaccine reduced Hib meningitis from 20,000 cases a year to fewer than a hundred. This is one of the NIH's greatest contributions ever to public health. Completing the cycle of the world's leading scientific awards, Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi, an NICHD grantee for 29 years at the University of Hawaii, was awarded Japan's equivalent of the Nobel Prize, the 1996 International Prize for Biology.Dr. Yanagimachi's animal research has laid the foundation for much of today's human infertility treatments. Not all our research has been honored with such distinguished prizes, but much of it has already made a significant difference in peoples' lives. One dramatic achievement has been the development of an effective treatment for the inherited disease cystinosis. NICHD scientists in the NIH Clinical Center identified the basic defect in the disease, developed a drug to treat it, and tested it in a clinical trial. Prior to this treatment, affected children were severely stunted in growth, went blind from cystine crystals deposited in their eyes, lost their kidney function and died by age 10 unless they received a kidney transplant. Today, with early diagnosis and drug treatment, the development and lives of these children are entirely normal. NICHD has led an expanded research program in autism. A research conference on autism was held in 1995, followed by a solicitation for research grant applications focused on neurobiology and genetics. Funding these applications this year will markedly expand autism research and bring new scientists into the field. Abnormalities of brain development can result in children having difficulties in learning. Almost half of all the students receiving special education in this country have learning disabilities. Screening procedures have been developed for preschool identification of risk for learning disabilities. Longitudinal studies using a new approach for children with these reading disabilities have been conducted in ordinary classrooms in several states. Approximately 97 percent of this group of high-risk children is now learning to read using these techniques. At any time, any of us can suffer an injury or an illness that changes our entire life. Christopher Reeve has turned his own tragedy into a remarkable stimulus for research. Thanks to NICHD research, a new generation of assistive technology is becoming available. Novel imaging techniques facilitate rapid fabrication of prosthetic and orthotic devices that are customized to fit individual users. An advanced portable oxygen system will help school children with breathing problems, and an electronically controlled knee-lock device will improve lower limb bracing to increase mobility. We study issues related not only to the individual but to families and populations as well. We lead a Government-wide effort to improve Federal statistics and research on fatherhood. Also, as many more women are joining the work force, the issue of child care is increasing in importance. Last year, the early results of the NICHD study of early child care showed that, in and of itself, child care by non-maternal figures does not adversely affect the mother-child relationship. This study continues to examine other important issues in the first seven years of life. A major study of adolescent health is concluding, and will soon be available to help understand the social changes and structures influencing teenagers and their needs. Mr. Chairman, the awards and achievements we report to you today represent part of the return on the long-term investment of the American people provided by the Congress which has made these lifesaving advances possible. The fiscal year 1998 President's budget request for NICHD is $582,032,000, excluding AIDS. I will be pleased to answer any questions. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 1639 - 1642--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] autism Mr. Porter. Dr. Alexander, we congratulate you and your Institute on these awards and recognitions. I think it's fair to say that this subcommittee believes that your reward ought to be more than a 2.5 percent increase. And your work is far more important and of greater priority in my mind, at least, than that figure would represent. We'll see if we can improve on that but, every year in appropriations, you start from ground zero and have to build the case. So we will have our work cut out for us in terms of addressing the priority that I think certainly most of the members of this subcommittee believe biomedical research to be for our country. And we hope that we can do better than the President has suggested. We'll have to wait and see. Dr. Alexander, autism is thought to affect 400,000 people in the United States, with a devastating emotional and financial impact. Is it fair to say that there has not been very substantial progress made in the biological understanding of autism in the past 15 years? Dr. Alexander. That's quite an accurate statement, Mr. Porter. Unfortunately for many years, the biological investigations of autism were back-burnered because of a belief that this was a psychogenic disorder caused by abnormal parental interactions with their children. As we have studied the condition more, we have come to realize that this is probably not the case, that this is probably a neurologically or even genetically based disorder, probably related to some abnormality of brain functioning, perhaps as a result of either a genetic disorder or some intra-uterine insult to the brain. Our efforts now are being directed to these particular aspects of the autism spectrum disorders. And in fact, we have just completed the competition under a request for grant applications for neurobiology and genetic studies of autism. These grants are being funded come April. We have received additional funds from Dr. Varmus to supplement the funds that the Institutes can put toward this area of research. And we believe that we have assembled a top group of autism researchers, as well as people in the neurosciences and genetics who have not worked in autism before. We believe that we stand poised to make major advances in our understanding of autism, and hope that we will be able to produce the kinds of results that we are anticipating in making real progress against this disorder. Mr. Porter. I think you've indicated this is possibly true, but is it likely that advances in autism through research will also help shed light on other illnesses like obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder, and learning disabilities? Dr. Alexander. I think there's a high likelihood of that. Anything that we learn about brain functioning and abnormal behaviors, such as these disorders manifest, will help whether we're studying one or the other. There is carryover to the other condition. And I believe that the work we're going to be doing on autism will probably help us to understand these other disorders as well. autism centers Mr. Porter. Do you think the field of autism research could benefit from a center based approach? Dr. Alexander. This has been something that we've discussed. I'm not sure that the field is ready for centers yet. The program project grants that we are going to be funding have many characteristics of centers. As these projects develop and function over the course of the next few years, we'll be able to assess whether they are functioning quite capably as program project grants, or whether there might be a need for a centers approach. Right now, it's the belief of myself and the other Institute directors involved in autism research that a centers based approach would be premature. autism research investigators Mr. Porter. According to autism family support organizations, one of the biggest problems in the field is the small number of talented scientists who are actually working in it. Do you agree, and are you taking steps to encourage more scientists to enter the field of autism? Dr. Alexander. We are. This increase in funding in autism, particularly using the program project grants, willcertainly attract investigators to this field, both people who have not been working in autism before, who are experienced, as well as young investigators. There is ample room in these particular program project grants for young investigators to be brought on to work with people who are more established in the field and represent the new entry of people who will continue an interest in autism research. learning disabled children Mr. Porter. Dr. Alexander, recent findings suggest that learning disabled children have trouble distinguishing between some spoken syllables, perhaps indicating that the auditory system is the focus of the defect, rather than the language centers of the brain. Does this mean that early training aimed at helping learning disabled children distinguish between sounds could prevent them from ever becoming impaired? Dr. Alexander. That's a very promising area of research that needs to be pursued. We're not sure yet whether this group of children who demonstrate deficits in the auditory system represents a sub-class of children with learning disabilities who demonstrate this overall problem with phonological processing, or whether it represents just a totally distinct group. We need to study this area further. The studies that we are doing, the studies that the Neurology Institute is doing, and the Deafness and Communication Disorders Institute is doing in these areas I think will help us to sort out whether these are clearly different categories of children who have different bases for their learning disability, or whether they are all part of the same kind of a continuum. We need to do more work that's going to pursue that. We will be aided in that work with some of the new sophisticated techniques of neuroimaging, and other methods that will help us to investigate this in a very clear way. Mr. Porter. How are you disseminating the results of these studies relating to learning disabled children? Dr. Alexander. We're working, both independently ourselves and producing information from the Institute for others to disseminate. Certainly, the work our investigators are doing is being published. Each year we are putting out a book about the year's progress in learning disabilities. And we have worked cooperatively with the Department of Education in producing a set of information called Learning to Read-Reading to Learn that is being disseminated widely by the Department of Education. We're also working actively with the learning disabilities associations, and there are several of these, to disseminate information to parent groups about the progress that's being made. Also, Dr. Reid Lyon, from our Learning Disabilities Research Program, has testified to the Congress, has testified before a number of State legislatures, and parent groups in States around the country about the results of this research on learning disabilities. And the word is getting out about the progress that's being made. We are also sponsoring with the Learning Disabilities Association a summit here in Washington in April, with the concluding event here on Capitol Hill, also in an effort to disseminate the word about research from this program. sids back to sleep campaign Mr. Porter. Your Back to Sleep campaign, urging parents to place infants on their backs when sleeping to prevent SIDS, which you mentioned in your testimony, has been quite successful in reducing the number of SIDS deaths. What research strategies are you pursuing to address the remaining SIDS cases? Dr. Alexander. Well, we're not satisfied that we've done all we can do yet with just Back to Sleep. We're at the point now where about 25 percent of babies are still sleeping on their tummies. We are going to be intensifying the Back to Sleep campaign with the goal of achieving 90 to 95 percent back sleeping in infants. Because we believe that just with this measure, we probably can reduce SIDS by over 50 percent and not stop at 30 percent reduction where we are now. We're also not satisfied that we yet understand the basic underlying mechanism of SIDS. Our basic research has given us some tantalizing leads, some suggestions and clear indications, in fact, that there is a area of the brain stem, called the arcuate nucleus, that has a deficiency in neurotransmitter receptors in infants that die of SIDS, compared to infants who die of other causes. This could explain, in fact, why infants placed in the tummy sleeping position could bury their face in the covers and not detect that they are in fact suffocating, that their levels of oxygen are dropping and carbon dioxide are rising, and turn their head to the side to clear their airway. If they don't have those receptors there, they don't get the message. So we believe that this is an explanation for a substantial number of infants with SIDS. We are also conducting a study of home infant monitoring, the CHIME study, Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation, looking at whether the latest generation of apnea monitors can in fact pick up preceding events or clues that a SIDS death is impending in time to arouse an infant, if parents are there and can respond to an alarm. Also, if in fact we are able to demonstrate that this defect in neurotransmitters is an underlying mechanism for SIDS, we will be looking for some markers of that defect, or some way to detect it, so that we could determine the infants in the population that are at the greatest risk of SIDS, and monitor them particularly intensively. premature labor and delivery Mr. Porter. Premature labor and delivery are leading causes of infant mortality. What clinical trials are you currently pursuing in this area? Dr. Alexander. We're very excited about our prospects here, Mr. Porter. We have gotten some evidence from some basic studies as well as from some small, preliminary clinical trials, to suggest that a condition called bacterial vaginosis is associated with premature labor in a number of instances. And it could account for a substantial portion of the premature deliveries in this country, as well as account for the higher proportion of premature labor and delivery in the African- American population. Studies identifying bacterial vaginosis either by a vaginal smear or using a new technique called detection of fetal fibronectin by a vaginal cervical swab give an indication of the presence of this condition, which increases the risk for premature labor and delivery. We now have major clinical trials underway looking at both these methods of detection, followed by initiation of treatment with antibiotics to try and eradicate the bacterial vaginosis infection to see whether eliminating that infection can in fact reduce the increased risk of premature labor and delivery. There is evidence from a small preliminary trial that this might be the case. We have now started definitive studies to provide clear indication of whether this will work. If it does, this should give us our first real handle on a means to detect and intervene to prevent premature labor and delivery. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Alexander. Mr. Hoyer. early child care Mr. Hoyer. It's good to see Dr. Alexander, whom I get to see regularly at places around Maryland. He and his wife are neighbors, and we're glad to see him here. Early child care. A lot has happened in my life, some not so happy; but one happy thing, I had a new grandson on November 18th. And one of the wrenching things that my 32 year old daughter is going through is that he's now three months old and he's starting child care and she's going back to work. This happens to hundreds of thousands of young people, so I'm very concerned about child care. I'd like to hear a little bit more about the studies that seem to show that there is not an adverse effect from non- maternal care for a period of time during the day. Could you expand on that? It's obviously a very, very important issue for our country, as we see more and more women in the work force, welfare reform requiring work, all of that. This is a critical area of study. Dr. Alexander. You're right on target with the question and the concern, Mr. Hoyer, which is the reason that we initiated this study some years ago. At the present time, more than half the mothers of infants, children under a year of age, are in the work force. And those infants are being cared for either by a father, a grandparent, some other relative, a small group day care home, or a large day care situation. And parents are concerned about whether placing the infant in a child care situation is going to have a good, bad, or indifferent effect on that child's development, that child's relation with family, and the whole family's interaction with the child. Because of this very clear trend, back in 1988, we initiated this NICHD Study of Early Child Care, trying to get an answer to the questions that were really beguiling parents. Does early child care have a good, bad or indifferent influence on my child and the rest of my family. We started this study with a competition to select 10 sites around the country with top-notch investigators where we could accumulate 1,200 families for a prospective study and evaluation of the impact of child care. Children have been picked up at birth and followed with intensive evaluation at several points in their lives. They are presently completing their four and a half year evaluations, and they will be continuing the study until age seven. We're currently trying to decide whether to extend that study any longer. The evaluations have been completed now with the data analysis through the 15 month evaluation, and we're starting on the 3 year data. The finding that I mentioned in my opening statement was one that came to the public last spring, and indicated an answer to the question most frequently asked, and the concern that had been raised: will placing my child in a day care situation have an adverse effect on my relationship with that child. And the study, based on the 15 month evaluation, gave a reassuring answer for parents. It showed that regardless of where that day care was being provided, whether it was the other parent, a relative, large or small day care setting, that there was not an adverse influence or a positive influence on the maternal-child relationship, that the child and mother did just fine, as long as there was not some other problem with the mother-child relationship in the home. So this data, I think, got wide publicity at the time and gave a lot of reassurance to parents who were in the same situation as your daughter. We are asking a lot of other questions; obviously the issue of maternal-child attachment is not the only one. What are the effects on social development, on language development, on cognitive development, on other forms of parent-child interaction? On the child's health? One thing we do know is that children in day care get more ear infections and other upper respiratory infections than children who are not. But they seem to do okay anyway. So the assessments of the data from this study continue. There will be about five more papers and public presentations released this spring. And data from this study are continuing to become available. As I say, we'll be following these kids through age seven, and we will be learning an awful lot about the day care situation. It is everybody's hope that all the data will be as reassuring as the initial findings that were released, but we don't know. Mr. Hoyer. Well, that is reassuring, and I'm going to get a copy of that study and send it down to Susan. She'll be glad to hear it. Dr. Alexander. We'll be glad to provide it. learning to read Mr. Hoyer. She is a very conscientious parent, and very concerned about it. Let me ask you about another question that the Chairman talked a little bit about in the autism field; learning to read, how children learn to read, how that occurs. You indicated there was a relationship between you and the Department of Education on this issue, and you've disseminated certain materials. How particular have you gotten from your perspective in your Institute on the specific teaching techniques in terms of learning to read, phonics versus whole language, and that whole debate? Dr. Alexander. We've gotten very specific about that, Mr. Hoyer. Once we had identified some specific problems that characterized children having difficulties learning to read, it was our intent to look at interventions to see if we could overcome these difficulties. And we made a very specific point of testing these interventions in a school situation in a clinical trial type of methodology. So we developed ways to test, first of all, children, pre-school, for the presence of these particular difficulties we call phononemic awareness or phonological processing. And we're able to identify the children who are at highest risk of reading disability, based on this pre-school testing. In a number of States, in California, in Texas, in New York and Florida and several other places, we have now conducted interventions looking at a phonics-oriented type of approach, but a modification of the traditional phonics that's intended to teach the skills involved in decoding of words, using phonetic types of skills and approaches. With these techniques, we have demonstrated that these children are usually able to learn to read and come close to the rest of their peers by the end of the third grade in most instances. There is still a very small group, maybe 3 percent of this group, that in spite of this intervention don't make it. Their reading problem is probably based in a different way than the techniques that we're using are able to overcome. And we need to study that further. But the basic finding is that we can identify these kids before they start school. We can intervene with this phonics- oriented approach in the regular classroom with training of the regular classroom teacher, and have these kids performing up to grade level in most instances by the end of second or third grade. We are now trying to look at variations on these teaching techniques, applying them in a wider variety of school settings. And we're also asking a slightly different question, that is, when a high proportion of the students in the school are likely to suffer learning disabilities that affect their reading skill, can you apply this kind of technique with everybody in the class, and not just a subgroup that's at high risk. Can you apply the same principles with the whole classroom and have this approach work and improve the reading skills of everybody and bring them, not just up to grade level, but in many instances above grade level. So that's the next step that we're going to be taking with this, as well as looking at the whole relationship of the modified phonics approach with integration of some forms of the whole language approach. And throughout this, we are in contact with the Department of Education. We are working with them, providing them with the results, and working with them to try to make sure that the appropriate information is passed on to teachers, to teacher training schools, and to boards of education. web page Mr. Hoyer. In terms of that, I've been very interested, with the National Library of Medicine; a decade ago, I started talking about this. And I am essentially computer illiterate, as most of the people are in my generation who don't have to use a computer, and who unfortunately--or fortunately--have people working with them who are really very facile with the use of computers. But on this Web page, if the teacher in the classroom wanted to get that information on your Web page, is that available? Dr. Alexander. That's one of the things we're doing, yes. Mr. Hoyer. When you say one of the things we're doing, we're getting it on or it is on? Dr. Alexander. It is not on yet, but it will be. Mr. Hoyer. Okay. Because this is critically important to the classroom teacher, it seems to me, to have that information at their fingertips, where we spent a lot of money centralizing this information. Again, my daughters, I've got a 25 year old daughter that when something happens, I just ask her about it. I don't have to ask CRS about it any more, she sits down, accesses the internet, and she's got it for me in minutes, almost. It's incredible. It's just an unbelievable power that she has to access that information; that if the classroom teacher or the local practitioner in Timbuktu who's got a computer on his or her desk can access that information, it's going to make a revolutionary difference to be able to get what Alexander has at his or her desk anywhere in the world, essentially. asthma Last question, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your tolerance. I have to leave, unfortunately, I have another hearing. I'm interested in asthma, and I was concerned about what is an alarming rise in childhood asthma. To what do we attribute that, and what are we doing? Dr. Alexander. We don't know just what the cause of the increase is. There are many different and often conflicting claims. The most frequent one that we hear is that it's related to increased air pollution, environmental air pollution. Others claim that there are other antigens in the home that are increasing, and that as we further close up our homes for insulating purposes that there's greater exposure to these. I don't think anyone knows for sure what the cause of increased asthma is. But it's very clear that this is the only condition that's increasing in children, and the only thing, other than AIDS, that's increasing deaths in kids. The primary responsibility for asthma research lies with the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the Allergy and Infectious Disease Institute. And they're making major efforts in this. And in fact, Dr. Varmus, with funds from the Pediatric Research Initiative, has targeted asthma in children as one of the three areas for focus for the use of these funds this year. So there will be an increased effort in that. Dr. Varmus. It's also highlighted in the areas of emphasis for 1998. Mr. Hoyer. Good. I appreciate that. Let me ask you something. You mentioned environmentally related issues. To what extent do we continue to look at the psychosomatic implications of asthma? Dr. Alexander. I think there is still interest in that. But I think that the trend of today is to look more at specific triggers, environmentally induced triggers of asthma, rather than so much a psychogenic component. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, thank you again for allowing me this time, and Doctor, thank you for what you did today and what you've been doing, and all your colleagues at NIH. The Chairman is absolutely correct, the more investment we make the better payoff for our people. Thank you. Dr. Alexander. Thank you, Mr. Hoyer. protection from asthma Mr. Porter. Thanks, Mr. Hoyer. Let me follow up with two questions in this area, since we've opened it. We heard from Dr. Lenfant that, paradoxically, exposure to respiratory infections at a young age may offer a protective effect against asthma. And that asthma, the antibodies or whatever may be produced from those exposures are not as great today as they used to be in the past, and that therefore, children are more subject, and adults more subject, to this disease. Are you following this kind of research? Dr. Alexander. This has been a hypothesis that's been put forward with some supporting data from one study, the claim being that with vaccination, immunization, for example, we are less exposed to the antigens that the children used to be exposed to and actually get an illness. Whether or not there's any strong support for this hypothesis, I think, remains to be tested. This is one interesting idea that's been put forward. I think we'll see some more research on that. But I don't think we know enough yet to say that there's a very strong indication that that's the case. Mr. Porter. The EPA has recently promulgated new regulations on particulate matter that will affect cities all across the country. Were you consulted in regard to their action, because they've cited the increase in asthma as one of the reasons for this. Were you consulted with regard to these regulations? Dr. Alexander. My Institute was not. My suspicion is that the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences probably was, and probably NHLBI and NIAID, who are the ones who have the major responsibility for research in children with asthma. And I know that one of the motivating factors in these regulations was the hope that by doing so, we would perhaps decrease the incidence of childhood asthma and the severity of it. Mr. Porter. Ms. DeLauro. PREVENTING PROBLEM BEHAVIOR Ms. DeLauro. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Dr. Alexander, thanks for all the wonderful work that you all do here. If you don't mind, I'd like to just say hello to my pal, Dr. Haseltine. How are you? If you could, please, Doctor, profile for the committee your Institute's efforts on preventing problem behavior among middle school students. Tell me a little bit about what's planned in that area. Dr. Alexander. There are several separate efforts here. One of these, the local effort that is one of the most visible ones, is an effort from our Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research. It's involved in the public school system, the middle schools, in one of the Maryland counties, and involves development of baseline measures of behavior in middle school students, and then interventions targeted to reduce the likelihood and frequency of some of these problem behaviors. Currently, we've completed the baseline data gathering year, and are in the first year of implementation of some of the interventions in this school system where we are making interventions in some of the schools and not in some of the control schools, and measuring the differences in these target behaviors at the completion of the study. We are also supporting individual investigators in studies looking at middle school behavior in a number of areas. And then we have a number of studies, the largest being the adolescent health study, which is post-middle school, but some of the middle schools are in that, as well, a series of studies on minority youth health behaviors that are in eight different sites around the country that are targeting particularly high risk sexual behavior, as well as violence prone behavior. So there's a wide variety of studies that are addressing this issue. The most on-target of those is the one in the local school system. Ms. DeLauro. You talked about violence and substance abuse? Dr. Alexander. Substance abuse, yes. Ms. DeLauro. When you talk about interventions, tell me what you're thinking about. Dr. Alexander. There are a variety of these. Some are almost traditional educational interventions. Others are peer education types of interventions, where they will either be talked to by their own age peers or older age adolescents who come and talk in the schools about some of these health behaviors and problems. Others involve teaching approaches to conflict resolution, for example, for the violence prone behavior. So there's a wide variety of these. Some are targeting health behavior, nutrition, exercise, elimination of some health problem behaviors. Some also target smoking behavior, and a variety of others. MIDDLE SCHOOL CHILDREN Ms. DeLauro. I'm interested because of what I have done as a start to this within the community that I represent, something called Kick Butts Connecticut campaign. It takes about 50 or 60 middle school kids, [and the schools have been enormously cooperative in allowing us to come in and talk to the kids have been] and shows videos and have material on smoking and its effect on youngsters, and what it means to smoke as an adult and so forth. We have, what I call, a little army of middle school kids who are going into the elementary schools. We have worked with the elementary schools to go in and do skits, ask their questions, role play to address this. We've also used some eighth graders to come in to talk with the middle school youngsters. We've just started this initiative, so I don't have any data or analysis. But we have at least interested a bunch of youngsters in getting engaged in being mentors and carrying this as a health message. I'm interested in what you're finding in terms of the local schools and some of these health related issues. Because I continue to believe that with kids, they can have a strong effect on each other. We've seen this with something we've got called an anti- crime youth council. This council talks about crime and violent behavior. It's been in existence for about three years, with juniors and high school kids, who are again in the schools talking about how kids themselves can deal with the issue of crime and what their responsibilities are. Dr. Alexander. We're eager to get the results of this. As your experience was, ours here has been no difficulty getting into the schools. We were welcomed. The problem is, many places have done things like thisand variations on the theme. Very few of them have done it in a research context, or in a way that it can be evaluated. What we have attempted to do here has been to do this in a research context, where we collected baseline information before we went in with the intervention, tested different types of interventions, to address the same problem, and then followed up the students to see whether the interventions made any difference at all, and which of the interventions were the most effective. So we hope by approaching this in a research context we can gather information that will help many middle schools around the country to design programs that will take advantage of what we have learned here and apply them in a local way. You are absolutely right in terms of the timing here. This is the group where the health behaviors and social behaviors of the future are shaped. There are many disorders that we see in adulthood that can be avoided if we shape the health behaviors correctly in this age range, if we can avoid smoking, if we can avoid inappropriate sexual behavior, if we can avoid the violent behavior, if we can improve nutrition and dietary behavior. We can have an impact on a large number of diseases. So we hope that what we learn from these studies, done in a research context, can provide valuable information to many schools around the country that would do a similar thing. Ms. DeLauro. Your results, I think, are particularly critical for us. I for one would love to see them, because we can take the research and make the local application. And I believe that those of us who serve in public life can do this. We can work with our community. It's a way in which we can have a direct effect. We're trying this and trying to engage, the middle school kids. When these kids meet and come into training, I have also had an office filled with their parents who were there taking an interest in what the kids were doing. So you wind up dealing with both kids and parents. Dr. Alexander. We're also looking forward to the results and we'd be happy to share them with you. DRUG DOSAGES FOR CHILDREN AND PEDIATRIC PHARMACOLOGY RESEARCH UNITS Ms. DeLauro. Okay. Just one other question that has to do with children, I'm not sure that this is cause and effect, but we do have people being moved into managed care. More prescriptions for antibiotics that are going to replace doctors visits, etc. Then you've got prescription drugs dosages that have been tried out on adults but not kids. That could be harmful to kids. What is the Institute doing in terms of dealing with the proper usage, and dosages for drugs for children? Dr. Alexander. Well, Ms. DeLauro, you've put your finger on a very major problem in pediatrics. About 75 percent of all the drugs that are available by prescription have never been studied or tested in children. So they don't have a pediatric indication listed. And this is a problem. Because children react differently to drugs than adults do. We say oftentimes, a child is not a small adult. And the smaller a child is, the less they are like an adult. They metabolize drugs differently, absorb them differently, excrete them differently, and they stay around for different lengths of time. And a liquid formulation of a drug that's often necessary particularly for younger children may be quite different than a pill formulation of a drug. So drug companies are able to get drugs introduced to the market based on adult studies, and never do any studies on children. Those drugs are obviously of value for children, and pediatricians often wind up prescribing them, even though there is not a basis, a specific indication listed for them for children. We have tried several ways to get around this. One of our major responses has been to establish a network of pediatric pharmacology research units. There are seven sites around the country, awarded competitively as cooperative agreements, with the top researchers in pediatric pharmacology in the Nation, where we provide not only top notch capabilities for clinical trials and laboratory capabilities for doing a number of the analyses that are required, but also access to a patient population of children where there is experience in doing studies, experience in institutional review boards in reviewing applications to do this work, and experience in investigators, nurses, the whole team that's capable of doing high quality clinical trials in children. We don't fund a clinical trial. We fund some of the basic metabolic studies. But the clinical trials are funded by industry. We tried to take away from industry the capability of saying, well, it's too hard to do these studies, there's no patient population available, there's nobody experienced in doing these studies. It's there now. And we have publicized this widely to industry, and encouraged them to make use of this resource for doing drug studies in children. That's now taking off. We have a number of drugs now that have gotten pediatric indication labels because of studies that have been done in this network. We have a large number of drugs that are under study in the network now, and are in the process of getting pediatric indications. And we have hopes that this network is going to be able to provide an expanding resource and capability for pharmaceutical companies to do the drug testing in children that's necessary. The FDA has been very cooperative with us in this effort. They have prodded industry and encouraged them to get studies done in children very quickly, either concurrent with adult studies or not far behind. And we hope that this problem is on its way to resolution. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very much, and thank you for your work. I appreciate it. Dr. Alexander. Thank you. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Ms. DeLauro. Mr. Wicker. LEARNING TO READ Mr. Wicker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Alexander, I notice in your testimony you mentioned that your Institute's researchers have been using non-invasive neuroimaging methods to study brain systems that are involved in the ability to read. Dr. Alexander. Yes. Mr. Wicker. A recent article in the Chicago Tribune cites a quote from Reid Lyon, Research Director of your Institute,with respect to reading skills. And Mr. Lyon is quoted as saying, we know what to do, we have the information within our grasp. We just can't get the message across. That's what makes the issue so frustrating. I wonder if you could comment on that, and tell us what science has discovered that might provide us more effective tools. Dr. Alexander. We know what to do in a large number of children. We're learning what to do in many others. We have the ability to identify a substantial proportion of the children who are at risk for learning disabilities before they begin school. We know what to do to help a large proportion of those children to learn to read. We are in the process of learning how to do that in a more effective way, by testing variations on the theme, if you will, of the interventions that we have found to be effective, to see if there are ways that we might make those more effective for a larger percentage of children. There remains a group of children for whom these techniques don't always work. And those children certainly require additional study and evaluation. One of the things that we're doing involves this neuroimaging technique. It's called functional magnetic resonance imaging. And it's a non-invasive method of studying what's going on in the brain of children. Because it is non-invasive, doesn't involve x-rays, we're able to use it in normal children. And it's teaching us a lot about how the brain functions. The neuroimaging studies have identified differences in activation sites, differences in processing activities, of areas of the brain in children with learning disabilities compared to children without. One of the things that we're studying right now is if we apply these remedial techniques, does the picture of the neuroimaging change in these children? Will they become more like their normal reading contemporaries, and their functional neuroimaging picture? I don't think we're going to be at the point where neuroimaging is the diagnostic criterion for learning disabilities. We have paper and pencil tests that work much better and much less expensively for that than a neuroimaging test does. But they do help us to study the basic underlying neurological problems that may be at the core of problems with learning to read, and help us to understand that whole process. Mr. Wicker. Which children are candidates for these functional MRIs? Dr. Alexander. At the present time, these are just children who are participating in some specific research studies. There are sites that have a particular interest in the underlying brain mechanisms associated with learning disability, and also have at their institutions exceptionally good capability for doing these studies. These are not easy to do. It requires sophisticated equipment, techniques, and people to interpret the images that we get. So there are just a couple of sites around the country where we are funding these particular studies of functional neuromagnetic resonance imaging to try and assess the underlying brain function or dysfunction of children with reading disabilities. children with reading disabilities Mr. Wicker. Based on what you know at this point, do you have an opinion about the advisability of using volunteers on children to assist children with reading disabilities as opposed to trained professional teachers? Dr. Alexander. I think children differ in what they're going to benefit from. All children can benefit from having a volunteer who reads with them, works with them in their early years of learning to read. A child with reading disability may not benefit from a volunteer who does not have some extra training above and beyond just reading a book to that child. A child with a reading disability may very much enjoy having a story read to them. But that may not have anything to do with improving their ability to read. If we want to try and improve the ability to read, one of the useful things is increasing the desire to learn to read, and the association with that volunteer reading the stories and books to them may increase that desire. But if we want to help overcome basic underlying problems of phonemic awareness and phonological processing and so forth, it's going to take probably more than just an untrained volunteer. It will take a teacher who is trained in the intervention techniques that have been shown effective in helping these children. Some of these techniques are not extremely difficult to teach a volunteer. And if there's a volunteer with an ongoing relationship with a child with a learning disability, that volunteer can learn from the trained teacher how to apply these techniques with that particular student, and be a substantial help to that child in amplifying what the teacher is able to do in a limited time they have to interact with the child in helping that child overcome the basic difficulty. These are not very difficult things to do. They can be taught to volunteers who can work with kids to help them. Mr. Wicker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Wicker. Mrs. Lowey. infertility research Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, I do apologize that I missed your presentation. With regard to infertility research, in your testimony, you did state that your Institute has completed several clinical studies on the causes of infertility. How close are these study results to commercial application, that is, to assisting couples seeking infertility treatment, and what is the process of taking these findings and making them useful to the public? Dr. Alexander. The two findings that I described in the opening statement have just been made, so they are very early. We now have to pursue what the underlying bases of these abnormalities are, and also determine whether or not there are hormonal interventions or some other interventions that can be made to overcome the specific difficulties. So there is a substantial amount of work yet before they are ready for broad clinical application. We would hope that we can understand very quickly the underlying pathology and develop interventions that will be ready for clinical trials fairly soon. maternal mortality Mrs. Lowey. Thank you. We think of death due to childbirth as a thing of the past. Yet every day, two to three women die from pregnancy-related conditions. Many of these deaths can be prevented. I'm working on legislation to improve maternal health through strengthening our surveillance of pregnancy- related mortality and morbidity data, increasing the use of folic acid to prevent birth defects, provide for better follow- up care after the birth of a child, and improving the quality and use of ultrasound tests. Can you briefly comment on the research you aresupporting in the area of maternal health, and in particular, any research looking at maternal mortality? Following up on that, I met with some people from the CDC yesterday and one of the questions I asked them in response to questions that were asked of me was whether their research has led to any connection between infant defects, child defects, and drug use during teen years. Could you comment on that as well? We're talking about prevention, how do you prevent birth defects. It was brought to my attention, and this person, everything you read may not necessarily be valid. But was telling me about information they read that did make a connection. Dr. Alexander. OK. First with regard to maternal mortality. Decreasing maternal mortality has been one of the great public health triumphs of this century. At the beginning of this century, a woman who was pregnant faced a 1 percent chance of dying as a result of that pregnancy. Now, it's less than 1 in 10,000. There's still over 300 women a year in this country that die from complications associated with pregnancy. And every one of those is too many. Pregnancy should be a condition which any woman can approach without any fear of death, certainly. The rarity of maternal mortality today makes it a difficult thing to study. One of the things that is associated with maternal mortality is infection. One of the hoped-for benefits of our bacterial vaginosis study, where we are looking at treating bacterial infections of the vagina and cervix during pregnancy with antibiotics as a means of reducing infant mortality due to premature labor, may in fact have as a side benefit that we will look at the potential of reducing maternal mortality associated with infection. That would be an outcome that we would hope we would see. Aside from that, the causes of maternal mortality are largely hemorrhage and some other complications that occur later, following delivery. As I say, the rarity of it is great, but it makes it a difficult topic for study. As far as birth defects in association with drug use during pregnancy are concerned---- Mrs. Lowey. Not during pregnancy. Dr. Alexander. Before pregnancy. Mrs. Lowey. Right. drug use before pregnancy Dr. Alexander. We do have a study that's going on looking at the complications, in fact, on the infant, of drug use during pregnancy. We don't have any studies at the present time looking at impact of prior drug use on birth defects in the infant. There was a flurry of interest maybe 15 years ago in association with some reports of chromosome breaks, in particular, being more frequent among teenagers who were using drugs, particularly marijuana and LSD. That research has not proven consistent in subsequent evaluations. I'm not sure what work the CDC has been doing that you discussed with them. I'm not familiar with that. Mrs. Lowey. None. Dr. Alexander. OK. That's a good reason not to be familiar with it. But we are not doing any work in that area at the present time. Mrs. Lowey. Is that because there is no one out there who thinks there's a connection, or you're focused on other things? It would seem to me, certainly we're aware of the tremendous difficulties that the crack babies have, so that the pregnant women who are on drugs and then leave us with thousands and thousands of crack babies, cause a tremendous impact on society, not to minimize the impact on them and their families. I just wondered, in pursuing this, is it because your hypothesis leads you or to the work done, that there is no connection? I would think that if there is any possible thesis that there may be a connection, after all, the eggs are there, are they the same eggs that are there during that time that the teenagers or older youngsters are experimenting, that we should be looking in that area, unless you're discounting it. So I'm puzzled by your response. Dr. Alexander. I think that the reason we're not now is that the work was done, like I say, 15 or so years ago. And the early suggestions and indications that there were problems with chromosome breaks and so forth did not pan out. And people who did follow up these adolescents with a history of drug abuse did not in fact find a higher incidence of birth defects in the offspring. The CDC has a very intensive birth defects monitoring program that they probably discussed with you that follows the incidence of about 25 or so birth defects around the country over time, and looks for any changes in incidence, and tries to track any fluctuations that they see to any causative event. And they have not seen any association from that study that I'm aware of with drug use or abuse in adolescents prior to pregnancy. We do have a maternal lifestyle study that's going on in our neonatal network that's a collaborative effort between us and the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Administration on Children and Families. This has picked up a cohort of women screened from a total of 19,000 pregnant women, identified about 1,000 of those who did have a history of drug exposure during pregnancy, picked up their infants, who screened positive on meconium screening in the newborn period, went back and got very detailed drug abuse histories from the mothers, whose infants screened positive, and is following these infants, looking at their behavioral development in particular. This is being done at three of the sites in the neonatal network. We now have followed these infants to about three years of age, it's our intent to follow them at least through beginning of school, trying to look at just exactly what their cognitive and behavioral profile is, and associate that, if possible, with the maternal drug exposure history. It's very difficult to do this kind of research, because there is a lot of environmental influence on this that's very difficult to separate out from the actual influence of what happened as a consequence of the mother's drug abuse during pregnancy. This study gives us the best shot of anything that's ever been done of trying to make that distinction and try to separate out effects of drug use during pregnancy from the environmental situation in which that child is raised subsequently. teenage drug use and pregnancy Mrs. Lowey. I think my time is up. So I'm to conclude that based upon all available evidence, whether it's crack cocaine, marijuana, heroin, used by a woman in her teenage years who then becomes pregnant and gives birth, there is no connection between that drug use and breakdown in cells, chromosomes or whatever? Dr. Alexander. This is not a subject that has been studied extensively. The limited studies that have been done, and they are probably too limited, have not to my knowledge given any clear evidence of an association with birth defects. Mrs. Lowey. Just to follow up, you're saying they're probably too limited. Dr. Alexander. Yes. Mrs. Lowey. So you would say---- Dr. Alexander. I don't think we have a definitive answer to your question based on the work we've done. Mrs. Lowey. Has there been any effort to put some more money into that research? I just think that the tremendous problems of drug use, which seem to be on the increase again, permeating every part of our society, and again, this was brought to my attention, and I'd be most interested in continuing the dialogue with you. Dr. Alexander. That's not something that we have done, Mrs. Lowey. I think it's something that we ought to take a look at and try to get an assessment on how adequate the studies are that have been done, and make a determination in conjunction with our colleagues in the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in particular, and probably the CDC as well, as to whether this is an issue that ought to be reopened and reexamined. Mrs. Lowey. And I'd appreciate if you'd get back to me on that. Dr. Alexander. We'll do that. Thank you. Mrs. Lowey. Thank you. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey. Mrs. Northup. phonics based reading system Mrs. Northup. Yes, thank you. I'd like to return to the question of learning disabilities and what sort of recommendations you make to the Department of Education. I noticed in your statement that you talked about a phonics based reading system being sort of the preferred, I suppose, in a remedial form for a child that has learning disabilities to learn to read. For example, a dyslexic child. Dr. Alexander. Based on our studies, it is the preferred initial one, but not the exclusive one. These kids who have this particular problem with phonological awareness and processing seem to learn better with a phonics based approach, not a strict, rigid phonics only approach, but a modification of the old phonics approach, where they are taught word recognition and basic reading with a phonics based approach initially. This seems then best followed along maybe by the second or third grade with introduction of the more whole language approach that's been used more recently in schools. But starting these kids with this particular disability with a whole language approach doesn't work. They do benefit from the whole language approach once they have mastered the basic skills of word recognition, decoding and reading. Mrs. Northup. And that's what your scientific investigations show? Dr. Alexander. That's where we are right now. We're not done. children with learning disabilities Mrs. Northup. Well, there's considerable anecdotal evidence in schools that are strictly for children, for example with dyslexia, that their phonetic system does truly remedy that child's problems for years. If they go to these schools, local ones, for three to four years, and then transfer back into a mainstream situation, they'll do fine. I guess I have to ask you what sort of recommendations you make when 20 percent of the school population has that problem and there is literally, in our schools, no phonetic based system for children until they are accomplished readers. I have supported new efforts at better ways of engaging children in learning. But I do think we leave our children with learning disabilities behind when we do that. I just wondered if you'd comment on that first. Dr. Alexander. I think you're absolutely correct. And our data also show that if these kids are not identified early, if we wait until third grade or so to pick them up until they meet the technical criteria of a year or two years behind in reading before we can begin any remediation, it's too late. Seventy- five percent of these kids who are not intervened with until third grade wind up never being able to read adequately by the time they're in high school. So early identification is important. We've also, I think, gotten very clear evidence that we have passed on to reading experts, to our colleagues in the Department of Education, to colleagues in States, that this population of children we can identify early on as at high risk for learning disability benefits most from a phonics based approach, and that they are not going to benefit from a whole language approach. If they are going to learn to read, they have to have this kind of an intervention and this kind of a teaching approach. Mrs. Northup. With that said, I have great experience with this issue myself, with children and the profound effect it has made on them to take them out of the public system and put them in three years of remediation. How can we continue spending money like we do to put children in a classroom that's totally based on whole language, which may be great, and I'm convinced in many cases it is, for children who are not learning disabled, and provide them totally mainstreamed in there with a little bit of a support system? When you're talking and saying that when you get to it if you try to remediate them at third grade or fourth grade it's too late, they're high risk and they almost never make up for the lack in that basic education skill. Dr. Alexander. Right. intervention programs Mrs. Northup. Would you agree then that it's not enough to send a tutor in for an hour or two, but to put that child in an intensive remediation program that allows them to be re- mainstreamed? Dr. Alexander. I think that our evidence indicates that you are absolutely correct, that this child does, in order to learn to read, has to have that kind of intensive intervention. I'm not sure that we know yet that that can't be done in a regular classroom. That's what we're still trying to learn. And in fact, the studies that we have done, in California and Texas and New York, have kept these kids in a regular classroom, provided the teacher with training skills in this intensive modified phonics approach for these kids, and have demonstrated this kind of an improvement with the kids in the regular classroom. Now, what we're trying to learn is, whether we can apply these kinds of techniques in the whole classroom, so that everybody is learning with the same kind of procedure, not just the kids who are identified as high risk for learning disabilities. Mrs. Northup. Well, let me just say, you raise some profound questions. And there are millions and billions being spent that do not reflect the science that you're talking about. Number one, I would like to see the studies that show a child that is mainstreamed in a whole language process that a little bit of support, either an aide in that classroom, that that remediates the child. I've seen no evidence of that. And number two, what you've just suggested is that maybe the whole class would learn better phonetically. There are whole States, including Kentucky, that have just gone in the direction of mandating, and I have to tell you I was part of that, mandating whole language for the school system, because we were convinced that it engaged all children. But if that leaves 20 percent of the population behind, that's a pretty startling fact, especially if what you tell me is that the older, the more traditional phonics based system would benefit all children. Here's a system that 20 percent lose out. I've seen no evidence, and I hope you'll provide me the studies that you say give evidence, that it's just as effective to try to have whole language classroom and one aide in there, for example, that provides a little bit of tutoring for kids that are learning disabled. That's entirely different than intensive remediation. And now we know from your studies that if this isn't accomplished by third or fourth grade, they're left behind forever. That's pretty powerful information and the education community really ought to know about that. Dr. Alexander. What we don't know, is if it is just as effective. One of the issues we are trying to address now is whether it is even more effective if the whole class is on a phonics oriented approach and the whole class benefits from that, rather than some kids one system, some another. phonics based system Mrs. Northup. Key question. That's a key question. But in the meantime, we know that children that are learning disabled need a phonics based system. Are we experimenting on whether we can leave them in a whole language system and give them a little bit of tutoring? Dr. Alexander. Yes, we are trying to learn that, along with these others. And really as a product of what we have learned, other States have gone the opposite direction, States like California and Texas that have been on a whole language system are now mandating a phonics oriented approach. So the pendulum swings. Ms. DeLauro. Would the gentlelady yield? Mrs. Northup. Sure. Ms. DeLauro. Just to follow up, you're talking about third or fourth graders, but with the information you're now beginning to uncover, can we find out information about a child that's learning disabled from zero to three? How do we find this in the zero to three period? What then are the implications? What can be done to impact that at an earlier time, thereby avoiding the process that winds up compounding year after year after year and whether it's mediation, etc. How early we can uncover the problem and what are the implications? Dr. Alexander. That's a question that we don't have an answer for yet. We thought we were doing pretty good to pick up these kids at four or five. If we could pick them up sooner, it would be terrific. We don't have the capability of doing that. Mrs. Northup. Let me reclaim my time. Ms. DeLauro. Sure. Mrs. Northup. The fact is that these children learning in the newer phonetic ways is a very proscribed system of learning. It literally takes them from where their visual and hearing impairment begins to the point of where they are very accomplished readers. And there are whole schools that do this now. They have a 95 percent success rate. And they've been in existence long enough to prove that these kids graduate from colleges, and they are not impaired in the future. A few of them happen to be my children. In the meantime, we have parent after parent whose children go to the public school system who diagnose them as dyslexic, who then the school says, we're going to give them, we're going to mainstream them all day, every day, except for one hour on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, or we're going to put a tutor or whatever, and the child never gets out of the learning disabled class. Meanwhile, we are paying Federal funds for this child that's so diagnosed and never is remediated, when we know of a system that works. I think, I didn't realize until I listened to you and read your statement how clear your evidence is in this area and how abusive it is to those children who are in the public school system that refuses to accept your scientific information. Dr. Alexander. We're going to do the best we can, Mrs. Northup, to get that information out. I described earlier to Mr. Porter some of the efforts, and to Mr. Hoyer, some of the efforts we're making to do that. We will have a learning disability summit co-sponsored with the Learning Disabilities Association here in Washington in April, with the concluding day here on Capitol Hill. Efforts will be made at that time for some very broad dissemination to Congressional staff members. And also, this again will be a joint effort with the Department of Education. So we are trying to get information out that we have so far. We are trying to broaden the research base that we have to examine some additional questions about how best to serve these children, and hope that we can turn around a situation that we know now is intolerable. Mrs. Northup. Well, in the meantime, since we have a system that works that's not available in most school systems, intensive remediation based on phonics in first grade, maybe what we need is for children that are diagnosed to have a voucher so that they can go to these special programs for three years, and go to a school that has a 95 percent success rate, so that they get out of not having to be remediated the whole rest of their educational years. Mr. Porter. The gentlelady's time has expired. We do have Dr. Slavkin and the Dental Research Institute yet on our afternoon agenda. The gentleman from Mississippi has asked you to yield. Why don't you yield to the gentleman then we'll finish our discussion. Mrs. Northup. I would be happy to yield. Mr. Wicker. I really didn't take all my time. [Laughter.] phonics Just a quick follow-up on that. Is phonics the answer for everybody? An administrator told me that there's a substantial population where phonics doesn't work at all. Dr. Alexander. That's why we need to be a bit careful about saying that this is the approach for everybody. There are some kids, the majority of kids, who learn fine with the whole language method. We don't know whether they wouldlearn equally as well if we had an all phonics method. Probably with this, as with most things, the truth is somewhere in between, that most kids probably learn best with an initial phonics approach, and then move better into a whole language approach, as they are ready and able to do so. We do need to do some additional studies to find out, just what is the best way to teach not just the LD kids, but the kids who are not LD as well, and how to accommodate the needs of a variety of kids in a regular classroom to the best extent that we can. research on fatherhood Mr. Wicker. Thank you. And my last quick question concerns your Institute leading a Government-wide initiative to improve research on fatherhood and develop policies to assist and encourage men in their role as fathers. Other than the obvious, what are you accomplishing there? Dr. Alexander. This is a broad based kind of an approach. Part of it is trying to just improve the Federal statistics base. We have a lot of statistics and measures about mothers, about children, but not nearly as many about fathers. We need to get better information about fathers, their participation in raising children, how their work and family responsibilities are shared, just what they do in terms of their engagement with children these days. Their roles are changing, as is a mother's role. We're also trying to look at various influences on how a father is able to fulfill his role in the home. Jobs, joblessness, time, and a variety of other factors. So it's a very broad kind of an approach. This has been underway now for about a year and a half. There have been several conferences on this. There will be sort of a wrap-up conference held at the National Institutes of Health in two weeks. And this will bring together a number of the different efforts that have been going on in various agencies to both improve the statistics effort that the Federal Government is engaged in to gather information about fathers, and their participation in the family and work types of activities, as well as efforts to stimulate an increased amount of research on fathers and their role with children. Mr. Wicker. Thank you. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Wicker. Dr. Alexander, thank you for your very good testimony, and for the wonderful work that you do at your Institute, the honors that have been received by researchers, both within the Institute and funded by the Institute. It's very, very impressive to us. Obviously the recognition is well deserved, and we appreciate the fine work that you're doing there. Thank you very much. Dr. Alexander. Thank you, Mr. Porter. We appreciate your support. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 1665 - 1736--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Thursday, March 6, 1997. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL RESEARCH WITNESSES HAROLD C. SLAVKIN, DIRECTOR DUSHANKA V. KLEINMAN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR YVONNE H. DU BUY, EXECUTIVE OFFICER EARLENE S. TAYLOR, BUDGET OFFICER DR. HAROLD VARMUS, DIRECTOR, NIH DENNIS WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. Next on our agenda is the National Institute of Dental Research. Dr. Slavkin, welcome. We're delighted to see you. We're sorry, we're a little late in getting started here. We had a very--obviously you heard the very spirited discussion we had at the end, there. Please introduce the people who are with you at the table and then proceed with your statement. Introduction of Witnesses Dr. Slavkin. Thank you. To my left is Yvonne du Buy, the Executive Officer for the Institute; and then to her right is Earlene Taylor, our Budget Officer; our wonderful Deputy, Dushanka Kleinman; and of course, Dr. Varmus and Mr. Williams. Opening Statement I'm celebrating my 20th month as part of Dr. Varmus' leadership team, and at the same time, I'm getting ready to celebrate a birthday that I would like to share with you, and that is the 50th birthday of the National Institute of Dental Research. On June 24th, 1948, the Dental Institute was created, at a time when life expectancy was about 62 years of age, when dental caries, tooth decay, was rampant in the United States, and when the typical adult could look forward to being edentulous by the 45th year of life. Some 50 years later, the United States is enjoying the finest oral health in the world, in no small measure because of the investment in the science of oral health. Children born today can pretty much take for granted fluoridated drinking water, fluoride in toothpaste, mouthwashes, dental sealants, panorex x-rays, all kinds of preventive measures that improve oral hygiene. The measurable outcome is that 90 percent of the adult population in this country still have their teeth at the time of death. That is a remarkable tribute to a relativelymodest investment in the National Institute of Dental Research. It's calculated that this investment is saving roughly $4 billion per year in the oral health bill of the United States. That is a wonderful yesterday. But as we take inventory of where we are today and look to the future, there are some terrific things going on. Last year when I had an opportunity to give my first show and tell, I was very excited about sharing with you an exciting paper that was published in Nature Genetics in which an overview was done showing that there were 40 craniofacial syndromes in which the genes had been identified and had been mapped to particular chromosomes, and that a molecular understanding was evolving for diagnosis. That was in February of 1996. We now have identified and mapped over 100 such craniofacial syndromes. What I'd like to show you with these prompts is an example of two of them that are extremely interesting. This particular disorder, called anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia, was first diagnosed by the famous Charles Darwin and written up in 1875. He had made a trip to India and identified four generations of males who were losing their hair, had no teeth, had no sweat glands, and presented with this unusual phenotype, ectodermal dysplasia-- EDA. Scientists supported by the NIDR as well as other colleagues around the world this year, in August of 1996, reported the EDA gene on the X chromosome, mapped it and found it to be a transmembrane receptor associated with epidermal tissues. This is leading to a standard diagnostic approach to this disease. Also, as you can see, these children are born without teeth. The NIDR took the leadership in developing implant technology to be able to create sort of miniature dentures that are fabricated through the life of these children until they reach maturity. These are individual children who have high self-esteem, can get through the socialization in the school setting and go on to become college graduates and do very, very nicely. The next example I want to highlight is a counter-intuitive discovery, primarily done by our colleagues at Johns Hopkins, at one of our centers for craniofacial anomalies led by a very outstanding geneticist, Mimi Jabs. This is an example in which one human gene, when there are multiple point mutations, a misspelling in one letter of the genetic code, gives rise to five different syndromes, all due to these mutations in a very particular region, a busy region in the molecule of fibroblast growth factor receptor type 2. This discovery is leading very quickly to new diagnostics, opening up a better understanding of normal development. These same observations are also relevant to other Institutes at the NIH and other colleagues. The last example is looking at this child with ectodermal dysplasia with no teeth, and the inability to have a dentition. An area has evolved over the last few years referred to as biomimetics, to mimic biology. That is, if one knows enough about the biology, then in theory, one could design and fabricate a biological solution to certain kinds of clinical problems. Here on your left is a typical example of growing cells in tissue culture in two dimensions where over time, they aggregate and make cartilage, which is stained in a bright blue color. Scientists have recently developed a strategy where you can take these same cells but grow them in a matrix and produce a three-dimensional form. In the lower right of the figure, you can see efforts to fabricate structures that have three- dimensional forms--a biomimetic approach toward developing new joints, new synovial joints, new temporomandibular joints, new hip replacements, new cardiovascular valves. In this area, through the generous support of Dr. Varmus, and through collaboration with the Heart Institute, we're starting an initiative on new therapeutics, taking the basic biology and moving it towards the ultimate realization of having biological solutions to knee joints or hip replacements or tooth replacement or valves or any of those tissues which need to be repaired, regenerated or augmented. So that is a reflection of where we are at this point. And I just wanted to mention in closing that as a smaller Institute, our future, if you will, is through leveraging our resources with other partners to be able to pursue these kinds of problems. For example, I'm pleased to report that by collaborating and co-funding with the National Cancer Institute, we've now set up four centers of oral cancer in the country. By collaborating with the Burroughs-Wellcome Foundation, we've been able to set up a genome study of a yeast called candida albicans which is expressed in immunosuppressed individuals. We hope this effort will lead to new diagnostics and new therapeutics. In closing, Mr. Chairman, the fiscal year 1998 request for the National Institute of Dental Research is $191,081,000. I would be very happy to answer any of your questions. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 1740 - 1747--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] Mr. Porter. Dr. Slavkin, thank you for your excellent statement, I might say without notes, except you had to read the final number. [Laughter.] Dr. Slavkin. That's the hard part. Mr. Porter. Well, that was a very impressive presentation, and we appreciate it very much. Dr. Slavkin. Thank you. dental amalgams Mr. Porter. You're funding two clinical studies examining the health effects of mercury-containing dental amalgams in children. This has been a concern for some time. Do you expect these two studies to provide definitive information about the safety of amalgams? Dr. Slavkin. The short answer is, I hope so. A number of people over the last five or six years have looked at the clinical efficacy and the costs and benefits of dental amalgams. To date, we have no scientific evidence that says that dental amalgams are harmful. But we do have a very strong environmental concern to try not to contribute to putting mercury into the environment. We're supporting research to quickly come up with a non-mercury containing solution in the short term. We're doing two prospective randomized clinical trials, one taking place in Lisbon, and the other taking place in New York, in northern New York, near the University of Rochester. The effort is designed to look at, with modern assays, if there are immunological consequences, effects on antibiotic resistance, or is there anything that we can define as a negative consequence of dental amalgam alloys. Those studies are just beginning. They are supported for five years. We hope they will put closure on this issue. Meanwhile, and independently, we want to get away from mercury-containing dental restorative material being used on people in this country. And that is the tack that we're taking. Mr. Porter. Well, I think you answered this, but let me ask it anyway. Given that children today have so few cavities, have you had trouble finding a study population for your clinical trial? Dr. Slavkin. In this country, we seem to have at least two kinds of children. We have children and grandchildren, like my own, who have no evidence of dental caries. This is probably shared by many of us in the room today. But we have a number of children in this country, especially in the inner cities of this country, who, with limited access and with a number of issues associated with poverty and inappropriate nutrition, etc., do present rampant dental caries, and do need solutions to those problems. So, in almost every urban setting in this country, one can find appropriate populations to look at. Mr. Porter. Does the low incidence of caries mean that there is little commercial interest in developing alternative substances for fillings, should problems be found with the currently-used amalgams? In other words, if you found something new, would you get a commercial interest in it? Dr. Slavkin. Despite the remarkable progress that's been made from fluoridating drinking water and developing dental sealants and improving dental hygiene, even in that context, in the United States last year, 200 million fillings were placed. In part because of our cultural diversity, a number of people live in this country who were not necessarily brought up with fluoridated drinking water and fluoridated toothpaste. So as a consequence, the background noise, if you will, of this advance in technology, is still 200 million fillings were placed last year, of which about 70 million were dental amalgams. biomimetics Mr. Porter. You are increasing your effort in biomimetics, the creation of replacement parts for body tissues and bones, which you discussed here. You indicate that it is a rapidly growing area in biotechnology with considerable private investment interest. If that is the case, what is the appropriate role for your Institute in developing these materials? What can you contribute that private industry cannot? Dr. Slavkin. In the hearings this year and last year, I think you've seen example after example where the NIH is perhaps at its best in doing fundamental basic scientific inquiry. We then move into translational research, where there are prototypes, before it goes to industry, before it goes to practicality, where expertise by NIH-supported scientists fulfills that requirement in this process of going from basic to translational to patient oriented to eventually the community. In this case, the opportunity is really focusing at that translational level; for example, to move the discoveries of extracellular matrix molecules and their different genes toward prototypes for the replacement of a cornea, replacement of the pancreas or salivary glands, or certain kinds of manipulations for cartilage, bone and ligaments. And there is a very exciting interest in the investigator-initiated research community to really pursue these and bring these ideas to fruition. fluoridated water Mr. Porter. Thank you. We've heard for years of the benefits of fluoride in preventing dental caries. But apparently India is in the midst of a battle about whether toothpaste with fluoride should carry warning labels, because very high levels of fluoride occur naturally in the drinking water, to the point that millions of Indians have been crippled by fluorosis. Is this phenomenon of heavy fluoridation of water an aberration of nature that doesn't occur elsewhere in the world? Dr. Slavkin. It's a very good question, and the answer is no. The creative insight that really led to fluoridation was observed by an American dentist in Colorado, Frank McKay, who made the observation that children who lived in Colorado had something called ``Colorado Brown-Stained Teeth.'' These children were consuming water from the Colorado River, and in that community, there was no evidence of tooth decay. Scientists were able to make that leap and that association. That is the downside of fluoridation, that like everything there is a benefit and a risk. In levels of one part per million fluoride, the benefit is to profoundly reduce dental caries. If you have excess fluoride in the water supply, or in the food supply, then mottled enamel or fluorosis becomes evident. In those parts of the world that have that situation,they have either put it into the food supply in excess, or it's in the natural water in excess, so they have to be concerned, and act accordingly. Mr. Porter. So why would they want to put it in their toothpaste at all, if they have an excess already? Why do they need to? Dr. Slavkin. I have not been privileged to the discussions they're going through. I don't know. tmd conference Mr. Porter. At last year's hearing, you were frank with us in saying that we don't know much about how to treat or even diagnose temporomandibular disorder, TMD. You held a technology assessment conference last May on TMD management. Did that conference produce any agreement about treatments, or at least promising research areas? Dr. Slavkin. It did an excellent job in identifying excellent research opportunities, specifically to focus on the etiology and pathogenesis of temporomandibular joint diseases and disorders. But it very strongly concluded that at this time in history, there is not a treatment that is being recommended. oral complications of diabetes Mr. Porter. What studies are you supporting in the area of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the oral complications of diabetes? Dr. Slavkin. Diabetes, as I'm sure you're aware, is an extreme challenge because of the oral manifestations, such as diabetic neuropathies, ulcerations that don't heal, teeth that become mobile, rampant yeast and bacterial infections, and activation of viruses. There's a whole field of problems. In particular, the Pima Indians in this country have been looked at, because they have the highest frequency of diabetes. They have been remarkably helpful in illuminating some of these kinds of problems. We have investigators both in our intramural research program and in our extramural research program who are looking at the genetics of diabetes, looking at ways of focusing on this balance between anabolic and catabolic degrading tissues processes. So it's an effort to understand the physiology and the cell biology between insulin and glucagon. We are pursuing that in terms of basic research and ways of making earlier diagnoses; we are interested in using saliva as a non-invasive tissue to be able to diagnose glucose levels and correlate them with serum levels to determine pre-diabetic conditions. We're also in the early talking stages of developing a relationship with the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, based in New York, to see about co-funding opportunities. So we're very interested, and are supporting that work. future expectations Mr. Porter. Dr. Slavkin, you mentioned that your Institute will be celebrating its 50th anniversary next year. With the pace of science and technology, perhaps it's unfair to ask, but could you hazard a guess as to the areas of accomplishment that are likely in dental research in the next 50 years? Dr. Slavkin. I hope there are. I guess it's easy to say because many of us won't be there to keep score. But the human genome project, of course, will be completed before 2005. A gene-based diagnosis for the viral infections and the bacterial infections and yeast infections, I believe, will be a given. Drugs will be designed based on the legacy of the genome study, so that there will be enormous specificity for analgesics for the management of chronic pain, for example. I think we'll understand bone formation and bone resorption, so that issues of osteoporosis affecting the craniofacial areas will be significantly advanced. But having sat through the previous interview with my colleague, Dr. Alexander, one of the areas that needs attention is birth defects and the issue of trying to make inroads in reducing the burden of birth defects. Currently, the numbers are 1 in 28 or 1 in 33 live births. That is just too high for a highly civilized country. So in that area, it really leaves the bench sciences, and it becomes public education and better communication and modifying human behavior, and a better understanding of prenatal care. Those areas, I suspect, will go much slower, because they're dealing with the philosophy of the human condition. And in those areas, we tend to progress very slowly. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Slavkin. Mrs. Lowey has asked to be taken out of order, because she has to catch a plane. So, Mrs. Lowey. osteoporosis and oral bone loss Mrs. Lowey. I'll just ask two brief questions, and I thank you. I'm very interested in the connection between osteoporosis and oral bone loss, if there is. Are you continuing to pursue the relationship between osteoporosis and oral bone loss, and what do you feel are the potential benefits of this research to people who may be at risk for osteoporosis? Dr. Slavkin. As you probably heard earlier in the day from my colleague, Dr. Steve Katz from NIAMS, we and NIAMS and Aging and NIDDK co-support a number of activities and initiatives focusing on women's health as specifically related to osteoporosis. A data base has evolved that is very compelling that osteoporosis is a player in the resorption of bone in the oral cavity. But to define precisely under what conditions, with estrogen therapy and without estrogen therapy, we have studies that are currently in progress, one at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, with very high-resolution radiography, to precisely define changes in bone density, bone density mass, and to identify individuals who are truly at risk as opposed to sort of a background of osteoporosis that might be tolerable in some situations. The answers are not yet in. Those are still research areas in progress. We're all looking at understanding the basic principles of coupling between bone formation and bone resorption, identifying the cytokines, identifying what turns on osteoclasts, and also how to retain the bone matrix optimally throughout an extended life span. It's still very much basic research inquiry at this point. Mrs. Lowey. I thank you. Just among my colleagues, this recently has been the subject of conversation. There seems to be a good deal more work in osteoporosis generally, rather than any connection to bone loss. Is that because this is more recent research, and there really hasn't been much work on bone loss in the mouth? Dr. Slavkin. You touch upon a very profound issue. Mrs. Lowey. Frankly, I was surprised, as we were pursing this. Dr. Slavkin. Yes. All of us in the room who were undergraduates of some fine university, we recognized there were two cultures, the science versus the humanities. And in the research area, until recently, there was not as much crossover, cross-disciplinary, multi-disciplinary activity as there should be or could have been. I think you're experiencing, and we all are, much more collaboration. People are realizing that the problems of medical or dental orthopedics, and the orthopedic-related issues, have an enormous amount in common. So there's co-supporting, people are doing grants together, working in centers together, going through training programs together. And I think that's changing the scientific culture. gender and pain Mrs. Lowey. Thank you. And lastly, I understand there have been some recent findings relating to gender and pain. Could you share some of these findings with us? Dr. Slavkin. It was an exciting observation that was published in November of last year in the periodical, Nature Medicine, by a group at U.C. San Francisco, John Levine and his colleagues. They were basically using a model of men versus women having wisdom teeth extracted, and looking at different kinds of analgesic drugs; specifically, they're called mu kappa opioid or kappa opioid analgesics. The surprise was that a particular regime of analgesic worked specifically well for females and not for men and vice versa. That opens up a very fresh opportunity to rethink the differences between men and women in terms of the reporting of pain, the tolerance of pain, the response to opiates, and the response to non-opiate analgesics. There are many scientists who have become very interested, both at the fundamental science point of view in terms of receptors and signalling processes, all the way to what could this mean clinically. Dr. Varmus last year gave a terrific lecture at the American Pain Society meetings which were held in Washington. He indicated that he was asking Zach Hall, Director of the Neurology and Stroke Institute, and myself to co-chair a trans- NIH effort to bring everyone together who has a common interest in the management of chronic pain and the science of pain, to really see if we could coordinate internally what we're doing much more effectively, and then from that position of strength, do the same with other Federal agencies when appropriate. To get this started, we created a trans-NIH interest group which is now in place. We're planning a ``New Directions in Pain'' research conference which will be held at the NIH in November, I believe it's November 21st and 22nd, at the Natcher Building, which will focus on trying to get people who are not necessarily in the pain research field to move their expertise and their intellectual prowess to begin to think about these areas. We have gotten a buy-in from 21 of the Institutes and centers and offices at the NIH. I think there's a very terrific interest in trying to see if we can get this much better. This is a $100 billion a year industry, pain pills. This is impacting on basically four out of every five adults over 65, who suffer from some type of chronic pain. So it is, with changing demographics, a very significant problem. I think the NIH is trying to position itself to be even more effective. Mrs. Lowey. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey. Before I call on Mr. Wicker, Dr. Slavkin, I have to leave at 3:30 and I'm going to ask Mrs. Northup to take the chair and finish the hearing. But let me say that you're doing a marvelous job as one of our newer directors. You're obviously very excited by the work that you find yourself in and the great progress that is being made, and we very much appreciate the fine job that you're doing. Dr. Slavkin. Thank you. Mr. Porter. Mr. Wicker. tmj disorders Mr. Wicker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just ask you to answer basically one question. If you would, elaborate on your answer to the Chairman about TMJ disorder. What do we know about the nature of this disease, and why did the panel come to the conclusion that it did? Dr. Slavkin. The temporomandibular joint is a synovial joint like the joints in our elbows or knees. But it's one of the busiest joints in the body, because it's essentially always moving. Mr. Wicker. Some more than others. [Laughter.] Dr. Slavkin. Yes. As we breathe and speak, etc. And as you might imagine, when you look at it clinically, there are 7 million people who report temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Most of these people are women. Most of the women are of child bearing age. It is not clear how much of TMD is a problem of premature osteoarthritis, how much of it is a neuromuscular disorder, or how much of it might be transient or hormonal. Clinicians have taken on the problem basically from their specialty points of view. Some assumed that the surfaces of teeth were the variable and would try to adjust the surfaces of teeth. Others performed surgical removal of the joint and put in silastic implants, thinking that might be the solution to this problem. And others have used behavioral modifications, biofeedback therapies, and nutritional changes. The panel came together, looked at the information that was available, and concluded that without prospective, randomized clinical trials, the evidence that is available does not support any one of these approaches with clinical efficacy. The recommendation was, we need to get a handle on the etiology and pathogenesis of TMD. And TMD may turn out to be four or five disorders rather than a single disease or disorder. We put out an RFA, we got a good response, we have funded a number of grants, we've got people around the country beginning to work on this problem. We're hopeful that in the near future, we will know about the etiology and pathogenesis, and then there could be a rationale that's evidence-based for diagnosis and treatment. Mr. Wicker. Your grants that you funded, how are they progressing and are you expecting results from them? Dr. Slavkin. From the conference that was held, which was last April, to the funding of the grants which probably happened in September of 1996, we haven't gone far enough to get a progress report. There's a large scientific meeting that's coming up later this month in Orlando, where there will be 4,000 or 5,000 scientists who are interested in oral health. And within that mix, some of the preliminary studies on TMD will be reported. But it's still quite early. Mr. Wicker. Is TMJ the subject of discussion by your trans- NIH pain research consortium? Dr. Slavkin. Yes. Mr. Wicker. Thank you. Mrs. chair]. Hoyer. fluoridation Mr. Dr. Slavkin. Thank you. Mr. Hoyer. I've had a great interest in the Dental Institute over the years. Dr. Loe, of course, an outstanding Scandinavian leader, and we Danes cared about that. And he pointed out, which you have also pointed out, I believe you used the $4 billion figure in your statement, in terms of the savings that have been effected by theinvestment of a relatively small amount of money, a relatively large payoff. I asked Dr. Lenfant a little earlier in the week about a similar analysis. It's more difficult, obviously, there, because it's not as discrete an analysis. Nevertheless, we obviously have gotten a real payoff for the investment that we made. In the course of your testimony you mentioned, and the Chairman was talking about the fluoridation, the Communist threat that was going to undermine the country, as you recall, it occurred to me--well, I have all these personal experiences and have no place to put them. [Laughter.] Up until 1989, I always lived in a city or a suburb, for my entire life. And as a result, I drank city water, through a pipe. Now I live in the country and I drink water from the ground, the aquifer. It occurred to me, and my wife had us get some bottled water as well, some spring water. Do either one of those have any fluoride in them of significant value to oral health? Or are we undermining the oral health of rural people? It just never occurred to me. But are rural people, other than getting Crest or whatever they get, they don't have fluoride in their water. Dr. Slavkin. Well, Mr. Hoyer, we typically don't provide the service of coming to peoples' homes and measuring the fluoride level, but in your case---- [Laughter.] Mr. Hoyer. I can see it tomorrow in the Washington Post, Hoyer pressures NIH to test his fluoride. [Laughter.] Is there a difference in the oral health of rural children on non-city fluoridated water? Dr. Slavkin. It really depends, case by case. We have in the country perhaps 10,200 water supplies that are fluoridated at the level of one part per million. And there are a number of sources of water which already are fluoridated, where there is no need to add fluoride. And in the food supply, fluoride has been added to mouthwashes and some brands of commercially available bottled water that people use in their homes. Mr. Hoyer. That's my question. Commercially bottled water does add fluoride? Dr. Slavkin. I can't speak universally. Mr. Hoyer. Read the label, I understand. Dr. Slavkin. Right. But it is an element in the larger food supply, and because many people purchase food that comes in cans with fluoridated water, there is always the potential risk of having too much fluoride, vis-a-vis mottled enamel. Mr. Hoyer. I heard you say that. That was interesting. That was not the question I had, but I was interested, because it occurred to me that an awful lot of kids live in rural areas that don't have the city water. diagnosis of cleft palate In any event, cleft palate, you've talked about a lot of this and I understand that was your first, I was a little late, I missed your first slide. In terms of cleft palate, can that be diagnosed in utero, and can it be affected, can we operate, can we do something to alleviate the condition in utero? Dr. Slavkin. Clefting occurs in approximately 1 in 500 live births; in utero, it can be diagnosed with ultrasound, noninvasively. But the formation of the face begins to happen at the 19th day of pregnancy, post-fertilization. So the face is forming usually before the woman knows that she's pregnant. The ultrasound diagnosis is made after these developmental processes have taken place. So the state of the art is really to have teams of people, pediatricians, plastic surgeons, various dental specialties, work together to address the special needs of a newborn child with surgical closure. We don't have a way in utero to correct this facial deformity at this time. The treatment that is currently available runs about $100,000 to $110,000 per child. And so looking at 1 in 500 live births per year, it's a little bit under $1 billion a year in costs, and the treatment extends from closure of the lip soon after birth to a series of reconstructions that often go well into the adolescent years. And clefting has speech and hearing consequences. So it really requires a costly team approach to habilitate these kids so they become productive and do very well. medicare coverage for dental care Mr. Hoyer. Doctor, last question, I know Mrs. Northup has to leave--are we critical? Because I can stop if you need to get out. They don't want to leave just a Democrat in the room alone. [Laughter.] They're very nervous about that. Everybody can understand that concern, of course. Congressman Cardin and I, and perhaps others, I don't know how many co-sponsors we have, are about to put in a bill that will deal with Medicare covering certain instances of outpatient dental care. The premise being that the ounce of prevention of that dental care will save effectively substantial multiple dollars, because of the dental care that is issued. I'm not asking you a question about that, I don't know whether you were aware of that or whether my staff--you're shaking your head, you were aware of it. Okay, good. But I think that in an era where we're talking about prevention being cost-effective, Congressman Cardin and I, Congressman Cardin is of course on the Ways and Means Committee dealing with HCFA and dealing with the Medicare issue, believe that this could be a real savings for seniors to get outpatient dental care, if in fact it is related to certain specific areas where the lack of care will then lead to much greater costs. Again, that wasn't a question but I wanted you to be aware of it. I'm glad to hear you're aware of it, and we'll be following up with you. dentist scientist program I said that was the last thing, but I know my good friend Nick Cavarocchi is in the back of the room here, who does a terrific job for health care generally. And I have been very interested, as you know, in the dental scholarship program and fellowship program. I frankly have not focused on what the status of that is. What is the status of that? Dr. Slavkin. At the moment, in that pipeline of the dental scientist fellows, they are being recruited for job positions two or three years before they're completing their training. The supply and demand issue is very skewed towards recruiting the DSA fellows into dental and medical schools. For many young people who are seeking that particular career path, and measuring the outcome in terms of getting a job and a very good job, they are very pleased. From our point of view, the DSA program is part of an agenda for training and then, in mid-career, retraining to keep people as current as possible with all of these scientific opportunities that you've been hearing about last week and this week. We're very proud of the DSA program, which was an idea that Harold Loe put forth a little over a decade ago. It's really been staffing a lot of dental schools around the country with a much higher caliber of faculty member. We're very proud of it. Mr. Hoyer. Congresswoman Northup, I will tell you, you heard that was Dr. Loe's idea. It was, but he made me think it was my idea. And we worked on it pretty hard together. [Laughter.] So it worked pretty well. And you will have that experience, sitting on this committee. A lot of people will be able to give you Northup ideas. Thank you very much. Mrs. Northup. Thank you, Congressman. I have one question in one area I'd like to ask you-- several questions. Before I start, I might point out to Congressman Hoyer just a little bit of anecdotal advice. If you start having dental problems after you've moved to the country, before you think about fluoride, I've noticed that age has something to do with that. [Laughter.] Mr. Hoyer. Boy, oh, boy. This is a rougher hearing than I thought it was going to be. I wouldn't know, but it's certainly something I'll watch out for. [Laughter.] spit tobacco and oral cancer Mrs. Northup. Dr. Slavkin, I was surprised in your presentation there was nothing about snuff tobacco and the relationship between the use of snuff tobacco and cancer of the throat and mouth. Does that fall under your investigation? Dr. Slavkin. Yes. Briefly, one of the things we were very pleased to do in this current year was to fund four centers for oral cancer: one at the University of Alabama, a cooperative program between the University of Chicago and Northwestern, a center at U.C. San Francisco on the west coast, and M.D. Anderson with the University of Texas at Houston. Oral cancer is the life and death issue in oral health, with about 42,000 cases a year, about 9,000 deaths, unusually skewed towards African-American men who are 44 years of age or older, who have the highest prevalence. I think it's the fifth most common source of death of cancer in that particular community. And to address it, we absolutely are committed to a number of programs designed to convince young people that chewing tobacco is not the way to get better statistics in baseball. You can do it without that. We're finding young kids trying to emulate behavior, and thinking that spit tobacco is the linkage to catching and throwing and so forth. So we're working with organized baseball, we're working with NCI, we're working with the Oral Health Alliance. The spot announcements on television during the baseball series where the athlete looks into the camera and talks about a successful career without spit tobacco is part of this campaign. Kentucky and Tennessee are two specific areas with very high prevalence of oral cancer in relatively young people because of the preponderance of this habit. And we want to do something about that. Mrs. Northup. Well, I am aware of the problems in Kentucky and the rising use among the youth. And I hope that you will focus a lot of research on it, and point that in the direction of the education community, so that children become aware of it. Do you do studies about the amounts of fiberglass that exists in snuff? Dr. Slavkin. I can check. I am not familiar with fiberglass as a component of snuff. Mrs. Northup. I'm pretty sure I'm right, what my children tell me is that the difference between snuff and chewing tobacco is that there are the fine particles of fiberglass in the snuff that ever so slightly, almost undetectable, develop cuts in the gum so that the juice and the tobacco are immediately absorbed into the bloodstream, as opposed to chewing tobacco, which has an entirely different concept. Dr. Slavkin. We will definitely look into it. I wasn't aware of that. Mrs. Northup. Would you let my office know if you all have any evidence about that. Dr. Slavkin. Sure. Mrs. Northup. Actually, for several years, I have been under the impression that that was a very well recognized difference between those two products. So in fact, the research and the cause and effect and the immediacy of the problem would be different between the two products if that understanding is correct. Dr. Slavkin. Right. Mrs. Northup. Are you beginning the research on oral cancer in teens that comes as a result of the use, I'm talking about teens and early 20s, of snuff and its effects? Dr. Slavkin. Yes, I think there was, because of the profound changes in our culture, a bias, not based necessarily on science, that all cancer was a problem of more mature individuals. But it's been rediscovered that we must pay close attention to young children. And we're finding nine year olds and ten year olds using spit tobacco in baseball leagues around the country, in so-called well off socioeconomic communities as well as in have-not communities. We will pay attention to this. Mrs. Northup. Okay, Congresswoman Pelosi. Ms. Pelosi. Madam Chair, I'm sorry, but other responsibilities kept me from being here. I don't want to hold up, I just want to get the testimony and read through it. Mrs. Northup. Okay. That concludes our afternoon session. Thank you very much. Mr. Hoyer. Time to take a nap. Mrs. Northup. That age thing. [Laughter.] In closing, I'd also like to thank you, Dr. Varmus, for being here the last week and a half, and I thank your colleague. This has been very enlightening, very illuminating, very interesting. I think the entire subcommittee has very much appreciated your testimony and we look forward to continuing it March 18th. With that, I'll recess the committee until Tuesday at 10. Thank you very much. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 1759 - 1807--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Tuesday, March 18, 1997. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH WITNESSES STEVEN E. HYMAN, M.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH RICHARD K. NAKAMURA, PH.D., ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR SCIENCE POLICY, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH WILLIAM T. FITZSIMMONS, EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH GEMMA M. WEIBLINGER, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH J. RICHARD PINE, BUDGET OFFICER, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH HAROLD VARMUS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NIH DENNIS P. WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DHHS Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. We continue today with the hearings of the National Institutes of Health. This morning we are pleased to welcome Dr. Steven Hyman, the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Hyman, why don't you introduce the people at the table with you and then proceed with your statement. Dr. Hyman. Of course. Introduction of Witnesses I have to my right Dr. Varmus, the NIH Director, and Mr. Dennis Williams from the Department. And from the National Institute of Mental Health, beginning on my left, Mr. William Fitzsimmons, Executive Officer; Mr. Richard Pine, the head of our Budget Office; Dr. Richard Nakamura, the head of our Policy Office. And this is Mrs. Gemma Weiblinger, who is our Legislative Liaison and my Special Assistant. Opening Statement It's my pleasure to appear before you to discuss the research programs of the National Institute of Mental Health, programs dedicated to understanding the brain, its role in behavior, and what goes wrong in the brain to produce mental illness. More than 5 million Americans have schizophrenia, major depression, manic depressive illness, severe anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, anorexia nervosa and other severely disabling mental disorders. Additional millions of Americans suffer other mental disorders that occur across the life span from autism in childhood to dementias frequently complicated by mood disorders and psychotic symptoms in the aged. All told, mental disorders cost the Nation more than $148 billion each year. Throughout the world, moreover, the relative burden of mental disorders will increase as a cause of disability and death as medical science conquers infectious disease. Indeed, the World Health Organization has noted that without marked improvements in recognition and treatment in the next 30 years, and I call your attention to this table up on the easel, and you have a copy of this, major depression alone will rival chronic ischemic heart disease as the single leading cause of Disability Adjusted Life-Years lost worldwide. Thus it's clear from a public health point of view that mental health demands the best science that we can apply. [See table 1.] [Page 1811--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] Fortunately, the opportunities for scientific progress have never been greater. We now recognize that mental illnesses are disorders of a specific organ, the brain, just as coronary artery disease is a disorder of a specific organ, the heart. Given the complexity of the brain, the task of understanding its function and dysfunction is formidable. But ultimately to make progress, we must understand mental disorders in terms of molecular and cellular processes in the brain, the assembly of neurons, that is the nerve cells into circuits, and the brain's interaction with the environment, including the broader context in which we all live. Examples of progress from the past year include identification of a protein marker on the surface of nerve cells that, early in brain development, may guide specificemerging cells to become part of the brain's limbic system, a set of structures that are involved in the control of motivation and emotion. In addition, observation through functional magnetic resonance imaging has permitted us to see alterations in brain circuitry during different processes of learning, that is, the experience of life literally changes brain function in a long- lived way. In addition, for the first time, we've seen convincing evidence through neuroimaging of the circuits involving a structure called the amygdala, which are the cause of fear and almost certainly anxiety disorders in the human. With the tools of molecular genetics, a team has identified a gene which is likely to prove to be the ``master controller'' of our daily biological rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle, which is markedly disregulated in mood disorders, and is also crucial to understanding a variety of human problems, ranging from insomnia to jet lag. Two teams together have markedly deepened our ability to add, alter or inactivate genes in the mouse, leading to what I think are remarkable discoveries on the molecular and cellular bases of memory of place in the rodent. But more importantly, providing novel methods of dissecting gene-brain behavior relationships. It is noteworthy that much of the science that will get us to the level of understanding that we need to deal with mental disorders is interdisciplinary, spanning the level from molecules to behavior and even more broadly, to social context. As we look to the coming year, we will continue to strengthen our efforts in fundamental molecular biology, in neuroscience, in basic behavioral science. We must also look to success in the realms of clinical and health services research. Thus we are engaged in a very thorough review of our approach to the complex human genetics of vulnerability to mental disorders. We are planning a renewal of our efforts in clinical trials and in the understanding of the effectiveness of new treatments in the complex settings provided us by the real world. I want to emphasize our commitment to children, in particular, our commitment to developmental brain research and clinical and services research focused on childhood and adolescent mental disorders. As many as 20 percent of young Americans between the ages of 7 and 14, approximately 10 million children, have a mental disorder that is enough to compromise their ability to learn and to develop, for example, normal family and peer relationships. Our knowledge base in this area clearly is an area where we must focus. One example is a severe disorder of communication and behavior which is autism. Family and twin studies point to a genetic cause for autism, and NIMH researchers at three different locations are now studying families using a combination of strategies. And I think the likelihood of finding susceptibility genes in the coming years is high. I highlight the area of autism, though, also because it reminds me to point out that this is a new arena of cooperation among four NIH Institutes, each of which brings to bear valuable and different perspectives on the problem of autism. And the collaborative spirit at NIH, I think, makes all our work better. Let me conclude by looking forward in the clinical and services realms, since I highlighted in the beginning progress more in the basic science realms. In the coming year, as I noted, we'll see new initiatives in the genetics of vulnerability to mental disorders. We will push to develop novel programs to translate what we learn from basic brain and behavioral research to clinical applications, ranging from neuroimaging to therapeutics, and we will begin reforming our approach to clinical trials and adapting what we learn to the needs of people in the real world. An additional important task for mental health services research will be the study of the impact of managed-care on the mentally ill, a particularly vulnerable population. For the scientific activities that I have briefly highlighted here and for related programs, NIMH requests $629,739,000 for the fiscal year 1998. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will be pleased to answer any questions. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 1814 - 1817--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] global burden of disease Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Hyman. As you mentioned, the 1996 WHO study of the global burden of disease found that neuropsychiatric disorders are important to health status and economic productivity in developing as well as developed countries. To reiterate, the study predicted that major depression will be the second leading cause of disability worldwide in the year 2020. If these figures are at all accurate, are we likely to have the therapeutic tools to address disorders of this magnitude, and will developing countries be able to afford them? Dr. Hyman. That's a very important question. And of course, not much farther down the list would come other mental disorders, such as manic depressive illness and schizophrenia. And just to reiterate, the demographic trend you point out reflects partly the hope that we will be able to conquer the first three on this list, which are infectious diseases in the developing world. And I would also point out that the demographic trends which create the picture that is projected for 2020 already in many cases are in place in the developed world. In order to make an impact, we clearly need new therapeutic tools, in several regards. First, taking major depression as an example, we are fortunate to have medications, a combination of which can now treat depression in 80 to 90 percent of people. But given a disorder that is so common and so disabling, the fact that there are 10 to 20 percent of people who remain as yet fairly treatment resistant is a problem. In addition, we have not yet been able to fully address the issue of recurrences throughout life, and indeed, in many cases, the depression may become more treatment refractory over time. We need more research, therefore, in understanding the fundamental brain mechanisms that lead to depression in order to develop really novel medications that will supplement the armamentarium that we have. In addition, staying close at home here in the developed world, we have a major issue in terms of the recognition of major depression. It is unfortunately a fact, demonstrated by a great deal of research, that major depression is recognized only about 40 percent of the time in many clinical settings, and under-treated when it is recognized. So that in addition to providing new treatments, we also need an educational effort to overcome stigma, to overcome the unfortunate tendency not to see mental disorders as real brain diseases which are worth intervening in. Mr. Porter. And about the cost, if you have the therapies and you have the diagnosis made in developing countries, is the cost for these drugs high or low, and would they be affordable? Dr. Hyman. The cost of these drugs is certainly not cheap. But to give you an example, the most modern antidepressants that are widely used in the United States cost between $70 and $90 a month. And while this is a staggering cost for developing countries, there are first of all tradeoffs, in that, the use of these drugs will markedly enhance economic productivity. More than that, we hope that as new compounds become available, competition among various treatment modalities may indeed decrease the overall costs. Mr. Porter. I recall about 10 years ago discussing what the developing world could do about AIDS. And WHO told me that they had virtually, in most countries, for example, in sub-Sahara and Africa, they had no money to spend whatsoever on treatment, no money to spend to even help people as they were dying from the disease. And the only thing they could hope to do was spend a little bit of money on public education to try to prevent the disease from occurring in the first place. Seventy dollars a month would be--a dollar a year would be a lot. Dr. Hyman. I agree. One thing that is rather striking, however, if you look at this list, is that four of the five diseases are actually preventable, based on obvious behavioral maneuvers. And interestingly, that does not include unipolar major depression. But ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are projected to be such problems based on the growing epidemic of tobacco use in the developing world. And of course, road traffic accidents also have the potential for behavioral prevention. It is interesting, therefore, that one of the things implied by your questions is that hopefully we can, through research on risk for the etiology of major depression, schizophrenia and other mental disorders, eventually prevent their occurrence. But at the present time, there clearly are no known readily modifiable environmental risks. Mr. Porter. I hope that by the year 2020 we're sending them our pharmaceuticals to help them, rather than our cigarettes to kill them. Dr. Hyman. I agree. use, needs, outcomes and costs for child and adolescent populations Mr. Porter. You have temporarily halted a large research project on children's mental health services known as UNOCCAP because of concerns about the study design. I understand the project has a $45 million price tag. And it certainly seems prudent to review its design before going into the field. What are the major concerns about the UNOCCAP study? Could the study be modified to address these concerns without major delays, or would you have to initiate an entirely new project? Dr. Hyman. This is a very important question for our Institute. It is clear, first of all, that we have great needs in the area of child mental health, including understanding the epidemiology of mental disorders in children and also their service needs. Just a moment's reflection tells us that children are not just like little adults. And so the diagnosis of depression in a seven year old needs special modifications. We undertook as an Institute a number of years ago a very ambitious project to understand the epidemiology but also the service needs of children. In retrospect, a number of things happened. The proposed idea of this very big project was likely quite ambitious. In addition, and I want to be very clear to say ahead of time that I absolutely value health services research, but this was being planned during the time when NIMH was in transition because of the health services research setaside, and had to move from 9 to 15 percent of its budget over a small number of years toward health services research, which meant that there were not felt to be, by my predecessors, funds to do the epidemiology first and then the health services needs second. But rather, everything was combined into a rather large study. And then the world changed radically. Which is to say that with the failure of comprehensive health reform legislation, there were all kinds of changes in the service delivery system, as you know, with the growth of managed care. Taking these things into account, the UNOCCAP investigators made what was an attempt at an altered study design to meet these, to turn the shifting sands of health service delivery systems from a liability into an advantage. Unfortunately, with all of these changes, the structure that had been created by UNOCCAP and the ambition of the study made the overall structure unwieldy. Therefore, because of this change in design, I asked for a thorough scientific review. And I engaged our council in overseeing the results of that review. Both the review group and the council found that there were many valuable things that have come from UNOCCAP, including study instruments to be able to understand both childhood diagnoses across various ages, and also service needs. But they also found that the project was more ambitious than could be accomplished with the time allotted. Therefore, a recommendation has been made to focus on finishing the development of these very valuable instruments that will be used in a wide variety of children's studies, and to thoroughly validate them. I'm also concerned that these instruments be translated into Spanish and be culturally appropriate for use in a diversity of populations. We will appoint an oversight committee to see whether there is appropriate time and appropriate organization to move beyond this instrument development phase. I think if the study were to end with the instrument development phase, something extremely valuable will be learned. I do not want to use taxpayer money in a way that would not be well focused or serve the needs of children well. And if the oversight panel does not agree that the study should proceed beyond this stage, it won't. Mr. Porter. Is the oversight panel the subcommittee of your advisory council that you've asked to do a review? Dr. Hyman. No, I'm sorry. I should have clarified that. The National Advisory Mental Health Council working group asked actually for an expert scientific oversight panel to be appointed, literally to follow this collaborative agreement within the Institute. And we have already identified, not everyone has said yes yet, but five people to serve on that oversight panel. They will report to council and to me. And council and I have entered, I think, into a very constructive partnership on this. Mr. Porter. So the subcommittee has completed its work and recommended this oversight committee? Dr. Hyman. That is correct. They recommended that the study be limited in its scope at this point, that there be an oversight committee, and that anything beyond the initial validation of instruments be approved by the oversight committee. setaside for mental health services research Mr. Porter. The 15 percent requirement for mental health services research---- Dr. Hyman. That is correct. Mr. Porter [continuing]. Staff tells me that that was part of the old ADAMHA statute. Dr. Hyman. That is correct. Mr. Porter. And was retained on its transfer to NIH. NIH is about to be reauthorized. Have you asked the authorizing committee to make any changes in that part of the law? Dr. Hyman. I have not had those conversations. Let me say that health services research, especially as we enter an era of managed care, is a very important area of research. And it's also a part of research that helps us translate clinical studies into understanding in the real world. My philosophy, however, is that specific setasides limit flexibility to pursue scientific opportunity. However, one of the accomplishments of the setaside, I think, was to develop a mature and vibrant health services research field, which should no longer need any special protection, but should be able to compete with the rest of the scientists applying in our portfolio. Mr. Porter. I have to say, and I want Dr. Varmus to know this as well, I've had some conversations with the Chairman of the authorizing committee in the House, Mr. Bilirakis of Florida, about directing NIH. It seems to me that if the appropriating committee attempts to do their very best not to politically direct research but the authorizing committee goes ahead and does it, you're bound to what they put into the law. So I think it's just as important that in the authorizing mode, that all of us send messages that the least amount of direction is the best, and the greatest amount of flexibility and decisions being made by science rather than politics are best for everyone. I've really been talking to Mr. Bilirakis about this and the importance of it. We'll see what happens. Dr. Varmus. We delivered some of those messages yesterday when Mr. Bilirakis and several of the other committee members visited NIH for several hours. Mr. Porter. Good. Ms. Pelosi. needle exchange programs Ms. Pelosi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Hyman, thank you very much for your testimony and for your leadership at the National Institute of Mental Health. I was fascinated by ``clock'', as one who commutes on a regular basis to California I'll be very interested in following that jet lag and sleep, day-night aspects of your research. Again, I want to thank you for your leadership at NIMH. Your work is so important to so many families in America. Many people come to our offices to talk about health care reform, and say that they are locked into what they are doing because of a mental illness that their child or another family member may have. That's one aspect of it. Of course, the other aspect is what it means to that individual and what it means to the family. So for many reasons, personal, fiscal and otherwise, we all look to you and thank you for giving us hope. Your investment in brain research does just that. And, as you know, the disruption and lost productivity in our economy, is staggering. I also want to commend you and NIMH on your behavioral research and your leadership in convening the recent consensus conference on interventions to prevent HIV risk behaviors. This is a very important report and useful to us in Congress. I hope that we will pay attention to the science. And I want to ask you a question about that. Your outside experts cite an impressive body of evidence that needle exchange programs work. Studies show a reduction in risk behavior as high as 80 percent, with estimates of 30 percent or greater for reduction in HIV infections. The secondary impact on reduction in women and children may be even greater than the 30 percent. I cite from your report that there are over 100 needle exchange programs in the United States, compared with more than 2,000 in Australia, a country with less than 10 percent of the U.S. population. And the studies show a reduction in risk behavior as high as 80 percent, with an estimate of 30 percent or greater reduction of HIV in intravenous drug users. This is your report. You're familiar with it. I just want to call it to the committee's attention. It's my understanding that researchers now estimate that if Congress were to change our current policy and support needle exchange programs that an additional 5,150 to 11,000 plus cases of HIV infection could be avoided by the year 2000. Based on science, do you agree with the outside experts, Dr. Varmus and Dr. Leshner that Congress should lift the ban on Federal funding for needle exchange programs? Dr. Hyman. Yes, just one clarification. Of course, it's not my report because the consensus panel was picked independently of NIH. But we ensured through NIH that they had access to all the data, positive, negative and so on. I think that from a public health point of view, the data on needle exchange is particularly compelling, in no small part, because the sharing of needles is such an efficient way of transmitting the AIDS virus that we could rely not simply for these studies on self- report of altered behavior, but one can actually see changes in sero-conversion to HIV. And I won't belabor what you've already read, but I think from a public health point of view---- Ms. Pelosi. Please do. Dr. Hyman. Well, from a public health point of view, the data in favor of needle exchange is very strong, indeed. Ms. Pelosi. Thank you, Doctor. Dr. Varmus. Dr. Varmus. We continue to make a distinction, Ms. Pelosi, between the data on seroconversion, which is quite easy to obtain and to interpret, and the more ambiguous data on the incidence of drug use in needle exchange programs. sexual abstinence in aids prevention Ms. Pelosi. Of course. Thank you for making that distinction, Dr. Varmus. As you know, in the welfare legislation, Congress provided $50 million, as some of us are just finding out, for programs for teaching adolescents abstinence from sexual behavior. This is far more money than we've been able to provide to CDC for programs that have been proven to work. While I support any programs to teach adolescents abstinence, I think we are delinquent if we don't teach abstinence ``plus.'' It is my understanding that this ``abstinence'' only approach is in direct conflict with science, since it ignores evidence that other programs would be more effective. What do we know about abstinence only education programs? Do you think this expenditure of $50 million could in fact increase the number of new HIV infections? Dr. Hyman. This is, of course, a very sensitive issue, because it treads not only on public health areas, but also on profoundly personal health values. Indeed, we have studied in as yet unpublished studies of abstinence-only education versus education which suggested abstinence but also emphasized safe sexual practices, should adolescents choose to engage in them despite admonitions to abstinence. What has been found is that abstinence-only programs do indeed delay the onset of sexual activity in adolescents, and tend to decrease the amount of sexual activity in those who have already begun. In several studies, however, the weakness in the abstinence-only approach--from a public health point of view--is that when adolescents then do become sexually active, they are not aware of practices of safe sexual behavior, and thereby may expose themselves to the risk of HIV. Ms. Pelosi. Well, as the mother of five, I know many parents in America, all, I could probably say, would be very concerned about this, and certainly would support the idea of abstinence. But I want to make a distinction, Mr. Chairman, between abstinence only and abstinence plus. It could be very effective as opposed to the disadvantage we're placing these young people when we know what the possibilities are. Dr. Hyman. I'm also the father of three young children and I have very similar kinds of concerns. And I think the really important issue is to recognize that there have been a lot of concerns that education about safe sexual practices would somehow increase the likelihood that children or adolescents would engage in sex, or engage in it earlier. And the kinds of programs that we are most interested in, recognize that there is a dual benefit in delaying the onset of sexual activity, and when sexual activity occurs for people to engage in practices that are not going to put at risk for HIV transmission. prevention of childhood mental disorders Ms. Pelosi. Thank you, Doctor. Our Chairman asked the question I was going to ask on children's mental health. I didn't know if you wanted to add anything about ways that we could prevent the onset of mental disorders in children. Dr. Hyman. This is a very vexed area. Indeed, I'm having a council-based review of our entire prevention portfolio. And let me say that given our current state of knowledge, the actual prevention of most cases of depression or manic depressive illness does not seem scientifically feasible. But there is an incredible public health need that is going unmet, which has to do with the identification of children at risk who are already showing symptoms of mental disorder early in life. The data suggest that these children are being recognized as having mental health problems very late. Often, kids get put in the wrong--I hate to use the term--but they're put in the wrong bin, they're called bad kids instead of kids who are in need of help. And one of my goals, indeed, one of the critical goals of the Institute, post UNOCCAP would be to provide the kind of epidemiologic and diagnostic information and also public education so that we recognize these children. But a second very important area is therapeutics. You might not be aware, and it's rather staggering, that there is only a single, well designed, federally-funded study at this point of the use of modern anti-depressants in adolescents. And we really need to do not only greater work in recognition but also in therapeutics for these children, so they can come to school ready to learn, and so they can form their normal relationships with peers and family. And I think it's really absolutely critical. world-wide burden of depression Ms. Pelosi. Can I just ask one quick question, Mr. Chairman? On this chart, Dr. Hyman, why did you not include, when you put unipolar major depression, you didn't include bipolar. Dr. Hyman. To make this readable, I just gave you the top five causes. This is a chart that I did not prepare, but actually came from the World Bank. The World Bank and the World Health Organization were interested in basically what is the burden of disease. That is, not just mortality, but healthy days lost, that people are unable to function in normal life roles, including work. And it turns out that for the entire world, the left hand column represents the five main causes of Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALY) loss currently, and the right column is their projection. Not far behind are manic depressive illness and schizophrenia. And the reason that these rank so high is because the onset of mental disorders tends to be early in life, and the course tends to be chronic or recurrent. So a disease like schizophrenia, tragically, will often strike just as someone is emerging into young adulthood and ready to become a contributing member of society. Then obviously, is unable to work. Ms. Pelosi. And AIDS is not on there because we're hopeful that---- Dr. Hyman. AIDS is, I believe, expected to be the tenth leading cause by the year 2020. Ms. Pelosi. Of course, having more devastating effects in certain areas. Dr. Hyman. That's correct. This is divided over the entire globe. Ms. Pelosi. I appreciate it. Thank you very much, Dr. Hyman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Dr. Hyman. Dr. Hyman. Good morning. minority investigators and research subjects Mr. Stokes. Dr. Hyman, one of my major concerns is that Federal agencies utilizing taxpayer funds reflect diversity in terms of the hiring practices at those agencies. Can you give me some idea of how diversified the upper echelons of your agency are? Dr. Hyman. Of our total staff, 20 percent are under- represented minorities. At GS-14 and above, it is 12 percent [clerk's note: later corrected to ``8'']. But I have to tell you that diversity is very important, not only within our staff, but also among potential grantees. These difficult problems need every good mind we can possibly bring to bear on them. And we can't afford to lose anyone through failed educational opportunities. And I'm extremely proud of some of the programs NIMH has for getting college students, for example, who are minorities, involved in science and seeing them through. Mr. Stokes. Would you include in the record a staffing grade distribution table, both below and above GS-14? Dr. Hyman. I'd be delighted to. [The information follows:] [Page 1826--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] Mr. Stokes. You mentioned grantees. And last year, when your Institute testified here, you indicated that you had taken part in an NIH-wide major initiative to track the enrollment of women and minorities over the course of funded grants. I understand that this initiative would allow the Institute to evaluate the success of its inclusion policy in achieving the Institute's goals. What are the findings of that effort? Dr. Hyman. I believe I'm going to have to provide those findings for the record. Mr. Stokes. All right. [The information follows:] initiative to track enrollment of women and minorities The NIH-wide initiative to track the enrollment of women and minorities over the course of funded grants is an ongoing activity for which data is still being gathered. For this reason the findings of this effort are not yet available. NIMH can report the following: 1) More than 88% of applications involving human subjects were found to meet the inclusion requirements as submitted (see table below). 2) Review procedures are in place to identify applications that do not meet the inclusion requirements. 3) Applications found to be unacceptable with regard to inclusion receive an administrative code of ``U'' that results in a bar-to-funding. 4) Applicants, whose grants would otherwise be approved for payment, may submit additional information to meet the inclusion requirement. After receipt of this additional information, these grants are submitted to the NIMH Associate Director for Special Populations for final determination that the inclusion requirement has been met. Approval at this level results in removal of the bar and subsequently to funding of the award.

Mr. Stokes. I understand that NIMH supports minority research centers. Dr. Hyman. That's correct. Mr. Stokes. The centers are confirming cultural differences in the expression of disease symptoms. As one would expect, such differences if not adequately taken into consideration can result in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. What are some of the most significant findings of this research? Tell us how the results of the research are being incorporated into your basic and clinical research initiatives. Dr. Hyman. That's true. I think it is very important to recognize that the incidence of major mental disorders is often quite uniform across different populations worldwide, but that the expression of symptoms may differ. For example, to take the simplest example, there may be cultural taboos about admitting to depression which may be stronger or weaker in different populations. People may focus more on psychological symptoms in one population, and on somatic symptoms in another population. In order to take this into account, let me return to the instruments that are being developed for the UNOCCAP study. We are involved in and going to have, for example, Spanish language versions of these instruments, but not one Spanish language version, but rather a version that would be culturally sensitive. You can imagine that if an interviewer goes into a family and starts asking a list of diagnostic questions, those questions really have to be attuned to things that the family will find understandable and important to respond to. This is a major investment for the Institute. Mr. Stokes. Doctor, I understand the Institute is sponsoring studies of ethnically defined populations as they respond to psychoactive drugs, is that correct? Dr. Hyman. This is correct. Once, again, there may be differences in different populations in the metabolism of drugs and in the way the body handles them. Mr. Stokes. Tell us why this type of research is important, and what your findings have been. Dr. Hyman. One interesting finding recently was to actually look at African-Americans and their metabolic ``handling'' of lithium. And it turns out that lithium, which is still the standard treatment for manic depressive illness, is compartmentalized differently between red blood cells and the serum, that is the free component of lithium, in a way that might make African-Americans more sensitive to the side effects of lithium. This kind of information is really critical if we are going to have broadly useful therapeutics for a wide variety of medications. And I believe that not enough attention has been paid to this kind of diversity. brain as the touchstone of nimh research Mr. Stokes. Dr. Hyman, one of the areas of your budget submission, the biology of the brain, is one of your majoremphasis areas. Tell us what is your Institute's role in the initiative and how is the initiative expected to further expedite advances in mental health treatment, prevention and early diagnosis? Dr. Hyman. That's a tall order. Because in many ways, that relates to the entire mission of our Institute. In essence, it's clear that serious mental disorders are disorders of the brain that evolve through the workings of genes together with the environment. We are obviously collaborating with the nine other NIH Institutes that have a large amount of brain research in their budgets, sometimes on specific programs, and sharing information. But for us, we recognize that new treatments, the eventual identification of preventable environmental second hits that interact with genes and a whole variety of other interventions are going to require that we understand the genes which confer vulnerability to mental disorders, how they work in the brain, how they're modified by environmental factors, and what molecules and cells in the brain might be targets for novel therapies. Let me give you just one example to make this concrete. We have discovered, as a community, that there are certain circuits in the brain, especially involving something called the amygdala, which are involved in fear. Normally, fear is a very important adaptive response. Without fear, people might do all kinds of things to get themselves into trouble. However, this very same circuitry, when it malfunctions, can give rise to a variety of severe anxiety disorders, including panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. We're beginning to understand in detail, in animal models, exactly how--not to be too dramatic--but exactly how these circuits can be usurped, or hijacked, in mental illness. And we're beginning to take those animal models to the human level, using functional neuroimaging. Now, the opportunity in understanding these circuits, we can now say, okay, this is a part of the brain that gets sick in these anxiety disorders, and what are the critical molecular targets in these brains that can be used as targets for therapeutics? What kind of behavioral or psychotherapeutic interactions might reverse some of these changes, and how might we follow them in humans with neuroimaging? In essence, the basic biology of brain disease forms the fundamental groundwork for our understanding of mental illness and for the production of new treatments. RESEARCH NEEDED ON CHILDHOOD DISORDERS Mr. Stokes. Let me mention another area. Earlier on, you mentioned mental illness in children. Dr. Hyman. Yes. Mr. Stokes. I would imagine that this would be an area of great interest to many parents throughout the country. I think it would be helpful if you were to tell us firstly to what extent mental illness in children constitutes a major problem; and secondly, whether you have developed some type of a profile of these children. How can parents, at an early stage, ascertain whether or not a child fits a certain profile? Dr. Hyman. Mr. Stokes, I have to say with some concern that we do not have the information that parents and schools need in order to know what problems children are facing. And part of this is the difficulty of recognizing symptoms as they are reflected through the changing developmental profile of children. That is, someone who gets depressed at seven might look different from eight and from nine. One of the things that we have to do is to take the basic behavioral science, for example, that we support, and bring it out of the laboratory more effectively, and into the arena of the real world, where we can develop the kinds of usable symptom checklists and interviews which would allow us to identify children who are having problems with mental disorders. And in addition, one of the goals for use of the UNOCCAP instrument that I described to Mr. Porter, is the ability then to take that kind of information and gain the appropriate epidemiologic information. I have to tell you that we are starting, again, from a really deficient knowledge base, and this is going to be one of the major goals for me at NIMH, to make sure that we have this information for children. I should tell you, although it's slightly off the point of your question, but I find it heartening that there's been a lot of interest in this from other agencies. Secretary Shalala asked us to brief her on Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder several weeks ago. And we've had several very productive meetings, including some planned collaborations with ACYF, especially with respect to using Head Start sites potentially as an arena in which to start to look at some of these problems. Mr. Stokes. Then, from what you are saying to us, this is an area in which we obviously have yet a long way to go. Dr. Hyman. Yes, we do. I agree. Mr. Stokes. Do I still have additional time, Mr. Chairman? Mr. Porter. You have 30 seconds. Mr. Stokes. I doubt if I can pose another question in that time. Thank you. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller. You seem a little more comfortable in that position than you did a year ago. Dr. Hyman. Yes, that was with two weeks experience. SOCIAL WORK RESEARCH Mr. Miller. Glad to have you. Two different lines of questioning. One is, I see in your budget a social work area, would you explain to me what you're doing in the social work area and what these centers are, and are they locked into funding for a long time, and why they're in your area? Dr. Hyman. These centers were really requested in Congressional language. And the logic of these centers is that social workers are often on the front lines of making actually very important decisions about the future of children and families and the disposition of children, and also on the front lines in treating a lot of mental illness. And the concern of the Congress in writing this language was that there were not adequate research traditions in social work and that evidence- based science within social work would help social workers make better and more informed decisions and be better able to use the science of mental health in their daily activities. Mr. Miller. How much money are we talking about? Dr. Hyman. We have, I think, five centers, it's just under $3 million. Mr. Miller. And you fund these centers through an annual grant? Dr. Hyman. They get a grant. The center grants are generally for five years. Now, the total number of centers in the Institute is capped, that's NIH policy and it's my policy, at 50 centers total. So this then would be a percentage of our total research centers. Mr. Miller. My daughter is getting a Masters in Social Work. I'm just surprised to see it's in your area. Dr. Hyman. We do end up spanning from molecules to society. Why this research is actually in NIMH rather than another agency is an issue that Congress helped us decide. [Laughter.] But wherever it is, I think it's very important that social workers have evidence based information. I think that's really critical. TRAINING OF MINORITY RESEARCHERS Mr. Miller. I agree with the idea of the need for them, where it really fits in. Let me just get clarification on this whole issue of diversity, and discuss it within your Institute. Both intramural and extramural research, aside from knowing a specific minority type of study, but does that come into play? Because this is peer review. And so is there any weighing, if it's a minority, does that have any---- Dr. Hyman. What we basically, I think this is true across NIH, that what we're interested in is scientific excellence. We're also interested, however, in bringing every talented American who is interested in science sort of up to a level where they can compete in peer review. So we have a number of programs, the Career Opportunities in Research--COR--program for college students, for example, and minority supplements to grants, which are not costly but, I think, represent important manpower development programs. When it comes to standard research grants, all decisions are made on scientific and technical merit and on the mission- specific priorities of the Institute. Mr. Miller. So the main area of minority support is really at the beginning research level? Dr. Hyman. That's targeted, yes, it is really to bring under-represented minorities in a full-blooded way into this research enterprise. Mr. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Miller. Mrs. Lowey. NEW DRUGS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Dr. Hyman. I believe that one of the most important contributions that biomedical research has made towards elevating human suffering is the development of drugs for the treatment of mental illness. And I understand that a second generation of anti- psychotic drugs are being developed for schizophrenia. I also understand that new anticonvulsant drugs are available for manic depressive illness. Can you describe to us how these new medications are more beneficial in treating these illnesses? Dr. Hyman. Yes. There's a very good, and I'll keep it brief, but a very good story about anti-psychotic drugs, which is, it began with a serendipity, which was the discovery of a drug called Clozaril. Clozapine is the chemical name. This drug has been known for a long time. It was not widely used, because 1 percent of people who take it develop a life--threatening blood disorder. And yet there was something about it. It didn't cause some of the same terrible side effects in the motor system and emotional withdrawal of the standard anti-psychotic drugs. And so, despite the risk of the blood disorder, clinical trials, in which NIMH played a key role, showed that Clozaril had unique ability to treat people with schizophrenia and no liability of causing these terrible extra-pyramidal, or motor side effects. This discovery absolutely reinvigorated drug discovery in anti-psychotics, both in federally-funded laboratories and also in the pharmaceutical industry. And what we're seeing with drugs like risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole--are basically the children of clozaril, that is, attempts to make medications which will have the beneficial therapeutic effects of clozaril, but without the risk of this blood disorder, without other problems with Clozaril, such as a risk of causing seizures. And frankly, all of these drugs will have their place in treating people with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. We, as an Institute, now need to do the kinds of studies that I think the Federal Government is best at, which are studies which will help clinicians and families know which of these drugs will be most useful first, and in what setting. At the same time, however, we can't be satisfied, because all of these drugs, as good as they are, simply palliate, but do not cure, schizophrenia. And it's only by really struggling more with the genetics and the fundamental neurobiology that we will have more fully adequate treatments in the future. TRANSLATION OF RESEARCH INTO TREATMENT Mrs. Lowey. I thank you. At your last advisory council meeting, you proposed the creation of a working group to oversee the translation of treatment discoveries to the actual care of patients. I happen to believe this is extremely important, particularly given the pace of change in research on major mental illness. Can you share with us how your research might more quickly or more effectively be made available to medical providers? Dr. Hyman. There are two major areas that have come to myattention. The first is actually in our centers program that Mr. Miller had asked about. I would like to encourage some proportion of our centers to be centers where basic scientists and clinical researchers might come together. So that I don't tell you too many different stories, let's just stick with this idea of fear and the amygdala. We already have one center, in fact, actually two centers, where attempts are being made to translate this knowledge about circuitry involved in fear and anxiety disorders into treatment by bringing together basic scientists who work on animals with clinical researchers who use neuroimaging and also, in one case, with treatment researchers. This is the kind of model where we can, in essence, ask basic scientists and clinical researchers who speak fundamentally different languages to work together over the long term so that they really understand each others' problems. The second area where I think some subset of our scientists can engage in translational research is in our intramural program. The scope of the intramural program and its size, along with the question which I have been asking myself, which is, what is the justification for an intramural program, what unique advantages does it have, well, one of them is that this critical mass can allow some subset of our scientists to engage, again, in sustained dialogue, sharing information that will bring clinical knowledge to basic scientists and speed the progress from basic science to clinical applications. I have to say, I'm always concerned, however, that we don't ask a lot of people to become either fish or fowl. It's got to be really only a subset of outstanding scientists who are involved in making these translations. Because so much progress really is made within disciplines, by pushing molecular biology, by pushing neurobiology, for example. Mrs. Lowey. Lastly, and it's really related, I have become very concerned recently because of some experiences I've witnessed, concerning the treatment of mental illness by HMOs. I'd like to ask you generally the positive and negative impacts thus far. But my concerns are the following. Because time in treating patients is such a factor, have you seen a rush towards treating the patient with medication, which indeed may be appropriate, however, not giving the appropriate psychotherapy and the time that the patient needs? In fact, I have become aware in discussions more recently that there has been a movement in psychotherapy towards psychotherapies that may not be the same for everybody. Dr. Hyman. That is correct. Mrs. Lowey. Whereas there used to be the usual, the procedure, and they are trying to direct it, especially with seniors, where seniors are being moved into HMOs, for some seniors, the medication may have such extraordinary side effects. And if there isn't the appropriate therapy with it, I am concerned about the treatment. This is a long question. Dr. Hyman. You're absolutely correct about psychotherapy. In the old days, it is true that often the approach was, here's the treatment, now what's the problem. But indeed, as we've become extremely sophisticated about particular diagnoses, about different age groups, we recognize that for many disorders, a combination of medications and targeted focused psychotherapies are often the most successful treatment. A good example might come from panic disorder, where someone will have spontaneous, overwhelming panic attacks which will lead them, over time, to constrict their lives because they are afraid to have a panic attack in some place where they might not be able to escape. They associate these terrible symptoms with places that they've been. Medications, for example, may abolish panic attacks. But someone might remain housebound without cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, which may very well be quite short lived, but is absolutely important. And so guidelines for treatment that are appropriate, whether in a fee-for-service or managed-care setting, really ought to look at the whole package of treatments that are necessary for a good health outcome. Now, the managed-care situation is complex. On the one hand, by keeping costs down, managed care could make mental health treatment available for all Americans. And as you know, we've been engaged in the last year in this parity debate and the Domenici-Wellstone amendment made the first early steps toward parity. The major concern being, just as I've told you how common mental disorders are, that treatment would break the bank. Well, by controlling costs, managed care makes parity not only feasible but, in our analysis, quite affordable. And above all, the doctrine of medical necessity that exists within managed care means that we are encouraged to tell the difference between someone who is sick, someone who has panic disorder, schizophrenia, manic depressive illness, versus someone who is less sick, and make those kinds of triages, so that the fear that there were millions of people on waiting lists for psychoanalysis would not literally break the bank. Now, the downside, however, is that in our zeal to cut costs, we may also cut recognition and treatment. I think one of the goals as a Nation, as we face managed care in general, is to ensure that managed care involves the management of quality, to make sure there are appropriate guidelines and implementation of guidelines, and not simply the management of cost. Because I agree with you, if somebody comes into their primary care practitioner and the primary care practitioner is doing a very good job, but has only a very short time to interact with the patient, and has to ask a whole list of questions, it will be difficult to elicit information about mental illness. These are often very personal matters, the patient might be unfortunately ashamed. And you can't just have a list, you know, headaches, blurry vision, are you depressed, are you an alcoholic, any stomach aches, that's not going to be effective. And I think we have to keep our eye on that. Mrs. Lowey. I believe my time is up, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you. I do hope we can continue this dialogue. Because I'm very concerned that it is easier to give a person Prozac, for example, or another drug, and say, well, it's going to take six weeks to kick in, and in the meantime, this young person is really finding their lives grossly interrupted at that time. Dr. Hyman. What we need are health outcomes, what we need to do is have a report card based on actual health outcomes and not on simple process variables that don't necessarily tell us whether the patients are doing well. Mrs. Lowey. Thank you. This is a longer conversation, but I appreciate your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Dr. Hyman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey. Ms. DeLauro. Ms. DeLauro. Good to see you, Dr. Hyman. Dr. Hyman. Good to see you again. treatment of mental illness in children Ms. DeLauro. Let me just follow up a bit with what my colleague Mrs. Lowey was talking about. First, let me just applaud you in terms of your commitment to clinical research. I guess it's page 4 of the testimony that says ``To be sure that we capitalize fully on these priorities, the NIMH attaches high priority to research to translate basic findings into the realm of clinical investigation and application.'' We really do applaud that effort. I too have this real concern and particularly I want to talk about children. You and I have talked about this. Children are being treated for mental health disorders with medication rather than with therapy. Yet clinical trials for medication such as Prozac have not been done on children. Drugs that are highly effective for adults may be harmful, even deadly, if they're given to children. But we just don't know, because children have not been included in clinical trials. What is it that we can do to make sure that the dosages of drugs for children to treat mental health are of help to them and don't wind up harming them? Dr. Hyman. We need to know many things. First of all, we should always recall that having an untreated or under-treated mental disorder is not where we want to be. We want to find the most effective treatments so that children can learn and children can develop normally. And one of the really chilling facts of epidemiology is that we're recognizing that the age of onset of depression, for example, is getting younger and younger in all western countries. We really need, for example, to be able to grapple with this. So what we need to do is expand trials of drug efficacy. First of all, ask the question, does the drug actually work in children. And what are the tradeoffs in terms of toxicity. We have a small number of studies of adults, and none in children, of the long-term effects of drugs such as anti- depressants. Now, again, I want to balance this by saying, there is no, there is little doubt that untreated depression and all of its psychosocial sequelae are a bad thing for a developing brain. But at the same time, we have got to know what the long term treatment with anti-depressants does to the developing brain. We've gotten a bit of good news in the past year, which is that women who, because they had such severe depression, had to remain on anti-depressants during pregnancy, and who have taken the modern serotonin reuptake inhibitor anti-depressants have given birth to children who seem, as we begin to follow them, healthy and without any developmental abnormality. But we mustn't lose our vigilance. So we need trials of efficacy, we need longer term trials. And we need, in order to do this, to work closely with FDA and other agencies to ensure that a whole therapeutic armamentarium is available for children. Ms. DeLauro. We agree that it needs to be done. How are we implementing what we know needs to get done here? Dr. Hyman. We have actually, in collaboration with the National Institute of Child Health and Development, attached pediatric psychopharmacology research centers onto a number of their existing pediatric pharmacologic research centers. In addition, we are going to try to, through program announcements and conferences, interest the field, many of whom have worked on adults, to get involved in these issues of children, and certainly, in developing part of our 1998 budget with Dr. Varmus, this was one of our major areas of emphasis. Ms. DeLauro. To include children? Dr. Hyman. To include children, yes. Ms. DeLauro. Here we are talking about mental illness. But this is true of children across the board. And I would be very, very interested in what you are doing in terms of putting children---- Dr. Varmus. We recently had a workshop on inclusion of children in trials throughout the NIH. It was hosted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. But we'd be happy to provide you with some information from that workshop. Ms. DeLauro. I would like to see that. Because I think it's important what you do, and I also think it's important to deal with this issue on the local levels as well--what the doctors are doing or not doing, and that they are the beneficiaries of this information, or to try to call some attention to this area in an effort to help you, but also to help youngsters in this process. [The information follows:] [Pages 1837 - 1839--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] Mr. Porter. Will the gentlelady yield for just a moment? I want to catch Mrs. Lowey before she leaves, and say to members of the subcommittee, who have expressed some frustration with our schedule, that I feel the same frustration. I have just signed off on a revision of the schedule for next year that will spread the hearings out a little bit more and allow us to spend more time with the institutes and with other agencies and departments under our jurisdiction. I might say that we are attempting toward the end of our hearing schedule this year, to bring back certain of the Institutes that we felt didn't get enough time. And I also just looked at the schedule for next year, which suggested we have Mental Health and Aging in the same morning time frame and said, ``no, no, let's spread them out.'' Because we feel we're shortchanging members and Institutes both in having them so compacted. I thank the gentlelady. Mrs. Lowey. And I thank you. And I do apologize, but as the Chairman knows, I wish I could spend some more time. Thank you very much. brain development and mental illness Ms. DeLauro. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. It really is unfortunate that we don't have the time, but it's truly difficult to be in three places at one time. I don't have to tell you that. But we don't need to give short shrift to anyof the Institutes here. Because we're very much interested in the work. Again, let me just follow up on this children's piece. If you covered this before I came in, I apologize. It is about the issue of mental illness in youngsters. And much of what we know about mental illness comes from the study of adults and these circumstances. How are we working at looking at mental health in children and how children are diagnosed with mental health illness? And if you can make a connection for me, if you will, I mean, we are doing all of this work on the study of the brain, or the development, and so forth, and how is that all being tied in to where we're, so we can see these things earlier than they normally manifest themselves? Dr. Hyman. What you're asking is actually very sophisticated, and it points to the fact that so much of this science has to be interdisciplinary. One of the most exciting conferences that I have attended is a conference that was put on by our basic neuroscience division on brain plasticity in early development. And it brought together a wide variety of scientists, developmental neurobiologists, molecular geneticists, ranging to people who studied the Romanian orphans, to people who study the effects of stress on the brain, and people interested in compensatory education. And we recognized with great humility the difficulty of bringing all of this information together, but also the necessity of starting in a serious way to do this if we are going to derive the information that's very important. So for example, in the mental health arena, we have to discover the genes that create vulnerability to mental disorders, not only because these are potential targets of treatment, not only to make a diagnosis, but also because these genes, which create vulnerability and not the certainty of illness, will permit us to be able to identify what else in development might occur that would be a potentially modifiable environmental second hit, turning vulnerability into disorder. All of these things will require concerted effort on many fronts in the Institute. And then I think bringing people together periodically to recognize where we are and how we have to set priorities in order to make progress. Ms. DeLauro. How far along do you think we are in terms of how much we know about mental illness in children, and how children are diagnosed with mental illness, in your professional judgment? Dr. Hyman. In my professional judgment, it is very early, it is to my mind a national emergency that compared with what we know about adults, what we know about children does not serve children, their development, our educational system, or our work force very well at all. Ms. DeLauro. Until we're able to grasp that, I mean, we have pieces surrounding the process, a Yale child study is trying to deal with the effect of violence in kids. And that's in the realm. But until we get some move along, I noted your words here, it's a national emergency, we need to move on a national emergency that's dealing with youngsters, because there's a whole lot of things that get triggered. Dr. Hyman. It is, but nature has given us a very hard problem. The building of the brain, which is the most complex structure in the known universe, with all due respect to the other institutes---- [Laughter.] Dr. Hyman [continuing]. Is something that is going to require an immense and thoughtful effort. And there's a lot of smoke, frankly. We go between, ``it's all genes'', and ``it's all environment'', and really digging in and making those connections is going to require a long-term investment in the fundamental science of development and plasticity. But the point you're raising, which is so important, is that it cannot be narrow. We have to understand everything from genes to the broad social context if we're to understand how the brain is built and how people become who they are. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Ms. DeLauro. Before I call on Mr. Wicker, I want to explain one other thing. The Chair has been proceeding under these principles, and will continue to do so. Those members who are here at the time the subcommittee is called to order will be part of the initial group and in the question period, we will then start with my questions followed by a minority member, then a majority member, then a minority member and the like, for those who are here at the time we are called to order. For those who come later, we will simply put them into the order of their arrival and call on them in the order of their arrival. And I've also said, and have been following a third rule, that we will give special treatment for ranking members who request it, so that they can come and go and get back to their other subcommittees if their duties require them to do so. I also would say to members that we have been allowing ten minutes for questioning. Today we expected there would only be a few members here, because we don't have votes until 5:00 o'clock, but suddenly there were six or seven. And that's what sometimes causes us to go over. So perhaps the Chair will adjust the time for questioning downward as the necessity may appear, so that we can give a fair amount of time to each of the Institutes or agencies before us for that day. Mr. Wicker. Mr. Wicker. Well, where does that leave me, Mr. Chairman? [Laughter.] Mr. Porter. You're known as one of our most patient members. [Laughter.] Mr. Wicker. I think the Chair may have been suggesting that I was the last member of the subcommittee to arrive. Mr. Porter. I would suggest your arriving right at the beginning, then you know where you are. [Laughter.] relationship of mental illness to other physical illnesses Mr. Wicker. By now Dr. Varmus and the members of the subcommittee have heard me mention several times that my home State of Mississippi has one of the highest rates of death due to heart disease in the Nation. I mention it again today in the context of the National Institute of Mental Health, because I understand that there is some new research concerning a connection between depression and heart disease. The information I have says that depression perhaps carries as grave a risk of heart disease as elevated levels of cholesterol. I wonder if you could elaborate on this research, how significant a connection do you think there is, and where is this research leading as a practical matter? Dr. Hyman. That's a good question, Mr. Wicker. And indeed, Mississippi being a rural State, our research suggests that citizens are less likely to seek treatment fordepression, both because of the lack of services, but also because of often rural traditions of self-sufficiency, and stigma, and shame. So sometimes it's a compounded problem in some of our States. There has been very suggestive data for years about the association between coronary artery disease and depression. The problem with most previous studies is it could not sort out the cause and the effect. It was certainly known that people who had had myocardial infarctions were depressed at very, very high rates. And indeed, they were often untreated using the very poor logic of, well, if you had had a heart attack, wouldn't you be depressed. And the answer may truly be yes, but in fact, all the data suggests that people do much better, and indeed mortality is lower, if you aggressively treat the depression. Now, the new piece of data which is important actually comes from an epidemiologic study initiated by NIMH a few years ago, just simply to look at the incidence of different mental disorders. But because we had this population, it was possible to follow them prospectively. And therefore, everyone with depression could be followed, and one could look at the incidence of heart disease in these people who entered knowing they were depressed but not having heart disease. And it was found that in people who had a history of major depression, there was a four-fold increased risk of heart disease. Now, there were some technical flaws in the study. So it needs replication. But there are some very interesting facts here that can be sorted out. One possibility is that people who are depressed are less likely to adhere to medical regimens such as taking their anti-hypertensives or exercise or weight loss. One factor that was ruled out, however, was smoking. That is, the investigators corrected for smoking. So that's not the villain in this piece. But the other possibility is that the brain disease of depression activates a whole variety of hormonal responses in the body, including the elaboration of stress hormones like cortisol, which affect metabolism and might actually produce atherosclerosis. Many people with depression are often agitated and have higher levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine circulating, which might contribute to hypertension. Therefore, the disease of depression may be an independent risk factor. What we need to know is, first of all, can this be replicated prospectively? Second of all, and most importantly, and the Heart Institute is already involved in something like this, can we intervene? That is, can aggressive treatment of depression actually prevent heart disease, or for people who have had heart attacks, can it decrease mortality? And I'm very optimistic about the possibility of doing those studies and getting valuable results. I would only add that with that information, then, we will have to redouble our efforts to get primary care physicians and physicians in all States and settings to recognize and intervene in depression. Mr. Wicker. Who's carrying on this study? Dr. Hyman. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is proposing a study of intervention right now. We are still following this sample. The investigator who published the most recent prospective data is William Eaton, who's at Johns Hopkins. circadian rhythms and mental illness Mr. Wicker. Okay. Well, that's very encouraging. Tell me what we're doing in the area of research into the relationship between altering sleep patterns and manic depression. Dr. Hyman. That's a very interesting and important area. But lacking a good animal model of manic depressive illness, we have had to do all of this research on human subjects, and therefore, in a non-invasive way. But it is clear that altered sleep, one clear public health factor is that altered sleep patterns, like shift work, should be avoided by people with manic depressive illness, that changes in their daily schedule may actually initiate episodes of mania. In addition, there are some very tantalizing findings that sleep deprivation actually elevates mood. There are other findings that have to do with people who don't have manic depressive illness, but there are clear mood changes depending on the time of day. And I know sort of at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, except for my self-prescribed mega-dose caffeine therapy, I would often start drooping and have some mood changes. We're really beginning to get a handle on this. For this reason, I think it's so exciting that we have almost in hand the first, the key switches in the hypothalamus, which may be controlling our internal clocks, and which may give us better tools to see what's happening, both in people with manic depressive illness, but also in the rest of them. Mr. Wicker. What do you have almost in hand? Dr. Hyman. A gene--I'm sorry, I mentioned it in my opening statement. An NIMH-funded researcher, Joseph Takahashi, at Northwestern University, has over many years narrowed in on a gene that seemed to be the master controller of our normal, free-running daily periods. That is, what gives us our own internal 24 hour cycles. And this is going to lead, I think, to very important information about understanding our circadian rhythms and what goes wrong. I mean, it's important, such genes were actually known, but they were known in the invertebrates. There were two genes, ``per'' and ``timeless'', that were known in flies, for example. But this is the first mammalian gene. And it looks to be the key controller of our 24 hour cycles. eating disorders Mr. Wicker. Okay. One more question. On the first page of your testimony you mention a number of disorders, including anorexia nervosa. I'd be curious to know what we've been able to accomplish there, but also, if you could, give me a little of the history of this disorder. Dr. Hyman. One fact is that from everything we can tell, all eating disorders are increasing in incidence. But this is especially true, not of anorexia nervosa, but of bulimia. And basically, what one has, and this is a particular scourge among high school and college age women. What one has is basically youngsters learning from each other about weight loss techniques and binging and purging. Then what happens in vulnerable people is they find they can't stop, that this takes on a life of its own. And part of this increased incidence really is real, that is, probably there was not this kind of incidence of eating disorders 40 years ago. The question is, would these women have been perfectly well 40 years ago? Here the evidence is rather complex. We find eating disorders often in the same families that have depression and substance abuse. So one possibility is that this is a manifestation of some underlying problem that might have alsomanifested itself as depression and then indeed, many women with bulimia also have depression. Now, there's good news about bulimia, and then I'll get back to anorexia nervosa, which is that we've made a lot of progress in treatment. The combination of modern serotonin reuptake inhibitor anti-depressants, the Prozac-like drugs, that hide those, plus behavioral psychotherapies, really have a marked effect on improving the symptoms and course of bulimia. Anorexia nervosa, I'm sorry to report, remains a difficult to treat and refractory disorder. Fortunately, it is relatively uncommon, but common enough, depending on the severity, affecting between half of 1 percent to perhaps 2 percent of women at some level of severity. But at its highest level---- Mr. Wicker. Almost entirely women? Dr. Hyman. Almost entirely women. More than ten to one women. And there's still perhaps a 10 percent mortality. This is a very severe disorder. Medications that we have provide modest benefits. But there's no medication that is really profoundly successful in a large number of women. The mainstay of treatment is still cognitive and behavioral therapies, including such common sensical things as, you have to achieve a certain weight in order to partake in desired activities. But we have a long way to go in anorexia nervosa. Mr. Wicker. Thank you very much. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Wicker. Dr. Hyman, we have many, many more questions. This is very frustrating not to have sufficient time, and we will simply have to put them in the record in order to give at least some time to Dr. Hodes. I might say that what I have planned to do is to add on at the end of our hearing schedule the three Institutes that previously we felt we didn't have enough time with. And I'm going to ask each member of the subcommittee if they will submit to me an indication of any other Institutes that they would like to invite back as well. Then on another day, we will also have before us for the information of the subcommittee members and Dr. Varmus, NCI, NIDDK, NHLBI, OAR and if we can, Dr. Varmus, yourself, for a panel on the priorities of funding by disease, an issue that has been raised so often by so many members that I think we ought to spend some time and really address that. The three Institutes that we have now that were not given sufficient time are NCI, NHGRI and NIAID. And there may be more. So thank you very much, Dr. Hyman, for the fine job you're doing. We'll have to put our questions in the record. You may be invited back, and thanks for your good statement and answers to the questions that were posed. Dr. Hyman. Thank you very much. Mr. Porter. Thank you, sir. We'll stand in brief recess. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 1846 - 1913--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Tuesday, March 18, 1997. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING WITNESSES RICHARD J. HODES, M.D., DIRECTOR, NIA TERRIE WETLE, PH.D., DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NIA COLLEEN F. BARROS, EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NIA KARYN S. ROSS, FINANCIAL MANAGER, NIA HAROLD VARMUS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NIH DENNIS P. WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES RUTH KIRSCHSTEIN, M.D., DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NIH Introduction of Witnesses Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. I apologize for the time constraints that we've found ourselves under. You may well be invited back. Dr. Hodes, I have to leave at 12:00 o'clock, because I have a speech to make out at American University over the noon hour. And I have asked Mr. Miller if he could take the Chair at that time and finish up the hearing. So I hope that you have time to stay a little bit longer if necessary. Dr. Hodes. Certainly. Mr. Porter. Thank you, sir. Would you introduce the people you have brought with you and then proceed with your statement. Opening Statement Dr. Hodes. I think Mr. Williams from the Department and Dr. Varmus have already been introduced. To my left, Karyn Ross, who's the Financial Manager for the Institute; Dr. Terrie Wetle, the Deputy Director; and Colleen Barros, the Executive Officer of the Institute. The National Institute on Aging supports research on the basic aging process as well as research on a variety of age- related diseases and conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. The overriding goal of all this research is to improve the quality of life for older Americans and their families. alzheimer's disease The NIA leads a national effort in research on Alzheimer's disease, a devastating disease which as you know affects approximately 4 million Americans at present, taking an enormous toll on the patients, their families, caregivers, and the public. Some of the recent discoveries in Alzheimer's disease and the pace of the discovery are typified in the first poster, illustrating some of the findings of underlying genetic relationships to Alzheimer's in the period from 1990 through the present. [See figure 1.] [Page 1917--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] There have been descriptions now of three genes on chromosomes 21, 14 and 1, which are responsible for the familial form of Alzheimer's disease, often of early onset, affecting individuals as early as their 30s, 40s and 50s. The fourth factor, ApoE, a gene on chromosome 19, is associated as a risk factor for the more common form of later onset Alzheimer's disease. This genetic information has already been translated into a number of steps toward application. It has been shown over the past year, for example, that combinations of modern techniques of brain imaging, together with genetic analysis, have suggested the ability to diagnose abnormalities in brain function as many as 20 years before the appearance of symptoms, providing an opportunity to identify disease early, and an opportunity to intervene before irreparable damage has been done to the brain. In addition to these diagnostic issues, we've moved a step toward understanding risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Among the risk factors identified are age and genetics. We've also uncovered over the past year or two more dramatic information about possible protective factors. [See figure 2.] [Page 1919--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] There's been a good deal of scientific as well as press interest in the role of estrogens resulting from recent demonstrations that women who have a history of estrogen use have dramatically lower incidence of Alzheimer's than those who have never used estrogens. In the area of anti-inflammatory agents, a great deal of basic research has suggested that there might be a role forinflammation and immune response in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. And in fact, there has been a good deal of attention paid to the finding that individuals who have a history of using anti- inflammatory agents for diseases such as arthritis have dramatically lower incidence, once again, of Alzheimer's disease. In both of these cases, the epidemiologic and basic science imperatives now converge on the need for direct clinical testing. And in the areas both of estrogen use and anti- inflammatory agents, there are in fact clinical trials underway. In the area of anti-oxidants, there's been a good deal of basic science showing that oxidative damage appears to be a candidate for a part of the mechanism involved in death of neuronal cells. And here once again, trials testing the effect of antioxidants on the progression of Alzheimer's disease are in progress. And in fact, as early as next month, we expect publication of one study which will again emphasize yet another area for hope in the treatment of this disease. biology of aging The basic research supported by the Aging Institute and across NIH tends to find underlying biological processes which are critical to many of the problems and processes of aging. Over this past year, there's been discovery of a number of genes in lower organisms which, when expressed in altered forms, are capable of extending both the health and life span of organisms several fold, providing interesting opportunities for translation into areas of understanding and intervention relevant to humans. Interventions such as caloric restriction provide another interesting phase of scientific advance. Studies showing that restricting animals calorically by 30 percent while maintaining nutrition has dramatic outcomes in reducing incidence of diseases such as cancer, and in fact of prolonging life span by 35 percent and more. Once again, these studies will be the basis for determining whether there are interventions appropriate for human use. The issue of translation of discoveries such as this into practice and application is, as for all Institutes at NIH, a high priority. Cardiovascular disease, for example, remains the major cause of death among older Americans, accounting for nearly 50 percent of deaths of Americans 65 and older. In the past year, there's been identification of stiffening of large and medium size arteries as a potential risk factor for serious cardiovascular events. Taking advantage of information such as this, intervention studies have been carried out with efforts using, in one case recently reported, a diuretic based anti-hypertensive therapy to reduce hypertension association risk with the finding that five years of such treatment has lowered the risk of serious cardiovascular consequences by 34 percent. In fact, that risk reduction in absolute terms was nearly double for diabetics than for non-diabetics. demography of aging Overall, all of these issues take on an imperative with the change in demography of the American, in fact, the world, population. The demographic predictions for the population of the world in the next 50 years are summarized or illustrated in this format. What you can see in 1950 and in 1995, the near- present, is a very familiar sort of pyramid, in which, in lower ages at the bottom, there are the greatest numbers of people living, with a very rapid decrease toward small numbers living to advanced age. [See figure 3.] [Page 1922--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] A dramatic change in that is expected, as you can see illustrated here, for the year 2050, with what is called a squaring of that curve, a great increase in the number of people at advanced ages, and a great increase in the ratio of older to younger individuals, making more imperative our efforts to find solutions to the problems of disability and poor health in older people. The next poster illustrates some of the good news that has again been published of late, with a good deal of attention even in today's press, from a study that will be appearing in the proceedings of the National Academy of Science. This study has followed participants in the National Long Term Care Survey from 1982 through the present. [See figure 4.] [Page 1924--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] What you can see graphed here in the upper line in red is the number of individuals over 65 in the United States who were expected to be disabled if the rates of disability reported in 1982 had not changed. The lower line in blue illustrates the actual observed numbers of Americans with disability observed in 1982 through 1994. The difference between that predicted by unchanged rates from 1982 and those which reflected decreased rates of disability observed over these years amounts to 1.2 million fewer Americans disabled in 1994 than would have been predicted if those rates had not changed. Our challenge and the opportunity for the years to come is to sustain and in fact to accelerate these changes based on increased understanding of the mechanisms which underlie the cause of disability, and the discovery of ways to intervene to alter those risk factors. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to discuss these issues with you. The fiscal year 1998 budget request for the National Institute on Aging is $495,202,000, and I welcome an opportunity to answer any questions you might have. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 1926 - 1932--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] disability research Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Hodes. We note that you gave your entire testimony without a single note, not even a heading or anything like it, which is very, very impressive. Let me ask regarding this chart, since you've got a rising population above 65 but declining rates of disability, are the absolute numbers more or less remaining constant? Dr. Hodes. You can see, or almost see on the scale in that lower curve that the absolute numbers of disabled Americans increased from 6.4 million in 1982 to 7.1 million in 1994. From 1989 to 1994, it's a very small slope, an increase from 7.0 to 7.1 million. It has been projected, and of course, projections become more speculative than recorded fact, that what amounts here to a 1.2 or 1.3 percent decrease in the rate of disability per year over this time period would need to be increased to approximately 1.5 percent to produce a straight line projected into years to come. Mr. Porter. Reading today's Washington Post and the article that resulted from the release, have researchers put forward any predictions about the longer term savings in Medicare, if the trend continues? In other words, they've mentioned substantial savings in one year. What would it amount to into the future? Can we balance the budget on this? Dr. Hodes. These areas remain certainly far too speculative for me to engage and involve a good number of factors, other than projections of disability. It needs to be emphasized how complex such a projection is. That is, there are enormous savings presumably associated with decreases in disability, since disabled persons cost the health care system far more than non-disabled persons. There also are costs to the research and the interventions which are responsible for those changes. Certainly those involved in policy and those involved in balancing the budget and Medicare finances are highly concerned with these issues. Our efforts in terms of generating research such as this are to provide such policy makers with the information which is vital to their projections. Mr. Porter. Can I ask you about the release itself? Was the release done by NIA or was it done by Duke University? Dr. Hodes. There were separate releases from NIA and from Duke, which is fairly typical of the way a lot of such discoveries are handled. The institution that funds the research is always welcome and most often will issue its own press release. In selected instances, NIA and NIH will supplement, complement or cooperate in those releases. In this case there were two. Mr. Porter. And was the timing---- Dr. Hodes. Dr. Varmus reminds me that journals, such as PNAS, will often also highlight specific articles and issue their own releases. So it's not uncommon for there to be multiple releases. Mr. Porter. I'm very happy that the release was made and these questions are not at all critical. But was the timing of the release, did it have anything to do with the timing of your testimony today? Dr. Hodes. If so, it was orchestrated by powers far beyond our own. It's of interest that the release for the publication in PNAS was initially scheduled for the day before the original date of scheduling for our Institute's testimony. Coincidentally, when you altered our schedule, the article's publication was delayed, and so it appeared one day before our current hearings. None of this had anything to do with our intervention, to our knowledge. Mr. Porter. I think that's, whatever caused this timing, I believe that the good news has to come out and be highlighted more than the bad news. This is obviously very, very good news and something that has captured the press's attention and I think will also capture the public's attention. And it's something that I want to very much encourage. Dr. Varmus. I'd like to emphasize, though, we don't really know the explanation for the decreased disability rates. While we think that medical research plays some role, there are many other factors alluded to in Dr. Manton's paper that really contribute, and the relative contributions made by the various components have yet to be sorted out. Mr. Porter. It's funny, you anticipated my next question perfectly. Dr. Hodes. I would add only that the sorting out of those causes is in fact a very high priority in the research that will be forthcoming based upon this finding. alzheimer's disease Mr. Porter. Well, it certainly got Senator Kennedy interested in more money for research. And I think that's all to the good. The news about decreasing disability rates in the aging population is welcome. But is there any similar news with regard to Alzheimer's disease? Will the increasing numbers of older Americans afflicted with Alzheimer's swamp whatever beneficial impact lower disability rates may have on health care expenditures and the quality of life? You partially answered this in your opening remarks. Dr. Hodes. But it's a very important question. The incidence of Alzheimer's disease as noted is very highly age related. In the age range from 65 to 74, the prevalence of Alzheimer's is about 3 percent. By the time it reaches the age group 85 and over, it's been estimated to be as high as 47 percent, that is, nearly half the people 85 and over. The extrapolation of these demographic projections for an increase in the age 85 and over population in the United States over the decades to come, would indeed have staggering consequences if there is not an increased ability to delay, prevent, or treat Alzheimer's disease. And that is a part of the underlying urgency behind that effort. I think there is reason for optimism. There are candidates for effective treatments. There are candidates based on our increased understanding of the basic biology of the disease. But the urgency is clear. demographic research Mr. Porter. Dr. Hodes, some researchers believe that there is a practical limit to age span of about 85 years, while others think typical life spans could extend into the upper 90s. Average life span obviously has major implications for the depletion of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, independent of the health status of the population. Is there anything in demographic research to provide counsel to the Social Security actuaries or are findings on life span too uncertain at present? Dr. Hodes. Clearly, the research area of demography has a great deal to offer to the policy makers in particular. However, in precise answer to your question, the recent publication summarizing efforts at projecting average life expectancy in the American population over decades to come is most notable for the very wide confidence limits. So wide, that the implications for, for example, the expenditures in Medicare and Medicaid leave enormous ranges of uncertainty. And I think one has to concede at times that some of these projections are simply beyond the level of current science to be carried out with fine limits of discrimination. So just as you alluded to in your suspicions, the projections by various equally skilled and expert investigators and agencies are extremely diverse, reflecting uncertainty in those estimates. alzheimer's disease Mr. Porter. Another study reported last week suggested that small, silent strokes may cause much of the memory loss and dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, and that symptoms of Alzheimer's can be prevented by preventing strokes. How should we interpret this finding, that the dementia that is thought to be linked with Alzheimer's is really a consequence of small strokes instead? And this particular study was done with female subjects. Do you expect the results also to be confirmed in male subjects? Dr. Hodes. This was an extremely interesting study that was carried out on a population of nuns, the School Sisters of Notre Dame, a population that has been highly committed to the study who have been followed over years with very detailed analyses of cognitive function and with a commitment to autopsy or post-mortem examination of brains. And the finding, as you note, reported last week, was that there was a dramatic effect of clinically undetectable but pathologically detected strokes which influenced the amount of clinical dementia, of memory loss, that occurred in individuals with Alzheimer's. In fact, the findings of the study showed that these strokes had an effect on cognitive function only in individuals who also had Alzheimer's disease; that is, the population of nuns who did not have pathologic findings of Alzheimer's did not have any changes in cognitive function as a result of the stroke. So that in this population, for the kind of microscopic strokes being detected, it appeared that it was not a confusion of diagnoses, but an effect on the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease of concomitant cerebrovascular disease and stroke. The implication is, of course, that even with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, and even apart from efforts to directly intervene to treat the causes of Alzheimer's itself, there may be room for preventing some of the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's by preventing strokes, by treating hypertension, for example, in those populations at risk. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Hodes. Ms. DeLauro. quality of life Ms. DeLauro. I want to follow up on the question that the Chairman was asking with regard to the article in the Washington Post. That research often, may succeed in reducing Medicare and Medicaid costs, I think it's fair to say that experience to date has been that while research improves the quality of life and life spans, oftentimes new tests and treatments have generally increased rather than decreased medical spending. I just wanted to ask what's different about this research that's going to lead us to expect cost reductions. Dr. Hodes. I think it's an important and very complex question, to which there is not a simple answer. Indeed, there are some interventions which have enormously positive outcomes on the quality of life, on health and on life expectancy which may be costly. There are also, I must hasten to add, others which are not. Last year, for example, I had the opportunity to present to the Committee an example that resulted from several studies carried out by investigators at Yale who were studying interventions for falls, in those individuals at highest risk for falls. And in that study investigators discovered multifaceted interventions which were capable of reducing by 44 percent the incidence of falls in a group at high risk. There was a subsequent follow-up to that study which analyzed the costs, including the costs of carrying out the study and of the intervention itself. That case concluded that there was a net savings, even with those factors accounted for, in the range of $3,000 per patient per year, and a net decrease in all medical costs as a result of that intervention. Clearly, our highest priority is to find interventions that will improve the quality of life and avoid disability and disease. But not to be disregarded is our commitment and responsibility to attempt to identify those which will also be cost effective and cost saving. Ms. DeLauro. Well, I applaud the interventions and where they can lead. But I think in some instances we've looked at where we have increased health care costs for a variety of reasons. I'm hopeful that that doesn't have to be the case, and that we can in fact, with what you and others are doing, to bring those costs down. That's where people can take advantage of what the discoveries are. Dr. Hodes. I apologize for borrowing perhaps an over-used example, but one highlighted frequently was the case of polio, and the high cost of technology for iron lungs, a technology that was not definitive, the comparison of course being the discovery of the cause of that disease and the ability to immunize in a highly cost-effective way. And that is certainly a model to which we aspire for most of those problems which we confront at present. embryo research Ms. DeLauro. This subcommittee has debated the ethical and scientific pros and cons of embryo research in each of the last two years. And I anticipate that we will have that debate and discussion again. I understand that this research may hold particular promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's and in Parkinson's disease. What has been the impact on your research of a complete ban on federally-sponsored research in the use of human embryos? Dr. Hodes. I think that ban has had very little effect on the research areas supported by our Institute. In the areas you mentioned, such as Parkinson's, I think there, and again this has been largely conducted through collaboration, most of the funding is conducted through the Neurology Institute, and sources of tissues and cells other than those restricted by the ban have allowed research to progress. I think it has not been a great cost to the research conducted by the Aging Institute. osteoporosis Ms. DeLauro. Osteoporosis, as you know is a serious problem on the elderly, particularly women. My understanding is that it's likely to become a more serious problem, as today's young people are not eating enough calcium, or taking in enough calcium. Bones stop being able to absorb calcium by age 22. What research on improved osteoporosis treatments is currently underway and how promising are the findings? Dr. Hodes. Well, there are a number of promising interventions that have pointed out the efficacy, as you are probably aware, of increased dietary calcium, of adequate vitamin intake to support both absorption and use of that calcium, and the role of estrogen and estrogen replacement therapy. One recent study just initiated by the Aging Institute is attempting to capitalize on preliminary findings in an animal model which is showing that a unique approach to treating osteoporosis with a drug called minocycline that's related to tetracycline, may provide an additional effect to the drugs currently in use, most of which prevent resorption. Minocycline has shown promise in animal experiments of allowing the actual addition of bone and increased bone strength, in addition to reducing the amount of bone loss that often occurs with aging and after estrogen withdrawal, for example. Therefore I think in summary it's fair to say that we are looking at the level of clinical trials of many of the more established treatments, and in small scale clinical interventions, we are trying to take advantage of basic science research which identifies innovative metabolic approaches to altering the balance of calcium deposition in bone. Ms. DeLauro. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. health care savings Mr. Miller [assuming chair]. Let me follow up with a couple of questions that had been asked earlier, and that is, this Duke study about understanding why we're going to save money. I remember we were saying if you encourage people to smoke more, they'll die earlier, we'll save money on health care. That's obviously a ridiculous statement. With people living longer, we're going to spend more money on their total health care. So how do we save money, just do the arithmetic? Dr. Hodes. Again, excuse me for emphasizing that our primary goal, of course, is the maintenance of quality of life and life without disability. And the concern you mentioned comes next. But it is nevertheless an important one. There are a number of facts that I think surprise individuals at times. There is no doubt that the longer one lives, the longer one is going to need care, including medical care. However, the costs of medical care later in life actually decrease substantially as age proceeds. So the medical care in the final year of life, for example, is much less costly for individuals 90 years old than for 80 or 70 or 60, whichindicates that the prolongation of life does not necessarily mean the extension of high costs to the degree that one might deduce unaware of those figures. Mr. Miller. We're all affected by our own personal stories, and I lost my father-in-law three years ago at age 91, my mother-in-law two years ago at age 87, and my mother's 87 and in a nursing home. When you see the quality of life being so poor, and you start wondering, will I see my mother again on Monday. And she's got a tube in the stomach, she's just going on, it's not a great quality of life. I think she knows me when I visit her, at least I have a feeling she does. She's been like this for a year. Her whole body's wearing out. There's no real diagnosis as such. It's just old age. And as Mr. Porter asked, that's the question, how long before, does old age overcome the diagnosis of a specific disease, not necessarily Alzheimer's, she's not swallowing, that's the reason she had the tube put in. At what stage does, how long can you prolong? Dr. Hodes. The answer to how long we can prolong life is of course not precisely known. I fully sympathize, I think all of us have the same very emotional experiences with loved ones, with family, and the difficulties people incur with aging. Our goal is clearly not, as a result of research, to extend life at any cost and at any quality. It really is to try to extend life of high quality. What is reassuring about studies such as this, showing decreased disability, is as noted in the article, for example, is that the gain is high even for those people of the greatest disability. That is, we're not only decreasing disability for people at the margin, while people at an extreme of disability go unimproved; rather the statistics show that there has been a real improvement in the quality of life measured by decreased disability even in the most disabled population, and even in the oldest of the most disabled population. And I think that's clearly what we all aspire to, not just allowing people to live some months or years longer, but finding a way to do that, such that the most disabling and distressing and anguishing of diseases are reduced and improve the quality of life. Mr. Miller. The percentage of people in institutions, nursing homes or other institutions, has that been declining or does it depend on the statistical measure you use? Dr. Hodes. Yes. There has in fact been a decrease in the numbers of people institutionalized below those expected from previous rates. Some of it may be accounted for by the decrease in disability shown here. Other components of it appear to be accounted for by changes in decisions about institutionalization. This also, of course, clearly relates to quality of life. For many individuals, if there's a way to provide the infrastructure, the research, the mechanism, to allow people to cope in a home setting, or non-institutionalized setting, that is likely to result in a higher quality of life for families and individuals. That as well as the decrease in disability itself are likely contributors to the decrease in institutionalization over the expected levels in recent years. Mr. Miller. My Congressional district in Florida has more senior citizens than any Congressional district in the United States. So I've got my area, Sarasota, Bradenton, has lots of retirees. So it's an area of great interest. But it's also different because people that move to Florida have broken their ties to the north. And there's a higher rate of institutionalization in Minnesota, for example, than in Florida, because people move into mobile home parks and take care of each other. Dr. Hodes. I think you're right, that social and family settings have a great deal to do with these outcomes. falls in the elderly Mr. Miller. Last year, I remember when we were talking with the CDC during their appropriations hearing, they were talking about doing research on falls in the elderly. And I was intrigued by why they were doing it. Do you do that type of study? Dr. Hodes. Yes. I mentioned briefly some of the research conducted on falls, which is still ongoing, is attempting to first identify the causes of falls in older people. That research was highly successful as reflected by the fact that the next stage, designing interventions based on the identification of risk factors, has shown in clinical settings the ability to decrease falls nearly half in individuals at high risk. And to do so with interventions that are highly cost-effective. I think the CDC becomes involved in monitoring the incidence of this disability, or the causes of disability in the population, and being potentially a source for monitoring any changes in clinical outcomes, which might occur as a result of widespread application of the kinds of clinical interventions that have been identified by ongoing research. Mr. Miller. By monitoring, you mean more of a statistical measuring? Dr. Hodes. Yes. Mr. Miller. Because I got the impression it was actually the research on how to prevent falls, and they were talking about using inflatable devices around elderly people for falling. I was just curious why they were doing that research and, not that you oppose that research, it seems more logical to be in your realm. Dr. Hodes. Yes. Research such as the specific one that you mentioned, the use of padded devices to try to prevent fractures at the time of falls, is supported by NIH and by NIA specifically. Once again, as to the degree that those interventions are used in more widespread fashion across the population, a monitoring of their effectiveness might be a part of surveillance by CDC. Ms. Kirschstein. Mr. Miller, the CDC has a Congressional mandate to study injury prevention. Mr. Miller. Right, it's in the injury area. Ms. Kirschstein. Yes. Mr. Miller. And we're hearing this in another area, why is CDC doing it, before they were talking about social work in mental health, and I don't object to what they're doing, it's just, wait a minute, we're having another area doing the same thing, and is there an overlap and duplication. It seems like it's more logical under your area of research than CDC. But that's how they're justifying their program. I don't mean to put you on the spot in that. Thank you very much. Mr. Wicker. prostate cancer Mr. Wicker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, tell me about this new blood test on prostate cancer that could let us know earlier about a possible diagnosis. Dr. Hodes. That's an extremely interesting story. It was reported some years ago, on the basis of research carried out within the intramural program actually at the National Institute on Aging, that sequential measurements of prostate- specific antigen over time could allow diagnosis of prostate cancer several years before it was otherwise identifiable. More recently, a new finding, published and publicized in January, indicated the use of a new test, devised collaboratively again, through the intramural program of the Institute on Aging, together with investigators at Johns Hopkins, that looked at compartments of the PSA or prostate- specific antigen. In fact, it looked at ratios of free to total and reported that using this measurement, it was possible to identify prostate cancer up to 10 years before diagnosis. Now, all of this is in the context of a fair controversy about the role for diagnosing prostate cancer early. Prostate cancer can be aggressive and it can be less aggressive. And in some individuals, its progress is sufficiently slow that it's actually an issue of current medical debate whether it is justified to intervene surgically since at an extreme, the clinical course might be so slow as to never cause a clinical problem. What is going to be published this month in fact, and has just passed its embargo, so I'm comfortable being able to speak about it, is a further elaboration on the study that I think you were referring to in which it is reported most promisingly that use of the ratio of free to total PSA not only allows prediction of prostate cancer, but as reported by these investigators, allows a distinction between what are likely to be aggressive and non-aggressive cases of prostate cancer. It's one finding published in a journal which will await repetition and replication. But if true, it would, I think, be enormously important in decision making on how one uses the diagnostic criteria to make therapeutic decisions. If the more aggressive cases could be identified as those which would most benefit from intervention such as surgery, while cases less likely to be aggressive could be spared the morbidity of that treatment, this would indeed be an important advance. Mr. Wicker. You alluded to a recent controversy. And that surrounds even whether the test should be given at certain ages, is that correct? Dr. Hodes. I think that's correct. And it derives from the controversy of what one should do with the finding. The argument would follow that if indeed a positive finding on this test, meaning a likely diagnosis of prostate cancer, had no clear therapeutic implications, because one simply didn't know whether to treat or not, some would argue it's questionable whether the test should even be done. That's clearly a complex question, and there is not a unanimous opinion. But I think that's the essence of the current controversy. alzheimer's disease and ibuprofen Mr. Wicker. But it is interesting that a scientist would suggest that we could know too much too early. It strikes me, as a layman, as being quite interesting. Well, let's see. You mentioned on Alzheimer's disease a cooperative study about prevention and treatment, and you mentioned a bunch of combinations, selegilene, vitamin E, prednisone, estrogen therapy perhaps. What are we learning about the relationship between Alzheimer's and ibuprofen? Where does that come in? Dr. Hodes. On the basis of suggestions that anti- inflammatory agents might have a protective role on development of Alzheimer's, a study was carried out in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, part of the intramural program of the NIA. In this study, there were individuals who were followed with examinations every two years for extended periods of time, up to decades. It was possible to do a retrospective analysis looking at the history of people over 15 years and ask whether they did or did not have a history of use of anti- inflammatories, ibuprofen being one of them. And asking in turn whether there was a relationship between this history and the likelihood or risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. And it was found that individuals who had taken ibuprofen had approximately 50 percent the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's as those who did not. Even more striking for those who had been taking ibuprofen for two years or more, there was a 60 percent reduction in the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's. I have to emphasize that this is an observational study. It is strongly suggestive, but will not take the place of a direct treatment study in which individuals are for example, randomized in such a way that they are taking a pill and are unaware whether that pill is ibuprofen or a drug or a placebo which is being compared. That is the form of study which is most able to, with certainty, predict the utility of the therapeutic intervention. And it is likely now, based on the study that I mentioned and that you asked about, that such intervention studies will be proposed and supported in the very near future. Mr. Wicker. How far away is your agency from issuing a report saying, it's a good idea to take some of these drugs? Dr. Hodes. The time frame for a study, a demonstrated efficacy, is of course dependent upon the disease. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, which is a slowly but unfortunately progressively debilitating disease, there is a period of follow-up likely to be in the range of a minimum of two years that one will have to observe to see if a population is altered in the course of its disease. If one is looking to prevent disease, and if one begins with a population that doesn't have Alzheimer's and waits for a number of those, even if one selects a high-risk population, to develop disease, to see whether treatment A or treatment B makes a difference, one is likely to be talking about follow- ups of at least five years and perhaps more. That is, for a study initiated today, even if all the patients immediately began taking the drugs of comparison today, there is likely to be a lag of this many years before, with certainty, a recommendation could be made. Now, some of the studies that I've mentioned to you, one involving prednisone and one involving estrogen, are underway, and the results of those studies are likely to be reported within the next one to two years. The more extensive, larger studies based on some of these new candidates will have a lag time that is therefore proportionately longer. Mr. Wicker. Are these studies with prednisone and estrogen among so-called high-risk populations? Dr. Hodes. The ongoing studies at present for estrogen and with prednisone are in individuals who already have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. These studies are looking to see whether the progression of disease is altered or slowed by treatment. The second generation of studies, that of actual prevention by finding people at a high risk for disease although they have no disease, is the generation of studies that we are just embarking on now. The candidates for such interventions will frequently come from the first set of studies. So when one has a drug which seems to slow the progression of disease, a natural next generation of study will be to say if that intervention is moved to an earlier point in time, when detectable clinical damage has not occurred, to ask whether that same intervention will actually prevent the development of disease which is of course the most hoped-for objective of such intervention. Mr. Wicker. Who are high-risk people? Dr. Hodes. The most clear-cut answer for high risk, as I've indicated, is, for example, if one chooses a population that's at age 85. I've also mentioned some of the genetic risk factors. One could pick individuals with a given Apo-E type, which I must add is not a guarantee or an absolute predictor of disease, to identify an even higher risk population. I'd mentioned that modern techniques of brain imaging can identify abnormalities in individuals years before the detection of symptoms. The screening of individuals by such a technique in principle, though an expensive approach, could identify individuals at high risk to develop clinical disease, though not having the disease at present. Currently, investigators are looking individually and in combination at such identifiers as age, genetic risk factors, brain imaging techniques, which collectively may be able to identify populations at a high risk which would be appropriate candidates for intervention. genetic research Mr. Wicker. And finally, let me just ask you what the Institute is doing with regard to attacking age-related diseases by manipulating or mutating genes? And I wonder if you could comment on some of the ethical questions which might arise in that connection. Dr. Hodes. Well, the approach to manipulating genes is being carried out extensively in animal models. In a number of them, mutations are identifiable which will have substantial effects on life span prolongation and on health span prolongation. Our principal goal in these studies is to identify biologic processes altered by the genetic manipulations which will give clues to interventions in humans that will not necessarily necessitate genetic interventions. The genetic interventions, as has been often discussed, carry scientific, medical and ethical complications that in the near future are probably going to be prohibitive. But that doesn't diminish the value of using genetic studies in animal models to pinpoint the biologic processes, the biochemistry that may be modifiable by other than genetic manipulation in humans, and therefore, the genetic studies may be quite valid and important in suggesting interventions appropriate to humans. Mr. Wicker. I don't understand what you mean. What would be an example of that? Dr. Hodes. Well, an example would be taking a gene from one of the familial forms of Alzheimer's disease, a mutation associated with Alzheimer's, and introducing that into a mouse, as has been done over the last year or two, making a transgenic mouse that expresses an abnormal human gene associated in certain families with early onset Alzheimer's. It's been observed that such animals develop lesions in the brain that look like Alzheimer's, and as they grow older, in the case of mice, this means by nine months of age or older, they develop abnormalities in learning that appear to be at least broadly defined analogous to what one sees in Alzheimer's. Now that one has gone this far, finding out the error in a gene, one can in an animal model look for ways to reverse it. For example, introducing an enzyme that will do the job that the mutated gene product in the affected patients can't do, thus eliminating the toxic material that might play a role in Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Wicker. Thank you. long-term care Mrs. Northup [assuming chair]. Thank you. Doctor, I have just a couple of questions. Have you all done any research that looks at nursing facilities and the possibility that they have individualized, or whether or not they do have individualized or intensive therapies? Considering as you look at the aging process there are a number of different reasons and ways people wind up in nursing homes, how intensive or individualized are the therapies and how much difference does that make? Dr. Hodes. It's a very important question that is being pursued by an active research program supported by the Aging Institute. There is a serious look at so-called special care units, for example, which may be tailored to the special needs of individuals with dementia, or individuals with HIVinfection in another domain. The interest and importance here is both to find out how these special care units address the special needs of the individuals in those units and how in turn that impacts on the function of the remaining patients in a nursing facility. So, for example, the questions being asked at present, are how special care units are defined across the country, how many of them there are, and then to look, most importantly, at practices and how those practices affect the quality of life of patients, of family and of staff, which ultimately will be of importance as well. And there appear to be suggestions in at least some of these studies that there are advantages to individuals, again to cite the example of dementia, for care in a special care unit. And there are also secondary gains to the patients in the rest of the institution who are better cared for when their standard can be separated and distinguished from the standards that need to be applied to those in special care units. Mrs. Northup. But that's not widespread today, I suppose, that there are those opportunities for families who have a parent, for example. Dr. Hodes. The numbers, in fact, are increasing significantly and quite rapidly over time. And a part of the intent of the studies is to monitor these changes as they occur. So I think you're correct that this is still at an early stage. But it is a practice which is expanding quite rapidly. predictive testing Mrs. Northup. One other question, and actually, you may have touched on this, I had to step out for just a minute. What are the dangers and what do you do about it, and I know that Alzheimer's is not the only area where we're beginning to be able to do predictive testing. You do a test on me and you tell me, hey, you are high risk for Alzheimer's. We obviously know there are the financial questions. What does that do to my insurance? But what are we doing in terms of the emotional and psychological effect of that sort of predictive testing, especially because that clearly has to forerun any sort of therapy to try to offset that? Dr. Hodes. You've asked an enormously important question, and you've touched on some of the important considerations, those related to health insurance, the finances, and in addition perhaps the most central one, the emotional impact. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, the circumstances are particularly complex. For a small proportion of the cases, the so-called familial Alzheimer's disease, for which at least three genes have been identified, the diagnosis in that genotype, of identifying an altered gene, has a very high, nearly 100 percent, predictive value that that individual will develop Alzheimer's. In that sense, it's equivalent to cystic fibrosis or some of the other defined genetic diseases. That needs to be separated, and I think it is not so well separated in the minds of, unfortunately, all of the public from the cases--where probably 95 percent of Alzheimer's at present, where, although we may be aware of a risk factor such as Apo-E 4, this by no means predicts disease with certainty. So we have an added level of complexity in having to interpret for individuals what the outcomes of these tests might be. This is all superimposed on a situation in which at present there are no definitive or preventive interventions. All of the circumstances will hopefully of course be altered in the future if or as we develop interventions. In the meantime, recommendations of panels which we ask to revisit this repeatedly, panels consisting of scientists, and of ethicists as well, have been to suggest that genetic testing for Alzheimer's be carried out only in either experimental settings where communications or results may be anonymous, that is, individuals may not know the results of their tests, or carried out as an adjunct, in individuals that already have the diagnosis of dementia. And here, I have to say there's a difference of opinion among experts, both ethicists and scientists, who would allow in that situation the possibility that if you have a diagnosis of dementia, the question of whether it is Alzheimer's or not might be assisted by the use of this genetic test, in association with other tests, there is discussion of whether that is an appropriate means. But there is widespread agreement that genetic testing at a population level to find out whether you've got a higher or lesser predisposition based on genetic statistical assessment at this point is simply unwarranted and rather unanimous recommendations are against such testing at present. Mrs. Northup. Thank you, Doctor, and members of the panel. We are recessed until 2:00 o'clock today. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 1946 - 2000--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Tuesday, March 18, 1997. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE WITNESSES DR. ZACH W. HALL, PH.D., DIRECTOR DR. AUDREY S. PENN, M.D., DEPUTY DIRECTOR RICHARD L. SHERBERT, JR., EXECUTIVE OFFICER ANDREW C. BALDUS, BUDGET OFFICER DR. HAROLD VARMUS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NIH DENNIS P. WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DHHS Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. Let me apologize to you for the delay. I was out at American University making a speech on human rights in Hong Kong. I apologize. There just aren't enough hours in the day some days. This afternoon we're pleased to welcome Doctor Zach Hall, the Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Before you give your testimony, would you introduce the people whom you've brought with you, and then please proceed with your statement. Introduction of Witnesses Dr. Hall. Yes. This is Dr. Audrey Penn, on my right, who is the Deputy Director of our Institute, on my far left is Mr. Richard Sherbert, who is the Executive Officer of our Institute, Mr. Andy Baldus, who is the Budget Officer for the Institute, and we have at the end of the table Mr. Williams from the Department, and Dr. Varmus, whom I assume is a fixture at this table. Opening Statement Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before this committee. These appearances are a real pleasure for me because we are in an era of unprecedented progress in research on the brain and its diseases, and I appreciate the opportunity to share with you some of the important advances of the last year. As you may know, this is Brain Awareness Week. I was, this morning, at a symposium at the NIH that is being held in connection with Brain Awareness Week and heard several exciting talks on recent progress in Alzheimer's disease and in epilepsy. This afternoon there will be talks on addiction, on development of the brain, on mental illness, and on learning and memory. The symposium, which is reporting the latest findings from some of our most distinguished and promising scientists, is sponsored by 12 Institutes at the NIH working together to promote and support research on the brain. We work together in a number of areas of mutual interest that include Alzheimer's disease, sleep, pain research, autism, and neurological aspects of AIDS. Our own Institute, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has responsibility for more than 600 neurological disorders. These include a number of well-known disorders that affect millions of Americans--stroke, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy--as well as a number of less well-known diseases and disorders that affect maybe a few hundred people. These include such things as ataxia- telangiectasia, Friedreich's ataxia, and Batten disease-- diseases which, although they affect only a few people, are nevertheless devastating to those who have them and to their families. Our research brings new hope to those suffering from neurological disorders. As you know, in the past we've had little to offer those suffering from brain disease. When I was in medical school and first became interested in neurological disease, I was told by my advisors that if I was interested in the intellectual challenge of diagnosis, I should go into neurology, but that if I wanted to make people well, I should find something else. Fortunately, that chilling judgment is changing as we understand more and as we begin to find new treatments. Today, I want to tell you about our progress in three important disease areas: stroke, Parkinson's disease and developmental disorders. Stroke is a major health problem in the United States; 500,000 Americans have a stroke each year, of whom approximately one-third die. The total number of those who have suffered a stroke in our society is currently estimated to be 4 million people. Many of these have significant disabilities and must receive care. The estimated cost to the Nation is $40 billion per year for stroke. Last year at this time I reported to you that the NINDS, working with investigators and hospitals and medical institutions across the country and with the private sector, had organized a clinical trial showing the first effective treatment for stroke. The trial found that prompt administration of a so-called clot-buster--tPA--to those with the most common form of stroke gave a 30 percent increase in the chance for full recovery. One might think that such a dramatic result would lead immediately to widespread use of this treatment across the country. But, in fact, there is a fundamental problem. Treatment with tPA is most effective when it is given within three hours after the symptoms first appear. Beyond that time, there is an increased risk to the patient which, at least with present information, makes its use unacceptable. In order to get people to the hospital and give them tPA within three hours stroke must be treated as an emergency. Since there has been previously no effective treatment for stroke, this requires a massive change in attitude on the part of patients and their families, on the part of physicians, on the part of emergency room personnel, and on the part of hospitals. Last December, our Institute convened a major symposium that brought together all of those concerned with acute care for stroke--doctors, nurses, paramedics, as well as hospital and patient representatives. The purpose of the symposium was to provide guidelines for health care providers implementing acute stroke therapy in a variety of medical settings across the country, from small rural hospitals, to suburban hospitals, to large urban hospitals, to those in academic medical centers, each with different problems. Our Institute continues to take a leading role in coordinatingpatient and professional organizations in the vast educational effort that will be required to realize the benefit of this important research. Let me make another point about these findings. We hear much these days about the high cost of modern technology in medicine. tPA, in fact, is one of the products of modern technology, since it is made by recombinant DNA technology, and its use adds to the immediate cost of stroke treatment. And yet, this investment pays off. A recent follow-up study on the patients in the NINDS clinical trial showed that tPA use results in dramatic long-term savings. Those treated with tPA stay in the hospital for a shorter period of time, and more are discharged to their own homes rather than going to nursing homes or to rehabilitation centers. When this is extrapolated to make an estimate, the best figures are that tPA use will save $4 to $5 million for every 1,000 patients treated. So not only does its use then bring significant health benefit to the patient, but also results in a substantial cost-saving. Let me now turn to Parkinson's disease, where we have dramatic recent progress of another kind to report. In 1995 our Institute and three others sponsored a workshop whose purpose was to identify new directions of research for this terrible disease. A major conclusion of that workshop was that Parkinson's disease was likely to have a larger genetic component than had been appreciated. In response to that suggestion and insight, NINDS initiated a collaborative project with the National Human Genome Research Institute and with a group of extramural researchers. Within a year after that project was initiated, we had important and dramatic results to report. In an issue of the journal, Science, published last November, we reported that in a single large family Parkinson's disease was found to result from an alteration in a small region of chromosome 4. Research continues with the effort to identify the gene involved and to determine if it is important in other families. But the significance of this is that one of the major tools of modern biomedical research, molecular genetics, can now be brought to bear on the problems of Parkinson's disease. We hope that identification of the gene involved, even if it doesn't affect a large number of patients, may offer us key insights into understanding why nerve cells die in Parkinson's disease, a question about which we presently have really no idea. Let me finally turn to developmental disorders of the brain. As you know, over the last several years, scientists have made tremendous progress in identifying genes for a number of developmental disorders, including spinal cerebellar ataxias, ataxia-telangiectasia, Batten disease, and others. You're familiar with many of these findings, as I and my colleagues have reported them to you year after year. These disorders make it very clear that genetic factors play a critical role in brain development. But I'd like to make the opposite point today, and to emphasize the critical role of experience in brain development. Much recent research emphasizes what we already intuitively know; that is, we are not simply the product of our genes, but that our early experience shapes in important ways how our brains become wired up and how we use them. We have become increasingly aware that even our adult brains have a surprising capacity for reorganization. This was illustrated in a very dramatic way by a recent research finding in our Institute that showed that when blind people read braille, they use a part of the cerebral cortex, in the back, that normally responds only to visual stimuli and not at all to touch. So this part of the cortex then has been at least functionally rewired to be used in the service of braille reading. The capacity for functional reorganization, as we know, is particularly well developed in children. A dramatic illustration of this is the astonishing recovery of children who have had large parts of their brain removed for intractable epilepsy. One would predict in many cases devastating consequences, but they show, again, a remarkable ability to reorganize and use the parts of the brain that they have remaining for their normal learning and development and to carry out functional tasks. Research at our Institute and others is revealing more about how early experience shapes the normal brain. We are also learning that in some cases the developing brain establishes maladaptive patterns of learning that lead, or can lead, to learning disabilities in children. Our Institute recently sponsored, in collaboration with the Office of Rare Disease Research, a workshop on neuroplasticity in rare developmental disorders. One of the things we heard at that workshop was that many of the children that have ``learning disabilities'' are perfectly capable of learning, and that by altering their experience in controlled ways we can help them achieve significantly improved performance. The conceptual basis for this discovery, which is now being explored clinically, grew out of fundamental research on the ability of the cortex to reorganize following a section of the nerves in animals. This combination of basic and clinical research is what makes brain research in this era such an exciting one and gives it such promise for future progress. Mr. Chairman, the funding year 1998 budget request for NINDS is $722,712,000. I am pleased to answer any questions that you might have. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 2005 - 2009--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] diseases of aging Mr. Porter. Thank you, Doctor Hall. I have a question for Doctor Varmus, and I think I know the answer but I want to make sure. We just had the National Institute on Aging here and Doctor Hodes and we talked about stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Does NIA have the lead on any disease, or are those always in other Institutes and NIA simply relates them to aging? Dr. Varmus. There is coordination of Alzheimer's research, but the National Institute on Aging has the lead for Alzheimer's. Mr. Porter. Say again. Dr. Varmus. The National Institute on Aging has the lead for Alzheimer's. Mr. Porter. Okay. Dr. Hall. I should say also several other Institutes do carry out research in Alzheimer's disease. Our own particular portfolio is very biologically based. One of the important things that Richard Hodes did, actually, was to establish a working group on Alzheimer's among those Institutes that are concerned with it. The directors have gotten involved in this as well, and we have met several times. It has been extremely useful in exchanging expertise and being sure that our portfolios are well-coordinated. We often have overlapping interest and the current mood, I would say, among those Institutes is that that's perfectly all right and that we will cooperate in those areas where we do have overlapping interest. We also have, each of us, areas in which we are distinctively interested. administering tpa for stroke Mr. Porter. Absolutely. I understood that. I just wondered whether NIA had the lead or whether you had the lead. Is it possible to administer tPA on site or in the ambulance, or do you have to administer it in the hospital? Dr. Hall. Let me address that, because that's a very important question. tPA, as you know, is a clot-buster, so while it breaks up clots, it also makes coagulation more difficult. There are two kinds of stroke--ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes. Let me simply remind you that stroke results from an interruption in the blood supply to the brain. That can come about in two ways. If you block the arteries or some part of the circulation in the brain, you get what's called ischemic stroke; if small blood vessels break, then you get a hemorrhage and that also effectively stops the circulation in that area and the cells are without oxygen and without nutrient. tPA has the capacity to benefit and to help those with ischemic stroke, but it is dangerous for those with hemorrhagic stroke and you certainly do not want to give it to those patients. About 80 percent of stroke patients have ischemic stroke, and that is the most important thing to be found out. You do that with a CT scanner. So any hospital that has a CT scanner can give acute stroke treatment.But it would be very dangerous to give tPA in the absence of knowing whether it is ischemic or hemorrhagic. And so part of marshalling the efforts to bring about acute stroke treatment involves the mechanics of getting somebody to the hospital, first of all making sure that they do have the symptoms for stroke, because many patients report or think they're having a stroke and it turns out after a few questions you find out quickly that they do not, so that first screen is done, and then arrangements are made to get a CT scan very quickly. In large crowded hospitals, that means they go to the head of the line, and there's a protocol for that. There also has to be an arrangement that once the scan is obtained it needs to be read immediately, and that often is a time block by the time you can find somebody who has the time and can drop what they're doing to read it, and so you have to have an emergency protocol for that. And then also the pharmacist needs to be alerted in advance so that the tPA is there ready to be given when it's decided that it is appropriate. So all of these things have to be coordinated to get the tPA to the patient within that three hour time window. Of course, the worst thing of all would be to give a patient with hemorrhagic stroke a tPA. And so for that reason, everything waits on the CT scan. future of brain research Mr. Porter. At a FASEB conference last week, Doctor Arthur Kornberg of Stanford predicted that ``following the decade of the 1990s in which science has been dominated by gene hunters, the next decade will be ruled by head hunters who study the functions of the brain.'' Do you share the view that brain research will be the next science frontier conquered? Dr. Hall. Without doubt. I'm actually pleased to hear Doctor Kornberg say that. I did my post-doctoral fellowship years ago in his department at Stanford. I had at that time already committed to the nervous system, and maybe, I'd like to think, perhaps some of my enthusiasm rubbed off on him. But, at any rate, I very much agree with that. There are several reasons for saying that. I think one of them is that the brain is the most complex organ that we have. It's the highest product of human evolution, if you will. It is incredibly complicated. When I began my career there were many who thought it was too complicated to get serious answers; you could not do experiments that gave you hard answers if you worked on the brain. And as the methodology has developed and as techniques have improved, I think what has now happened is that our tools and our technology are now up to working on these very complicated problems. And that is reflected I think, by the flood of people who are now coming into brain research. One of those tools certainly is genetics. It is estimated that a third of all genetic diseases have neurological consequences. Of the large number of diseases that I mentioned for which our Institute is responsible, a significant number of those are genetic diseases. And by identifying the gene, one gets a powerful clue to what may be going on with the disease. We've seen this in ALS with the identification of a superoxide dismutase, the enzyme responsible for at least a portion of those with familial ALS. It gives us an important clue that oxidative reactions are probably important in the neuropathology of the neurons that die in ALS. Imaging is another important tool that has really revolutionized what we do. It gives us literally a new view of the brain. The fact that one can look at the human brain in a non-invasive way is truly remarkable. As you know from some of the testimony by my colleagues, one can see the effects of drugs on the brain in this way; one can even ask people to think of particular things and see what areas of the brain light up. So many of the most subtle and complex things that the brain does, things that involve intention, or things that involve, even in a recent study, one's gut feelings about something, now can be addressed in a biological sense. One can actually ask what parts of the brain are involved in making these decisions, are there cells that we can find that are actually responsible for carrying out these tasks. So in that sense, we are able to address more and more complex problems. I think the future is bright and important for brain research. ninds budget increase Mr. Porter. My next question begins with the words ``in the aftermath of Christopher Reeves' spinal cord injury.'' But before I ask that, there was a great deal made at the time of the injury to Christopher Reeves, a public figure, an actor and entertainer, and he even appeared at the Democratic National Convention to talk about the importance of spinal cord injury research. Your budget has a 3 percent increase in it. Do you think that reflects the priority that we ought to have for spinal cord injuries and other neurological disorders? Dr. Hall. Maybe we should check afterwards on the budget figures. Those are not the figures I have, but I may be wrong about that. Mr. Porter. No, I'm talking about overall increase for your Institute. Dr. Hall. Oh, sorry, for our Institute. I thought you meant for spinal cord. Mr. Porter. No, I only have it by Institute. But we can ask that, too. [Laughter.] Dr. Hall. That's fine. I think we have a number of opportunities in research on diseases of the brain. I would be happy to talk to you about the particular opportunities in spinal cord research which are important. But in many, many areas we have opportunities to make important advances. The rate at which those advances are made depends on our budget. I'm here to defend the President's budget, the 2.5 percent increase, or approximately that, and we are pleased with that increase. We would, of course, do more---- Mr. Porter. Why are you pleased with that increase? Dr. Hall. Well, I'm pleased that it's not a decrease in these Washington days. spinal cord injury research Mr. Porter. Let's talk about spinal cord injury research. Dr. Hall. Let's do. [Laughter.] Mr. Porter. What's the baseline level of effort in spinal cord injury research, and how much of an increase did you make in that in 1996 and what do you project for 1997? Dr. Hall. Yes. Our figures for 1996 were approximately $47 million, and our estimated figure for 1997 is approximately $50 million. And it was those that I was looking at when I spoke before. [Clerk's note.--Later provided, ``the 1995 baseline was $39 million.''] Spinal cord injury presents a tremendous problem for us in that it seems like almost an impossible task. There are literally millions of nerve fibers that go out from the brain to connect with the circuits in the spinal cordthat control the muscles that allow us to move and that convey our sensations from our body back to the brain where they can be used. In spinal cord injury, these connections are damaged or in some cases broken. And the idea of trying to attempt that rewiring seems almost a Herculean task. But we are helped by the fact that even a small amount of regrowth and regeneration can often restore significant function. And for those who have spinal cord injury, even a small restoration of function can mean an important improvement in the quality of life. The ability, for example, simply to grasp a glass or grasp a pen or to use one's hands and fingers, even if not doing fine movements, can add immeasurably to what one is able to do and to one's independence. We are finding that there are ways in which we can improve that regeneration. We just heard on Monday at the NIH a visiting scientist from Switzerland who has found that the white matter, the myelin that coats our nerves, actually contains a substance that inhibits nerve growth. And the purpose of this normally is to, we think, confine the growth in the nervous system to those areas in which it is important for adaptation. If you remove that inhibition in his case, he's done it experimentally with antibodies, but there are other ways to do this--then one can obtain much more regeneration, and often in an appropriate way so that one can get partial restoration of function, more than one would have believed. And in experiments done in collaboration with scientists in the United States, there has really been some remarkable progress made in showing functional restoration. The other half of it is we are finding more and more about those molecules that can stimulate regrowth. These are growth factors. They occur in minute amounts. We know some of them, we don't know all of them. There's been a great deal of active research recently in trying to identify them. I think last year at this time I spoke about the identification of one, a factor called netrin that had been hypothesized for years but has finally been identified. And so, in a sense, with this combination of an attractant and removing the inhibitor, taking off the brake and putting on the gas, if you will, it is possible to get some regrowth. There are a number of other problems that we're interested in and making progress on. One of the things that happens when you damage a piece of nerve cord is that the glia that are responsible for making the wrapping of the long fibers, that essentially insulate the fibers that run up and down the cord, die. Recent research shows that some of those die in a delayed fashion as a result of a process called apoptosis; that is, they in essence commit suicide. We are very interested in understanding the factors that regulate this suicide program in those cells with the idea that if they can be saved, then they can help remyelinate the regenerating cord after that. So in spite of the fact that this is a tremendous problem, we are making some limited progress. I don't think anybody thinks it will be easy. And we are unlikely to be able to completely regenerate a cord within any time span that we see. But the important point is that we don't necessarily have to do that. And so we are continuing this research. The other area that we have been investigating are acute treatments that limit the damage after injury. Our trial several years ago on the use of methylprednisolone, for example, has been responsible for limiting the injury to a large number of patients in this area. So we see a number of opportunities. As you may know, our Institute allocates its funds through the competitive peer review process and, by long-standing agreement with our Advisory Council, the first 80 percent of our funds is spent strictly according to priority reflecting scientific excellence and opportunity. So we are pleased to see that this area is developing and that grants in this area are developing as well. Mr. Porter. Can you say that again, the first 80 percent of your funds are? Dr. Hall. Yes. The first 80 percent of our funds are given, by agreement with our Council, strictly according to the percentile score as judged by---- Mr. Porter. What about the other 20 percent? Dr. Hall. The other 20 percent we can award out of order, and we do that on the basis of several criteria which include so-called creativity/originality, applications that perhaps didn't score as high as they might but that have unusually creative aspects to them that would bring something genuinely new to a field; areas of particular interest that we think might have been overlooked or are particularly promising; we look to support young investigators, and we also in some cases have an ongoing established group that has been active, we expect them to continue to be productive, but for one reason or another they've fallen below the line, and we feel there may be an investment to be lost, sometimes it's animals or sometimes it's personnel, if they were to have a lapse in funding. Mr. Porter. Looking at spinal cord injury, whether it's before or after Christopher Reeve was injured, research in this area is just as important in any case. Dr. Hall. Yes. Mr. Porter. But the President of the United States seemed to respond to that particular injury and the public interest in spinal cord injury after Christopher Reeve was injured. How do you respond to the commitments the President has made in these areas and still adhere to your principles of not earmarking funds for particular diseases? Dr. Hall. Do you want to answer that? Doctor Varmus---- Dr. Varmus. The two of us worked together in an attempt to stimulate the field. Doctor Hall arranged a workshop that made it clear that we have special interest in this area, and that did bring a lot of people together and stimulated grant applications that met the review criteria. Do you want to speak specifically about the grants that have been supported? Dr. Hall. Sure. Yes, we've supported a number of grants that look at the factors that influence cell death in these spinal cord---- Mr. Porter. Let me interrupt you, Dr. Hall. I understand, but did that have anything to do with Christopher Reeve being injured or the President's commitments? Dr. Hall. Yes. Mr. Porter. It did? Dr. Hall. Yes, it did. Mr. Porter. Would you have done this anyway, or did you only do this because the President indicated this was something he wanted to talk about? Dr. Varmus. It was a combination. I think it was a fortunate collision of an interest in doing something in response to public interest in this condition, but there have been a series of developments in the study of nerve regrowth-- particularly the study in the rat model that Dr. Hall mentioned--has provoked a great deal of interest in the opportunities for regeneration of nerves in the spinal cord, in particular. Some of the money that was used for meeting the President's commitment was from my Director's Discretionary Fund, and some was generated by the use of my 1 percent transfer authority. So a number of things were cobbled together to meet the President's commitment. Mr. Porter. Again, I don't at all question the importance of spinal cord injury research, but I think that political earmarking for diseases is reprehensible whether it's done by the Congress or by the Administration. It seems to me that we've got to be very careful that we aren't responding to the particular topical events of the news, but rather are seeking the best science. You're telling me you're seeking the best science, and that's certainly good enough for me, but, on the other hand, I worry that we could get to a position where we will be directing most of what you do because Members of Congress are interested or the President is interested. That's not what we ought to be about, it seems to me. We talked about this a great deal. I just wanted to see what your answer would be in respect to this particular circumstance. The Department of Defense and the VA are both major players in spinal cord injury research as well, are they not? Dr. Hall. Yes. Mr. Porter. Who is doing the largest amount of research in this area? Dr. Hall. I don't have the figures for spending in those areas. We could certainly get them for you. I do know that when we gave our workshop we certainly let representatives of those organizations know and they were in attendance. But I don't have the figures. Mr. Porter. Can you provide those for the record, Doctor Hall? Dr. Hall. We can provide them. [The information follows:] SPINAL CORD RESEARCH ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal Year Agency ----------------------------------------------- 1995 actual 1996 actual 1997 estimate ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Department of Defense........................................... $12,000,000 $4,200,000 $5,850,000 Veterans Affairs................................................ 6,000,000 6,500,000 7,200,000 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Porter. As you indicated, another approach to spinal cord injury was tested last year when researchers formed bridges across severed spinal cords in rats with multiple fine nerves. In conjunction with growth factor, the procedure allowed certain limited recovery of function. In the short term, do these reconstructive therapies hold greater promise than studying cellular processes? Dr. Hall. Well, those procedures arise, in part, from the study of cellular processes. It is actually precisely that study that I was referring to before, because one of the key features in that study was to provide bridges across the cord, the brain is on my left, you have the spinal cord here, you have an injury, and what you want to do is then make bridges from this side to the other. The point was to lead those bridges into the gray matter and to avoid the white matter. That was done for the specific reason that cellular work had led to the realization that there was an inhibitor substance in white matter that would prevent regeneration. And so the combination of having bridges that would be hospitable for growth, providing an extrinsic growth factor, and avoiding the white matter in the construction of these were all key features. So it's not an either/or situation. Those arise out of, those represent the application of insights that have come from cellular and molecular work to this complex clinical situation, if you will, involving an animal. I think the conditions under which those were done, very carefully controlled for the purposes of the experiment, of course there was a nice clean break made and so forth, are rarely the conditions that you see in spinal cord injury in the clinic. So they cannot be simply transported wholesale from the experimental situation to the real life situation. But by telling us what factors are important and by validating, if you will, these insights from cellular and molecular studies at the tissue level, these then provide the basis for future study and I think are an important foundation for research that is now going on. An important aspect of those experiments, I might add, was showing not only did you get fibers growing across, but you also got functional recovery. And this ties into the point I was making before that sometimes only small amounts of regrowth are sufficient to give you a surprising amount of functional recovery. And extensions of those experiments, some of which I heard about earlier this week, as I mentioned to you, indicated that the regenerating axons don't simply regenerate randomly, but appear to regenerate in an appropriate way to reestablish control of the brain over these spinal cord circuits that are local circuits that remain intact. genetics of parkinson's disease Mr. Porter. As you mentioned, last fall researchers identified a specific genetic region in a large Parkinson's prone family in Southern Italy that seems to be linked to the disease. This upset the conventional wisdom that Parkinson's was not genetically linked. Do you think this finding will prove to be an important clue to Parkinson's, or is the disease likely to have multiple causal factors including those which are environmental? Dr. Hall. Our suspicion is that the disease arises through some combination of genetic and environmental factors. And for many years, much of the interest in the field focused on environmental possibilities in part because of a discovery which you may have heard of made on the West Coast some years ago in which a number of young people were found to have essentially a very severe form of Parkinson's disease that was traced to their use of a drug that was contaminated by a substance that actually destroyed the same cells that die in Parkinson's disease. This was carried out by researchers in California and at the NIH. One of the consequences of that was to increase interest in the possibility that there might be some environmental toxin that was acting in the same way as this drug contaminant did. So there have been a number of studies that have looked for such an environmental influence. So far nothing has been identified that acts in such an effective way. It is known that in certain cases after a viral infection, on occasion there has been the development of Parkinson's symptoms. So it can be influenced by external events. But people had really sort of overlooked the genetic angle, or many people had. What we found at the meeting was that there were large families who had many patients in them with Parkinson's disease and in which it appeared to be inherited in a very clear-cut fashion. And so we, as I said in my opening statement, put together this collaboration and we have worked with the Human Genome Institute which has really provided the very latest in gene hunting technology to pursue this. So in this large family it is very clear that a defect or an alteration in a single gene causes Parkinson's disease. And I might add, this is perfectly typical Parkinson's disease as far as we know. There might be a slightly earlier age of onset, but it appears indistinguishable from any classical Parkinson's disease. The question is, first of all, will this particular gene prove to be important in other families even though it may not exert as strong an influence, perhaps because the mutation is different or something of that sort. We now have the tools to begin to ask that question. And then the other point is that even if this gene turns out to be important in the most extreme case only for this family, our hope is that it will provide this important clue to what's going on. We simply do not know why cells die in Parkinson's disease. Wehave a number of clinical trials, these are all aimed at trying to replace the cells that have died, but the cells continue to die. It is a progressive disease, as you know, and we simply don't know why. Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, Parkinson's disease, all are neurodegenerative diseases in which cells die for unknown reasons. In each case, a specific population of cells is involved, and in each of those cases these are adult onset diseases, these are cases in which people function perfectly well for many years and then something happens and these cells die. We think there may be links between those. We are very interested in perhaps looking at using what's been found with one disease to try to understand another. The powerful tool that has been missing so far in Parkinson's has been molecular genetics and we now think that tool is at hand. targeted research Mr. Porter. I want to go back to what I said earlier about the President's commitments on spinal cord injury research. I don't mean to suggest that there's anything wrong with the President being very interested in this and promoting and encouraging NIH to work harder in this area. I also will suggest that many Members of Congress do exactly the same thing. The fact that Silvio Conte and George O'Brien both had prostate cancer certainly led to a greater concern about that disease I think in NIH. We have members all the time that express concern about diseases. We wrote into the report last year an urging that you pursue research on therapeutic approaches to Parkinson's disease, and I think you might have just answered that question of what you've done. But, again, there's nothing wrong to have that concern. My worry is that we begin to have all of science politically directed, that's what worries me. I'm sure it worries you also. What share of your research portfolio would you categorize as basic research that cannot appropriately be designated as targeting one disease or another? Dr. Hall. Those judgments are somewhat arbitrary, as you know, but our guess is somewhere between 60 and 65 percent of our research is directed at fundamental mechanisms that may be applicable to a variety of diseases but are not targeted to a specific disease. Mr. Porter. And Doctor Varmus, would Neurology's percentage of research that is basic mirror that for NIH as whole? Is that about where everyone is? Dr. Varmus. It's difficult to say, Mr. Porter. I think one of the things that makes this a hard question to answer is that a lot of research can be construed as being focused on one disorder but is clearly applicable to others. That's a little different from the question you asked, but it's something, I'd have to consider in answering your question. neurodengenerative disease initiative Mr. Porter. Your Institute has been involved in the neurodegenerative diseases initiative funded for the past two years through the Office of the Director. Can you give us your impressions of how well this mechanism of centralized funding has worked? Dr. Hall. Let me ask, I'm not sure. There are two things. One is, we have the Biology of Brain Disorder Initiative which is part of each year's budget. We also have through the Office of the Director a group of us have funded research on neurodegenerative diseases, and perhaps it is that you're asking about. Let me tell you what we did, and we will do something like that again this year I think, and that is that a group of directors of the Institutes who are concerned with neurodegenerative diseases met, we then asked for applications for those Institutes that had projects that were in this area that were deserving of funding, we actually extended that beyond the small group to any Institute who had a project in this area that they wished to be considered. We then actually invited Dr. Varmus to sit with us if he would and look over these various applications, and then we discussed their excellence, importance, interest, and on that basis recommended funding for the various Institutes. So it was, in essence, a mini competition, if you will, in that area. Mr. Porter. The 1998 budget for the Office of the Director does not include funding for the neurodegenerative diseases initiative and, instead, indicates that the research projects funded will be supported by the individual participating Institutes. What projects from the initiative will be supported from your 1998 budget and at what funding level? Dr. Hall. From the 1998 budget, we don't know. Our sense would be to take those deserving applications in 1998 that were not going to be funded by our own funds and then apply them to the neurodegenerative initiative in the same competitive way. So in that sense, I can't tell you that we are pre-planning what those particular funds might be. That is, we will look at the applications that come in. We have not gone to the community, if you will, and said we want applications in this area because they're going to be used in the neurodegenerative disease area. Dr. Varmus. We could provide on estimate of the continuing cost from the 1996-97 awards. Dr. Hall. Yes, that's true. We have made awards in the past that will continue, and so we will fund those. Mr. Porter. Maybe you can provide those figures. Dr. Hall. We'll be happy to provide those figures. [The information follows:] funding for the neurodegenerative diseases initiative In FY 1996 an additional $3.5 million of NINDS neurodegeneratie research was supported with funds from the NIH Director's Discretionary Fund and the NIH Director's use of the one percent transfer authority. The commitments from these awards will be supported by the NINDS and total $3.6 million for FY 1998. In a similar manner, FY 1998 commitments for research projects funded by the NIH Office of the Director in FY 1997 will be supported by the institute that has responsibility for administering the project. Funding to meet these commitments in FY 1998 is estimated to be around $8 million, based on the FY 1997 appropriation. Dr. Hall. We have not actually made the 1997 awards yet, so in that sense we will do that this year. A little bit later in the year when we've had a significant number of applications come in, we will sit down and we'll say what promising things we were unable to fund this year in this area. We will do the same again next year. Mr. Porter. And then those will be funded out of your Institute's funds? Because the Office of the Director doesn't have any budget for that, correct? Dr. Hall. We have in some cases matched those funds. Dr. Varmus. Remember, Mr. Porter, that in general when we've initiated new projects either through a specific earmark for the Office of the Director or through the use of the 1 percent transfer authority, we pay the initial year's support with that money from the Office of the Director, then the Institutes have picked up the outyear costs. estrogen and stroke Mr. Porter. Throughout our hearings we have talked a great deal about the benefits and hazards of estrogen use. Your budget justification mentions yet another possible use of estrogen to prevent strokes in post-menopausal women. What properties of estrogen might be expected to have a protective effect against stroke? Dr. Hall. You're quite correct. We have a large clinical trial that will look at the effects of estrogen in post- menopausal women. We're very interested in that trial. We expect it to report in 1998 if all goes well and we will see what happens. The gender difference in stroke is interesting. Women, on an age-adjusted basis, have a slightly lower risk for stroke than men, but because women in general live longer and because the risk for stroke is age-related, more women than men end up being affected by a stroke particularly in later years. So this leads to the suggestion that there is maybe some beneficial effect in terms of a hormonal effect that might be responsible for the gender difference. So we hope that this trial will provide some support for that. possible therapeutic effects of nicotine Mr. Porter. For many years there has been evidence that smokers seem to have a reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Nicotine has also been suggested as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Now that nicotine has become available in numerous non-tobacco forms without the risks of smoking, do you think the evidence is suggestive enough to support research into the possible therapeutic effects of nicotine? Dr. Hall. Yes. We, in fact, do support an interesting project on the therapeutic effects of nicotine. There was an article in the New York Times in which I stated incorrectly that we were not supporting such a project, but I found out later that we were. It's an interesting one, and that is for patients with Tourette's Syndrome in which there are so-called tics in which people make sudden unexpected movements or sometimes say things that they cannot control, then haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic agent, given in low doses has proven to be useful for these patients. The side- effects of that are ameliorated by nicotine. But it has been very difficult to get the patients. These trials have been carried out on adolescents, and nicotine, if given orally, is very bitter and they tend not to take it. So what's been developed now is a skin patch whereby the nicotine actually is absorbed through the skin. That is in trial. We're very interested in the possibility that will be beneficial. Certainly anything that would help these young people, we would be very interested in. Mr. Porter. But that's not having a therapeutic effect, that's offsetting side-effects from the drug itself, right? Dr. Hall. Yes, it is. Yes. That's correct. Mr. Porter. Are there any possible therapeutic effects of nicotine itself? Dr. Hall. There is an old observation that smokers, as you mentioned, do not get Parkinson's disease. And within the last year, there has been some experimental support at the cellular basis for that. I think whether one would use nicotine and how it might be used in that context is at present only speculative. My guess is it will not be a key agent. And we don't have any plans at present to pursue that. So with the exception of the Tourette's case, we are not actively pursuing any case with nicotine. prion hypothesis and mad cow disease Mr. Porter. In January, Science magazine published a study questioning the leading hypothesis about the cause of Mad Cow disease. Abnormal forms of proteins called prions have been thought to cause Mad Cow disease although no infectious disease has ever been shown to be caused by proteins. Do you think the new Science study is persuasive enough to send researchers and funding agencies in new directions looking for the cause of Mad Cow disease? Dr. Hall. This is a long-standing question. At its core is a scientifically very important idea, and that is, infectious agents replicate so that if we are infected with a virus, the virus divides to produce more viruses, and that's how the infection is spread within the body and spread from person-to- person. We know that viruses and bacteria replicate through their DNA by dividing and splitting. The question of the prion diseases, which were originally called ``slow viruses,'' was a very perplexing one. Research at our Institute originally showed that some of the neurological diseases, specifically kuru and later Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and others, were actually caused by an infectious agent. That is, you could take brain material from someone who had kuru and give it to an animal and the animal would develop symptoms. This is the same thing that happens in Mad Cow disease, that it is transmitted. Now the question is, what is the transmissible agent? There have been literally decades of research that have gone into that question. I think it's fair to say that most people believe now that it is a protein, although the issue is not settled beyond doubt. The current hypothesis that is being most actively investigated is that the protein goes in and it is in an altered conformation that makes it infectious, and that when it goes into the body, it then induces in some catalytic manner the normal protein of the body to take on this altered conformation. And in that sense, the altered protein replicates itself even though there is no nucleic acid involved. And then that altered protein is transmitted to the next animal, and so on. The study that appeared in Science reported that in some animals, and not all, by the way, but in some animals that had the symptoms of these diseases, they were unable to detect these altered proteins. Whether that is a fundamental observation or a detection problem, we are not yet sure. I think that is the real question, as to whether or not they are there and simply not detected, or whether in fact, as some people believe, there is another infectious agent and that this change in the protein simply allows the infectious agent to come in and do its work. So research in this area will continue. We actually support people on both sides of that dispute, some who believe that it is the protein and others who are less sure. It is from a biological point of view a fascinating point, it is even a revolutionary idea. And as you know also, it has had tremendous economic-social consequences through the spread of Mad Cow disease in Britain. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Hall. Ms. Pelosi. Ms. Pelosi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Hall, Dr. Varmus, everyone, welcome. Thank you, Dr. Hall, for your testimony and for your good work at your Institute. Once again, Mr. Chairman, may I express my pride in a leader from the University of California-San Francisco making such a wonderful contribution to science under Dr. Varmus' leadership. This committee, I just love it, it's such a wonderful place to serve because of all the good testimony we receive, and under the leadership of our Chairman, the good work that the committee is able to accomplish. I don't know what is sadder, the days when people come in and they're talking about diseases that effect large numbers of people in the population, like cancer or AIDS, or the days when people come in and it's a small population, a small universe that is affected because you know it is going to be very difficult to build the public support. Dr. Varmus would not want that to happen in any event, that we would be sticking with our basic biomedical research-- but, in any event, that enough attention is paid in one way or another to some of the rare diseases that we see families have. I want to just ask about a couple of those. Dr. Hall. Please do. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Ms. Pelosi. In our report language last year, we talked about Lou Gehrig's disease and the need to sustain the momentum of current research. The committee encourages you to enhance your support of brain research relevant to ALS. Forgive me, Mr. Chairman, if that's already been addressed. Dr. Hall. ALS is a very active area of research right now, one that we're particularly interested in. I actually had used it earlier this afternoon as an example of a disease in which we have been able to make progress through insights in molecular genetics. About 10 percent of patients with ALS have a familial form of the disease, which means they inherit an alteration in their DNA which causes them to get it. In some of those cases, a portion of those cases have been shown to be due to alterations in a specific gene that encoded, in fact, an enzyme that was very familiar to us, an enzyme called superoxide dismutase. Basic science had studied that enzyme for years and it was one of those cases where clinical investigation suddenly is able to plug into a vast body of knowledge that was there waiting for it. The discovery that this enzyme was the problem led to the idea that there must be something wrong with the disposal or the generation of very dangerous compounds or class of compounds in ourselves called ``free radicals'' which are very reactive and which can do damage. These are generated as a by- product of energy metabolism and the cells have a special machinery to dispose of these. Further research has indicated that it is not the absence of the enzyme that causes problems, but it appears that the altered enzyme actually itself is a pernicious agent and that it does bad things to the cell. We don't yet know what that is, but we think the enzyme, because of the alteration, doesn't get rid of these free radicals in the way it should but actually generates a particularly dangerous class of those free radicals and that they attack the cell. What's happened then is one has been able to take this altered gene that was responsible for ALS in these families, put it into mice, and now we are studying in mice what happens, what the pathological process is, how it is that these mice develop motor symptoms, which they do. It is a relatively good model for the disease. We hope that this will also be a place where one can investigate potential therapies. I think you'll hear later this afternoon from Dr. Cassman about some basic research that has gone on involving some of the pathological processes in these cells that occur during ALS. So this is an active area. In fact, I hope to be able to attend a workshop later this spring in Boston on motor neurons and ALS. We're very interested. human embryo research Ms. Pelosi. Thank you, Dr. Hall. I'm going to skip a couple of diseases and go to another question in the interest of time. We've had quite a lively debate in our subcommittee and in the full committee about human embryo research. I was interested in what you had to say here about Parkinson's disease in your testimony. And I wondered if the actions taken by our committee, and therefore the Congress, on the restrictions on human embryo research have had an impact on your work? Dr. Hall. No. The work that you refer to that we support concerns experiments in which aborted fetuses have extracted from them the cells that make the chemical that's missing in Parkinson's disease, dopamine. These cells then are put into adult brains of people with Parkinson's disease. We are now carrying out two clinical trials to see if this treatment is effective. Because these are not human embryos that were created, these are aborted fetuses and they don't come under the human embryo research bans. So this work is not prohibited. Let me just say that no one believes that in ten years from now this will be the way we will treat Parkinson's patients. The reason that we're doing this is that there is a strong feeling that it may be more effective to give dopamine, the missing compound, by cellular secretion than by giving L-dopa, a precursor which people take and which has to enter the brain and get converted and so forth. L-dopa, as you may know, is not in the end a definitive therapy for Parkinson's disease. People develop side-effects, it becomes ineffective. And so the idea is that maybe if it were given in a more natural way it might be effective. The only cells that we know that one can put in the brain and have function in this way right now are cells from these young nervous systems. If those experiments are successful, then we will proceed to devise engineered cells that will do this in a different way. This will not in any long-term or large sense be the source of cells that will be used for therapy. Ms. Pelosi. That's interesting. I was also interested in terms of the in vitro fertilization, the debate that we had about the remains or the---- Dr. Hall. Our Institute is not involved in that at all. spinal cord injury research Ms. Pelosi. Okay. I thank you. Spinal cord injury, if I may just quickly, Mr. Chairman. Is there reason to be hopeful that with all the advances in science and technology that--well, could you address that, please? Dr. Hall. Yes, indeed. There is. We have made much progress in understanding the factors that make nerve cells regenerate and grow axons, the long extensions that they have. And we now know factors that positively stimulate them to grow and we also know that the nervous system has factors in it that prevent their growth. It actually has been a long-standing mystery or one of those well known puzzles that if you cut nerves in the peripheral nervous system, that is the nerves that run down your arm, they will regenerate. But if you cut nerves in the central nervous system, they don't. One of the reasons they don't is because there are substances that prevent this in the central nervous system. Presumably these are there to prevent aberrant connections being made in adults. We are finding ways of blocking that inhibition, if you will. And so there are some initial, very promising studies suggesting that you can increase the growth of nerves in spinal cord-injured animals and that this increase results in functional recovery. So we are very heartened by that and very eager to explore that further. Ms. Pelosi. When you say cut cells one place and another and compare the impact, when you bruise the spinal cord, is that the equivalent of cutting cells or is that something else? Dr. Hall. Yes. Well, several things happen in spinal cord injury. In fact, most spinal cord injuries are not clean cuts but are cases in which the vertebra are broken and actually compress the axons. So there's damage on several levels. The axons that run down the cord are sometimes damaged as if they had been cut. There is also edema, that is swelling of the cord, and the cells that are responsible for making the insulation around the axons die, we are now finding out, sometimes with a delay. We are trying to explore ways in which that cell death can be prevented. So it is not simply the physical separation of the cells, but a lot of the trauma has to do with increased pressure, edema, there is often an inflammatory reaction, and all of these factors contribute to spinal cord injury. So it is really a very complex sort of injury. It is not something as simple as a clean cut would imply. Ms. Pelosi. I appreciate your elaboration. I was encouraged by what your statement said on the subject and by your testimony. Dr. Hall. Absolutely. Ms. Pelosi. Thank you very much, Dr. Hall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Ms. Pelosi. Thank you, Dr. Hall. You did an excellent job of testifying, except for the answer to my question as to why you don't want more money. [Laughter.] Mr. Porter. We very much appreciate the fine job you're doing at your Institute. Thank you for your appearance here today. Dr. Hall. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. We will stand in recess briefly. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 2026 - 2093--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Tuesday, March 18, 1997. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES WITNESSES DR. MARVIN CASSMAN, PH.D., DIRECTOR MARTHA PINE, EXECUTIVE OFFICER DR. W. SUE SHAFER, PH.D., ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR EXTRAMURAL ACTIVITIES G. EARL HODGKINS, FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OFFICER DR. HAROLD VARMUS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NIH DENNIS P. WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DHHS Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. We are now pleased to welcome Dr. Marvin Cassman, the official Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Congratulations, Dr. Cassman, on your becoming a full director rather than just an acting director. Congratulations also on your Institute having, together with the OAR transfer, passed the $1 billion mark in budgeting. Why don't you introduce the people at the table with you and then proceed with your statement. Introduction of Witnesses Dr. Cassman. Thank you, Mr. Porter. I'm pleased to be here officially. On my far left is Mr. Earl Hodgkins, who is our Financial Management Officer, on my immediate left is Ms. Martha Pine, the Executive Officer of the Institute, and Dr. Sue Shafer, on my right, the Associate Director for Extramural Activities. I'm very pleased to be here and to present to you the programs of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Opening Statement Today, I would like to highlight several recent discoveries that have emerged from NIGMS-supported basic research. This is something we do every year, of course, but this year I particularly want to use these highlights to illustrate that important discoveries do not occur in a vacuum, but build on a large body of previous work. This is another aspect of what Dr. Varmus in his opening remarks called ``culminations and inspirations.'' These breakthroughs are the culmination of decades of research representing the inspirations of many investigators. Isaac Newton said that the reason he could see so far was because he stood on the shoulders of giants. The reason that these exciting new discoveries are emerging is because they have been built on the efforts of a community of scientists. It is one of the goals of the NIGMS to ensure the continuing productivity of this basic research community. One of the benefits of the NIGMS' long-term support of basic research is that major discoveries can emerge in unexpected places. The breakdown of materials in the cell was for many years considered to be an essential process but, until recently, it was not viewed as very interesting or even very complicated. After all, waste removal has never had much appeal. But it turns out that both in our external environment and in our internal environment, in the cell, the process of removing unwanted or obstructive material is complex, highly regulated, and of central importance in our lives. There are indications that the failure of cells and tissues to properly dispose of molecular waste may be a factor in some diseases, including one which was just mentioned, ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. On the poster to my left, you see a pathway that begins when a cell is stressed. One consequence of stress on cells, not necessarily human stress, is that proteins unfold from their highly ordered structure and lose their ability to function. In some circumstances this is irreversible and the molecule has to be disposed of. This is done by tagging it with another molecule called ubiquitin, that's the left-hand branch of that pathway, which signals to the cell that the protein's time is up. [See figure 1.] [Page 2097--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] Ubiquitin was discovered more than 20 years ago and it was found to be ubiquitous in almost all cells and organisms; hence, its name. It was given the name of ubiquitin because nobody really knew what it did. It took quite a long time of patient investigation, much of it by NIGMS-supported investigators, to understand that its primary function was in this removal of proteins that have become damaged in some way. Recently, the ubiquitin story has taken an interesting turn. We now know that in addition to waste disposal, the selective and irreversible destruction of proteins by their coupling to ubiquitin also provides a means of regulating cellular processes. For example, perhaps the most significant new advance in understanding how cell division is controlled comes from the discovery this year by an NIGMS-supported investigator of a large cellular particle which contributes to the regulation of the cell cycle of growth and division through targeting specific cell cycle proteins for destruction by coupling them to ubiquitin. Understanding how this activity fits into the complex process of cell division is likely to provide further insights into the behavior of the cell cycle in normal and aberrant cells. It also demonstrates that the protein degradation system is being used by the cell not only to eliminate proteins that are damaged or no longer needed, but in the regulation of cellular processes as well. As one NIGMS investigator stated in a recent publication, ``Protein degradation represents a chapter of cellular regulation that is just beginning to be written.'' And all this from two decades of investigation of an initially unknown compound. On the right side of the poster you see a second possible response to stress in the unfolding of proteins, the refolding into an active form assisted by a compound called a chaperonin. Now, how proteins fold into their three dimensional active forms is one of the central questions of biology and it is one that's been studied for many years. But all along a key tenet that everyone has basically agreed on is that proteins don't need any help to fold, all the information is contained in the chemical structure of the protein itself. So it was a totally surprising and completely unexpected discovery that in the cell there exists this class of compounds which have been named chaperoninsthat help proteins fold. Obviously, once again, the name chaperonins are by analogy to the chaperones who once accompanied and protected young ladies. Apparently at least some proteins need a helping hand, or maybe a helping molecule, to achieve their mature folded form. The utility of chaperonins in the cell's economy and the way they function have been vigorously addressed by several NIGMS- supported researchers, one of whom has determined the structure of a chaperonin in great detail. I wanted to show you this because it is beautiful, apart from anything else. You're looking at a chaperonin from the top down. It is a ring made up of seven separate and different subunits. There are actually two of these rings stacked one on the other. You can't see the second one, of course, because it is hidden below. The ring forms this doughnut-shaped cavity and in the cavity the unfolded protein sits and is shielded as it folds. [See figure 2.] [Page 2099--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] This structure will help in understanding the mechanism of proper folding in the cell and may give clues to dealing with a number of diseases. Failures in correct folding of proteins have been implicated in retinitis pigmentosa, Tay-Sachs disease, and cystic fibrosis. This fundamental discovery will affect all of them and probably many more. Understanding the rules that predict correct folding, as well as the process by which it occurs, may help clarify the basis of these and other diseases. I should point out that the problem of how proteins fold is a very difficult one to solve. A variety of approaches to understanding this process have been supported by NIGMS for many years, even when progress appeared painfully slow. In recent years, the pace has picked up dramatically and major advances have been made, in part, due to a continuing investment in this field over a long period of time. The step-by-step progress of science also yields tools that can be of enormous importance both to industry and in the basic research laboratory. I've given several examples of these in my written statement, but I'll focus only on one, and that's on the next poster which shows the developments in the production of transgenic, or knock-out, mice--mice which have had genes introduced or removed. Two NIGMS investigators have been largely responsible for the development of this approach, and it's been based on the underlying basic research which is listed on the left-hand side of this poster. The highlights in gold are those areas in which NIGMS investigators have had major involvement. [See figure 3.] [Page 2101--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] As you can see, many of the fundamental advances that resulted in the generation of transgenic mice have emerged from NIGMS-supported research. Now if you look on the right-hand side, you will see the mouse models that have been developed so far. Two of them are highlighted because two of them have been developed by NIGMS researchers, the mice that have the cystic fibrosis gene and one in which high blood pressure is being examined. But as you will see, most of the other mouse models are being supported by other NIH Institutes, as is quite reasonable because they are being used for the specific purposes of understanding the diseases that those Institutes are targeted toward. All of these discoveries build upon and were supported by many outstanding investigators whose individual contributions make up the body of science. It sometimes appears that progress moves seamlessly, without a hitch, because discoveries appear with such frequency. However, investigators sometimes stall in their efforts, and in order to ensure that temporary difficulties do not permanently cripple an otherwise productive laboratory, and to maintain momentum in the field, we have instituted a bridge funding mechanism for investigators whose applications fall just beyond our payline. This is intended to benefit the investigators by allowing them time to maintain their progress; to benefit the Government by ensuring that an investment in individuals and research is not lost; and to benefit science generally by maintaining the scope and breadth of effort that ultimately yield the discoveries that transform our world. Two other major areas of NIGMS support are training andprograms designed to increase the number of under-represented minorities in the biomedical sciences. I've discussed these programs previously before this committee. I'll leave the detailed remarks for my written testimony. Rather, I would like to conclude by looking at these programs through the lens of history. The seminal document in the development of the modern research effort in the United States is generally agreed to be Vannevar Bush's 1945 report called ``Science: The Endless Frontier.'' This is a document more often cited than read, which is a pity because it still has a great deal to tell us. At one point, Bush quotes from an advisory committee, which said the following: ``We think we probably would not, even if we were all-wise and all-knowing, write you a plan whereby you would be assured of scientific leadership at one stroke * * *. We think it is much the best plan, in this constitutional Republic, that opportunity be held out to all kinds and conditions of men whereby they can better themselves. This is the American way, this is the way the United States has become what it is. We think it is very important that circumstances be such that there be no ceilings, other than ability itself, to intellectual ambition.'' This sentiment is applicable to all of our programs, but in particular it reflects the purposes of the Minority Opportunities in Research program, which is to ensure that under-represented minorities have an opportunity to achieve the scientific leadership of which Vannevar Bush wrote. Mr. Chairman, the fiscal year 1998 budget for the National Institute of General Medical Sciences is $992,032,000. I would be pleased to answer any questions that you may have. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 2104 - 2107--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] goals of the director Mr. Porter. Thank you. It is $1,020,000,000 with the OAR transfer. Dr. Cassman. With the OAR transfer, absolutely. Yes. Mr. Porter. Dr. Cassman, now that the ``acting'' has been removed from in front of your title, you get the vision question. Now that you've ascended to the top position, what goals have you set for the Institute during your tenure, and what steps are you taking to achieve them? Dr. Cassman. I think that not a unique, but a major responsibility of the NIGMS is to ensure the continuing productivity of basic research in the biomedical sciences. That means balancing a lot of different demands on the system. It means ensuring that established investigators with ongoing active programs are not disrupted in their research efforts and maintain the ability to continue to be productive. That has to be balanced against the needs of new investigators, and the needs of the scientific community and of the country to have new investigators come into the research system. It means making sure that areas that are dynamic and evolving continue to get the resources that they need but without starving the new opportunities that continually emerge. We look for new opportunities, for new ideas. We try to facilitate the development of the basic research effort, and we try to balance all of the needs that our community and that the broader research enterprise in the United States faces. One of the major things of course that we do is interact with the extramural community, with our scientists, and with our advisors, to get continued input into where science is moving and to make sure that our portfolio is balanced in such a way that all of the needs are addressed, not always met in full, of course. research in chemistry and physical sciences Mr. Porter. Dr. Varmus has often noted that biomedical research depends upon other disciplines--physics, chemistry, mathematics, and computer science, for example--to thrive. Does NIGMS support the lion's share of research in these other disciplines at NIH? Dr. Cassman. Certainly in chemistry, I don't think there's any doubt of that. Physics, probably. Physics has an input in a variety of different ways, including instrument development which occurs in many parts of NIH. Mathematics is an area where I think we need to have more involvement. In fact, we have been having discussions recently with individuals who have an interest in applying mathematical approaches to biological systems. I don't really believe that we are encouraging mathematicians to be as involved as they can and should be. interim funding Mr. Porter. As you mentioned, you've instituted a program to provide interim funding to some unfunded competing continuation grants. Applications that fall within 10percentile points of the payline are eligible and will receive a third of the grant's total cost. When will these researchers apply again for full award? What success rate do you expect them to have? Dr. Cassman. Those are interesting questions. The award is made for only one year. So we expect them to apply within that one year period so that there will be no hiatus in funding. In the past, the success rate of this group of investigators has been somewhere between 55 and 65 percent. I would hope that the resources that we are providing through the interim funding will make them more successful, not necessarily in the immediate future, because this is really to tide them over, but to ensure that there is no break in the progress of their research, so that when they come in in the future they will be more successful than perhaps they have been in the past. That's one of the things we're going to follow to see whether this program in fact has been useful. Mr. Porter. How much funding do you allocate to these interim grants? Dr. Cassman. It will be about $3.5 million. Mr. Porter. Do any other Institutes operate similar programs? Dr. Cassman. Other Institutes are approaching the issue in other ways. I don't believe that there are any others that are doing bridge funding in this form. Mr. Porter. Your program has been criticized by some in the university community because it caps indirect costs at 25 percent. How have you responded to these concerns? Dr. Cassman. This was never intended to be a program through which we could provide full support, we just don't have the resources, for either the investigator or the institution. It is an interim funding mechanism; it is not a full-funding mechanism, it's a partial funding mechanism. I feel that it's appropriate that we share the burden of supporting these investigators for this one year period where we are providing the one-third support in direct cost. Mr. Porter. I'm not sure that fully answers what I've asked. Obviously, there are institutions that have indirect costs that are far higher, correct? Dr. Cassman. The indirect cost rate is lower than the full negotiated level. That's, first of all, consistent with other programs at NIH, such as the Shannon Awards, which are interim funding programs, and it is simply a reflection of the fact that this program only provides partial funding either through direct costs or indirect costs. I have no theoretical objection to giving full cost to both in terms of direct and indirect, but we don't have the resources for it. high risk research Mr. Porter. Your budget justification mentions plans to support innovative high risk research through two year pilot grants. You had previously tried another approach to supporting higher risk research. What are you hoping to achieve, and why did your first program not meet this objective? Dr. Cassman. In the first program, we were looking at applications that came in just through the normal route, and looking at applications that did not fall within our normal payline, in fact, in some cases fell far beyond it, and where the reviewers would say things such as, ``This is a terrific idea but--but there's not enough preliminary information'', ``but we're not convinced the investigator can do it''--or because there was a lot of controversy. There really weren't a lot to select from. People do not send in applications that they don't think will be funded. So what we're doing in this new program is more proactive. We're soliciting applications that we hope will be somewhat controversial, that have substantial experimental risks but promise substantial benefits. new investigators Mr. Porter. You also mention efforts to support adequate numbers of new investigators. Are you creating a new research mechanism to address this need? Dr. Cassman. No. No, we're not. Since 1992, we've given specific advantage to investigators who have no other source of support, and in particular new investigators. We're continuing to do this. I urge the staff to look carefully at new investigators coming in within 10 percentile points of our payline, and even a bit further. I'm also co-chair of a committee looking at the means that NIH uses to bring new people into the system and the mechanisms that we use, and to determine whether those mechanisms have been successful, whether they're doing what we hope they will do. stimulation of research fields Mr. Porter. You intend to assess your grant portfolio to identify gaps in research coverage. If you find areas that are not being adequately addressed, what steps will you take to increase research in those areas? Dr. Cassman. What we normally do is we get advice, as I said earlier, from members of the extramural community, and from our advisory council. We usually hold at least a workshop to determine what kind of approach is appropriate, and then we put out a specific request for applications in that area. employment prospects for research trainees Mr. Porter. We continue to hear reports of considerable anxiety and stress in the biomedical community about job prospects, of positions having hundreds of applicants, and of young scientists moving from one post-doc to another rather than being able to secure a permanent job. At Dr. Varmus' December advisory council meeting, at least two members indicated concerns about this and felt the council should take a more active role in assessing the problem. They also questioned whether the periodic workforce studies by the National Academy of Sciences provided useful information. First, Dr. Cassman, can you give us your personal assessment of the situation? And then, Dr. Varmus, can you tell us how you plan to follow up on the suggestions of the members at your advisory council? Dr. Cassman. There's certainly some pressure on the workforce. I don't think there's any doubt of it. How much is not yet clear. Unemployment, as measured by the various indices that the American Chemical Society, for example, or the Federation of Societies for Experimental Biology use when they're looking at this, have not, until very recently, shown a significant increase in unemployment. Nevertheless, I do feel that the opportunities are fewer now than they certainly were during a period of high growth. But it's difficult to be able to project that very easily. The main point to remember is that all of our training programs train for eight to ten years in the future, and that we as a Nation, maybe anybody actually, are pretty bad at predicting things that far out. Attempts to estimate supply and demand in the past have been dreadful and have usually failed miserably. I don't think we can make our adjustments now on the basis of the fluctuations in the current situation. I think it has to be left to the individuals who have an interest in pursuing an area of excitement and great promise, and where those individuals, I really do believe, will find jobsthat are quite appropriate to their interest. Dr. Varmus, you have to give your half of this. Dr. Varmus. I'll be brief, Mr. Porter. Basically, the next meeting of my advisory committee will be devoted, at least in part, to this issue. Many of the members were unacquainted with the National Academy of Sciences study that is done every three or four years. We will have them read that report, and we'll provide them with data that Dr. Cassman and Dr. Ellie Ehrenfeld, Director of the Division of Research Grants, have been putting together with respect to the state of young investigators. We want to distinguish very clearly between the problems in obtaining grants on early applications and the problems of finding jobs. We also distinguish between the difficulty in obtaining jobs in a very restricted academic market and the other opportunities for using an advanced degree in science to work in industry, Government, or other sectors of our economy. scientists employed as temporary workers Mr. Porter. The Washington Post carried a story recently describing the increased use of highly trained temporary employees in scientific labs. Is this principally an issue for private industry, or is it becoming more common in university labs as well? Dr. Cassman. As far as I know, it is really an industrial issue. I'm not aware of temporary employees of the kind that was described in the article, which I did read, being involved in academic institutions at all. research training collaborations with industry Mr. Porter. Bruce Alberts, the head of the National Academy of Sciences, proposed last week at an AEI-Brookings conference that new hybrid models should be developed for students to blend the university research setting and the biotech company so that young scientists would have models other than the traditional tenure track as a career route. Are the NIH research training programs flexible enough to support training in settings like these should they be developed? Dr. Cassman. Absolutely. In fact, they already do. We have specifically at NIGMS a biotechnology training program that requires some involvement or some interaction with industry, frequently an internship and in other instances collaborative research, a variety of different ways. But in addition, our other training programs frequently have interactions both on the research level and on the teaching level with neighboring biotechnology companies. So I think this is not an uncommon phenomena even now. rationale for stipend increases Mr. Porter. NIH has increased 1997 training stipends for pre-doctoral students and those in their first and second years of post-doctoral training. The President's budget proposes another stipend increase for the first two post-doctoral years for fiscal year 1998. What guiding principle is NIH using in these stipend decisions? Are you trying to achieve parity with other Federal training programs? Dr. Cassman. Would you like to respond? Dr. Varmus. It's difficult for us to achieve parity with all the programs. But we recognize that we have not been providing cost-of-living increases to our trainees, so they've fallen farther behind. Therefore, we have made a decision as a group, at a meeting of the Institute directors, to increase the level of support. Mr. Porter. Stipends for post-doctoral fellows beyond their first two years of training have remained unchanged since 1991. Dr. Varmus. They were relatively high, however, compared to the first two years. We tried to get the first two years up to what amounted to a fairer relationship to the more advanced years. evaluations of national research service award training Mr. Porter. Your advisory council last September heard the preliminary results of an ongoing evaluation of the National Research Service Award training programs. What are the major findings of the study to date? Dr. Cassman. That's an analysis that is being conducted of all of the NRSA programs at central NIH. I don't believe it is completed yet, although I understand that early this summer at least a preliminary version of the report should be available. Mr. Porter. Can you share that with us when you get it? Dr. Cassman. Oh, yes. Of course. compliance with nrsa payback requirement Mr. Porter. Your Institute is responsible for monitoring compliance with the payback requirements for research training grants. In general, what kind of track record do trainees have in fulfilling their research payback requirement? Dr. Cassman. Very high. It's difficult, I can't give you a good number, but I'm pretty sure it's under 1 percent where we've had problems with compliance. medical scientist training program Mr. Porter. Do you intend to increase your emphasis on the Medical Scientists Training Program which supports joint Ph.D.- M.D. trainees in order to ease the difficulties clinical researchers are facing in the new health care environment? Dr. Cassman. Our training programs have stayed essentially constant in numbers. The increases have been primarily through stipend increases and occasionally to compensate for inflationary increases in tuition payments. We don't really have any plans at this point to differentially increase the MSTP program. It would mean taking away resources from the other graduate training programs and those are the programs which support MSTP because the MSTP trainees do their research in the graduate programs. Dr. Varmus. I would add, Mr. Porter, that it isn't necessarily the case that M.D.-Ph.D. awards lead to greater protection for clinical investigators, because an awful lot of our M.D.-Ph.D. graduates end up doing basic research that's not clinical in nature. Mr. Porter. Well, that's my next question. What information do you have on the career outcomes of researchers who have completed the Medical Scientists Training Program? Dr. Cassman. We're doing a study now. I hope within the next year it will be complete, and we can report on exactly that, on the career outcomes. There have been previous analyses of these but none very recently. The last one I believe was in 1984. We do know something about the career progression but it is more anecdotal than it is concrete. They tend to be among the best students at any institution. They do extremely well when they get out. They have a very good record of getting research grant support. Many of them are in clinical departments even though, as Dr. Varmus pointed out, they may be doing basic research, which I think is very appropriate because one of the intents of the program was to bridge basic and clinical and their presence helps in that bridging. I can give you more details I hope next year at the hearing. research areas pursued by young investigators Mr. Porter. What can NIH do to avoid imbalance in the research areas chosen by young investigators; that is, toomany students targeting one trendy field and ignoring other important areas. Can the research training program be managed to address this problem? Dr. Cassman. Well, we ask our training program directors to give us their best--their best students, their best faculty, their best programs. Beyond that, we try not to direct them. The programs that we have are all multi-disciplinary to begin with; they are not very highly targeted in some very narrow specific research area. And, in fact, we're hoping to broaden them even further. So I don't think that there is a lot that we can do, and perhaps not a lot that we should do, about that. It is still really up to the student to make that decision and they'll go where the exciting work is being done, no question about that. Mr. Porter. Dr. Varmus, do you want to add to that? Dr. Varmus. I do think this is an important question, Mr. Porter. We haven't talked all that much about this as an institution. But I think an argument can be made for trying to generate programs that would allow post-doctoral fellows, especially those of great excellence, to work independently within an existing laboratory for one or two years. The difficulty, as I'm sure you know, is that people who are good tend to train in labs that are very productive, often working in the most exciting areas. They develop research programs in those areas and then, when it's time for them to seek a job and apply for a grant, they naturally have to undertake their activities in that area. They are never given an opportunity to develop something novel in an atmosphere in which they have some protection. So I would like at some point to develop with a program that would allow us to diversify the scientific community a little more dramatically than we have been able to. training programs of the howard hughes medical institute Mr. Porter. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute supports almost $90 million in science education activities annually, from elementary to post-graduate. Do any of the Howard Hughes post-graduate programs target the same research trainee population as NIH programs, particularly in the minority area? Dr. Cassman. Actually, the Howard Hughes programs, the post-doctoral programs are quite limited. The only one that I am aware of is to M.D.s who have had at least two years of clinical experience. So it is essentially a reentry program almost. Beyond that, I don't believe they really target anything else, certainly nothing that's in the area that we deal with. percentage of ph.d.s awarded to minorities Mr. Porter. Have there been any encouraging recent trends in the percentage of Ph.D.s in the life sciences awarded to minority students? Dr. Cassman. The numbers are still very low. The last number that I'm aware of, which is based on 1994 data, shows that it is maybe just about 5 percent of the total. [Clerk's note.--Later corrected to ``6 percent''.] There is some indication that the bachelor's degree production in the life sciences may be picking up, and of course that's a necessary prerequisite. But right at the moment, it's still very poor. Mr. Porter. I might say we're also concerned about this in the education area, because the percentage of minority students getting advanced degrees is going down and that's of great concern. Dr. Cassman. Yes, the numbers are difficult to interpret. Mr. Porter. What share of these minority Ph.D. students graduate from minority institutions compared to so-called majority schools? Dr. Cassman. That data is usually reported by the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation in different publications they have. The only minority schools that they identify are the HBCUs, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. There are other definitions-- Hispanic, for example. The University of Texas at El Paso has something like a 65 percent Hispanic population and could be considered a minority school, but it is not measured that way in their evaluation. So if you look at the HBCUs, on the order of 12 percent of the African-American Ph.D. degrees in the life sciences come from HBCUs. That's really the only number that I have available for minority institutions. [Clerk's note.--Later corrected to ``10 percent''.] gender differences in response to trauma Mr. Porter. One of the researchers you support has found that more males than females die after a traumatic injury, and that those males who survive are often more sick. Sex hormone levels are thought to be an explanation for this result. How might hormone levels modify response to trauma? And what implication could this have for the treatment of injury? Dr. Cassman. It's another example of the intrinsic superiority of the female. [Laughter.] Dr. Cassman. What happens is that after trauma there is frequently hemorrhagic shock; there's a loss of blood. One of the things that happens as a result of that is a reduction in the immune response. So people with hemorrhagic shock tend to be more prone to infections and, particularly in that kind of debilitated condition, therefore are more prone to die from infections. But this doesn't appear to be as true for females as for males. The answer appears to be not that females have something that the males don't have, but rather vice versa. The testosterone levels in the blood apparently in some way predispose men to this ultimate reduction in immune responsiveness. There have been some studies recently showing that anti-testosterone inhibitors provided for a short period of time help in reversing this effect in males. That's still underway in the preliminary studies. Mr. Porter. Dr. Cassman, you have answered all of my questions. I don't even have any for the record. We thank you for your good statement and your very direct answers. We're delighted that you are now complete and no longer acting. And we're delighted that a Chicago boy and a University of Chicago boy made good. [Laughter.] Dr. Cassman. Well, thank you, Mr. Porter. I appreciate that. Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will stand in recess until 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. [The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 2116 - 2153--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Thursday, March 20, 1997. OFFICE OF AIDS RESEARCH WITNESSES WILLIAM E. PAUL, M.D., DIRECTOR WENDY WERTHEIMER, SENIOR ADVISOR DONNA ADDERLY, SENIOR BUDGET ANALYST, OFFICE OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT HAROLD VARMUS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH DENNIS P. WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DHHS Introduction of Witnesses Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. We continue today with hearings on the National Institutes of Health, and we are pleased to welcome Dr. William Paul, Director of the Office of AIDS Research. Dr. Paul, if you would introduce the people with you, and then please proceed with your statement. Dr. Paul. Thank you, Mr. Porter. I am delighted to have the opportunity to appear before you. I would like to introduce my colleagues. They are Ms. Wendy Wertheimer, who is a Senior Advisor at the Office of AIDS Research; Ms. Donna Adderly, a Senior Budget Analyst in the Office of Financial Management; and, of course, I don't need to introduce Dr. Varmus and Mr. Williams, but I will formally do that. Opening Statement Mr. Chairman, this has been a year of progress and promise in AIDS research, a year clearly demonstrating the dividends made possible by our national investment in biomedical science. So striking was this progress that Science Magazine named the ``New Weapons Against HIV'' as the breakthrough of the year, and Time Magazine named Dr. David Ho, an NIH-supported investigator and a member of our Advisory Council, as its Man of the Year. We can take collective pride in the dramatic changes that have occurred just since our hearings last year. Protease inhibitors, a new class of drugs, used in combination with other antiretroviral therapies, have been shown to dramatically diminish the amount of HIV in the blood of an infected individual. Receptors for molecules called chemokines have been identified as critical co-factors for HIV infection, providing us with an entirely new set of targets for anti-HIV therapies and new approaches for vaccine development. These critical advances have brought a sense of hope and renewed vigor to the AIDS research community and to our patients. But it is essential to point out that the news, while good, cannot lead to complacency. The covers of many magazines may fantasize about the ``end of AIDS,'' but, Mr. Chairman, the end of this pandemic is not yet in sight. The new drugs, while promising, are not a panacea. We do not know how long the benefits will last. It is far from clear whether immune function of treated individuals can be restored without additional intervention. There are many for whom the new drug regimens have not been effective or for whom the side- effects are not tolerable. Because of their expense, these drugs are not affordable or accessible to many who need them. Furthermore, the sobering fact is that we have made little progress against the devastating spread of the epidemic around the globe. AIDS is the number one cause of death among young adults in the United States. Rates of increases in AIDS cases in the U.S. are greatest for women, for adolescents, for persons infected through heterosexual contact, for minorities, and for injecting drug users. Worldwide, more than 29 million people have been infected with HIV, with more than 3 million new infections in just the past year. The great majority of these infections occur in the poorest parts of the world, in countries without the resources or the health care systems to benefit from the new anti-HIV drugs. AIDS has brought about a significant decline in overall life expectancy in many African countries, threatening the economies of these already-poor nations, and robbing them of their workforce. A safe and an effective AIDS vaccine is an urgent global public health imperative. Without a vaccine, AIDS will soon overtake tuberculosis as the leading infectious cause of death in the world. Three years ago, the prospects in AIDS research appeared dim. The pipeline of new potential drugs or vaccines seemed empty. The OAR convened a small group of eminent scientists at the Stone House on the NIH campus, a meeting which has proven to be pivotal for AIDS research. We asked the group to help us identify the critical gaps in our knowledge about AIDS and to suggest what steps could be taken to open up new scientific opportunities and move the scientific frontier forward. The late Dr. Bernard Fields stated his firm conviction that further advances against the virus would require that NIH shift its priorities and its resources to bring about a rededication to building the knowledge base about HIV and how it causes disease. Without this knowledge, he argued, the pipeline would remain empty. In every budget year since then we have increased the proportion of funding for research on basic aspects of HIV, on the immune system, and on the mechanisms of disease, and we have placed a greater emphasis on investigator-initiated science. Between fiscal year 1994 and this budgetary request for fiscal year 1998, we will have increased the number of research grants by approximately 50 percent. This has encouraged innovation from a wider group of investigators. Another important initiative emerged from the Stone House meeting. Dr. Phillip Sharp, a Nobel Laureate, stated that to plot a course for the future, we needed to understand all of the facets of the existing AIDS research program. He suggested that OAR undertake a critical evaluation of the entire program to ensure that the most promising areas of science were being supported, the most critical scientific questions were being asked, and the most effective use being made of Federal AIDS research resources. As you know, that discussion led to a review of unprecedented scope across all the NIH Institutes and Centers, led by Dr. Arnold Levine of Princeton University. The report, commonly called the Levine Report, provides guidance to the NIH for strengthening our AIDS research programs. This report is not sitting on a shelf, gathering dust; its recommendations helped frame the OAR's finaldistribution of the fiscal year 1997 appropriation, and are reflected throughout our fiscal year 1998 research plan and budget request. I would like to update you about the implementation of some of these recommendations. The report recognized that only a truly effective preventive vaccine can limit and eventually eliminate the threat of AIDS. The reviewers placed a high priority on the need to restructure and reinvigorate the AIDS vaccine program, with leadership and guidance from eminent non-Government scientists. The NIH has taken important steps to carry out this critical recommendation. Nobel Laureate Dr. David Baltimore has been recruited to lead this effort, and he has gathered a group of outstanding scientists to serve with him. Their charge is to energize the development of new strategies that will lead to the discovery and development of a safe and effective AIDS vaccine. To facilitate this effort, the OAR has made a major financial investment in AIDS vaccine research. The fiscal year 1998 budget request represents a 33.6 percent increase for vaccine research in the two-year period since fiscal year 1996, a sign of our commitment to this effort. The President also highlighted the importance of vaccine research in his State of the Union address. Some have argued that a protective anti-HIV vaccine is simply not possible. As an immunologist, I believe there is persuasive evidence that a protective immune response can be induced, and that an effective vaccine is possible. I also believe that the Government has a unique role and obligation to support the basic research needed for the development of a successful vaccine. The Levine Report also urged NIH to develop a Prevention Science Agenda, combining research on behavioral interventions with biomedical interventions such as topical microbicides, female-controlled barriers, methods to prevent mother-to-child transmission, and prevention and treatment of sexually- transmitted diseases. The OAR has convened a group of experts to assist us in identifying the most promising areas for additional investment. With these actions, we believe that the necessary balance has been struck between research to develop treatments for those who are infected, and to develop vaccines and other prevention methods for those who are at risk. This is a delicate balance and one that will almost certainly shift as science progresses. Thus the fiscal year 1998 budget for AIDS research has been crafted to reflect the recommendations of the Levine Report and the broad consensus on the current scientific opportunities, including a rededication to understanding the basic biology of the virus and how it causes disease; a stronger vaccine research and development effort; increased research on human immunology; an emphasis on prevention science research; and a vigorous therapeutic program with an efficient clinical trials system in which there is increased participation of women and minorities. Mr. Chairman, we are reaping the rewards of years of work by dedicated scientists. Those who met at the Stone House helped us set a new course for AIDS research. We have gained new knowledge of the basic biology of HIV and developed new targets for therapies and vaccine development. The science of AIDS is moving forward and opening whole new areas of research that can advance the treatment and prevention not only of AIDS, but of other diseases as well. The Office of AIDS Research requests a consolidated appropriation of $1,540,765,000 for NIH AIDS research. The budget authorities provided to the OAR, allowing us to make resources available where the greatest opportunities lie, are even more critical today, as these opportunities constantly change. We are grateful to the committee for your continued support for AIDS research and providing us the flexibility critical to meeting the enormous scientific challenges posed by HIV. I will be pleased to answer any of your questions. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 2159 - 2162--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] Mr. Porter. Dr. Paul, thank you for that wonderful statement. Let me say that the progress that has been made in AIDS research makes one's heart leap for joy, and yet you warn us, very properly, that we're only making substantial progress and the end is not yet in sight, and we certainly need to assure that you have the resources that you and your investigators need to continue the fine work that you have done. So we very much appreciate your leadership and all the progress that is being made, and we obviously want to provide you with the resources that you need to continue doing the fine job that's being done. I might add that I don't think the President is giving you enough, but you knew that already. [Laughter.] aids statistics Let me ask some questions. Perhaps because of the relative newness of the AIDS epidemic, the number of cases is usually described in cumulative rather than in annual terms. Can you give us an idea of the number of new AIDS cases and AIDS deaths in the United States on an annual basis over the past few years? Dr. Paul. Yes. For the last year for which we have complete numbers, the number of new diagnoses is slightly in excess of 70,000--I believe approximately 71,000. The number of deaths-- again, in the last year for which we have complete data--was approximately 50,000. There does appear, however,in the last six months to have been a trend towards a diminution in the death rate. CDC's numbers suggest that death rates are now falling, possibly by as much as 10 to 13 percent, although we will have to see that on an annualized basis. Mr. Porter. Were they rising in previous years, previous to this? Dr. Paul. Yes. The death rates--deaths have been rising from in the mid-40,000 range to 50,000 in the last year. I believe that would be the 1995 to 1996 year. And as I say, in the first six months of the most recent year that we have data for, the CDC indicates that the death rates are now beginning to diminish. demographic groups with increasing aids cases Mr. Porter. In which demographic groups is the annual number of new cases continuing to increase? Dr. Paul. Yes. Well, we are certainly seeing increases, of course, quite substantially, among women. Tragically, the numbers continue to increase and the proportional burden of this disease on members of minority populations are continuing to rise. As I indicated earlier, the number of new cases also amongst injecting drug users is increasing, and we are seeing a greater degree of transmission through heterosexual means. prospects for international availability of an aids vaccine Mr. Porter. The international picture of HIV infection is terribly bleak, as you said in your statement. Even if the unimaginable occurred and a promising vaccine candidate was identified tomorrow, how many years would it take for the vaccine to pass through testing and approval before reaching the international organizations that would sponsor its distribution? Dr. Paul. The general process through which trials are conducted, in which we do initial safety trials, is the so- called Phase I, and then, following the model that is used in drugs, we do trials that establish that the vaccine actually induces an immune response, which is the equivalent of Phase II trials. And then, finally, conducting efficacy trials. This is a period which probably cannot be accomplished in much less than four to five years. That would probably be, I would have to say, the lower limit of the time required, and that's probably if everything is working perfectly. Unfortunately in this business there are almost invariably needs for adjustments that have to be made. So were we to have in our hands tomorrow something which eventually proved to be an efficacious vaccine, I would guess-- if I said five years, that would probably be a very optimistic statement. But we would obviously want to push the pace of this as rapidly as we could. projected aids deaths without a vaccine Mr. Porter. Assuming current demographic trends in looking worldwide, how many people would die before the vaccine became available to them? Dr. Paul. Well, as I said earlier, the rates of new infections for the last year or two have been in the range of 3 million per year. The actual number of AIDS cases worldwide now is probably in the order of over 8 million. We have 29 million infections, and the reason for that discrepancy, of course, is that the epidemic is gathering force, so that many of those infected have not yet progressed to the point that they can be diagnosed as AIDS. Almost invariably, we will see the great burden occur several years out. But for every year that we don't have an effective vaccine, we can anticipate three to four million--and in the outyears, more--new infections. So to answer your question appropriately, I would say that failing good treatments, with the concept that every infected person in poor parts of the world will eventually succumb to this disease, each passing year is a minimum of 3 million in new deaths. Dr. Varmus. Just adding something, Mr. Porter, although vaccines are traditionally thought of as being preventive, there is the possibility of having vaccines that act in a therapeutic manner, and that would obviously affect the outcome. benefits of aids research to other diseases Mr. Porter. As you know, the committee is often drawn into the debate about whether an inappropriate share of NIH funding is devoted to AIDS research. Your budget justification described quite powerfully how advances in AIDS research have had an important impact in other disease areas. I wonder if you would highlight these examples today. Dr. Paul. Well, I would like to make several comments on that point. I think it is not fully appreciated what a remarkable accomplishment the antiretroviral therapy has been, not only because it has such a powerful impact on patients living with AIDS, but it really represents the first time there has been a concerted and rational effort to develop drugs to treat viral diseases. Until now we have had some drugs that can treat viruses, in various limited circumstances. Almost invariably, their ability to do so has been discovered in a--I would say, in a serendipitous manner. By contrast here, scientists have shown that if you take the virus apart piece by piece and examine how it works--with the aid, of course, and participation of the pharmaceutical industry--drugs can be made to treat virus diseases. That's an entirely paradigm-shifting concept. We have relied in the past on preventing virus diseases and treating bacterial diseases. I believe that this approach will herald an era when we will have the ability to undertake true treatments of viral diseases. So I believe this is, in a sense, a path-breaking concept which is largely due to the investment the Nation has made in HIV research. In addition, there has been an enormous increase in our attention to human immunology, to fundamental immunology. The advances in this area have enormous impact for a wide range of disorders, for virtually all of our autoimmune diseases, which include, of course, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile--so-called Type 1-- diabetes. The range of disorders which are actually caused by disrupted immune responses is quite staggering. So I believe that the scientific advances that have been made by my colleagues working in this area--and by my colleagues, of course, I mean the whole of the enterprise, which is a very considerable one--have very great implications for the health of the Nation and the world. flexibility for oar to change icd distributions Mr. Porter. Dr. Paul, I don't want to belabor a dispute of sorts that I believe has been resolved, but in last year's debate about the consolidated appropriation for AIDS funding one of the arguments raised was that because of changing circumstances, like the publication of the Levine Report, it was important to have flexibility to change the distribution of AIDS funding among Institutes. Yet from 1996 to 1997, the actual changes you made in the percentage of NIH AIDS funds allocated to each Institute were very, very small. In retrospect, was this argument just not relevant? Dr. Paul. Well, let me say, Mr. Porter, I believe that the consolidated appropriation has been a very effective tool for responding to these changes. I must also say that the authorities that the committee has given to the NIH for this purpose have worked rather well within the last year or two, and I might say that I believe in large measure that has been because we have been fortunate to have a set of personalities in the NIH Director and the directors of the key Institutes that work very effectively with our office, so that problems that might have occurred are just not issues. With regard, however, to your general point about the distribution of resources, I don't think it is entirely fair to say that we haven't really made changes amongst the Institutes. Indeed, if you will look in our proposal for fiscal year 1998 you will discern that the distribution isn't even. There are one or two Institutes that get quite substantial increases; there are a few Institutes that are actually receiving less in the way of proposed appropriations than in past years. We believe that these changes reflect the imperatives of the Levine Report, the need to increase investment in vaccine research, in human immunology, in prevention sciences. That logically drives the budget in certain directions. total aids research funding Mr. Porter. Well, again, we want to give you all the flexibility you need to do your work, obviously, and we would intend to do that this year as we have previously. Do you expect to change your estimate of the total amount of NIH funding targeted to AIDS research during 1997? Dr. Paul. Well, of course, that's an issue that would be decided, in association with my colleague on the right--that's a decision that impacts not only AIDS research, but non-AIDS research. But my personal view is that the current practice in which the AIDS research dollars are increasing, in concert with the total NIH appropriation, is a wise one. It must be recalled that we are now in a position in which the advances made in AIDS research have an impact on science in general; but of course, and it must be said very clearly, the great advances that we are seeing in all aspects of science supported by the NIH budget have enormous significance for AIDS research. And I don't believe that we can imagine the two out of step with one another. So I feel very comfortable about the proposal that we are putting forward for increases of a comparable magnitude. Dr. Varmus. I should also say that this is in accordance with the recommendations of the Levine Report, which argued that the amount of the budget that is allocated to AIDS research is appropriate and the issue is reallocation within that amount. Mr. Porter. It's going to be necessary to stand in recess because there is a vote on the floor, so the subcommittee will stand in recess until I return. [Recess.] Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. Dr. Paul, I apologize. I not only had to vote, but I had to answer press inquiries about your testimony. [Laughter.] three percent transfer authority Mr. Porter. Dr. Paul, do you and Dr. Varmus intend to use the 3 percent transfer authority we have provided in the 1997 bill to move AIDS funding between Institutes? Dr. Paul. Mr. Porter, we regard the transfer authority as a very valuable tool, but we also recognize that the Institutes need to plan ahead, and that moving resources in the middle of the year can be very disruptive to them. So we have taken the position that that transfer authority should be reserved for really special situations, particularly situations which our own discretionary fund cannot meet. So we regard it as an important authority, but one that we don't want to use simply for the sake of utilizing it. It ought to be reserved for very special events. So the answer is, I do not see today the need to utilize it in fiscal year 1997, but of course, some event could occur that might change that judgment. Dr. Varmus. Well, Mr. Porter, we did use my 1 percent transfer authority last year to shift some money to the AIDS domain, before the 3 percent authority was established. aids research proportion of total nih request Mr. Porter. Dr. Varmus, did the proportion of the fiscal year 1998 NIH budget request allocated for AIDS research change at all as it went through the Department and through OMB? Dr. Varmus. Not as a proportion of the total. Mr. Porter. How did it change? Dr. Varmus. It only changed because the total value for NIH changed. Mr. Porter. I see, like everything else changed? Dr. Varmus. That's correct. Mr. Porter. All right. Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller. No questions. Mr. Porter. Mr. Stokes. status of minority and women's health Mr. Stokes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Dr. Varmus and Dr. Paul. Dr. Varmus, as the hearings have progressed, I have on several occasions, as you know, inquired of various Institute heads regarding the status of minority health in our country today. Let me now ask you, as Director of the National Institutes of Health, what is the status of minority health in America? Dr. Varmus. As you know, it is---- Mr. Stokes. And let me include women also. So my question becomes what is the status of minority and women's health. Dr. Varmus. Well, that makes it a larger question, because the health problems are different. Mr. Stokes. Yes, they are. Dr. Varmus. It is difficult to encapsulate all the possible answers here in a short time. In general, the health of minorities is less robust than that of the majority population. That is particularly true in the roughly seven areas that we and you have identified-- cancer, violence, drug abuse, hepatitis and other liver diseases, and AIDS. Dr. Paul just recently reviewed the data that shows that minorities bear a disproportionate effect of HIV; 60 percent of the burden is on the minority community, which is about 22 percent of the population. Part of that discrepancy can be attributed to differences in socioeconomic status and health care, but other components are attributable to genetic differences and cultural differences, and other issues that we're trying to understand. role of the office of the director Mr. Stokes. In terms of minority health, the Office of the Director has a special role, would you agree? Dr. Varmus. We have a leadership role, and we have a role that is intended to promote efforts by the Institutes to support research that leads to the betterment of minority health, and to develop the capacity of minority scientists to contribute to the improvement of minority health. Mr. Stokes. In your opinion are you making any progress in terms of that responsibility? Dr. Varmus. We are in some ways. But in some ways it has been disappointing to me because, as you know, I would like to see parity of health for all people in this country. Mr. Stokes. I know. Dr. Varmus. We have, of course, continued to provide support for a variety of training programs. In general, the number of minority Ph.D.s has not changed very much over the years. But we have achieved an increase in the number of minority students at medical schools and, as a result, increased the number of minority M.D.s. I have noticed that we have seen an increased number of research project grants going to minority applicants, nearly a doubling since I became NIH Director. I am pleased by that. The number is still low in proportion to the minority population, but it is increasing with respect to the number of minority scientists. We have a very large investment in research that affects minority health. It is always very difficult to decide where the boundaries are, since many of our very large investments in cancer and hypertension and heart disease and diabetes and many other areas affect all populations. But when we try to look at those grant proposals that specifically target minority populations one way or another, we have well over $1 billion invested in those areas. minorities on research training grants Mr. Stokes. I understand that the National Institutes of Health has a requirement that underrepresented minorities be recruited onto regular research training grants. Is that correct? Dr. Varmus. Yes. Mr. Stokes. Okay. How does NIH enforce this requirement? Are you seeing any positive results in the numbers of minorities participating in these programs? Dr. Varmus. I have to get those numbers for you for the record. [The information follows:] Number of Minorities Recruited Into Regular Research Grants To comply with federal mandates, all questions related to race and gender are identified as optional on all NIH research grant applications. Although statistics vary from year to year, and across Institutes and Centers, a significant number of grant applicants, 25 percent in FY 1994, choose not to identify their race and/or gender. Since there is no way to predict accurately the race and/or gender composition of these applicants NIH is unable to identify accurately the number of applications submitted by minorities and women or the number of awards made to minorities and women. This information available is summarized in the tables below: GROWTH IN NUMBER OF RESEARCH PROJECT GRANTS [Fiscal year] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992 1993 24,964 24,899 and Hispanics........ 769 847 1,153 1,256 1,698 Percent increase............................... 10.1 36.1 8.9 35.2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GROWTH IN RESEARCH PROJECT GRANT AWARDS [Fiscal year] [Dollars in thousands] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992 RPGs..................................... $5,459,375 $5,657,630 $5,981,328 $6,194,524 $6,612,358 Percent increase............................... 3.6 5.7 African-Americans and Hispanics........ 158,161 192,523 35.8 8.8 48.3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We do ask, whenever the training programs are recompeted, that the directors of those programs provide us with information about recruitment of minorities into those programs. Mr. Stokes. Okay. Dr. Varmus. And I know that some programs have been penalized as a result of their failure to mount an active minority recruitment process. We also have to take into consideration not just the success of the minority recruitment effort, but also the efforts that are made. And when good faith efforts are made, we do allow some leniency, but we do require a good faith effort and evidence that the training program is seeking, particularly from minority schools and other places where minority candidates are likely to be, an effort to recruit those students into the programs. Mr. Stokes. Please feel free to expand upon your response in the record. Dr. Varmus. Absolutely. [The information follows:] Efforts To Recruit Minorities Into NIH Training Programs As part of the Minority Health Initiative (MHI), the NIH through the Office of Research on Minority Health (ORMH) focuses on the recruitment and retention of minorities in a wide array of biomedical research and health professions. In recognition of the underrepresentation of minorities in biomedical research, a systematic approach has been taken ranging from support of students at the precollege and undergraduate levels, through graduate/post doctoral and faculty training. ORMH collaborates with the National Science Foundation to support science and mathematics educational programs at the kindergarten level through grade 12, including classroom and laboratory research experiences for student participants, teacher training and standards-based curricula. Community-based outreach activities to encourage minority students to pursue biomedical careers are also conducted in collaboration with the HHS Office of Minority Health. At the same time, NIH continues to support the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) and the Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) programs--two primary undergraduate research training programs. The Minority High School Research Apprenticeship Program is continuing. ORMH funds a relatively new program called ``Bridges to the Future'' which encourages students at key transitional points in their education to continue for their bachelor's degree--if they started a two year college--at partner colleges and to continue to work toward the Ph.D. degree--if they attend terminal master's degree institutions--at a partner university. Also, the ORMH supports pre-existing NIH minority training and educational programs, international research training programs through the Fogarty International Center, as well as research supplements, for undergraduate students. A new program co-sponsored by the ORMH and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) has established a graduate/post doctoral neuroscience program at Morehouse Medical School. Further, the NIH continues to fund clinical associates programs and career development opportunities for minority faculty development. In the intramural program of NIH, a loan repayment program for young clinical researchers is aimed primarily at disadvantaged students. As with the health research agenda, the assessment/ evaluation underway by the ORMH will review these training initiatives to ensure that they are operating as they are intended. aids in minority populations Mr. Stokes. Dr. Paul, you may have already covered this because Dr. Varmus sort of indicated that prior to my coming in you had some comments relative to AIDS in minorities. I happen to sit on the International Advisory Committee on AIDS up at Harvard University. As you may know, this past October they had a council meeting where leaders from throughout the country were called there to Harvard to talk about the whole problem related to AIDS. I have just recently come from another meeting up there. Obviously, the minority community now has had an expansive growth in terms of AIDS. Is that correct? Dr. Paul. Tragically, it is correct. Mr. Stokes. Can you tell us what that situation is? Dr. Paul. Well, in terms of numbers, in the last year for which we have complete numbers, the new diagnoses, roughly 60 percent of those were amongst our minority community; and over the life of the epidemic, that number is in excess of 50 percent. So minority populations make up a disproportionate share of those infected and, unfortunately, a growing share. There are so many bad things about this epidemic, but this is one that I have always personally regarded as one of those especially tragic aspects of the character of the epidemic. aids research addressing minorities Mr. Stokes. Dr. Paul, how does your budget address this particular situation? Dr. Paul. Well, in several ways. Firstly, of course, we have taken very seriously the notion that we need to be certain that members of minority groups and women are adequately represented amongst our clinical trials and our natural history studies, because it is only through that process that we can be certain that the therapies that are developed and the understanding of the disease will reflect the particular characteristics of the disease in these populations. In our large clinical trials programs, minorities are represented in roughly the proportion in which they are represented amongst those who are affected by the disease. We have certain natural history studies, particularly those targeted at understanding the disease in women and the issue of perinatal transmission, in which minority participation is actually in excess of 80 percent, so that we will be gathering information which we believe has great impact on the disease in minorities. Further, I should say--and this is on a more worldwide scale--that the growing emphasis is on the need to find preventive measures, and particularly a vaccine. While of course it would benefit all who are at risk of the disease, since so much of that risk throughout this world occurs in the poorest parts of this world, I believe that were we to be successful in developing a vaccine--as I very much hope we will and have a degree of confidence that we will--that we will have great impact on individuals within the U.S. minority population. reluctance of minorities to participate in clinical trials Mr. Stokes. Let me ask you this. I recently had a conversation with a New York Times reporter who was writing an article about the fact that the Tuskegee syphilis study has had a negative impact upon the African American community, in that the community is very reluctant to subject itself to clinical trials. Are you aware of this, and can you comment on that for us? Dr. Paul. Well, it is certainly known that there is, in many of our minority populations, a substantial suspicion. We feel it is fundamentally unfounded, but we also understand the basis of that suspicion regarding the motives of those who are conducting trials. Now, we have, as part of our research enterprise, particularly in the behavioral aspects of that, efforts underway to determine mechanisms that are most effective in dealing with access to care, access to trials, and the institution of appropriate preventive measures amongst various populations that are culturally sensitive, because we recognize that different groups have different needs. Indeed, I would have to say, particularly in the prevention arena, there has been a growing recognition that one size does not fit all, that we need programs that are tailored to particular cultural groups, particular racial groups, if we're going to really have impact, and that is, I would say, a growing aspect of the way those studies are being conducted. Mr. Stokes. Thank you, Dr. Paul. Thank you, Dr. Varmus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Wicker. Mr. Wicker. I will pass, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. aids research proportion of nih funding Mr. Porter. Dr. Varmus, to confirm what you said earlier, if the committee is able to provide an increase larger than the 2.6 percent for NIH for 1998, will you continue to allocate the overall NIH percent of increase to AIDS research funding? In other words, if we are able to go to 3 percent, would then the funding for OAR be 3 percent also? Dr. Varmus. That is correct. proportional increases for nih institutes Mr. Porter. And is that the same for all Institutes? We would simply move up in percentage terms? Dr. Varmus. Well, we would do some negotiation, but in general, yes. The reason I hesitated slightly is that my objective in proposing increases is to be sure that we can capitalize on a number of proposals within the areas of NIH emphasis that I have outlined for you before. Many of the proposals that the Institute Directors made to me were not proposed for funding within the 2.6 percent budget. If a larger budget is available, I would like to be able to work with committee staff to try to develop a budget that allows us to take advantage of the many specific opportunities that Institute Directors have identified. Mr. Porter. Speaking for myself, you simply have to tell us what allocations you want to make, and we will attempt--we will, as far as I'm concerned--we will simply reflect your priorities. Dr. Varmus. Needless to say, I appreciate that. prevention science working group Mr. Porter. Dr. Paul, as you mentioned, one of the areas emphasized by the Levine panel was the need for enhanced research into AIDS prevention strategies. Has the prevention science panel headed by Dr. James Curran made its recommendations? Dr. Paul. Dr. Curran, as you know, is leading this panel that consists of some 10 members, derived from institutions outside NIH. They have made an initial set of recommendations. We had set aside a pool of resources that the Institutes could have access to this year in an effort to sort of ``jump start'' this prevention science process. They have made recommendations for the use of these resources; indeed, the Institutes are aware of them, and have responded to them with a large series of proposals. Indeed, we are going to make the distribution very shortly. Amongst the areas they have indicated would be studied, are behavioral studies in particular, revolving around the new therapies for HIV, how we can improve adherence to these difficult therapeutic regimens, dealing with the issues of HIV transmission by individuals under therapy. So that's one area they have focused on that is particularly important. They also stressed issues regarding maternal-to-fetal transmission, and particularly the behavioral and the non-vaccine biomedical prevention areas. A further area that they particularly focused on was research on injecting drug users, with particular emphasis on mechanisms to foster getting them into drug treatment so that techniques could be used to diminish the burden of injecting drug use as an approach, of course, to diminishing the risk that would adhere to those who are such users. But beyond that, we look to this group over the next several years to be providing a changing agenda that the Institutes can use in crafting their plans for the future. So they have an immediate task, which they've done, and a longer- term task, which they are in the process of carrying out. the new generation of aids researchers Mr. Porter. Last June, an article in Science Magazine suggested that a new generation of AIDS researchers appeared to be overtaking the pioneer AIDS researchers, although theynoted exceptions like Dr. Fauci, who ranks as a powerhouse in both groups. [Laughter.] Do you think this characterization of a changing guard is correct? And do you feel the new group of researchers is more collegial and less competitive, as the Science article asserts? [Laughter.] Dr. Paul Well, I like to look at it somewhat differently. I think there was a core of truth in the article, in the sense that there has been developed in AIDS research a young group of outstanding scientists, largely as a result of the Nation's investment in this field. First-rate scientists have grown up in this field and are doing terrific work. On the other hand, the ``old guard,'' as we put it, is not so very old---- [Laughter.] Dr. Paul [continuing]. And they are holding their own very well. So I like to think of it as having an expanded population of first-rate scientists, doing outstanding work. Inevitably, fields change and mature and develop; we see now a very good spirit of cooperation and collegiality among scientists. There always are controversies, but I think it reflects not so much the personalities as the maturation of the scientific field. Mr. Porter. The media loves to look at the controversies. I have other questions, and I assume other members do, for the record, which we would ask you to answer for the record for us. Again I want to say what a wonderful job you are doing, and the progress is simply the most heartwarming thing that we hear. We want to do everything we can to help you continue that progress. Dr. Paul. Thank you, Mr. Porter. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Paul. (The following questions were submitted to be answered for the record.] [Pages 2174 - 2248--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] ---------- Thursday, March 20, 1997. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES WITNESSES RUTH L. KIRSCHSTEIN, M.D., DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANTHONY ITTEILAG, DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR MANAGEMENT HAROLD VARMUS, M.D., DIRECTOR STEVEN C. BENOWITZ, EXECUTIVE OFFICER STEPHEN A. FICCA, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF RESEARCH SERVICES DENNIS P. WILLIAMS, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUDGET, DHHS Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. Next we are pleased to welcome Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, the Deputy Director of NIH, to testify on the Office of the Director; and Dr. Harold Varmus, to testify on buildings and facilities. Dr. Varmus. I am going to begin, Mr. Porter. First of all, let me just say that in view of the limited time available, Dr. Kirschstein and I are going to make very brief remarks to cover these two topics and leave as much time as possible for the questioning. Introduction of Witnesses I am accompanied here today, in addition to Dr. Kirschstein, whom you know well as our Deputy Director, by Mr. Steve Benowitz, who is the Executive Officer of the Office of the Director, Mr. Tony Itteilag, who is the Deputy Director for Management, and by Mr. Steve Ficca, who is the Director of the Office of Research Services. Opening Statement The function of the Office of the Director is to provide leadership for the entire NIH and coordination among its components. The budget request for the OD this year, provided in your summary, is $234,247,000, excluding AIDS. There are four general domains of our activity in the Office of the Director: first, to provide management services for the intramural research program, the extramural research program, and the general administrative functions of the NIH. In those domains we have continued emphasis on our streamlining proposals, reinvention proposals that the Administration has fostered, including electronic grant submissions and electronic reporting of inventions and many other such streamlining activities. We also are moving ahead, as I described in my opening statement a couple of weeks ago, in improving our information technology and in the recruitment of a central information officer, and we are also trying, through our administrative functions, to help control research management and support spending, as directed by this committee, and we are carrying out a study which you have requested and that we talked about very, very briefly at the time of my initial statement here. In the policy domain, we have a variety of activities that range from technology transfer to science education to ethical and economic issues that affect the NIH, and we coordinate reports on a wide variety of topics we've discussed here before, ranging from AIDS to clinical research, gene therapy, recent reviews of the Institute directors, and many other topics. Program coordination in certain areas, particularly those that have been Congressionally mandated as requiring special offices for coordination, is carried out by a series of offices that Dr. Kirschstein will review in just a moment, and we have the function in our office of overseeing buildings and facilities--I'll come back to that after Dr. Kirschstein has spoken. Before I turn the microphone over to her let me make two points about overriding issues that affect our function in the Office of the Director. First, we are trying to make the Office of the Director into a unit that serves the Institutes, Centers, and Divisions in the most effective possible way. We are trying to foster cooperation and unity of purpose among the Institutes. If there is any legacy that I would like to leave the NIH, it is the legacy that the NIH is one large agency in which there are many autonomous parts, and that those parts work collegially together, though maintaining an appropriate level of autonomy for the Institutes and Centers while encouraging a sense of unit, of purpose. That is an important component of what we're trying to do. This direction is symbolized by our annual retreat that we talked about before. We discuss matters as trivial as the use of the NIH logo in all communications of research findings by different Institutes, and a variety of coordinated activities that range from research topics we've discussed here to competitive service centers that provide administrative activities. The second general point I would like to make concerns budget formulation within the President's budget. The Office of the Director shows a decline in our budget request, and that's true for a number of reasons. We show little or no growth in most of our offices because we are trying to protect our budget priority, which is research carried out by research project grants. We are not requesting any new research earmarks, including those that were provided in our 1997 appropriation bill. We are trying to restrict our research management and service monies, as we have agreed to with this committee in the past. And we rationalize the restrained growth of program offices by recognizing that research is done by the Institutes and Centers; the program offices are there to stimulate research in those targeted areas, to coordinate that research and to inform the public. These functions have largely been established, and these offices have a very small commitment base because of very small continuation costs. They are not, for the most part, funding the bulk of the research. I would like to extend this discussion of the program offices by turning the microphone over to Dr. Kirschstein. Opening Statement--Dr. Kirschstein Dr. Kirschstein. Thank you, Dr. Varmus. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, as Dr. Varmus said, cooperation over trans-NIH activities occurs through the special programs and the special program offices which were developed and have been established to improve the health of women, minorities, and the medically underserved, to support research in the social and behavioral sciences, and to encourage research in prevention and in rare diseases, dietary supplements, and alternative and complementary medicine. The Office of Research on Women's Health serves as the focal point for research related to health and disease in women, for policies regarding the inclusion of women and minorities in research studies, and for activities to assure that all NIH research studies include women and minorities as subjects, and to continue programs to increase the number of women in biomedical research careers. The Office of Research on Minority Health and the Minority Health Initiative provide continued funding to improve the health of and address the highest priority health needs of minority populations, as well as to improve the preparation of minority scientists for careers in biomedical sciences. Behavioral patterns and social status are risk factors in an array of diseases, and it is the role of the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research to encourage such studies. This includes a trans-NIH initiative for research in the four leading health risk factors in the United States: physical inactivity, smoking, diet, and alcohol abuse. The maintenance of health and the prevention of disease are critical to the length and quality of life, and that is the job of the Office of Disease Prevention, through a number of subunits within it. One of the major ones, in which this committee has had great interest, is the Women's Health Initiative, which is a $628 million, 15-year project involving more than 164,000 women, aged 50 to 79. It is to study strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporosis in older women. The 1998 budget request for that office is $54.7 million, and that's a decrease from last year's level, but it's a decrease which was based on plans because the recruitment phase of the study will be completed in May, 1998, and then the study will go on at a decreasing rate as data are accumulated and are analyzed. The initiative, therefore, is on target as far as budget and schedule. One of the important things that is of great interest, I think, is that we expect to reach the goal of 20 percent of the participants of the study to be minority women, and this is probably the largest number of minority women ever studied in a research setting in the United States. As interest in alternative medicine increases, the NIH has research in that area with the Office of Alternative Medicine, which was established to investigate and validate therapies which are outside the general stream of therapy, and to recommend research programs to test fully the most promising of these practices. These are in areas of cancer, drug addiction, asthma, and the study of pain; and in addition, in fiscal year 1998, we plan to make an award, after peer review of applications, to a yet-to-be-selected, Congressionally-mandated chiropractic center to foster chiropractic-related research. We have an Office of Rare Diseases which provides information on rare diseases and conditions. These are diseases which have a prevalence of less than 200,000 cases a year, and the office is very important in linking researchers interested in those diseases with families across the country that have such diseases within their families. The Office of Dietary Supplements was the most recently established office, in 1996, to support research related to the role of dietary supplements in maintaining health and disease. It is conducting a study to determine what types of information are needed to respond to the public's questions regarding dietary supplements. The one other program I would like to mention is through the Office of Intramural Research, which coordinates the loan repayment program at NIH and will initiate a new clinical research loan repayment program to repay the educational loans of people who go into clinical investigation. We are particularly interested, again, in attempting to increase the number of minority physicians and scientists who go into clinical investigation. With that, I think we will stop so that you will have as much time as you need for questions. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 2253 - 2256--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] buildings and facilities Dr. Varmus. Let me just finish briefly, Mr. Porter, with a brief presentation on buildings and facilities. We are requesting $190 million this year for buildings and facilities. The major request is for continuation of the financing of the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, for which you appropriated $90 million last year. Let me give you a very brief status report on that project. At last year's appropriations hearings we told you that we had hired a distinguished West Coast architect, Zimmer Gunse & Frasca Partnership, to carry out the design. We have since hired a construction manager, McCarthy Brothers from St. Louis. The negotiations with those entities are carried out through our contract manager, Boston Properties, and administered through the GSA. We expect design development to reach the 50 percent completion point in March of 1998. We will have a groundbreaking ceremony, we believe, this fall, with official excavation of the building site to occur next summer. We expect occupancy at the end of 2001. Other items in the B&F request are mainly renovations and to upgrade our utilities infrastructure and modernize our buildings, many of these projects reflecting a legacy of infrastructural neglect over the years. About half of our buildings are over 35 years old. Those items are catalogued in the submission and I don't think I'll go through them in detail. I will note that Building 50, for which we have received complete appropriations in 1997, will soon start construction and we expect to occupy that new, consolidated laboratory facility in the year 2000. Now we would like to open the floor for questions on all the topics that we have addressed. Thank you. [The prepared statement follows:] [Pages 2258 - 2261--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] radiology and imaging Mr. Porter. Thank you, Dr. Varmus and Dr. Kirschstein. I have a couple of unrelated questions I would like to ask. I believe you answered this in our earlier hearings, Dr. Varmus, but what view do you have on creating a separate NIH Institute for Radiology? Dr. Varmus. Mr. Porter, radiology and other imaging modalities are incredibly important and have attracted a great deal of attention, both in our intramural and extramural research programs. We have, through the Office of Intramural Research, carried out a study of our intramural radiographic and imaging facilities and personnel, and are trying to coordinate that very carefully. My personal belief--and very strong belief--is that radiology and imaging are fundamental to the activities of many--perhaps most--of our Institutes, that to put those activities into a single Institute would not serve science and would create additional administrative costs that I would not endorse. Mr. Porter. I knew that was your answer. [Laughter.] cholestin But I've been asked about it recently. I imagine that when we have an Office of Chiropractic Research, or an Office of Dietary Supplements, that radiologists feel short-changed that they don't have something specific for themselves. It's simply human nature. Thank you for that answer. This question is probably an FDA question, but I'm very curious about this. Have you ever heard of a product called Cholestin? Dr. Varmus. I heard about it roughly 15 minutes ago. [Laughter.] A series of calls back to the campus have failed to produce the information that you request. Mr. Porter. Well, I wonder, because this was advertised in a national news magazine, and it makes health claims. It says, ``In fact, Cholestin's exclusive all-natural ingredients have been clinically proven to lower cholesterol levels an average of 25 to 40 points in just eight weeks.'' That would be, it would seem to me, a violation of the law unless they actually can substantiate the health claim. It is obviously sold over the counter. Dr. Varmus. By tomorrow we will have---- Mr. Porter. Yes. I am very curious as to how they can do this---- Dr. Varmus. We will see. crc advanced appropriations Mr. Porter [continuing]. Because it is making remarkable health claims that, it seems to me, must be unsubstantiated. Your budget requests $90 million for the next fiscal year for the second installment of the clinical center construction, but it also requests advance funding for 1999 and 2000---- Dr. Varmus. That's correct. crc cost estimates Mr. Porter [continuing]. For the remaining costs of the project. Why should the committee provide the entire cost of the construction now without access to the more accurate cost estimates being developed? Dr. Varmus. Well, this is a recommendation from OMB, with the intention of ensuring that the monies necessary for completing the project will be available. Now, as you point out quite correctly, we will not have an absolutely accurate cost assessment until sometime further along in the process of design development. I have provided for the committee members some current pictures of what we believe the general design of the building will look like, but obviously these are preliminary sketches. They need to be revised in accord with budget estimates. As you know, our initial projection for the cost of the clinical research center we thought to be programmatically appropriate was around $380 million. That estimate was revised down, in consultation with OMB, to $330 million for the entire project, and we're working within that number to try to develop an architectural plan. [Clerk's note.--Later corrected to ``333''.] We believe that we can work within that plan, and we will be reporting back to the committee about the correspondence between design requirements and cost estimates. Mr. Porter. Well, somehow I doubt that this subcommittee or our counterparts in the Senate are going to allow a half- completed building out on your campus, so I think---- Dr. Varmus. That is our hope. [Laughter.] Mr. Porter. As we discussed last year, precise cost estimates for construction of the clinical center will not be available until the detailed design and space programming are completed. What instructions have you given the planners in developing cost estimates? Have you directed them to fit the project within the OMB estimate of the $310 million remaining, or have you asked them to develop an accurate cost estimate regardless of whether it turns out to be above or below the $310 million figure? Dr. Varmus. Well, in a sense, both. My intention is to develop a plan that will be within the $333 million--the $310 million remaining--for the project. We have to take into consideration what the bed needs and laboratory needsare going to be. The guidance at the moment is to give us the best plan they can within the recommended budgetary amount, and if we encounter a discrepancy between programmatic needs and what can be constructed, we will face that at that point. renovation of clinical center Mr. Porter. We are frequently asked what NIH will do with the existing clinical center building, once some of the functions are moved to the new facility. Understanding that it may be difficult to have a firm strategy for a period five to ten years from now, what longer-term plans do you have for the original building? Is it most likely that the space would be used for labs? Dr. Varmus. Yes. The proposal--of course, it is not a detailed one as yet--is to use as much of the space as possible for offices and laboratories. There will be requirements for continual renovation because that building, as you know, has inadequate facilities infrastructure, and we will need to improve the utilities there. We estimate it may cost us $20 million to $30 million a year over a time period of 10 to 15 years to bring that building completely into conformance with modern design stipulations. But we expect that most of the building will be used, even as the new building is completed. But there will be parts of it that will be undergoing renovation in a multi-phase process. Mr. Porter. And did you say you had cost estimates for renovation? Dr. Varmus. Not precise ones, no. But we think--Mr. Ficca may want to correct me on this--the estimates that we've looked at suggest that if we plan to phase the renovation over 10 to 15 years, we may have costs of around $20 million to $30 million a year. administrative cost study Mr. Porter. Now, you mentioned the administrative cost study that you are conducting, at my suggestion. I am encouraged by your serious efforts so far to make the study comprehensive and wide-ranging, and we are pleased that you were able to persuade Jack Mahoney to head up this effort. Can you tell us more about how you are structuring the study? Have you yet selected a contractor? Dr. Varmus. We are in the process of doing the contractor selection. We had six candidates; we have looked at their credentials very carefully and they have been interviewed, and we hope to be able to announce a decision very, very shortly. Mr. Porter. There are many administrative cost centers you could target in your study. What areas have you selected as first tier issues to be examined, and why? Dr. Varmus. Well, we attempted to identify areas in which we felt we could have a major impact. The first tier of areas to be targeted are buildings and facilities functions, equal opportunity functions, finance, logistics, mail and printing services, personnel and human resources, procurement, safety and security, and space and facility management. Mr. Porter. That sounds like everything. Dr. Varmus. It's not everything. [Laughter.] If you want to hear the second tier, I can give you that. There's a lot left. [Laughter.] But we chose areas where we thought there might be administrative overlap, there might be opportunity for reduction in costs, where we thought we might be able to develop centralized services, based on past experience in trying to generate some competitive service centers. But I think these are the areas where we can get our greatest gains, and we will of course keep you informed as we move along with them. unified information technology system Mr. Porter. We understand that you are attempting to integrate all the computer systems on the NIH campus into a unified information technology system, and that you are recruiting a chief information officer. What does this project entail in terms of staffing and expenditures? Dr. Varmus. I may have to have someone else help me with the cost for staffing and expenditures, but let me explain that over the last several years, as computers have become much more important in the daily lives of everybody at NIH, whether researchers or administrators, we have had a ``tower of Babel'' on campus with respect to efforts to develop optimal information systems. At one recent count there were 37 committees working on information technology development in a manner that was not completely cohesive. At our recent Institute Directors' retreat, there was a community-wide resolve to put an end to this Babel and to coordinate our information technology development in a way that would produce euphony. The result was putting together a committee that didn't cost us anything--just NIH employees who worked diligently and brought a report to me within about six weeks, that outlined a strategy for normalizing an information system that would allow free communication between Institutes, that would protect the privacy of information, and that would allow what we call ``interoperability,'' even though the hardware might be different in different Institutes. We have also resolved to hire a chief information officer, as you noted. That will cost us some money, obviously. There will be a need to have a highly-trained and well-experienced person come to the NIH to coordinate our information services. He or she will need an office and a few people. We believe, however, that given the importance of information services to everyone at NIH, that this will produce savings. I don't know if anyone on my staff is willing to estimate what the savings would be, but I believe that there is little doubt that an investment in our information technology is going to have major dividends. We already know from the activities that Wendy Baldwin has carried out in the Office of Extramural Research that we can make tremendous improvements in, for example, grant submission, invention reporting, and many other activities through an improvement in our computer technology. Mr. Porter. Mr. Itteilag is shaking his head no, he doesn't want to make a cost savings estimate. [Laughter.] Mr. Porter. We will bring this up next year and see where we are. Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller. I think---- Mr. Porter. You're going to yield to Mr. Wicker? Mr. Miller. I'll come back. Mr. Porter. And go to the end of the line? Mr. Miller. Trade places. Mr. Porter. Yes, you may. You yield to Mr. Wicker. office of alternative medicine Mr. Wicker. Well, I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your allowing me to go out of line. I just want to ask a few questions about this Office ofAlternative Medicine. How long has the office been established? Dr. Kirschstein. The office was established in 1992, I believe. It was not completely functioning in 1993 when Dr. Varmus and I came, and it really began in earnest, if you will, somewhat later. Mr. Wicker. In 1994? Dr. Kirschstein. In 1994. herbal medications Mr. Wicker. Well, I noticed that you are planning to look into herbal medications. What is the difference between herbal medications and the practice of pharmacognosy which, as you know, is using natural products to develop prescription drugs? And will this Office of Alternative Medicine be considering pharmacognosy as it considers herbal medications? Dr. Kirschstein. I believe it will. I would like to ask the director of the office to give you a more specific answer, unless Dr. Varmus would do that. Dr. Varmus. This office, of course, is coordinating research that is carried out by the Institutes. It doesn't have grant authority of its own. We would welcome at the NIH applications to study any herbal medications that are thought to have efficacy. One of the ways in which such medicines might be studied would be to use traditional chemical methods to try to identify the pharmacologically-active compounds in an herbal preparation. Classically, this has been the way many medications--digitalis, taxol, quinine, and many others--have been identified, and then further improved through pharmaceutical chemistry to make better medications. Mr. Wicker. So the office itself will not contract for the research? The office will coordinate with various---- Dr. Varmus. It would encourage Institutes to take an interest in areas that are brought to the attention of the office. Mr. Wicker. And will the various Institutes, do you think, be contracting with universities? Dr. Varmus. Well, not necessarily contracting with, but inviting applications from. office of dietary supplements Mr. Wicker. Inviting applications from universities to participate in this research. All right. I notice that you mentioned the Office of Dietary Supplements. I guess that means vitamins, is that right? Dr. Varmus. Vitamins and other things. Dr. Kirschstein. Vitamins and other additions to the diet. That office was established in 1996 by Congressional mandate, and has been actively developing a data base regarding the various dietary supplements. Vitamins are a very important part of that, and probably one of the major parts. medical nutrition therapy Mr. Wicker. Well, I don't know if this question deals with the Office of Dietary Supplements or the Office of Alternative Medicine, but is the NIH coordinating any research concerning the area of medical nutrition therapy, which I think is a term of art? And I might add that Representative Nancy Johnson, I understand, has a bill to allow Medicare to cover medical nutrition therapy. And I would ask further, before I allow you to comment on all of this, the Lewin Group apparently has commissioned a study which was released only recently, and it estimates that medical nutrition therapy would save $11 million in the year 2001, and increase up to a savings of $65 million in the year 2004. So I just ask you what you are doing, if anything, with regard to medical nutrition therapy, and if you are aware of any study by the Lewin Group about this treatment. Dr. Varmus. I am not aware of the Lewin study. We do have an Office of Nutrition that exists within the NIDDK that works closely with the Office of Dietary Supplements. I don't know what medical nutrition therapy is explicitly, but I'd be happy to provide that information for the record and find out whether either of the two offices are doing anything explicitly on that topic. [The information follows:] Medical Nutrition Therapy Medical nutrition therapy refers to specific services provided by dietitians and health care providers. In the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1995 (H.R. 2247) this therapy is covered under part B of the medicare program and defined as services provided by registered dietitians and nutrition professionals only when referred by a physician. This bill defines medical nutrition therapy services as: ``nutrition diagnostic, therapy and counseling service which are furnished by or under the supervision of a registered dietitian or nutrition professional who is legally authorized to furnish such services under the state law of the state in which services are furnished, as would otherwise be covered if furnished by a physician or as an incident to a physicians' professional services.'' The Lewin report to which this reference is made has not yet been released (the report will be titled ``The Cost of Covering Medical Nutrition Therapy under Medicare: 1998 through 2004''). This report was commissioned by the American Dietetic Association with The Lewin Group. The report presents the results of an econometric study of covering medical nutrition therapy as a Part B benefit of the Medicare program. The study included 16,000 Medicare patients with diabetes, and 38,000 with cardiovascular disease who participate in the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. This ground health plan has provided coverage for medical nutrition therapy through visits with registered dietitians for over six years. Most health care programs do not include this benefit. The preliminary results without a narrative interpretation have been orally presented to the American Dietetic Association (ADA) by the contractor (The Lewin Group). The ADA has in turn shared their interpretation of these results with members of Congress because the data appear in part to support their contention that extension of Medicare coverage to include medical nutrition therapy would reduce health care costs. The inclusion of this benefit would provide coverage for dietetics services. NIDDK Medical Nutrition Research The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 identified the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) as the lead institute for coordinating trans-NIH nutrition research. The Division of Nutrition Research Coordination (DNRC), which was transferred from the Office of the Director, NIH, to the NIDDK synthesizes and leads the trans-NIH focus for nutrition. NIDDK supports major clinical trials and basic research studies to investigate both the role of diet and specific nutrients in prevention and treatment of disease, and the specific role of nutrients and other dietary components in the development of disease. An example of a major recent research effort is the trans-NIH Bionutrition Initiative. The Initiative is supporting research on the defective mechanisms as well as the normal processes involved in the direct roles of specific nutrients on cellular, genetic, and metabolic processes, and potential clinical applications. Recently completed major clinical trials, such as the Diabetes Control Complications Trial (DCCT) and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study, both contained important dietary components. The DCCT examined whether intensive treatment with the goal of maintaining normal blood glucose levels could decrease the risk of diabetes complications. A diet and exercise plan was a component of the DCCT. The results indicate that intensive control of blood sugar levels effectively delays the onset and slows the advancement of diabetic eye disease, foot disease, and nerve damage in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The MDRD tested whether low protein diets and rigorous blood pressure control could slow or prevent the development of various kidney diseases. Study results indicate that below- normal blood pressure levels have a favorable impact on deteriorating kidney function, particularly in patients with proteinuria. The associated effect of protein restriction is less potent than blood pressure reduction. In June 1996, the NIDDK launched the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial. This major trial will explore the feasibility of preventing or delaying the onset of noninsulin- dependent or adult onset diabetes. The DPP will identify volunteers with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) levels between 100 and 139. An ``intensive lifestyle'' intervention, which consists of a diet and exercise program designed to help volunteers achieve and maintain a seven percent weight loss, is one of four treatment regimens that are being studied. This six-year study is recruiting individuals who are at high risk of developing diabetes, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders. NIDDK will receive additional support from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the NIH Office of Minority Health. In addition to these clinical investigations, basic research on nutrient metabolism, the relative proportion of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in the diet, and on energy metabolism serves as the foundation for the design of medical nutrition therapy and dietary guidance provided to both patients and the public. Across the NIH, similar research serves as a foundation for nutritional recommendations in areas of relevant illnesses, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Mr. Wicker. All right. Well, I would be very interested in your following up with my office on it. Dr. Varmus. As a matter of interest, was the savings millions or billions? Mr. Wicker. I have ``millions'' here. But as the late Everett Dirksen said, it all eventually adds up to real money. [Laughter.] So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to go out of order on this. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Wicker. Mr. Stokes. ORWH's budget level Mr. Stokes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Varmus, Dr. Kirschstein, what is your current budget for the Office of Research on Women's Health? Dr. Varmus. The amount in 1997 is $17,241,000. Mr. Stokes. Can you give us some idea of what your plans are for future appropriation requests for this office? Dr. Varmus. That's the 1997 estimate. The President's budget for that office is $17,423,000. Mr. Stokes. Okay. Is there an increase there? Dr. Varmus. Yes. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, this office, like all the offices, is receiving a very small increase in the President's budget request to preserve as much money as possible for the highest priorities, the grants that would serve all these areas. Mr. Stokes. This office has an important role on research on women's health and has responsibility for collaborating with the Institutes and Centers of the NIH in promoting research on women's health. How high a priority does the Office of the Director give to this particular function? Dr. Varmus. We give it a high priority. I emphasize again, Mr. Stokes, as I've said before, that it seems to me that the important functions here are coordinating and instruction and the provision of supplementary money to encourage the Institutes to make the major investments in these areas, and I believe that the important thing for us to do in tight budgetary times is to continue to provide the Institutes with the funds required to support research projects, which will be encouraged even by slightly smaller amounts. I think the number of supplements and co-funding enterprises carried out by the office is actually more important than the actual dollar value that is in each of the supplements. national agenda on research on women's health Mr. Stokes. I note, Dr. Varmus, that the Office of Research on Women's Health is in the process of updating the National Agenda on Research in Women's Health. How is that office reaching out to ensure that issues of minority populations are incorporated into the development of the newAgenda on Research on Women's Health? Dr. Varmus. I think Dr. Kirschstein would like to answer that. Mr. Stokes. Dr. Kirschstein? Dr. Kirschstein. That office has been very active in that regard. As you know, Mr. Stokes, Dr. Vivian Pinn is the director of that office. She has been long active not only in women's health areas, but in minority health areas as well. Mr. Stokes. She is a very distinguished lady. Dr. Kirschstein. Yes. In order to update the original agenda, which was set some years ago at a conference in Hunt Valley which I had the honor to chair, Dr. Pinn and her staff are doing several conferences around the country which will reach out to people interested in women's health and the health of women in all groups, majority women, African American women, Hispanic women, American Indian women, in order to see what the gaps still are, and then we will update their agenda. women in biomedical careers Mr. Stokes. Dr. Kirschstein, part of the mandate of the Office of Research on Women's Health is to enhance women in biomedical careers. What efforts are underway to increase minority scientists as investigators in women's health research? Dr. Kirschstein. One of the things we have found, and I know Dr. Pinn has found as well, is that very often, when one provides small incentives in terms of small amounts of money for studies in women's health or in the health of minorities, the individuals who are particularly interested in carrying out those projects are women or minority scientists themselves. Dr. Pinn's efforts, through the Office of Research on Women's Health, are to encourage women scientists who have been out of the workforce for some time because of family responsibilities, to reenter careers and to develop fellowships to provide them with the updating necessary. Also, encouraging young women-- minority women in particular--to enter science, is going to and will continue to, in one way or another, pay off in that regard. marc and mbrs programs Mr. Stokes. OK. Earlier in your testimony today you mentioned the MARC and MBRS programs. Dr. Kirschstein. Not particularly here, but I love to talk about those programs all the time, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes. I know you do, and you've had that responsibility for a number of years. I know that's a program that you have your heart in, and I appreciate that. Over the years the Committee has advocated increased funding on behalf of many of the NIH minority programs, but specifically the MARC and the MBRS programs. Can you clarify for me whether this Committee directed any increase through the Office of the Director for any expansion in these efforts? Dr. Kirschstein. I don't think the Office of the Director provided specific increases to those programs. Dr. Marvin Cassman was testifying just two days ago and did mention those programs. He has worked diligently, along with the Director of Minority Opportunities for Research Programs--the More Program--who has the responsibility for MARC and MBRS, to increase those programs, and particularly to increase the effectiveness of those programs. They have worked very hard to have the students in those programs enter biomedical sciences. One of the things that has clearly happened is something Dr. Varmus mentioned previously, which is that there has been a real increase through the efforts of MARC and MBRS, for minority students to enter medical careers. It has been, as you know, more difficult to persuade them--with, perhaps, good reason--to enter into fields that are not so medically driven. On the other hand there is an increase, therefore, in medically-trained minority investigators whom, we hope, will be moving into clinical research. Dr. Varmus. I might just add that Dr. Ruffin, who as you know is the head of our Office of Research on Minority Health, has been aggressive and imaginative in establishing a number of other minority training programs, including the Bridges to the Future Program and other undergraduate training programs that are funded through other minority research initiatives. minority funding increases Mr. Stokes. I was about to move into that area, Dr. Varmus, because, as you know, I have a keen interest in the viability of the NIH Minority Health Initiative and the Office of Minority Health. How does the recommended increases for these programs compare to the overall increase in the NIH budget? Dr. Varmus. It is lower, and it is lower for the reasons that I outlined before. These are programs which provide supplements and encouragement to programs and grants that are run by the Institutes. My primary concern, in this fiscal situation that we're in of a fairly modest increase for NIH as a whole, is to preserve the ability of the Institutes and Centers to be able to make new grants. I believe, in consultation with Dr. Ruffin, that the office can continue to provide that stimulation of interest in these programs without an appreciable increase in the financing of the initiative. Mr. Stokes. Well, let me ask you this. When these two important programs were established and funded by this Subcommittee, it was contemplated that these resources and program activities would be utilized as an opportunity to sort of ``prime the pump'' at the other NIH institutes. The goal was to improve their overall effort to solving problems associated with the health status disparity that exists in the Nation among minorities when compared to non-minorities. I am concerned that, instead, these funds have become the primary source of NIH funds dedicated to research on minority health. Is that correct? Dr. Varmus. That isn't so, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes. It's not so? Dr. Varmus. No, it's not so. Mr. Stokes. Then, what is the situation? Dr. Varmus. I believe the office is still serving the ``pump-priming'' function. There have been very appreciable increases, well ahead of the overall increases for NIH, in previous years. The amount of money that NIH spends on minority health, as I explained, is a number that is open to definitional issues, but a conservative estimate is well over a billion dollars, roughly $1.2 billion. And, of course, the Minority Health Initiative is, in total, I think, about $61 million. So the office is serving the priming function that you described, and I think it is doing so very well. funding for minority researchers Mr. Stokes. An article appeared in the Chronicle of Higher Education pointing out that a relatively minor amount of NIH's budget is awarded to minority researchers. Has that situation improved any? Dr. Varmus. Yes, it has, Mr. Stokes. That article appeared, I believe, in 1992 or 1993---- Mr. Stokes. It appeared in 1993, actually. Dr. Varmus [continuing]. And reflected numbers from 1991. Mr. Stokes. That is right. Dr. Varmus. And all is not as well as you and I would like it to be, but I recently found some figures that I think will provide encouragement to you as they do to me, suggesting that since I came to NIH in 1993, the number of research project grants awarded to African Americans and Hispanics has doubled from roughly 850 to roughly 1,700. Now, that is probably an underestimate, because not all applicants for our grants self- declare their racial identity; but nevertheless, while the number is proportionately lower than the number of underrepresented minorities in the research population by about two-to three-fold, it still augurs well for the future and I believe it does reflect a number of things, including the effect of our training programs, our interest in trying to promote minority health, and the technical workshops we have provided for a number of institutions to try to improve the ability of minority applicants to compete successfully for our grants. Mr. Stokes. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? Mr. Porter. Your time has expired, I am sorry to say. Mr. Stokes. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Miller. minority research grants Mr. Miller. Mr. Chairman, I have a couple questions to follow up on what Mr. Stokes asked about minorities. For grants, if you are a minority, does that give you an advantage in receiving a grant? Dr. Varmus. No. Mr. Miller. How are you able to double the number of grants to minorities? Dr. Varmus. I think by improving the quality of applications that come from minority investigators, and training more effective minority investigators, and by providing them with better facilities. minority funding Mr. Miller. You say that of your budget, $1.2 billion can be identified as minority---- Dr. Varmus. No, no. We have identified roughly $1.2 billion as research that pertains to minority health; that is, it addresses issues that are special concerns. As I explained to Mr. Stokes a little earlier, this is a difficult problem definitionally because one could argue that since diabetes affects minority populations more profoundly than it does majority populations by some modest measure, that any research on diabetes is working to the benefit of minority health. So what we try to do is identify within that portfolio those projects which are specifically targeting problems that especially affect minority populations or use minority populations in greater numbers in clinical trials, or look, for example, at the pattern of diabetes pathogenesis among the Pima Indians, and therefore it can be categorized as a minority effort. Mr. Miller. Do you have a report that summarizes how that $1.2 billion--I missed the session; you did have one presentation that included minority issues earlier, last month. But where did you get the $1.2 billion? Do you have a report that reflects that and shows how that was derived? Dr. Varmus. Yes, I believe we do. The number comes, of course, from the various ways in which we catalog all of our research. But we certainly can provide for you the information that you require about how those numbers are developed and what they represent. [The information follows:] [Page 2273--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] quotas Mr. Miller. You do not use quotas in biomedical research? Dr. Varmus. We do not. undergraduate and secondary education Mr. Miller. What do you do in the area of undergraduate and even secondary education? Do you get involved in that? Dr. Varmus. Yes, we do. In fact, Dr. Kirschstein is involved in some of these---- Mr. Miller. Not just minorities, but in all areas? Dr. Varmus. In all areas. We do that through a variety of mechanisms, some being the kinds of minority training programs that have already been mentioned briefly, and Dr. Kirschstein might elaborate on them, but also through our Office of Science Education, which is providing outreach to many schools in this area--and of course, many of those schools do have very large minority populations. Secretary Shalala and I were just this week, for example, at Eastern High School, where they have an academy that is sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services, and we were there promoting the interest of those young people in science in a school that is almost entirely African American. So there are many ways in which we do outreach. We could very easily provide you with a list of those activities. Mr. Miller. There is another vote coming, so let me just proceed. Maybe you can get me that information. [The information follows:] [Pages 2275 - 2288--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] nih organizational structure Mr. Miller. In sitting through the presentations, not only today but all the time, I see--I haven't heard from the Pentagon recently, but they're very big with acronyms, and I see you are, too----[Laughter.] Mr. Miller [continuing]. But I think I counted 12 new ones here. Mr. Porter talked about the administrative study. The question I have is, the Office of Science Policy or the Office Intramural Research or the Office of Dietary Supplements--you never close those down, I'm sure. Mr. Porter asked the question in the area of imaging; you're not going to create one. In the area of AIDS, you did not create a new Institute, because five years from today or ten years from today it may be a very different situation. Basically, you can never shut one down. I mean, I'm a business school professor; the number of people that have to report to you probably violates all organizational management charts. I would hate to see your organizational chart right now. Dr. Varmus. Oh, I don't think it's all that bad. [Laughter.] Mr. Miller. Well, how many Institutes are there? There are 17 or 18 Institutes? Dr. Varmus. Well, 22. Mr. Miller. And then all of the offices. Dr. Varmus. Institutes and Centers. It depends on what you call them. Mr. Miller. Okay. Dr. Varmus. And then there are some Divisions that are independent, as well. Mr. Miller. Is this administrative study going to be looking at any consolidation? At some stage--what was the one that was mentioned a few minutes ago that the Congress asked you to create, the Office of Alternative Medicine? Dr. Kirschstein. And Dietary Supplements. Mr. Miller. Dietary Supplements. That was a mandate? Dr. Kirschstein. Yes. Mr. Miller. I'm not saying that that shouldn't be investigated or studied or such, but I get concerned that you're getting an organizational structure that---- Dr. Varmus. Some of this, you recognize, is at the directive of Congress. Mr. Miller. But there are some things where you need to take an overview and say, ``Wait a minute; are we getting ourselves just added and added and added, organizations and offices and Institutes?'' Is this administrative study going to look at that at all? Or is it too sensitive politically? Dr. Varmus. Well, you should recognize that not all these offices are, in fact, reporting directly to me. Some of them have been located within Institutes; some of them have been located within larger offices, such as the Office of Disease Prevention. So we have tried to impose some order on the system so that those of us who are at the upper echelons are not overloaded by people reporting to us. Mr. Miller. Have there been any studies about the overall organization of NIH to consider that factor? How many more offices were just created? Two in the last Legislature? Dr. Varmus. Well, I don't think it's appropriate for us to ask our consultants to tell us whether or not Congressionally mandated or authorized institutions should be continued. We are asking them to look at lines of reporting and to look at the overall administrative structure. But the emphasis has been on functions which we believe might be consolidated and streamlined, fundamentally in response to the concern of the committee, as expressed by Mr. Porter, that we have as few full-time employees and as few dollars as possible allocated to these functions that could be considered ancillary to research, and not research itself. plans for new institutes Mr. Miller. Do you have any plans for any new Institutes? Are any being discussed? Dr. Varmus. I do not. [Laughter.] Mr. Miller. I guess the one on the Human Genome Project was the last one that became an Institute. Dr. Varmus. That's correct. That, of course, was an existing Center which changed in name but not appreciably in function. There were some minor administrative changes, but it was already operating more or less as an Institute, with an intramural program and many authorities. listing of nih facilities Mr. Miller. What facilities do you have outside of Bethesda, the main campus of NIH? Dr. Varmus. Well, we have facilities in Poolesville, Maryland; Baltimore, Maryland; and North Carolina--we could provide you with a list of them. We have quite a few. [The information follows:] NIH FACILITIES IN THE BALTIMORE/WASHINGTON AREA [Excluding Bethesda Campus] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Facility Location ------------------------------------------------------------------------ NIH Animal Center................

We could certainly provide you with a complete list of that.

Mr. Miller. Are you planning more expansions around the country? Dr. Varmus. No, we're not. Mr. Miller. Is that a problem, having facilities around the country? Dr. Varmus. Well, we have, of course, reviewed all these institutions with regularity. There are a couple of small facilities that we have, one in your home State, Mr. Miller-- the Animal Center in Florida--and another small building in Puerto Rico, both of which we intend to transfer to the State or territorial authorities. Mr. Miller. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. minority funding Mr. Stokes. Mr. Chairman, would you yield to me for just a moment? Mr. Porter. I would be happy to yield to you, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me see if I can just clear up something that comes to my mind with reference to a question posed to you by Mr. Miller. He had asked you about the $1.2 billion of your budget which may in some manner impact upon minority health as a result of research in that particular area. You have indicated an allocation of about $1.2 billion, is that correct? Dr. Varmus. I would say that's probably a conservative number, because that number is determined by looking at projects that very clearly are intended to benefit minority health specifically, as opposed to, say, any cancer project, which, as you and I know, would be of benefit to minority populations, which do have a disproportionate burden of cancer. Mr. Stokes. I think it is important for the record to show the amount that remains in your budget after the application of the $1.2 billion. The $1.2 billion comes out of what budget total? Dr. Varmus. The total budget is $12.7 billion. Mr. Stokes, if I may, I understand where your line of questioning is going, but I would say that it's important to recognize that virtually everything we do is going to benefit the health of virtually everyone. Mr. Stokes. Hopefully. Dr. Varmus. Hopefully. Mr. Stokes. The disparity that we've been talking about as it relates to minorities, the disproportionate disparity, obviously is not affecting everyone. Dr. Varmus. Yes, but I would be hard-pressed to identify research which is disproportionately directed toward majority populations. Some, I'm sure, is, but---- Mr. Stokes. The fact is that you are identifying approximately $1.2 billion that you feel has some impact upon the health of minorities, or--am I misstating you? Dr. Varmus. Yes, I think you are, with due apologies. I think that perhaps I'm not making myself totally clear. Mr. Stokes. Okay. Dr. Varmus. That research is identified by criteria that we will have to look at more closely, but it is research that is not just in any way likely to improve minority health, but is specifically addressed to a problem that has--in a way that investigates, for example, what might be the differences between stroke in African American and white populations or that uses a population of study patients who are largely minority, as opposed to a study of breast cancer, which is studying breast cancer generically and would have important benefits for the minority population because, as you know, the mortality rates for African Americans from breast cancer are higher. The study is of breast cancer per se, but I would argue strongly that it is very likely to have benefit for all people. Concluding Remarks Mr. Porter. Could I suggest to the gentleman from Ohio that there is very little time left in the vote, but also that we are going to have NIH back again, and Dr. Varmus will be here, and this question can be raised at length, if you would like to do that. Mr. Stokes. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Porter. Dr. Varmus, this concludes our first round of NIH hearings, 13 in all, with 26 hours of testimony. You and your colleagues have been very patient to spend all these hours with us, and we are considering taking a little bit of money and making a laboratory in the basement of Rayburn for you---- [Laughter.] Mr. Porter [continuing]. So that you can be here practically full-time. Dr. Varmus. I would appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. I think you realize how valuable these opportunities are for members of the subcommittee and how much we enjoy the sessions, and that's why we hope that you and your colleagues can return in May at the conclusion of our regular hearing cycle to discuss in more detail some of the issues we feel we haven't had sufficient time to discuss in this process, and we'll look forward to seeing you then. Thank you so much. Thank you, Dr. Kirschstein.

MINK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF HAWAII Mr. Porter. The subcommittee will come to order. I am delighted to welcome back our panel of NIH witnesses for this hearing on the process NIH uses to set research priorities. It is a special pleasure for the subcommittee to have a second opportunity in the course of one hearing cycle to talk to representatives from NIH. We have invited this morning members who are not members of the committee, who have expressed an interest in this subject, and we expect that some of them will arrive in the course of the hearing this morning. Today's hearing is the outcome of discussions during our first round of hearings in which some members expressed concerns about whether NIH was appropriately taking into account various factors, such as health care expenditures, in allocating research dollars among various diseases. My own views on these matters are well established. I have stated scientific opportunity as judged by scientists, not politicians, should be the guiding principle in NIH resource allocation decisions. I do not believe that science fundamentally operates on a disease-specific basis. So much of the research that NIH supports is basic, unplanned, untargeted and unpredictable and serendipitous in its outcomes. As we have heard on many occasions, research aimed in one direction frequently provides benefits in an unexpected direction. Forcing a categorization of research in one disease area versus another can often be an exercise in futility and a hazardous diversion in funding debates. But I want to give an opportunity for a full airing of views on the subject. I am not without sympathy to the arguments that some of the disease groups raise. I understand how passionately they care about research and the victims of the diseases they represent. I intend to raise several questions myself that voice their concerns. I hope that today members will take advantage of this hearing to raise these issues that often simmer beneath the surface so the NIH leadership and the Institutes directly involved can respond. I hope this discussion will resolve some concerns before we approach markup. My first concern is to maintain the health of the NIH enterprise, and I fear that the fighting between diseases, this ``siblicide'', as one journalist dubbed it, represents a threat both because it undermines public support for NIH and because it could provoke ugly battles that result in NIH funding being cut overall. We will hear an opening statement from Dr. Harold Varmus, the Director of NIH, and other NIH representatives will be available to answer questions. I yield to Mr. Obey, our Ranking Member. Mr. Obey. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hadn't intended to make a statement, but let me simply make an observation. I have served on this subcommittee some 23 years, and during that time, two things have been self-evident. Number one is that this subcommittee has traditionally put as its highest priority support for biomedical research, which is largely funded through NIH. The second thing that has become abundantly clear to me is that there are tremendous political pressures which are brought upon both NIH and representatives in Congress on questions of funding levels for various Institutes to attack various diseases. I do not want to suggest at all that the process by which NIH arrives at its allocation decisions is absent political considerations. It is not. I think NIH is just as pummeled by political pressures as are Members of Congress. You have various groups who want dollars that you provide and they are going to find justifications to improve their bargaining position. But having said that, I would say that the dangers of political pressure on Congress resulting in bad allocations of resources in the biomedical field are infinitely larger than the dangers of political pressures on NIH itself, because what I find is that all too often, when Members of Congress get into this disease-of-the-month club business, they more closely resemble Daffy Duck than they do Jonas Salk. So it seems to me it is crucial that while this committee recognizes it has a legitimate right and indeed a responsibility to review the decisions made by NIH, it is also incumbent upon us to insist that the decisions that are made are free, are made as free as possible from political pressures. In fact, I think the intervention of this committee in any decisions made by NIH ought to be simply interventions that increase your ability to withstand political pressure, rather than decrease it. That is a distinction that I would draw, and I hope that this hearing will contribute in at least some small measure to ours and your ability to do so this morning. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Obey. Dr. Varmus, why don't you introduce your colleagues and then proceed with your statement. Opening Statement Dr. Varmus. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, at your hearings over the last several weeks, and indeed the last several years, we have frequently had occasion to touch on decision-making and resource allocation at the NIH, and I am grateful to you today for providing this dedicated forum to discuss these important, contentious and unfortunately complex issues at greater length than usual. My job will be to present the process in general, to describe some of the underlying principles. Then, I will be joined by my colleagues, Dr. Claude Lenfant, Director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Dr. Phil Gorden, Director, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Dr. Richard Klausner, Director of the National Cancer Institute, and Dr. William Paul, Director of the Office of AIDS Research, to answer questions about the specific processes, the specific mechanisms used in the different units of NIH in relation to specific programs. I think, before we get into some of the more contentious issues, it is useful to remember that over the past half century the NIH has enjoyed a good relationship with the Congress, the public, and the Administration; that very productive relationship has been responsible for many of the discoveries that have improved health around the world, deepened our knowledge of living organisms and placed the United States in the forefront of medical research and development. observations and principles for resource allocation Today we are meeting to discuss how we spend the money we receive from you each year, namely, what kinds of decisions must be made, who makes those decisions, and what factors need to be considered when making them. Underlying these simple questions are some fundamental issues. How much of our budget should be spent on plans to conquer specific diseases? How much should be invested in basic research? How should the NIH, as part of the Federal Government, generally respond to threats to health posed by specific diseases or injuries? And thirdly, where should the final authority reside in making important decisions about the distribution of our resources? In the interest of trying to consolidate the underpinnings of our decision-making process, I am going to confront these issues through 10 observations based on historical facts, on some operating principles and on my personal experience as Director of NIH that I believe help explain how we manage our budget. The first of these observations is that resource allocation is not a single issue. In fact, it embodies many decisions that are made during a complex process of deciding how to spend our money. So, first, the administration and the Congress must determine how much money is appropriate to give to each Institute and Center. Then each Institute and Center must decide how to allocate its funds to different kinds of mechanisms; that is, to investigator initiated grants, to contracts, to centers, to the intramural program, or to training programs. Then each Institute must also judge two additional things: which specific applications for grant support to fund and whether to emphasize certain research topics within its authorized domain. The net effect of these several decisions will be to determine how much across the NIH is devoted to certain categories, certain scientific disciplines or certain diseases. commitment base The second perspective is a pragmatic one, well-known to this committee but worth emphasizing here: only a relatively small portion of our budget can be realigned each year. As you all know very well, many historical decisions provide a firm framework for our budget, decisions that led to the creation of Institutes, research centers that are supported by the Institutes, and the intramural research program. Furthermore, a very substantial portion of our funds are already committed to grant recipients as a consequence of giving multiyear awards and receiving annual budgets. As a result, a fairly small fraction of each year's budget, perhaps 10 percent, can be affected by changes in funding policies. limitations to planning science The third observation is a philosophical one, but important to remember, and that is, to echo a remark you made, our ability to plan science is limited and, indeed, excessive efforts to plan science can inhibit progress. Science attempts to discover what is unknown, and, in that sense, is inherently unpredictable. History has repeatedly shown the benefits of allowing some component of our research activity to be governed solely by the imagination of individual scientists. As a result of that policy, some of the research done by each Institute or Center may be difficult or, indeed, impossible to explain as part of a research program against a specific disease. Now, sometimes we can say about a research strategy that it can be planned, but it lies outside the boundaries of a specific disease. The genome project is a good example. But historically, we have many examples that fall into other paradigms. For example, the development of recombinant DNA research and the methods that now underlie the entire biotechnology industry and its production of important therapeutic reagents dramatically illustrates the need for unplanned, untargeted, high quality, fundamental science. There are many contemporary illustrations that will yield the same fruit: our efforts to understand cell death, our attempts to paint the three-dimensional structures of proteins, and many other areas that now can't be assigned to a specific disease, but, I believe, will be the foundations on which beneficial applications of our research will ultimately develop. So, overall, the Institutes cannot, and should not provide, entirely precise plans for their complete research portfolio. criteria for decision making The fourth point is also an important one to remember, and that is that there are many criteria which have to guide the development and expenditure of our budget. There is no single criterion that applies. So when we try to answer the questions I raised earlier--how much to give to a singleInstitute, how much to devote to a certain discipline, how much to spend on a certain disease or certain grant mechanism or which applicant among many to fund--we have to consider many kinds of demands that we are responsible for answering. We need to respond to public health needs, but those needs themselves can't be correlated with research in any single way using any single metric. We need to be responsible to support work of the highest caliber. Excellence is our creed and we try to judge that by peer review. We are responsible for seizing scientific opportunities and we know all scientific opportunities are not equally approachable, regardless of their importance for public health. We have to depend on advisors of many kinds, including program managers in the Institutes, to help capitalize on recent advances. We also must be responsible for maintaining a diverse research portfolio so we feel we are advancing on all fronts, if at different speeds on different fronts, at all times. Finally, we need to help ensure a strong scientific work force and research facilities, so maintenance of the scientific infrastructure is also part of our domain. advice in decision-making The fifth point is that we attempt to evaluate these many criteria for making decisions by seeking advice from a large number of sources. This is our outreach program. We have scientific review groups composed of accomplished investigators to review grant applications. We have national advisory councils with members of the public, and the medical and scientific community to review Institute policies. We organize large numbers of conferences, workshops and other studies to gather opinions on a variety of health and scientific and ethical and administrative issues. The Institutes and my office have coordinating committees and program offices that review scientific progress, develop long-range objectives, and formulate budgets and initiatives. We have extramural advisory groups that are asked to look at trans-NIH activities--that is, activities that extend across Institute boundaries: the clinical center, gene therapy, clinical research, my use of my one percent transfer authority. We consult frequently with members of other agencies and other components of the administration, Congressional Members and staff and, importantly, with professional and health advocacy organizations. But I have to emphasize, despite this large outreach of consultancy, despite these many means of gathering opinions and evaluating them, assembling each Institute's research portfolio is a difficult and highly imperfect process, and it is one for which the Institute directors and I must assume the ultimate responsibility. imprecision of disease coding The sixth issue is one that causes us great difficulty. We know that numbers alone provide a hazardous way for assessing and designing a research portfolio. Now, the public and the Congress have a right to know how our money is spent, and we make great efforts to find out and determine those numbers for the public that provides the dollars by trying to account for the amount of money that we provide to specific diseases, to various research activities, and to separate grant mechanisms. But we know that the coding of funds by disease category, although useful as a general guide, is also inherently imprecise. parkinson's disease I have provided for you, in the back of my written testimony, one example, in the context of Parkinson's disease. I point out to you the large difference between the number of grants that can be assigned specifically to research on Parkinson's disease--that is, specifically and unambiguously to Parkinson's disease--and the much bigger number of grants assigned to topics such as nerve cell biology, dopamine metabolism, nerve degeneration, topics that have obvious implications for understanding and treating this disease. The charts also show that many Institutes are involved in these activities; not just Neurology and Mental Health, but indeed virtually all the Institutes have some role in research that has an effect upon the development of our understanding of this disorder. And this is a reflection of the fact that beyond these widening circles, there is yet the other possibility that the most important discovery will come from a totally unexpected direction. For reasons of this kind, there is no right amount of money or right number of projects for any disease. science cannot be purchased The seventh point is one which I find particularly important to emphasize in this context and that is that scientific work is not simply a commodity sitting on a shelf that we can purchase. To shift priorities in a way that makes effective use of our monies in these fiscally restrained times requires talent and ideas, not just budgetary realignments. Campaigns to expand research on specific diseases often focus on efforts to increase spending on those diseases. But in order to spend such money effectively, it is first necessary to identify scientific opportunities and use them to attract established investigators. We try to make use of several means to do this. We invite scientists to workshops that highlight new opportunity and needs in a field; we try to advertise an Institute's interest in increasing funding in that area; and we try to train new scientists to work in a designed area. budgetary constraints The eighth point is a modern reality, and that is that the decision to increase support in one area of medical research now usually constrains the support of something else. Those who follow the history of the development of NIH know that there have been decisions over the years to create new Institutes and to markedly expand programs in certain areas, accompanied by dramatic increases in the NIH budget. No programs needed to be attenuated as a result of those large increases. This is no longer the case. Recent budgetary increases, while welcomed and appreciable, have been modest by historical standards and, therefore, when directed to spend more for certain diseases in certain areas, do run the risk of constraining spending in other areas, and even, perhaps most importantly, in our highly productive, nontargeted areas. resource allocation by nih The ninth point is one of potential contention, and that is that methods for resource allocation at the NIH are, in my view, preferable to excessive congressional directives. We know that many fields of biomedical research deserve increased support and could move faster with more funds. But as I pointed out, resources are currently limited, so pushing funds vigorously in one direction is liable to impede funds in another. This situation compels caution. Our requests for increased funding are carefully considered by the Institutes, by my office, by me. Both of these we now feature in the NIH areas of emphasis which represent the results of prolonged deliberations between the Institute directors and me. These areas of emphasis aim to exploit recent discovery, such as theisolation of new genes for human diseases. They aim to encourage studies of diseases that have been relatively neglected, poorly controlled, or recently made more accessible to scientific study, and they aim to strengthen research technologies--computer science, imaging devices, neuroscience, gene mapping--that are applicable to a broad range of disciplines or diseases. The final point is that many novel and powerful means are available and should be used to heighten the interest of scientists and the public benefits of their research, that is, their application to disease. I understand, we at the NIH all understand, that the public and the Congress are often frustrated with the pace of progress, and that is so for a number of reasons. pace of research Medical science is inherently hard and slow. Advances don't occur at equal rates against all diseases. Sometimes the long- term relevance of the basic science that we do is relatively obscure, and scientists themselves may be deficient in comprehending or indeed communicating the connections between their work and its potential value to the public. I have argued here that the best solutions to such frustrations are not excessive directives to reroute dollars to specific diseases. Instead we encourage advocates for those specific diseases to advance their causes in a variety of innovative ways. For example, many of us have seen how advocates for the study of specific diseases can be effective either at the local or national level by visiting individual scientists or by visiting professional societies, and thereby stimulating the interest of working investigators in the unappreciated implications of those investigators' work. I have seen this strategy effectively used by proponents of research on a variety of diseases, most obviously cystic fibrosis, ataxia telangiectasia, scleroderma, and several others. The NIH often responds to concerns that research on a specific disorder is underserved by convening a workshop to evaluate opportunities, to bring potentially collaborative disciplines together, and to stimulate the interest of new investigators. We have had major workshops developed in this way on a variety of subjects. Perhaps the better publicized were on autism, spinal cord injury, and Parkinson's disease; another will be held soon on diabetes mellitus. One workshop brought together clinicians and geneticists who then collaborated to identify a new chromosomal locus that predisposes to a familial form of Parkinson's disease. The research opportunity created by this finding will attract new investigators and could be the basis for major advances against the more common, nonfamilial form of the disease. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to talk at length on these issues. I and my colleagues will be happy to answer questions that you and your colleagues might have. [The statement of Dr. Varmus follows:] [Pages 2439 - 2470--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] Mr. Porter. Dr. Varmus, thank you for that statement of principles. The subcommittee will operate under the 5-minute rule today because of the large number of Members who are present, and we will go back and forth between the Majority and the Minority. Although we would be delighted to have her, we are going to count Patsy Mink of Hawaii among the Majority instead of Minority because she is sitting on our side; and questions can be answered not only by Dr. Varmus but by anyone who would like to comment on them. aids and scientific opportunity Dr. Varmus, you talked about scientific opportunity in allocating research dollars. This is a kind of chicken-and-egg situation, though, isn't it? In other words, don't you really create scientific opportunity in a sense when you allocate money to a particular research field, and that encourages talented scientists to move into that area? Advocates use the AIDS field as an example, asserting that the best scientists followed the AIDS dollars and shifted their work to that field. Isn't what is hot and new and interesting to scientists also part of this? And I wonder if you could explain whether you believe that scientific opportunity leads or follows the infusion of resources. In other words, can't resources create opportunity and encourage people to work in that field? Dr. Varmus. Well, it is a very complicated relationship, Mr. Porter. Needless to say, when the money is available, it is likely to lead to some findings that will then generate new opportunities. But that is a slow process. In the case of AIDS that you mentioned, I would argue that, in fact, the opportunities were fairly limited in the beginning until we knew that a retrovirus was the causative agent. At that point, it became clear that there were in fact already very deeply built-in opportunities, because a large number of investigators, myself included, have been working on retroviruses for other reasons for about 20 years. The result was that we knew a tremendous amount about that class of viruses. As soon as it was apparent that it was likely that AIDS was caused by such a virus, the accumulated knowledge was, in itself, the platform from which new opportunities for pursuing AIDS developed. We knew about the proteins made, we knew about enzymes that were made by these viruses. The methods for understanding pathogenesis and understanding the targets for drug intervention were already inherent in the problem. Mr. Porter. But don't you believe that once you put resources there, that you then tend to get a lot of proposals that follow the resources? Dr. Varmus. You get the proposals, Mr. Porter. The difficulty, of course, is deciding in a constrained environmentwhat is the most efficient use of resources. I do agree with you that if we applied a large amount of funds to a specific area, that eventually we would make progress and create some new opportunities, but the money itself is not sufficient. One has to ask in a period of constrained resources whether we should be--it is very difficult for us to stimulate all areas at once. We have to have a rationale for saying we are going to take money away from an area where money could be more productively used and add it to an area where opportunities, at the moment, may seem limited. Now, this is not to say areas of limited opportunity are not areas we would fund. We are funding them. But the question is, how do we assign the dollars that are flexible in each year's budget? I think we have to do that by taking into consideration a variety of factors. I think this is the place where our job is most difficult; namely, we hear, as you do, the stories that describe the impact of disease upon individuals, and we know that additional funds will be a benefit. But we have to make some decisions about where the benefits are likely to occur most quickly and most effectively at that time. factors in resource allocation Mr. Porter. We often hear from disease or patient advocacy groups that you are not taking into account such things as the number of deaths attributed to a particular disease, the number of cases of a particular disease nationwide or worldwide, the indirect cost of the disease, the cost of the disease for government program such as Medicare, Medicaid, or Ryan White, the measurement of years of potential life lost, quality- adjusted life-years or disability-adjusted life-years and the like. Can you tell us what role those kinds of things play in your decisions for allocating resources? Dr. Varmus. Well, Mr. Porter, your list of indices reflects part of the problem; that is, there are many ways to try to gauge the impact of disease upon society. Each of those gives a somewhat different outcome. We are of course extremely sensitive to our basic mission, which is to do science that benefits health; and we of course would be remiss if we were not spending large amounts of money on the diseases that have the greatest impact, by a variety of measures. But what becomes very difficult and, to my mind, not credible, is to try to take any single indicator and to use that as a metric by which to design a funding strategy. So if we were not supporting research on a disease that clearly had a major role in public health, we would be extremely remiss. But beyond that fairly proximate outline that tries to correlate our research spending with disease impact, the refinement of the process, I believe, needs to depend more heavily on the scientific opportunities. committee report language Mr. Porter. What is appropriate for Congress to do in expressing our concerns? Obviously, I assume that you think that congressional appropriations that are specific to a particular disease would be inappropriate, but what about language in a report, directive language in a report or encouraging language? Why don't you tell us what you do with that. Dr. Varmus. We welcome that. We are a creation of the public will. We are one of the great manifestations of our democracy, and we believe that we should be responsive to the public, and you are the representatives of the public who indicate to us what public concerns are. There are a variety of ways for us to respond to such language. One is what I find the most pedestrian: to give you a report. What I find the most useful is for us to take your suggestions of an area of concern to try to bring together people who work on that problem and related problems, have a conference that addresses the public's concern about the issues, and seek the possibility that there are opportunities we have not seized adequately. We are imperfect and the process is imperfect. We have repeatedly heard this year that we are not providing adequate support for research on diabetes. My response and the response of my colleagues is not the defensive one of saying, no, what we do is perfect. Instead, we have organized a very important workshop that will be held the first week in September and will bring to Bethesda not only people in the diabetes field, but people working on research in fields related to diabetes, in hopes that we will identify new areas of research that will be beneficial to patients with the disorder. Mr. Porter. Well, you are imperfect, but Congress is more scientifically imperfect. But we obviously all have great concerns in certain areas and we feel free to express those in the report accompanying the bill, and you are saying you want to respond to that and state what the truth is, and I think it is a very good process. Mr. Obey. expenditures for aids and other diseases Mr. Obey. Dr. Varmus, let me follow up on the Chairman's questions that relate to your expenditures on AIDS versus other diseases. The argument is made that because many more people die of heart disease and cancer than die of AIDS that somehow we ought to look at those numbers and calibrate our expenditures to attack those problems accordingly. But I think there are other factors that ought to be taken into consideration. Since NIH was created, or over any other time frame that you care to cite, can you tell me how much has been spent, in total, on cancer? Dr. Varmus. Well, we have been spending--it will take me a little time to give you the precise numbers; I can give you those for the record, but since 1971 when the Cancer Act was passed, we have been spending, do you know, a billion dollars? [Clerk's note.--Later changed to ``$20 billion.''] Dr. Klausner. About $28 billion. Mr. Obey. Let me simply, if you don't have the numbers, my staff happened to have compiled them for me. Dr. Klausner. This is how we negotiate our budget. Mr. Obey. My understanding is, from 1967 to 1997 we have appropriated for the Cancer Institute some $35 billion; the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, we have appropriated some $21 billion; Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, $12.5 billion. AIDS, in comparison to the $34 billion for the cancer institute and the $21 billion for heart, lung and blood institute, over that period, AIDS, we have spent about $13 billion. And I would point out that we spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars prior to 1967 to attack cancer, to attack heart and other cardiovascular problems, to attack other diseases, simply because we didn't have AIDS until just a few years ago. And so it seems to me that there may be a very good reason why the expenditure per death is higher on AIDS than it is on other diseases, simply because we are starting from a zero knowledge base with AIDS, and we are still starting from a fairly low knowledge base, and we have had a lot of years to learn things about heart disease and cancer, and we haven't had as many years of research with respect to AIDS. So it just seems to me we ought to be very careful before we take the simpleminded approach of looking at only one index by which to measure what we are spending. nobel laureates The second question, how many NIH officials over the past 10 years have been the recipient of Nobel prizes in science? Dr. Varmus. Grant recipients? Mr. Obey. No, how many Nobel prize winners have been in positions of responsibility at NIH over the past decade or so? Dr. Varmus. It depends on what you mean by responsibility, administrative responsibility? Probably very few. At least one. Mr. Gekas. One is sitting here. Dr. Varmus. Equal to or greater than one. Mr. Obey. How many Nobel prize winners have sat on your peer review panels. Dr. Varmus. I would have to check. It depends on whether you ask before or after the receipt of the Nobel prize. Probably quite a number before. Fewer afterwards. Mr. Obey. My point is, it would be a significant number of people. Dr. Varmus. That is correct. Mr. Obey. How many Members of Congress have received Nobel prizes? Dr. Varmus. Peace or medicine? Mr. Obey. No, medicine. I think the answer is obvious. How many persons who serve in decision-making spots at NIH have received academic training in science and medicine? Dr. Varmus. Virtually all. Mr. Obey. How many members of this subcommittee have received academic training in science or medicine? Dr. Varmus. No one at the table today. There are some in the Congress. Mr. Obey. As I total it up, we have a lawyer, an insurance executive, a TV executive, a lawyer, another lawyer, another lawyer, a businessman, a teacher on the Republican side of the aisle; and on the Democratic side of the aisle we have a lawyer, a lawyer, a public official, a public relations consultant, a political activist and a fugitive from Russian studies. That is me. The point I am simply trying to make is, I think it is perfectly appropriate for us to exercise our responsibilities to taxpayers and to the average American citizen to see that you are making decisions absent political pressures. But I do think that there ought to be a certain modest sense of humility which accompanies those evaluations, given the fact that we are likely to be responding at least as much to political pressures as we are to our own scientific knowledge on this side of the table. And I would simply note that in case anybody on the subcommittee is even mildly interested. The only other thing I would say is with respect to AIDS, I think there are pressures on you, both up and down for funding. I mean, no matter how much you appropriate for AIDS it will never be enough for the AIDS activists, and no matter how much you appropriate to AIDS it will always be too much for gay bashers in this society. And I think it is our obligation to resist pressures in either direction, so you do have maximum opportunity to put the money where you have the greatest scientific opportunity rather than political opportunity. managing public information The only other observation--this isn't a question; it is just another observation. I guess my main concern with the way NIH and the scientific community has operated the last generation has been, I think, their view that we must constantly feed the public with as much good news as possible in order to keep support out there for biomedical research, and I find that to be false. I happened to note Daniel Greenburg's article in the Post a couple of days ago with which I substantially agree. I think it is important for people to understand how little progress we have made in a number of these areas, not dismissing for a moment the importance of whatever breakthroughs we have had. But I think we have to resist this constant analogy that we get between the moon shot and, say, a cure for cancer or any other disease. We are able to go to the moon because we have reached a certain point in our understanding of engineering, in our understanding of ballistics, and in our understanding of trajectory and mathematics, in our understanding of propulsion; and when we reach that critical level of understanding in all those related fields, we are able to accomplish a relatively simple engineering feat. It is not a simple engineering feat to discover various forms of cancer or anything else, and it seems to me the best way that we can respond to the public's concern is to provide enough funding to basic research so that we eventually do reach that critical mass so that then what we spend in disease- specific ways can have a greater chance of success, and I think that we have responsibility on this side of the table to remember that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Varmus. Thank you, Mr. Obey. congressional biomedical research caucus Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Obey. We are pleased to be joined by a number of our colleagues who have been invited to sit in with us this morning, and George Gekas is the chairman of the Congressional Biomedical Research Caucus. And, George, we are delighted you are here. Statement of the Hon. George Gekas, a Representative in Congress From the State of Pennsylvania Mr. Gekas. Yes, I thank the Chairman. I also note the presence of our Cochair, the lady from California, Ms. Pelosi; and thank Dr. Varmus for giving us the opportunity several years ago to light the fire under the advocacy for biomedical research, which resulted in our forming the caucus. But I want Dr. Varmus to understand that the reason that he is Executive Director today of the NIH is because of Biomedical Research Caucus. That is going to be in my memoirs. But, in any event, it is a wonderful relationship we have struck up and has resulted in, we believe, education of the Members on many aspects of the subject to which Mr. Obey has alluded here today, and we want to continue cooperation between our caucus and the NIH, of course. commitment base One thing that struck me from the testimony that you offered, Dr. Varmus--I don't find it in trying to look through the written part, but you alluded to the fact, or stated that only 10 percent of the total funding for a particular year really is allocatable; that is, with the ongoing grant contracts and work in progress, as it were, which has a multiyear feel to it, that when we start arguing about Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and cancer and diabetes, we are only talking about allocating, or reallocating, 10 percent. Dr. Varmus. That is it roughly. It will vary from year to year, indeed from institute to institute depending upon their commitment base for that year. Mr. Gekas. So we are really arguing here, when we try to apply congressional pressure to emphasize one disease or another on very little of the total package, and I think that is a message that we are responsible for transmitting to the public that work in progress, as it were--I can't think of a better term to use--receives most of the continued funding. Dr. Varmus. We do consider that a large number with respect to dollars and a major responsibility. Moreover, when we make decisions, those decisions tend to be perpetuated over multiple years because when a decision is made to develop a program it becomes part of the commitment base for succeeding years. Mr. Gekas. Where do we stand then in the proposition that we have referred to, to try to double the funding for NIH, the appropriations, to double the current level of funding over the next 5 years in which effort the Chairman of this committee has lent his name--in fact is a key part of. Would that go to that 10 percent, shall we say in the next 5 years, but making it 20 percent? Dr. Varmus. That would make a big difference with respect to the number of dollars that we had to mold to specific new opportunities and concerns. Mr. Gekas. But part of that would go to the ongoing work? Dr. Varmus. No, no, that would be new money for new initiatives and for expansion of existing ones. coding for parkinson's reserach Mr. Gekas. Well, we want to continue that effort, and we will keep you apprised of the progress that we make in that. There is only one other question that I would like to ask. When you settled on Parkinson's disease as a way to give us an example of how related research awards, which may never have started with the idea of curing Parkinson's or--when you say they are related, that is what I want to know. Dr. Varmus. Yes, the reason I displayed the findings in that way was to show that there really are three cohorts of grants. One in which it is unambiguously clear that the grant is directed towards Parkinson's. It might be a clinical trial of a new drug against Parkinson's or the use of fetal tissue in transplantation research to treat Parkinson's. And then there is a collection, a cohort of grants in which the work is directed to, for example, dopamine metabolism. We know that dopamine is important in Parkinson's research, but also important in schizophrenia and other neurological and mental disorders. And then there is a third cohort of research that I could not display for example, on cell death. As you know, Parkinson's disease is dependent on certain cells in the basal ganglia. Cell death is the fundamental mechanism by which that disease arises. And yet it is possible for someone studying that cell death in a fibroblast, in tissue culture, to make the seminal discovery that turns our thinking about that disease. That research would not be funded as Parkinson's-related research because there would be no way to show the relationship at the time that the grant was awarded. Mr. Gekas. My point is that you could prepare such a chart for each disease, could you not? Dr. Varmus. Easily, yes. Mr. Gekas. And some would be related. Dr. Varmus. This is part of our coding problem, Mr. Gekas. I am glad you brought it up. Mr. Gekas. So that we return to the thesis that was first uttered by the Chairman in his opening remarks that basic research and the emphasis that we put on our scientific community on that level, seeps up, as it were, to reach all the diseases with which the public is so much concerned. Dr. Varmus. A very good example of that is the Genome Project, which is obviously built on the idea that we will identify all of the genes that contribute to the development of human diseases, and yet the Genome Project, per se, is not money attributable by this kind of accounting to one disease or another. Ninety-eight percent of the money that the Genome Institute spends on extramural research is not categorized by disease. Nevertheless, we know that as disease genes are found, the impact on the study of those diseases is dramatic and new opportunities are obviously created when you identify the precise gene that is involved in the causation of that disease. Mr. Gekas. With that, I want to thank the Chair for recognizing the value of the Biomedical Research Caucus, for his co-working with it on many different subject matters, and to allowing me to put myself on record as endorsing the Chairman's concept that the reliance on the new discoveries yet to be made should be placed on the scientific community with a nudge from the Congress as necessary. Thank you very much. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Gekas. The staff has reminded me that if I proceeded in the way that I first announced, I would be violating my own principle. So what we will do is recognize back and forth those who were present at the start of the hearing, and then we will recognize those Members in order of arrival so that from this point on, next will be Mr. Stokes, then Mr. Miller, then Mr. Nethercutt, Mr. Hoyer, Mrs. Mink, Ms. Northup, Mr. Istook, Ms. Pelosi, Ms. Morella, Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Moran. Mr. Stokes. strategic plan Mr. Stokes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Varmus, the previous Director of NIH instituted a strategic plan to help guide the Agency's direction in setting priorities. Can you describe the framework of that plan to the Subcommittee and tell us to what extent it has been updated under your directorship? Dr. Varmus. Well, I can tell you a little bit about the process of developing the plan. The plan itself has never been put into action. It involved reorganizing a number of aspects of the way in which we categorize our research. When I came to NIH, neither the Department of HHS nor I were willing to espouse the plan in detail. What I thought was extremely useful, about the notion that Dr. Healey put into practice, was the idea of engaging the extramural community more actively in the process of thinking through where the NIH was headed. Indeed, I and many of my colleagues here participated in very useful discussions at various locations around the country, trying to predict future directions as best we could, and thinking about what we would do with additional resources. The process was more important than the product. I have tried to emulate that in a somewhat different way. I am a little suspicious of efforts to develop one single plan for the entire NIH. Instead, I think it is more appropriate to consider reviews of special programs, reviews of Institutes, reviews, for example, of our extramural program, gene therapy research, and clinical investigation. I have tried to do that with as much involvement of extramural scientists, disease advocates, and professional societies as I have been able to do. trans-nih disease categories Mr. Stokes. I understand that NIH tracks its investment in targeted diseases under the designated label--trans-NIH areas; is that correct? Dr. Varmus. Well, yes, we do have numbers for the expenditure on certain diseases or other activities across all the Institutes. Mr. Stokes. How do these diseases qualify for this label? Dr. Varmus. Frequently because in the past Congress has asked us to follow those numbers. Mr. Stokes. To what extent is there overlap in the reporting of funding amounts in these ``trans'' areas? Dr. Varmus. Very often there is considerable overlap for some of the reasons we just discussed with Mr. Gekas. nih spending on minority initiatives Mr. Stokes. I would like to refer back for a moment, to our original hearings during this session of the Congress. At that time, pursuant to a question I posed, you indicated that NIH spends over a billion dollars on minority initiatives at NIH. You are familiar with that? Dr. Varmus. Yes, I am. Mr. Stokes. I am interested in knowing exactly how and where those dollars are being spent. When I use the term, ``minority initiatives,'' I mean those funds that are being spent directly on minority programs, particularly on what the DHHS Secretary and others referred to as the 6 plus 1. As you know, in the DHHS report on minority health focused on cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, unintended injuries, homicide, infant mortality, chemical dependency and AIDS. What I would like to have you do, and you can do it now or provide it for the record, is for each of these health areas tell us how much money has been allocated, and for what specific initiative. Dr. Varmus. I think we probably would need to do that for the record to be accurate. Obviously, in each of those areas, there are projects that are focused very heavily on the minority component. There is research that emphasizes the minority component and there is research that would work both ways as, of course, the research that is minority emphasized. The minority number I gave you at the previous hearing encompasses not just those seven categories, but several others as well. We can provide you with a breakdown by Institute and by disorder and we would be happy to do that. Mr. Stokes. That is what I would like to have you do for the record. For tracking purposes, how does NIH define minority health, women's health, children's health, senior's health, and aging research? How are these definitions used? What amount of funding is spent in each of these population categories? Dr. Varmus. I don't have the precise definitions with me, so I would have to provide those for the record, if I could. [The information follows:] NIH Definitions of Selected Population Groups The following are definitions that NIH uses to report funding for research on minorities, women, children,and elderly/aging. In using these definitions and in comparing funding reported for different population groups, it is important to keep in mind that there is considerable overlap among those populations groups and as a result, there is also some overlap in the research reported for each. For example, research on a disease that affects minority women disproportionately would be reported under both research on minorities and women's health research. Also, most definitions are developed in response to concerns of particular groups and have evolved as concerns and issues have changed. For this reason, definitions and data reported below are not consistent over time. Changes in definitions are noted below. minority Research efforts related to individuals of non-Caucasian descent, and individuals of Hispanic descent. women's health For research on diseases, disorders, or conditions that occur primarily in women (such as breast cancer, mammography, osteoporosis, etc.). This will include both clinical or applied research and basic research. Prior to reporting FY 91 data, women's health research reporting focused on single-gender diseases; studies to evaluate gender differences; and studies of diseases, disorders and conditions that are unique to women. Such an approach did not fully reflect the true scope of women's diseases, and NIH, in collaboration with other Public Health Service agencies; developed a more inclusive and consistent definition of women's health research. children Research on children can be defined as studies in all categories of biomedical research (e.g., basic, clinical, epidemiological, behavioral, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, as well outcomes and health services) that relate to diseases conditions, or the health and/or development of neonates, infants, children, and adolescents up to age 21. This age grouping is consistent with recommendation by the NIH Director's Panel on Clinical Research, the NIH Inclusion of Children in Research Committee, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. elderly (aging) According to the Research on Aging Act of 1974, which established the National Institute on Aging, research on aging encompasses ``biomedical, social, and behavioral research and training related to the aging process and the diseases and other special problems and needs of the aged.'' ``Elderly'' is often regarded as interchangeable with ``aged,'' and neither term is defined by any single, discrete chronological boundary, reflecting the fact that both normal and abnormal biomedical, behavioral, and social processes act on a continuum over the lifespan. Research on aging therefore focuses on issues of importance to health and quality of life of people in later stages of the lifespan through studies of a diversity of relevant events. funding for population research Mr. Stokes. Also, if you would, provide for the record the current total funding investment in each of these population categories across the NIH. What is the percent change in the investment in each of these categories for fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997, and fiscal year 1998 estimate? Provide for the record a chart that displays the amount and percent change in funding for each of the population categories, for each year-- for the period fiscal year 1984 to 1997, also include the fiscal year 1998 estimate. Would you do that for us? Dr. Varmus. I would be happy to do that. It will involve some hard leg work. I would also caution, Mr. Stokes, that there is going to be a subjective component to those assignations because, as you know, in all of our research activities there is going to be a component that we would like to believe benefits all. And there is research that is not categorized as minority that benefits minorities. There is research that is categorized as minority- oriented research that, of course, benefits the majority. So there are not any clear-cut boundaries, but within the limits of our definitions, which we will provide for you, we will do those computations. [The information follows:] [Page 2481--The official Committee record contains additional material here.] Mr. Stokes. I can appreciate that. I understand perfectly what you are saying. Let me go back to the previous question where you made reference to the use of the various definitions, I am assuming you can clearly identify the amounts. Dr. Varmus. Yes, we can identify them and you will see that the definition will be helpful, but nevertheless, there will be a subjective component in deciding how much of any single grant should be assigned to that category. Mr. Stokes. Thank you. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Stokes. Mr. Miller. public relations for nih Mr. Miller. Dr. Varmus, welcome again. As one who is a very strong supporter of NIH, I am really excited to be on this particular subcommittee and to be able to express my support. I was interested in your tenth point, which was basically stating that you needed to do some better PR, and I see that all the time when we have Mohammad Ali who will come and testify on behalf of Parkinson's or Arnold Palmer on cancer. I think it is something that we need to push for as to the success and what a crown jewel that the NIH is and definitely be proud of how our tax dollars are used. As a strong fiscal conservative, I can argue very often against programs, but this is one that I argue for, and I think we need to develop a better program because so many people think that NIH funding is 10 percent that is intramural rather than the extramural. That, in effect, is what you point out in your tenth point. You don't want to use the word PR, but we need to market what good is being done there. And I agree with our Chairman and Mr. Obey that we need to be careful not to politicize it. For example, in the past couple of weeks I have had letters to the editor in my local paper criticizing me for not supporting the Mo Udall bill. It was targeting money for Parkinson's disease research. Last week, we had testimony about autism and it is very emotional. aids research coordination AIDS is an issue that comes up, and maybe Dr. Paul, however you want to answer it, discuss the uniqueness of that. Why it developed the way it has, why its research is different overall affecting other diseases than, say, just cancer research or diabetes research and why the approach has been in that area. Dr. Varmus. I am not sure that it is inherently different from a disorder like diabetes, which also affects many organ systems. But, as you point out, Mr. Miller, one of the characteristics of the problem posed by HIV and AIDS is the multiplicity of organ systems affected by it. One of the consequences has been that we have a different mechanism for allocating our dollars for AIDS. That is, rather than absorb the administrative burden of creating a new institute to work on AIDS, we developed a coordinating office, which Dr. Paul leads. I will ask him to comment on this in just a moment. That office coordinates the funding through every NIH Institute and Center, each of which has some responsibility for the various components: the different organ systems that are involved in the manifestations of AIDS, and the different kinds of approaches that range from structural biology to behavioral research to drug abuse research to control of the opportunistic infections and cancers that occur during the disease. AIDS is one of the most complex problems we have had to confront. It is also an infectious disease, it affects young people and some of our most disadvantaged citizens and has posed a wide variety of problems, and it is a disease that we have had to respond to in fairly recent times, as Mr. Obey pointed out. The response has been acute because of public concern about the magnitude of the problem, the lethality of the disease, the unusual situation of having to cope with a viral infection for which vaccine efforts have been frustrating. We have had to develop for the first time effective pharmaceutical approaches to the control of the disease. We are very proud of the fact that, in conjunction with the drug industry, we have had remarkable successes doing that. We have also had the advantage of advance preparation due to a deep prior investment in virology, immunology, cancer, and many other basic research endeavors. This prepared the way for us to proceed with alacrity against this disease. Bill, you may want to comment. Dr. Paul. Yes, thank you. I think Dr. Varmus has laid out one of many of the important issues. I would like to emphasize one or two. HIV infection and AIDS is unusual in one very important respect. It is a disease which has come on the scene both suddenly and with frightening impact. Before 1980, we were virtually unaware of its existence at all. It is now the leading cause of death of young adults in the United States and it will shortly be the leading cause of infectious death in the world. It poses a remarkable challenge to us and a challenge which the government took up very quickly and did so within its normal mechanisms. The research on the various aspects of HIV infection was dispersed to the individual Institutes in a manner rather different than an established disease. Rather than form an Institute--and I think wisely the Congress did not move in that direction--the use of our established mechanisms, together with an office such as the OAR to coordinate that work, has allowed the Institutes to use all of their normal mechanisms without disruption of them. And yet for us to have a mechanism through the OAR which allows resources to be moved to the areas where opportunities are the greatest in a relatively rapid manner has been critical. We have been able to illustrate that. For example, in the last year or two, we have been able to change direction and markedly increase our resources devoted to vaccine research without having a marked disruption that might have been achieved had we not had a coordinating mechanism. So I would echo Dr. Varmus' statement. We face a new disease, a disease of still uncertain significance for the United States and the world, but a disease that has already established itself as a leading cause of death of young members of our society. Mr. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. George Nethercutt of Washington. Statement of the Hon. George R. Nethercutt, Jr., a Representative in Congress From the State of Washington diabetes research Mr. Nethercutt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for allowing me to join this panel today. As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittees, I have a special interest in the subject of diabetes. And I certainly welcome all of you gentlemen here and thank you for all of your good work, because it is truly good work. Dr. Varmus, I heard you testify that the NIH would be remiss not to spend money on diseases that have the greatest impact, and I think you are correct. And so my question goes to the issue of diabetes and the relative spending that is done and has been done over the years on diabetes research and the Institute, NIDDK versus other Institutes. And I am not here to diminish the importance of other diseases, but I am here to emphasize the importance of diabetes because it has a tremendous impact on society. Something like $137 billion a year in costs that spans a wide range of complications from heart disease to kidney disease to blindness to amputations, all the horrors that all diabetics know about. So, my question is this: Do you acknowledge, Dr. Varmus, that there has been lesser emphasis on NIDDK spending and diabetes as opposed to the wide range of other diseases over the years? In other words, when NIH spending has gone up in other areas, my information is that NIDDK spending has gone down, and I am wondering if there is an explanation for that, and if so, what it is. Dr. Varmus. I don't think it is quite fair to say that diabetes research has suffered in comparison to all other major diseases. Over the last few years, there have been a number of new initiatives at the NIH that account for much of the increase in our spending: For example, increases in spending on AIDS, the creation of new institutes, and a number of other initiatives. Diabetes research has been well-supported for many years, and I think one would have to make the comparison with a large variety of other disorders to substantiate the claim that you just made. I would point out that my view of the proper metric here is not to try to correlate some number with the dollars that we assign to diabetes research. This is a number that is constrained by our ability to make the categorical assignments and the same problems that I described for Parkinson's Disease. But you have to consider the impact of a wide range of other research activities upon the creation of opportunities in diabetes research. For example, we have many kinds of studies of blood vessels. It isn't all categorized as diabetes research. Some of it is in cancer and some is in heart disease, and, of course, that all has an impact on the well-being of diabetics. adequacy of spending on diabetes As you know, we have had many challenges from the diabetes advocacy groups about the adequacy of spending on diabetes research. I don't mean to defend absolutely what we do, because it is an imperfect process. That is why we have decided to have this very broad workshop, which is not intended to discuss recent research discoveries, but instead to bring together experts to evaluate our spending and our research initiatives in the area of diabetes, to ask whether the various components of diabetes research are all being pursued with the appropriate degree of enthusiasm and attracting the right kinds of personnel, because I do believe there are many opportunities. We also have opportunities to improve the lives of diabetics that the country has yet to take full advantage of. As you know very well from your own experience with the disease, we have learned a great deal through the work of the Diabetes Institute over the last several years about means to control the complications of diabetes. Yet we know that a very substantial number of patients with diabetes are not yet properly controlling their blood sugar. They are not seeking help for diabetic retinopathy at a significantly early stage. Those components of health care also need to be improved. We recognize that there are many ways that we can do better, and we are trying to look at ways in which we can pursue them. Mr. Nethercutt. I appreciate that and I think it is a wise move to have this diabetes research symposium coming up this fall. I have legislation I have introduced that would essentially do that gentle nudging to NIH that says, let's have a plan and decide in what areas and what specific subject areas would provide the greatest opportunity for curing this disease. And so I think the conference that is coming up this fall leads certainly in that direction. nih resource allocation procedures Let me ask one other question as you talk about categorical assignments. I am wondering--and incidentally, I had a great visit to NIDDK earlier. I guess it was last year, and I am very well aware of the great basic research that is being done there and other places. What input is there, and what input do you use from the directors of the various Institutes of NIH in determining the allocation of funding for those respective Institutes? Is there a vote of some kind? Is there consultation regularly? I am just wondering from the committee's standpoint, what can we understand about the internal procedures for deciding who gets what? Dr. Varmus. Well, we are not sufficiently democratic to have a vote. I am not sure how well that would work. It might be one vote for each proposal. But there is an intense consultation process which begins within the Institutes, each having its own process for doing this, using the scientists who are grantees and intramural scientists of the Institute, advocacy groups, and other advisors, who are consulted during the course of the year to think about a number of issues-- including how grants are reviewed, what the criteria should be for funding, how much should be spent on various mechanisms, and whether there should be more centers or fewer centers, or increases in training in certain areas. The wide panoply of questions that I addressed in my testimony would be looked at either annually or every other year to try to determine whether the Institute is on the right course. areas of emphasis Then, at a point during the development of the President's budget for NIH, I consult with each Institute director in a process that has been, frankly, evolving since I came to NIH. This year, for example, I asked each Institute director to bring to me candidate proposals for inclusion in what I called the NIH Areas of Emphasis. These are six broad areas in which I try to summarize, in a trans-Institute way, the major themes in modern medical research that I believe should be the vehicles for advancing medical science, particularly in the current restricted financial environment. What we try to do in building the budget is to provide the money for the commitment base and money to continue the support of investigator-initiated projects that simply depend upon the imagination and direction of investigators. In addition, we provide, through the Areas of Emphasis, new programs that are intended to either expand or initiate programs that we think are particularly valuable for fostering either broad research that may affect a variety of disciplines, or areas of research that we believe are currently undersupported, because NIH has not paid sufficient attention to them in the past, or because the discovery of a new gene has created opportunities that need to be pursued, or because a methodology has come about that now allows us to study the disease in a new way. For example, the Genome Project has made it possible for the Cancer Institute to begin to look at the anatomy, if you will, of a cancer in a different way by looking at the totality of expression of genes in each individual cancer, an advance that I believe will completely change our attitude toward the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancers over many years. Those investments are the ones that are highlighted in the areas of emphasis, and that is a document that is prepared by a series of consultations. one percent transfer authority In addition, as part of our yearly assessment of what is going on during that fiscal year, we consider as a group initiatives proposed by the Institutes that can be funded by transferring money from one Institute to another. And only 20 or 30 or 40 million dollars is usually transferred in that process. It is a combination of discussions among the Institute directors and advice that I receive from external advisors who are brought in to discuss these issues with me that result in the final determination that is then sent to your committee. Mr. Nethercutt. Well, I thank you very much for your good work. I have just commended to my colleagues on the panel, the recent editorial that was written in the Journal of NIH Research entitled, ``Mix Science and Politics? Of Course.'' I think it goes to a lot of the comments that you have made here today that there are a lot of influences that decides who all-- -- Dr. Varmus. And I would point out that the Journal of NIH Research is not a journal written by the NIH. final authority for decision-making Mr. Porter. Mr. Hoyer. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Essentially, this committee has been a committee of advocacy for NIH. Doctor, in page 2 of your statement, you talk about where the final authority resides for making these important decisions, i.e., the allocation of resources. Notwithstanding the fact that we have lawyers, Indian chiefs, and refugees from Russian studies, the Founding Fathers put the authority here. What we try to do and what Mr. Obey and Mr. Porter have argued for is that we need to put a great deal of reliance on your judgment. But, ultimately the decision resides here, and, therefore, we have these hearings as opposed to simply saying, whatever Dr. Varmus says is what we do. It is interesting and important to note that the scientific community doesn't always agree. Dr. Klausner might want to answer one of the questions that I want to ask you. The New England Journal of Medicine published an article which is an update of the previous proposition that in the allocation of resources within the Cancer Institute or within NIH, we are spending too much money on trying to cure cancer as opposed to preventing and dissuading people from activities which lead to diseases. I think that is an interesting big picture item which we, nonscientists, will ultimately have to decide on. I have no doubt that we will continue the way we have gone, so I don't think it is going to change policy, but I think it is an appropriate question. I would like to hear your comments on this and Dr. Klausner's, comments, and perhaps other members of the panel, because ultimately, big dollars are put here because the people give those of us in Washington monies and hope we will spend it wisely. We have to try to decide how to do that. Dr. Varmus. Let me comment briefly before turning the microphone over to Dr. Klausner, about the initial comment you made about where the responsibility resides. I absolutely agree that the responsibility for giving out money to the Institutes resides with you, and of course, the administration. But there is that additional responsibility of deciding exactly how the money is spent within the Institute. Obviously, we are answerable to you because if you don't believe we spend it well, you give us less next year. But those decisions made within the budget that is given to any individual Institute, at the moment, at least, are our responsibility. Mr. Hoyer. And I do not want to be misunderstood. We agree, of course. The proposition that our Chairman and our Ranking Member were stating was that we have made a judgment that the best interest of the taxpaying public is that it is not a political decision. I think that is the position of the two most influential members of our committee, and I think we all agree on that. But in that context, the public does expect us to make judgments as to whether we are spending their money wisely. And then I go to this study where, having gone through a recent experience, I was very frustrated by the fact that we could not impact the situation that confronted our family. And every family in America has been confronted with this. After we spent a lot of money, how come we cannot impact the situation? As I understand, the proposition of the article is that we really have not made a whole lot of difference. Mortality rates are essentially the same. Not in every category, but essentially overall, adjusted for life expectancy, mortality rates are essentially the same and, therefore, what we ought to do is shift our priorities to a greater focus on prevention. cancer mortality rates Dr. Varmus. We do have some differences with regard to Dr. Bailar's article. I think Rick might want to comment on them. Dr. Klausner. Yes, I would be delighted to. The main take- home message of Dr. Bailar's analysis, which is a reanalysis of what the American Cancer Society and the NIH have done using public numbers, is that we agree that something remarkable has happened. Cancer mortality rates were going up all century. They were going up. And around 1990, the overall rate stopped going up and since then we all agree they are beginning to drop. Now is cancer defeated? Absolutely not. A disease that is going to kill about 550,000 people this year is not defeated. But the sound bite from the New England Journal has been that efforts devoted to cancer have been a failure. I must say I don't feel I am being defensive, but the numbers don't support the sound bite. They are dropping. The mortality rates are dropping. Where I disagree with Dr. Bailar is why and what are the implications for policy. We agree about the numbers. Dr. Bailar says treatment will fail, that we have been promised it for years. The problem is cancer is not one disease. It is many diseases. And if you are now going to go from the aggregate lumping of total mortality, whether we look at total mortality of all diseases, you are not going to learn anything until you look disease-by-disease. The reality is when we look disease-by-disease, the mortality rates are really falling. The answer for some is prevention. With lung cancer, we have not made much progress for treatment. We think we know how to prevent it. Gastric cancer is plummeting and we actually have no idea why. Breast cancer mortality rates are really beginning to fall. That is ascribed to a combination of early detection and treatment, and I will propose that the vast majority is the use of adjuvant therapy, which has been recently shown for colorectal cancer to reduce mortality by 20, or 30 percent. Forty years ago, people argued childhood cancer couldn't be cured. Don't try it, they said. Now, 80 percent of our children with cancer are cured. Now, Dr. Bailar says that is not enough, the numbers are not enough. What do we say on prevention? Again, the question is what are the numbers? The NCI spends 38 percent of its dollars on what the prevention community broadly defines as prevention, and we keep looking for new leads and investments. A blue ribbon panel was constituted last year by me of experts from throughout the country on prevention. This report will be given to me next week, in fact, about how we should be studying prevention better. But we currently spend 38 percent of our dollars on prevention. Prevention requires knowing causes. It is not simple. There is no more likely going to be a magic bullet for a single cure for cancer than a magic bullet in prevention. An article that I am sending to the New England Journal is subtitled from a quote from Yogi Berra, and that is ``When You Come to a Fork in the Road, Take It.'' What do we mean by that? When we look at the reason we are making incremental progress, progress that we all agree is too slow, it is being made for many reasons. It is a combination of prevention, early detection and treatment. We need to take our victories where we can. When we come to the fork in the road where we are seeing progress in both treatment, and as he says, early detection--but early detection doesn't cure anything without an effective therapy--and prevention, we need to do all of it. We spend about 31 to 35 percent of our dollars directly on treatment versus 38 percent on what we talk about as prevention; that is, prevention, intervention, understanding the cause--you can't do prevention if you don't understand cause--epidemiology, predisposition, environment, et cetera. Mr. Hoyer. Doctor, I have one last question, but the article, I think, would be interesting for the Members to have. Dr. Klausner. I will have to submit it through the New England Journal. They have asked me to write it and we will have to see if they accept it. Mr. Hoyer. It would be interesting, even if they don't accept it. [The information follows:] Cancer Research Article Upon completion of the article, I would be pleased to submit it for the record. funding for autism Mr. Hoyer. We had some very compelling testimony from a Dr. Rothman, whose brother is a Member of Congress from New Jersey. His testimony really crystallized what we are talking about. He has a child with autism. There are apparently 380,000 cases of autism in the United States. He made the analogy between autism, cystic fibrosis, and M.D., and referred to how Jerry Lewis raises a lot of money. He made the comparison between about a $33.88 expenditure on autism per afflicted individual, $1,000 on muscular dystrophy, and $1,200 on cystic fibrosis. His point was that you have $20 billion in consequential expenses relating to the 380,000 autistic children and adults, but we were doing very little to combat it. Chairman Porter made a very compelling statement you know, we have got to listen to the scientific community. We will put report language in, but, ultimately, we do not want to make a political decision. I thought the Chairman's comments were on target and I agree with him. But on the other hand, from this parent who happens to be a medical scientist and a doctor's standpoint, he compares a telethon and a lot of dollars at the NIH, on M.D. and cystic fibrosis which have far fewer individuals afflicted. This doctor says to himself, how are you making these decisions? How do we answer that individual? Dr. Varmus. Let me answer with respect to autism. I don't find it extremely useful to try to do the comparison disease- by-disease. But I do find it useful to focus on autism as a disorder. We recognized a few years ago that autism was a much more complex brain-based disorder than had commonly been thought. A workshop was carried out in part in response to a congressional suggestion in 1995 and organized by the Child Health and Human Development Institute. A great deal was learned in that workshop about, first of all, the idea that autism was probably not a single disorder, but instead as many as five or six different disorders. There were also clues available as to anatomical abnormalities in the brain. It was agreed among the members that were involved in this workshop that we needed to place additional emphasis on the families that had been studied, attempting to identify genetic components, and to do more neurophysiological and neuroanatomical studies of this disease. The result has been a new initiative involving several Institutes at the NIH. There is a small coordinating group. This year I have used my one percent transfer money to help underwrite the genetic studies of autism. I believe that we are going to see, as a result of the process, there will be a quite similar result to what I tried to describe in my opening testimony for Parkinson's Disease. I think that this is one place where advocacy and a few new scientific developments have synergized to allow us to identify some ways to promote the study of this disease. Mr. Hoyer. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the extra time you gave me. Mr. Porter. We will take it off your next series of questions. The Chair has eight Members on the list. This would take us somewhere between 12:15 and 12:30. Dr. Varmus, do you and your colleagues have time to stay with us? Dr. Varmus. I certainly do, and my colleagues would be agreeable. Mr. Porter. Patsy Mink of Hawaii. Statement of the Hon. Patsy Mink, a Representative in Congress From the State of Hawaii detection of ovarian cancer Mrs. Mink. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I certainly want to thank you, Mr. Porter, for inviting me to participate in these hearings this morning. I do not serve on the Appropriations Committee, so this is a rare opportunity that is being extended to some of us who care deeply about what is happening in the whole area of health, particularly the impacts of research and other activities at NIH, and the implications that it has on the general fears and concerns of our constituents. While I certainly support the comments of the Chair and the Ranking Member that it would be inappropriate to politicize the whole question of the areas of research that are being conducted in NIH, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to express my very deep concerns about the minimal efforts that have been done in the last 6 or 7 years in the whole area of ovarian cancer. I came upon this issue in 1990 when I returned to Congress and found at that time less than $7 million that we could identify with the assistance of NIH to ascertain exactly what was being spent in direct research and studies and explorations in this area. Today, after nearly 7 years, we have somewhat less than $40 million being expended. I hope that because of the efforts of some of us, that increase has been able to be attained. But the point is that we are not here to make choices for the NIH. I believe that the staff and the experts there have to make that determination. But I do feel that the Congress has the responsibility to express the frustrations and anxieties of the population as large. And we are talking about 28,000 women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year. We also know that 14,000-plus die of ovarian cancer each year, and these are fairly steady figures that have not diminished in any way over the last 6 or 7 years. The frustration is not an anxiety with respect to prevention or cure. The anxiety comes from the fact that there is really no early detection process for the assurance that women can get because of periodic checks to ascertain that they do not have this dreaded disease. Most frequently, the disease is discovered too late, and as a result only 25 percent of those that have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer can expect to survive more than 5 years. It seems to me with this picture of the historic reality of this disease, that somewhere in NIH, there must be a combination of interest, talents, and motivation to get more research into this area for the one aspect of it, and that is the early detection. And I would like to know from yourpoint of view, Dr. Varmus, are we advancing our best research in this one area, and how close are we to giving assurances to the women in this country that in a short period of time there will be tests available in the hands of practicing physicians that have the chance of detecting this type of cancer? Dr. Varmus. Thank you for the question, Mrs. Mink. I believe that we are making progress in this area. I am going to turn the microphone over to Dr. Klausner of the Cancer Institute to answer in detail. I would draw your attention to one unexpected benefit that came from the studies of genetics in breast cancer. We now know that two recently discovered genes that were pursued initially because they were believed to be involved in hereditary breast cancer also predispose strongly to ovarian cancer. Knowledge of mutant forms of those genes is an important clue to women who may be highly disposed and particularly appropriate targets for early detection methods. But I think to discuss some of those methods and what is being developed, I will turn to Dr. Klausner. Dr. Klausner. You described the difficult situation with ovarian cancer perfectly. You are absolutely right. We need early detection for that reason. Dr. Varmus, before, described a new initiative of NCI called Cancer Genome Anatomy Project. Instead of waiting however long it might take, decades, to discover a possible flag, a marker like PSA, but hopefully even better than PSA for cancer, what we now have the opportunity to do through the Cancer Genome Project is to quickly try to identify all expressed molecules, all expressed genes in any cancer. We have begun that. It is up and running, and there are five cancers chosen in the first year to initiate the project, one of which is ovarian, and it is moving very quickly. Now, I don't know what to promise from that. I don't know whether we will discover a PSA or a better than PSA--which I think we can do better--with this project, but I think this is the quickest way to once and for all give us the tools to ask whether there are markers to provide a blood test or some other sort of test. I can go on to other things that we are doing, but I think that is actually the most significant ones, and we chose ovarian as one of the five for exactly the reason you talked about, because we so desperately need new markers. Mrs. Mink. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Mr. Istook. Mr. Istook. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. factors in resource allocation Dr. Varmus, I appreciate the chance for the hearing today. I must say, I remain disturbed and, frankly, suspicious about some things I am hearing. I recognize, and I think we all recognize the need to pursue scientific opportunity. The opportunity should be pursued, but when we talk about the need, also, to pay attention to the incidence of diseases and of deaths in society and make that a significant factor in the allocation of resources also, I think that NIH protests too much; the vigor with which I hear actual denouncements of efforts to do that. If we talk about that, it is characterized not as us trying to take our proper congressional role in public policy and spending public money, instead it is characterized as an excessive congressional directive. We are treated as though we don't pay attention to scientific opportunity and the other things that you properly consider, but there is such an effort to avoid having NIH priorities expressly take into account the number of people afflicted with different diseases, the number of people who die from them, the cost to society and the cost to the families and the financial cost as well, whether it be to the Federal Government through Medicare and Medicaid spending, things that go through HCFA, whether it be the cost to private insurance companies or the cost to the individuals or the lost man-hours at work, whatever it may be. I, frankly, am tired of the NIH pooh-poohing and belittling those factors, and I believe you are doing so, even though you don't do it in quite those words. The jealousy with which you try to say the pursestrings should be under the control of persons who know better than the rest of us is an attitude that is not healthy in our society, and we are here trying to talk about public health. I see ratios that are so out of proportion. We have seen it analyzed in different ways. If you look at what NIH is doing per patient in this country that either has AIDS or HIV, there is $2,100 a year being spent on research on that. But per patient with breast cancer, it is only a tenth of that, $200. For overall cancer it is $338. Alzheimer's, $81; heart disease, $74; Parkinson's disease, $34; diabetes $20. But diabetes has 16 million Americans that are afflicted with it. People who face amputations and all sorts of other complications because of it. It is a horrible disease in what it does to people. Sixteen million people, $20 each; AIDS or HIV, the larger category, 700,000 Americans at best, $2,100 each. I realize you should not be driven by a strict sense of having to have percentages and proportions. We both agree that would be wrong. That is not the approach anybody advocates, but when you look at the overall results and the disparity, the system that you have now is one where all roads lead to you, Dr. Varmus, in the decision-making. I realize that you did research in this area before you came to NIH. You are a very capable and accredited scientist who has the public good at heart. But there are many others who also have the public good at heart and there is such a disproportion here. And I think there is a lack of recognition that 34 million Americans with Parkinson's disease are paying for this research. And 8 million Americans with cancer and 2 million women with breast cancer and 16 million with diabetes, and 13.5 million with heart disease, these are the people who are paying for the research. To be told that those numbers are at best a negligible factor or that Members of Congress that bring it up are being excessive is an attitude that I find extremely disturbing. What do you say to the administration when they overlook your budget? When the White House exercises a role in your spending priorities, do you subject them to the same criticism? I am very disturbed. priority setting And I would like to know, Dr. Varmus, in the descriptions that you have given us of the priority setting, are your priority setting meetings open to the public? Are they open to the representatives of the administration and to the White House? Are they? Dr. Varmus. I do not know for sure what priority setting meetings you are talking about. As I mentioned, there are many sessions. Mr. Istook. Do you accept White House and administration efforts to be involved in the prioritization process? Dr. Varmus. I am not sure which step in the process you are referring to, Mr. Istook. Mr. Istook. All right. Do you have communications on behalf of the White House that come to you saying we want these priorities to be established in research funding? Dr. Varmus. That happens occasionally. We, of course, develop our budget with the OMB and with the White House. And frankly, Mr. Istook, I don't think you are hearing what I am trying to say. Mr. Istook. I don't think you are hearing what I have been trying to say, but please go ahead. Dr. Varmus. We are discussing priorities here. We do meet with many members of the committee; we meet with your staffs. There is a tremendous amount of to and fro between Congress and the NIH. And we welcome that. You are representatives of the public. I think you are painting me in the position of greater authority and arrogance than is true. For example, I must take particular care to point out that although you say all roads lead to me and that I worked in an area of research that is HIV/AIDS-related in the past, that the imputation that the size of the AIDS budget is the result of my single-handed determination to make the budget that large is really incorrect. Mr. Istook. I agree. It is not an effort to do that because, frankly, I don't think there is any other disease that has had the political involvement, you know, people in Hollywood wearing ribbons, the media attention to it, the millions of dollars that are given to political campaigns by people who have a specific interest in this disease. I would agree it is not, in that case, that all roads lead to Dr. Varmus. But I think it is a mistake to pretend that politics are not involved in the process and in the result we have seen with the disparate funding for that research. It is not that AIDS is not a terrible disease, because it is, but it is not the only terrible disease. nih expenditure on aids research Dr. Varmus. My point is, that although I strongly defend the money that we spend on HIV/AIDS, the current funding level was actually established before I came to the NIH. It was established by a large number of factors, including congressional appropriations, administration wishes, public health concerns manifested by many components of the public, and as well as by scientific opportunities. So, you know, if you look back at the history of the development of funding for AIDS research, you will see that the funding was at an extremely low level initially in the course of the epidemic, when it was difficult to know how this disease appeared. Many have argued, perhaps appropriately, that the government was slow to respond. There was also a shortage of experimental opportunities. We didn't know how the disease arose. The CDC was heavily involved in trying to find the cause of the disease. Once we knew that the disease was caused by a retrovirus, there was tremendous opportunity because the virus is one that we had tremendous information about. With the virus spreading through the population, affecting young people, and being universally lethal, with little prospect of a vaccine, there was tremendous public support for pursuing this in a vigorous way. Mr. Istook. And there should be significant resources for it. Dr. Varmus. And increases occurred up to fiscal year 1994 at which point the level of funding has stabilized. We believe that within the context of that budget we have been very successful in trying to pursue the vast myriad manifestations of the disorder. Because of many concerns about the AIDS research portfolio, 2 years ago we asked over 100 investigators, many of whom do not work on HIV/AIDS, to conduct a study of our research portfolio. First of all, they thought that the level of funding was approximately appropriate and that there was no need for increased funding. But they made a number of suggestions about moving allocations from one area of AIDS research to others, more emphasis on vaccines, and many other suggestions. stabilizing aids infections Mr. Istook. Would you say, Dr. Varmus, with CDC reporting decline in the incidence of AIDS, that a decline in the AIDS research proportion I am going to say, not absolute numbers, but proportion should be anticipated? Dr. Varmus. There has been a stabilization in the number of new infections. Dr. Paul may want to speak to this, as well. Of course, the problem is not solely confined to this country, and as Dr. Paul pointed out a moment ago, AIDS will soon be the number one cause of infectious disease worldwide--a disorder of mass destruction in many parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia, and still the major cause of death among our young adults in this country. So it is not a problem that is going away by any means. The fact that we have achieved some level of control is not, in my view, a reason to say that the battle is over, far from it. Mr. Istook. I don't think anybody would say the battle is over. The question is not whether there should be significant resources there, because I believe everybody agrees there should be. It is a horrible and deadly disease. The question is one of prioritizing with other deadly diseases that affect a far, far larger number of Americans. Dr. Paul. Mr. Istook, I might comment if that would be appropriate. Mr. Istook. Sure, I think I am about to lose my time from the Chairman. Dr. Paul. I think Dr. Varmus has made some of the most important points. In HIV, we face an unusual situation. Like you, I recognize there are many other terrible diseases and that as a Nation we have an obligation to attack them vigorously. Here we are facing a disease which has appeared on the scene relatively recently and of still uncertain potential. While you rightly point out the number of infections has stabilized within the United States in recent years, we know this disease is running rampant throughout the rest of the world. It continues to evolve because it is a relatively recent pathogen for humans. It is not like influenza or measles which has been evolving for a millennia. We cannot predict with confidence how this virus will interact with different populations as it continues to move through the rest of the world until we have a reliable means to prevent transmission--a vaccine or other preventive means--or effective treatment for populations who are at risk and will remain at risk. It is my own view that this is an opportunity we have been given to try to deal with the disease now and not leave it to our children or grandchildren to face what may be a more severe epidemic. So my own view is that we are facing an unusual challenge and we have adopted an unusual mechanism. I would argue that this is an appropriate action that the Nation as a whole has undertaken. Mr. Istook. Just in final statement, Mr. Chairman, I think it is important that we understand that the research dollars that go through NIH in AIDS are only about 20 percent, approximately, of the overall Federal spending that is related to this particular disease. Maybe there is some management of the overall numbers that are in order, because I certainly agree and I want to commend your efforts on researching this. The Human Genome Project, I absolutely agree with you with the extreme significance of that and other things; but I just finally reiterate my concern that there are so many other diseases that I feel are not getting proper priority in NIH allocations. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mr. Istook. Ms. Pelosi. aids research funding Ms. Pelosi. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to join you in thanking our distinguished guests for their fine testimony today--more importantly, for their leadership and the important work they do at the NIH. You are very fortunate, I think, because you have the power to cure. Hopefully, we can match the opportunity to scientific opportunity you have with resources so we don't miss any opportunities. Because we certainly don't want to engage in pitting one disease against another at the expense of missing an opportunity someplace along the way. Since I came so late in the game in terms of questions and answers and had the opportunity to hear the questions of my colleagues, it enables me to move on to another issue. First, though, I want to thank you, Dr. Varmus and Dr. Paul, particularly, for the justification you presented today on the AIDS research funding. I think it holds up on the criteria established in your presentation, Dr. Varmus. I want to thank all the members of the panel for making themselves available today, but also Dr. Klausner has visited San Francisco where there is a very high incident of breast cancer. Yes, we have a great deal of activism on the outside. I don't call that politics; I call it America. It is good when people speak out about a subject of which they are aware to make sure we have the full benefit of their views in making a judgment. I am certain, Dr. Varmus, that you could make a chart like this about AIDS as well in terms of the benefit it can give to other diseases as well as aspects of--areas of NIH which receive funding on AIDS research, is that right? Dr. Varmus. As you know, the budget is coordinated by the Office of AIDS Research but goes to every Institute at NIH. unanticipated research results Ms. Pelosi. I thank you. That is a level of politics I couldn't possibly understand, and I appreciate how you manage to pull that off. But I commend you for doing so, because I know it is a challenge. I wanted to talk about the future a little bit, because in your remarks you talk about there are limits to ability to plan science, the developments of recombinant DNA methods. It illustrated the need for unplanned, untargeted, high-quality fundamental science, as you said. The Human Genome Project, which follows on that, of course opens so many avenues. I know that the discovery of DNA was a culmination. Are there any inspirations in the Genome Project which you foresee which would inquire a huge infusion of funds? My question comes to the point of, A, what do you anticipate your needs down the road to be; and, B, if there were a will in the country to double the NIH budget in the next 5 years, could you absorb that? genetics research opportunities Dr. Varmus. Well, there is very little doubt that whenever the pursuit of human genetics identifies a disease involved in the cause of disease, we create new possibilities for investigation. Many examples have accrued over the last few years in the area of cancer. We believe we are on the threshold of such discoveries in Parkinson's disease, hopefully in autism, and in many other neurological disorders. When a gene is discovered, you read about it in the newspaper. To the naive reader this seems like, a--if you will excuse the expression--a culmination. But in our view it is just the beginning. We now have the tool. It is directed in a multiplicity of directions. Can we use this tool to develop tests to indicate predisposition to disease or early diagnosis? Can we use this gene to understand the basic mechanism by which the disease arises? Can we use the gene and the protein that the gene directs the cell to make to develop new therapeutic approaches? It is that set of new experimental possibilities that are now created by having a gene in hand that demands additional resources be devoted to that disorder. So the Genome Project, as we mentioned earlier, is not classified by disease. Indeed, the entire extramural genome budget is not classified by disease. But the outcome of the research is to generate opportunities that clearly fall into categorical disease areas. Ms. Pelosi. And these are all not predictable. Dr. Varmus. Well, in some cases, we can say yes. If we look backward, we can say we knew there was going to be a gene for cystic fibrosis, which is a disease of inherited nature. The gene was discovered several years ago, creating new opportunities for thinking about therapy and diagnosis and understanding of the disease. In other cases, it is a little more difficult to know. For example, in the case of autism, which we talked about a moment ago, or hypertension or diabetes, it is difficult to know exactly how many genes are involved, and what the discovery of those genes will provide. In the area of diabetes, just last year two new genes were identified as being important in a disorder called maturity onset diabetes of the young. Those genes had, in fact, previously been identified and not suspected as being diabetes genes. But we already knew something about them. That, obviously, creates all kinds of new inspirations, if you will, for trying to understand diabetes more generally. doubling nih's budget Ms. Pelosi. You didn't say whether you could absorb the doubling of the NIH budget. Dr. Varmus. Well, as you know, Ms. Pelosi, NIH funds currently about 25 percent of its grant proposals. A doubling of our budget, we would assume, would occur in increments. Yes, we certainly could absorb that. We also recognize that we are not the only agency that seeks more funds in government. The Administration has many other objectives that the intention of the Congress and the public is to reach---- Ms. Pelosi. Is there scientific opportunity for that? Dr. Varmus. Absolutely. Ms. Pelosi. So that takes me to my final point, which is we have a problem. Because certainly if there is scientific opportunity and we have the ability to put the resources there, we have, I think, a moral responsibility to do so. However important that we all clearly view the work of the NIH, it is the same old thing. It is not the price. It is the money. And the money just doesn't seem to be here, unless, as I say, there is a will in the country to change that readily. I know our Chairman would--if there was any way to have the money, he has certainly been your champion. But instead of having this pitting of one disease against the rest, I would hope that we could all channel our energies toward a bigger 602(b) allocation for our committee; and so much bigger that any increase in the NIH would not come at the expense of other lambs in our lamb-eat-lamb allocation--job training, Head Start--you know the list very, very well. So what is important for me to hear from you today is that there is scientific opportunity for not incrementally but a drastic increase in the funding. We have to take it to the American people to see if they want to live within the budget constraints, which are difficult at best, and now, with the new budget numbers in light of the budget agreement, almost unlivable for us. But the challenge of scientific opportunity to be matched by the resources is one that I find irresistible. But, on the other hand, we need the scientific community to help us with our entire budget so you are not benefiting at the expense of other functions within our subcommittee. I did want to just make one other point, Mr. Chairman; and that is to say that all of what we do here really saves money in the end. If we are helping people be well, if we are finding cures, if we are adding to productive years of life for people, I wish we could have a dynamic scoring on the investments at the NIH. But I leave that to our Chairman. Thank you all very much again. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Ms. Pelosi. Now, the congresswoman who has the privilege of representing many of the NIH scientists and has the NIH campus in Bethesda within her district, Connie Morella of Maryland. Statement of the Constance A. Morella, a Representative in Congress From the State of Maryland Mrs. Morella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for inviting me to this briefing. I was sitting in the corner for most of it, so I did hear the responses and the questioning that took place. I must say I am very, very proud, obviously, of the National Institutes of Health and the progress that has been made through the years; and it only happens because of leadership, leadership from the top and the leadership that you all have provided as Members at the top. You also--I think we are pretty fortunate in having such a good subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. It is a pleasure to--not as a member, as someone who is not a member of the committee--to work with that committee in terms of getting the kind of funding that they need; and you can tell by the questioning, by and large, how they feel. I am going to a meeting on lupus and then osteoporosis, I was in the Race for the Cure, and my sister died of cancer years ago. I am very much involved in HIV/AIDS, particularly in women where the fatality rate has increased 3 percent over the years; and, of course, worldwide will be a problem. I think we need to push more the breakthroughs as spin-offs, the ripple effect. When you move into the field of HIV/AIDS and a discovery occurs, it is one that might well be applicable in so many other areas, so that research in these areas pays off. information transfer I wonder if you might indicate what is the rule? How do you handle that? How do your other institute centers people know about breakthroughs in one area so they can apply it? Dr. Varmus. Fortunately, the world on the outside is not categorized by Institutes and Centers. That is only true at the NIH. But when one is an outside scientist, as I was for many years, one thinks of oneself as publicly supported by the NIH. You are a member of a scientific community that may identify itself as cell biology or virology or genetics. One goes to meetings and reads journals and hears about research developments through a wide variety of mechanisms--gossip, telephone, the New York Times and, of course, through the usual scientific processes. There is an issue with respect to moving information among the institutes, among the program managers. We have made a real effort over the last several years to try to develop the appropriate mechanisms for coordinating efforts among our institutes when multiple institutes are involved in the pursuit of any single problem. As you have seen from the charts and much of the discussion, it is almost inevitably the case that any single discipline or disease-oriented area of research will command the attention of multiple institutes. So we do that at one extreme by having an office like the Office of AIDS Research, with its major fiscal and scientific oversight responsibilities. At the other end, there may be an informal relationship in which program managers or Institute directors from two or three Institutes will meet informally at regular intervals to see how research is progressing and what kind of applications they have received each year to study that discipline. We believe that through those two extremes, or through coordinating committees or offices in the Office of Director or other mechanisms, we are able to do a pretty good job of coordinating research. Mrs. Morella. So you think that works. It is an internal process. Dr. Varmus. I don't think it is always perfect. One of the ways we try to be responsive to Congress is to develop such bodies for coordination when the Congress perceives, or the public perceives, we are not doing as good a job as we should at that. effect of public and congressional input Mrs. Morella. Because I think it is a good way of heralding how the hipbone is connected to the thighbone and other things. One area of your testimony, you talked about how there is a balancing act in determining areas of research. One segment of that balancing act includes public input. I know this is a difficult thing because the public may be clamoring for more research, you know, for cancer. You and I talked about Sam Donaldson's Million Man Woman March for Cancer Research, but I wondered about the effect of public input. Also, I know Mr. Istook is not here, so I can mention this. Also the fact that the President came up with that mission statement with regard to we will have a vaccine, you know, against AIDS within the decade. I am also reminded of the Office of Research on Women's Health, and I know Dr. Kirschstein is here who is in the period of the genesis of it. But had we not had Congress looking in on where our priorities are or are not, if we had not had the public then entering the picture, we might still only have a little bit of an Office of Research on Women's Health. We might not include them in clinical trials and protocols as we now do. So I think that that says that there is a strong role for congressional involvement and public input not overwhelming what you as scientists know. But would you like to comment on that? Dr. Varmus. Well, I think you touched on an important point. We are responsive to Congressional and public interests; and I agree that we have made important advances in our approach to women's health issues through the interest of women advocates, the creation of a women's health office and the writing of guidelines for inclusion of women and minorities in research. Those have been extremely important. aids vaccine initiative With respect to your remark on the President's interest in the AIDS vaccine, I would make a minor correction in what you said and say that the President didn't say we will have it. He gave us a challenge, not a promise. He gave us what I call inspiration. That is, he has responded to our belief that the prospects for an AIDS vaccine have improved. There are no guarantees. I come back to Mr. Obey's point earlier about moon shots. We acknowledge that this is not an engineering feat we are undertaking. We are trying to do something the guidelines for which are not clearly spelled out. We are attempting to find new means to approach AIDS vaccine development. I believe having the President speak out on that public occasion about the possibility of doing this provides leadership and excitement and could have a very significant and, at this point, dollar-free contribution to the way in which we approach the AIDS epidemic. cost savings from research Mrs. Morella. Finally, just a statement. I very often, in comments to groups, will point out how much money we have saved in terms of health, the health of the Nation by virtue of something that has come from the NIH in the way of research. It is a good way of bringing the point home to people in terms of the value, tangibly, that they can see. So thank you all very much and thank you, Mr. Porter, for the opportunity. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mrs. Morella. Ms. DeLauro. ovarian cancer Ms. DeLauro. Thank you, very much; and I want to thank all of you for being here today and discussing with us the priorities within the NIH and how the research funds are prioritized. Obviously, the topic here is to--strong feelings amongst members of what are the areas of research that ought to be looked into, what are the areas that are considered underfunded. My commitment, as you know, has been to women's health. I want to say thank you, though she has left, to my colleague Patsy Mink for talking about the issue of ovarian cancer, being one of the few survivors of ovarian cancer, and that we are providing this amount of money in terms of diagnosis, treatment. So I am very excited about the Genome Project, and ovarian cancer is included in it. politics and research I think--while Members try to influence decisions or really, for the most part, try to provide informed views on the direction, I think we do need to concede that politicians--and I am proud to be one--are not the final arbiters in this effort. I think one area that has been mentioned, the Parkinson's disease--and I don't want to get into a debate about this--we are in the business of cutting off avenues of research to look at, you know, Parkinson's fields of research or other means. I think if we inject the politics into this process, then we wind up truly not serving the best interests and best health of the public. So we put a lot of faith and responsibility in the judgments of NIH and the research funding priorities--not an easy admission for those of us who are here. clinical research One of the things I wanted to inquire about--and I have asked this question in different ways over the last several months. That is, while basic research is critically important in generating fascinating, powerful insights into disease, without the kind of transfer, the clinical research, the discoveries cannot really help to improve the care that Americans receive in their doctors' offices and hospitals. So the balance between basic research and clinical research has been the topic of some conversation. Along with several of my colleagues, we have introduced legislation to raise that profile of clinical research. I want to get a sense from the NIH of how do we ensure that the discovery--the remarkable discovery that you are making in basic research---- And let me say with regard to the AIDS research, when you are looking at research into blood and into suppressed immunities, this carries over into cancer and a whole variety of areas. This is not one specific area. But what are the steps that we are taking at the NIH to ensure that the discoveries that we make in basic research, with being tested in the clinical trials, are hitting doctors' offices across the country where that is--where the people receive the benefit? technology transfer Dr. Varmus. Let me point out that there are at least three vehicles for doing what you outline. First, something I won't talk about in detail is technology transfer. As you know, Congress became concerned in the late 1970s about getting the products of our research into development, and the Bayh-Dole Act was one way to do that. We of course, are not the only game in town, and we want to believe the basic discoveries we make are picked up by pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms and carried forward into the production of benefits that can be delivered to patients. We believe there has been a very successful change in the way business is done. clinical research The second concern has to do with clinical research. I don't mean to distinguish clinical research from basic research; indeed some clinical research is basic. When I arrived at NIH there was a concern that clinical research was in a state of crisis for a variety of reasons having to do with a decrease in the number of trained individuals going into clinical research and the potential for underfunding of academic research centers where clinical research is carried out because of changes in health care reimbursement. And there were concerns that NIH might not be adequately supporting clinical research. As I think you know, Ms. DeLauro, we put together a panel of clinical research investigators and medical school leaders to look at the clinical research portfolio whether we support it adequately and whether we are adequately attracting new investigators into clinical research activities, particularly patient-oriented research. A number of things have come about as a result of the panel's activities over the last 2 years. One has been the simple recognition that NIH's investments in patient-oriented or clinical research are already very appreciable. In dollars, about 37 percent [Clerk's note.--Later corrected to ``38''] of our grant money is going to clinical research activities, and nearly 30 percent [Clerk's note.-- Later connected to about 27''] of our grants are in the clinical research arena. Secondly, we agree that there is concern about recruitment of new clinical investigators. We are in the process of trying to identify ways to support new clinical investigators on faculties. We have recently established a new training program that allows medical students to come to NIH and spend 1 or 2 years with us to develop their interests in clinical research. We are hoping over the course of the next couple of years to develop loan repayment programs to create incentives for clinical investigation in the extramural sector. We are also looking closely at the operation of our clinical center at the NIH, the largest center for clinical studies anywhere in the world. Your committee has been helping us maintain at a high level of productivity through the generation of a new building andmany new programs within the clinical center. information dissemination The third area of concern is how we get information about our discoveries into doctors' offices. We have a considerable degree of activity in communications to advertise our results. This is an imperfect process; it is one other agencies of government and professional societies must help us with, because it is a huge and expansive problem. It is one where I think, in general, the biomedical establishment has not been totally successful. We talked earlier about obtaining as much benefit as would be possible from discoveries in the area of diabetes over the last several years. We know the science has run ahead of clinical practice there. It is extremely important that we find better ways to support the instruction of physicians in new methods and new findings, and we do that. But we can't do that alone because it is simply too expensive. It is much more effective for us to work in conjunction with advocacy groups, physicians and scientific societies. ovarian cancer Ms. DeLauro. It is an area we really ought to talk about, because with regard to ovarian cancer, many of the women who have been diagnosed are not getting the kind of care and treatment they need. That is statistical data, and I understand the difficulties in ovarian cancer, and I don't know if the science is outpacing what is being passed on, as you mentioned with diabetes. But with a disease which is as insidious as it is and with the high death rate, if we have it and we are not then properly treating it, then, my God, to what end are we engaged, so whatever ways in which we can assist in that third opportunity, I think we need to explore those ways. And it is not just your responsibility; it becomes all of our responsibility as well. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Ms. DeLauro. Mrs. Lowey. congressional support Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I do apologize. Because of a commitment in New York, I missed part of the testimony, but I want to join my colleagues and thank all of you for the outstanding leadership you have shown. And I am very pleased that the Chairman, who is probably your strongest advocate--and I know most of us would join with him and wish we could double our 602(b). It is absolutely criminal to know that only 25 percent of the grants are funded, when you think of all those opportunities to deal with the challenges in medical research that we are not pursuing--in my judgment, it is a real tragedy. I, too, don't like to see one illness pitted against another, but I think it is so important that we say, loud and clear, and understand that we all advocate on behalf of so much of the research that is done, whether it is in AIDS or diabetes or breast cancer, that does affect other illnesses. And in the area of AIDS, we know, and you have certainly expressed to us, that so much of that research has helped us to advance in other areas, and to not take advantage of opportunities that exist in AIDS research is criminal as well. So I want to applaud you in that area. I remember when I got to Congress in 1988, looking back, if we had not had the input of activists and congressional members, certainly in the area of women's health, we would not have had that partnership and moved as fast as we have moved. I want to personally express my appreciation and thank you for the Women's Health Initiative, for all the work you have done. I remember talking--Dr. Kirschstein remembers as well--I remember talking to the American Women's Medical Association, and I remember them talking to us about their medical school classes where they would spend 5 minutes on estrogen and a couple of hours or a couple of days on testosterone. And I also remember the days when there were just three gynecologists on the staff at the NIH, so I want to personally thank you for that cooperative effort that has moved us so far ahead in those areas. And as a passionate supporter of research--and I want to assure you, I care about prostate cancer and heart disease and diabetes, and we can go on and on, but my particular concern is with regard to the Office of Women's Health; and I want to thank you for your concern in just making sure we have a healthier society. orwh's priority setting process We know that a primary function of the Office of Research in Women's Health is its role in identifying research vital to women; that should be conducted and supported by the NIH. Could you update us in how the office is functioning, how its agenda is determined? Following up on the original Hunt Valley conference, how is it continuing to analyze and reevaluate priorities? I think it would be helpful for us to hear. Dr. Varmus. I can do that very briefly, Mrs. Lowey. About a year and a half ago Dr. Pinn, who is the director of the office, put together a standing advisory committee composed of outstanding physicians and investigators around the country who were particularly concerned with women's health. They are helping her adjust the research portfolio and set new priorities. The office continues to provide supplements to grants, working closely with the many Institutes and centers, all of which, of course, have an investment in women's health. The purpose of most of those investments is to augment the level of activity on grant projects that have already been approved by the Institutes in order to provide them with extra resources, to expand their efforts in the gender-specific aspects of the work. In addition, the office has responsibility for trying to encourage the careers of women in science and provides a number of programs that allow women to reenter the work force and stay in the work force despite domestic responsibilities. Another issue I should perhaps raise with you is one I know you are concerned about: the inclusion of women and minorities in research projects, and the guidelines that have supported our activities in those areas that were written jointly among offices in the Office of Director, including the Office of Women's Health. Dr. Pinn has been involved in evaluating the success of those efforts, and as far as we can tell, the success has been very great; that is, we see very little difficulty in helping our investigators to achieve compliance with the recommendations of those guidelines. priority setting interaction of orwh and nih Mrs. Lowey. In looking at the Office of Women's Health over the past few years, is there any difference in setting priorities there compared to the way you set priorities with the entire Institute, and what is the interaction? Dr. Varmus. Well, I think the reasons I would say the differences are not so great is because Dr. Pinn and her colleagues are in fact working with the other Institutes. Therefore, the input that goes to the other Institutes is amalgamated into the decision-making process that goes on inthe Office of Research on Women's Health. Mrs. Lowey. I think that is so important because I think the research is done across the board in almost every area. As you revitalize the NIH clinical center, perhaps you could share with us what considerations have been made with regard to women's health issues. Dr. Varmus. Women's health is part of virtually every research endeavor. It would be difficult for me to say what special concerns have been addressed in the plans we have carried out so far. Most of the energy that has surrounded revitalization of clinical center activities has had to do with recruitment of new clinical investigators to the NIH, training programs, the construction of the new facility, and changes in governance of the clinical center. We believe that in every one of these, equity is provided for gender-specific research. I think there has been a very significant change in attitude over the last several years. I don't believe that there is an ingrained discrimination of a gender-specific source at this point. If you feel there are ways in which women's health issues are being slighted in those activities, I would be more than pleased to entertain your views. Mrs. Lowey. No, in fact, again in closing, I want to emphasize I think in the last decade there has been extraordinary progress in the attention given women's health needs; and as we stated before, the research is done across the Institutes and all the institutions involved. clinical research report Just in closing, I wanted to thank you for the report that you have provided regarding your efforts on behalf of clinical research. I must say I haven't read it as yet--we just received it--but I want to thank you for the report, and I look forward to discussing it with you. And once again I hope that we can be of help to our Chairman and that the 602(b) will be increased as my colleague Ms. Pelosi mentioned so we can fund a greater share of those grants. Thank you again. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey. Mrs. Northup. information transfer in prevention Mrs. Northup. Yes, Dr. Varmus, I would also like to talk to you about transfer of information and results that come from research. In many of the medical areas, there are the dollars and the economic reasons to transfer technology very quickly. For example, AIDS research, then pharmaceutical companies become involved in developing a drug that addresses the problems. That is not so true in some quality-of-life issues, I guess you call them prevention issues. And prevention is becoming much more the issue in health, and I just wondered what you all are doing to promote that. I will give you a couple of examples. For example, drug rehabilitation and questions of addiction. What sort of effort does the Institute make when you come to certain conclusions about rehabilitation, or prevention altogether, to transfer that information to HHS so that the grants and the funding of prevention actually follow what the research shows is most effective. I will give you one other example, and that is learning and learning disabilities. We had quite a bit of testimony about what the best way of teaching kids to read who are at risk, and remediation for kids who have fallen behind. But in fact there is very little evidence that the Department of Education funds those kinds of programs, and in fact the President has proposed a reading initiative that is as far away from that as you can get. So could you share your comment with me? There is no pharmaceutical incentive or money incentive or medical incentive or insurance incentive to have the transfer go in those cases? drug rehabilitation Dr. Varmus. Yes, you are making a very good point, and it is one we are concerned about. I am sure that more detailed explanations of what is being done could be provided on those two topics. I would point out in the case of drug rehabilitation, that Dr. Leshner, Director of NIDA, works closely with at least a couple of other agencies that are involved, like SAMHSA and other departments within the HHS. He also has been working closely with General McCaffrey and his colleagues on drug control. So there are other ways to try to translate the scientific findings into public policy. early childhood development As you know, the White House has had a high degree of interest in early childhood development. We hope that from the initiatives that have been put into place by the President in the last year to try to emphasize the role of early childhood development on learning, that there will be increased interagency activities. Mrs. Northup. I think my question specifically to you is, what does your agency do to make the people making public policy and appropriating money aware of your most recent findings? information transfer to other agencies Dr. Varmus. I think almost all agencies involved in public policy in those areas are aware that we do research in those areas, and see that we are consulted. There is also an opportunity through the National Science and Technology Council for spreading our information among the various agencies that are involved in those public policy decisions. So in the area of health, for example, there is a whole committee of the National Science Technology Council that is devoted to health and safety, and multiple representatives of the NIH are at those meetings. research on learning disabilities Mrs. Northup. I worry because I sometimes have the feeling that if they don't call--and, quite honestly, I think that was really true of learning disabilities and problems--that you all do the research; and then, in a sense, the Department of Education until recently was not aware of what the most recent research was. Considering the dollars we are spending and how concerned we are about that issue, I think it is important that you initiate an effort to disperse the results of what your considerations are. Dr. Varmus. Well, I remember your interesting conversation with Duane Alexander, Director of NICHD, on this topic before, and I hope to get back to you about what is being done. [The information follows:] Information Dissemination of Research Findings on Learning Disabilities The NICHD has in place a successful program aimed at research information dissemination and in the last year has intensified its efforts in this regard in the area of reading development and disorders, and other learning disabilities. The extensive work of the Institute's investigators in the area of learning disabilities research is being published widely in research, education, and general interest publications. The NICHD is producing information such as fact sheets and brochures that are being distributed by the Institute and other agencies in both the government and private sectors. The Institute responds daily to many requests for information from the public and special interest groups on this subject. In addition, the Institute annually publishes a book that describes the year's progress in learning disabilities research. The NICHD worked cooperatively with the Department of Education to produce a set of information materials called ``Learning to Read--Reading to Learn'' that is being disseminated widely by the Department of Education and other agencies. The NICHD is working actively with the learning disabilities organizations to disseminate information to parent and education groups about the progress that is being made. In addition, the scientist directing the Institute's learning disabilities research program has testified before the Congress and, upon request, provided information to a number of state legislatures and parent groups in states around the country about the results of this research. In April of this year, the NICHD together with the Learning Disabilities Association sponsored a Learning Disabilities Summit in Washington, D.C., with the concluding event on Capital Hill, to further disseminate the research results in this area. The Institute is working with the Department of Education to develop a national assessment of research in reading development, reading disorders, and other learning disabilities and, where appropriate, a national strategy for the dissemination of that information to the Nation's teachers and schools. Mrs. Northup. What I am worrying about again, if we don't ask the right questions and somebody doesn't call up, nobody ever knows, and that is important. Earmarks in DOD for research I would like to ask you one other question. I absolutely agree with us not making scientific determinations here, but of course it is sometimes hard when you are in Congress not to think that you can't make all the rules. We try to repeal the laws of economics sometimes and all sorts of things. I have noticed that the defense appropriators have decided that they are going to earmark appropriations for such things as prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, Parkinson's disease and bone marrow. I was wondering if you would comment on, at least for us, why those appropriations being earmarked by defense aren't a good way or why they run counter to the best interest of research. Dr. Varmus. Well, I think that we at the NIH are interested, have been interested in working closely with our colleagues in the Department of Defense to make optimal use of those appropriations. As you know, there is very strong biomedical science in the Department of Defense through Walter Reed and the Office of Naval Research and other components of the Defense Department. You are right. The monies appropriated for research are in some cases conspicuously earmarked. We have a variety of interactions on virtually every topic on which they received earmarking that allows NIH scientists to interact with our counterparts in the Defense Department, and we welcome those interactions. In addition, the Defense Department has been working with us in clinical trials that include Department of Defense personnel. So there are many ways in which we interact with them, and to the extent to which most are appropriate for specific diseases, we try to do the best we can to provide advice that will allow those monies to be most wisely used. Mrs. Northup. Okay, thank you. Mr. Porter. Thank you, Mrs. Northup. NIH Budget for FY 1998 I think this has been an excellent hearing, and we want to thank you, Dr. Varmus, and your colleagues and all the members of the audience this morning. I might say that I found everything that you had to say highly credible, except defending the President, who is now--and I might add, this also includes the members of the Budget Committee and our leadership negotiators, who have now got the NIH budget down to a 1.2 percent increase for the next fiscal year. I am sure you find that just as unacceptable as we do, and I hope that the expressions about our 602(b) allocation that have been made by members of the panel this morning are ones that come true, because it will make it very, very difficult for us; and I am afraid the leadership of both the White House and the Congress have made it very, very difficult to make that a high priority and made our job much, much more difficult in the process. I think this is a subject that all of us have to address in the coming calendar year and make certain that the substance, the resources follow the advocacy. The advocacy is always welcome, but not if it is not supported by resources. Dr. Varmus, thank you very much. The subcommittee will stand in recess until 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, which is our last hearing of the year.
