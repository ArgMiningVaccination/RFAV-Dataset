Early autism signs really worrying me. My son is very difficult, he doesn't eat well, fights at the bottle and cries all day. He has some digestion issues and nothing seems to really help. He makes eye contact sometimes and will smile and babble but it's not often. He stares out of windows a lot. He's just so much different than my first and I'm getting so nervous that the stress I had during my pregnancy caused him problems.

These babies are just becoming aware of the world around them & so they do weird things. Just like my first, this baby loves to stare at the fan. She also stares at the sliding glass door. really he's doing everything normal developmentally, just very unhappy and not eating as much as he should be, which I think may be causing issues with him wanting to play and interact. He's just so miserable most of the time. my sister in law has 2 autistic boys. Both were very happy smiley babies. You are reading too much into nothing. that's what I've been told, I'm just following the milestones and he seems to be doing everything normal just not as much as his brother did. But I'm thinking it's because he's uncomfortable a lot so he's just not happy. Respectfully I disagree with this, every baby is different firstly.. and babies can show signs of autism as early as two months of age it's proven.. my niece smiled on occasion as a baby but never babbled or made direct eye contact and it continued to get worse the older she got.. so if it's mother's intuition that something may be wrong look deeply into it. My kiddo was diagnosed at 21 months. There is criteria out there for earlier diagnosis. Also he is an incredibly intelligent young man, he just needed some help along the way. Autism isn't something to fear. It's a completely different way of thinking. I know. Her youngest was counting from 1-10 at 2. Now he grunts. It's scary. But they are very happy and very loved boys. thank you for the reassurance but I couldn't imagine that seems so confusing and frustrating, I kind of thought kids were out of the woods by that point if they were hitting milestones. they both interacted very well and spoke up until the age of 2. Once they got older they both lost the ability to speak. Her eldest is now 10 and is socially awkward, very intelligent and managing away fine. Her youngest is 7, completely non verbal. Completely locked away in his old world. No one can tell if a baby is autistic. To be honest everything you listed described my now 2 and a half year old. He is so funny and smart, does not stop talking but was an incredibly difficult baby. Don't worry! you won't get a diagnosis as an infant. You actually answered your own concern. It sounds more like digestion issues than anything else. I'm pretty sure the earliest diagnosis you'd get is around 3 years old. if I may ask how did they come up with the diagnosis? Could it be a food issue? Maybe his stomach is upset both of my kids had tongue/lips ties, dairy/soy allergies, and terrible reflux. They acted the same way and would eventually stop eating until we got them on the right formula and had their ties revised. I would get a second opinion on the ties and maybe see if your baby's pediatrician would send a referral over to a gi doctor. It's so tough when your baby is always unhappy, we went through that with our first because we were new parents and had no clue about any of the feeding issues Yes, that's when my son cries too... which is so much better better than knowing he was constantly uncomfortable! It broke my heart! same ! It's like we have a whole new baby .. he is sooo much happier now. He only cries when he is hungry and overly tired. What a difference! I'm definitely not opposed to it he's just not having obvious signs of an intolerance you know? He passes gas just fine and his poops look normal it's more reflux and difficulty actually eating that I think is due to the tongue tie. Im probably just going to have to go through with the revision and see if that helps. Trial and error with these little ones. I had to change to a prescription formula and go completely soy and dairy free (since my baby is mostly breastfed) and since that change he's been a different kiddo. It's been about two months and before his stomach was hard, he was uncomfortable, and he would cry often. With the first change our doctor had us change to a different over the counter formula that was dairy free and just had me eliminate dairy. I'm so glad we made the change. The doctor can test your babies stool to see if there are signs of blood which would indicate a potential allergy... that's how they knew mine still had one. Hope this helps and that he finds some relief soon! it very well could be, I don't agree with the doctors about the tongue tie not causing issues but at the same time they know more than me and I don't want to put him through an unnecessary surgery. But it seems all his symptoms lean towards him not getting a good latch on the bottle. I just feel so bad he's so upset all the time could it be silent reflux? I daughter is 12 weeks and is now only drinking 3oz. She wasn't taking the much from the bottle or nursing well. We just started acid reflux medicine and she has increased her feeding and is eating with more ease and less discomfort we have changed formulas and bottles with no help. He has a posterior tongue tie but the ent dr said that it wouldn't be what's causing him problems. I've used gas drops, he gets probiotics in his nighttime bottle daily and I've seen no improvement unfortunately I wouldn't worry yet. I remember thinking my first son was bc of how he would do this weird hand flap thing. He was also soooo cranky and I was convinced that his crying would put him behind bc he literally didn't do anything without a meltdown. So far, the crankiness hasn't put him behind and he grew out of the flapping around 10mo. They all do weird things for a while. If you're still worried in a few months then def talk to your dr, but I think it's just too early. yeah my first did the hand flapping too and I was worried but was told it's normal for that age range. It's just hard not to worry My neighbor who has an autistic sons always tells me that when he was a baby he was perfectly fine she swears vaccine caused her son to be autistic but who knows. But she always told me when he was a baby he was perfectly normal and full of energy and played with other children things started shifting when he turned 3-4 years old. I would stop reading into things and besides nothing is wrong with having a child that needs a little assistance no need to stress over it. If it happens welp what can you do? Just keep going and make your child happy regardless. They will be fine don't stress the small stuff i mean autistic children can be much more difficult than typical children, it would be devastating but you're right there's nothing I would be able to do about it at this point. I'm hoping he's just having normal baby issues that I can get more answers here soon. I wonder why she thinks the vaccines caused it? My first never had a bad reaction or acted different after shots and so far this one hasn't either so I feel comfortable with vaccines. I'm not sure why either. I never had issues with vaccination besides the MMR which caused my daughter to have low blood platters and was diagnosed with ITP but she's been fine since then. That was just something she told me i have no experience everybody is different and what they think caused the issue but really i don't know i just know it's too early to make assumption just enjoy your baby My autistic kiddo is extremely chill. He was the easiest baby and still is an easy kiddo. He was delayed in speech which he is catching up on, and likes things like routine and extra sensory. It is not devastating as some have said. It's a different way of thinking, and for some can be more \"challenging\" yes. Academically ahead, while he's facing social delays. But that's what early diagnosis is helpful. You can't diagnose autism that early. All babies have different personalities. What formulas have you tried? Were you on the formulas for 2 weeks straight? His tie really could be the issue or it could be reflux like someone else suggested. For autism, neuropsychologists look at a child's developmental history and behavior and make diagnosis' based on that. The earliest they do is 2 though. I'm in the process! Just waiting for this pediatrician to give me another referral so I can go to a pediatric dentist that uses a laser for the revision. They are pretty terrible so I need to switch are you able to switch pediatricians? Even if you have to find a new pediatrician, I think it would be worth it to have someone who listens to you! my son had a posterior tongue tie, I knew he wasn't latching properly because he too clicked when he drank. He had his revised with a laser 5 weeks ago. I already see a difference, he still has to learn the proper way to latch and suck but it has improved a lot. He has so much less gas, grunting, and straining. I would definitely get another opinion. I'm sure he would've gotten used to it but I really don't think he has a CMPA and it's so difficult to find right now with the shortage and yes some bottles he'll eat and seem content and those bottles he won't start choking or hiccuping which is what happens when he has a really hard time drinking. I think he's having a hard time latching because he clicks when he drinks and so he's getting more air. I originally brought up him possibly having silent reflux before discovering the tie to his peds but they dismissed me and just wanted to do formula change. I think I'm just spiraling because I know something needs to be done and his pediatrician is awful so I'm just trying to figure it out myself gentlease did the same to my LO before we switched to nutramigen and she was okay with the taste of it. He probably didn't like the taste of nutramigen which I read about other babies not liking it either. I hear alimentum and Gerber extensive HA taste different and he might like that better. Does he fuss when you think he has reflux? he was on gentlease for almost 2 weeks before it made him very constipated and then we tried nutramigen but he didn't like it and I feel it made his symptoms worse (like silent reflux symptoms) so he's back on regular enfamil infant and his poops are much more normal on it and I feel he digests it the same. I really think it's the tie that's causing his reflux and other problems so I've been trying to get another referral for a pediatric dentist and every time I call they tell me they'll \"get back to me\" very frustrating. It is still so long until you would get a diagnosis of autism. I would try not to go there yet. my first sounds like that and he's not autistic. He was a colicky, hard baby and I worried about the same thing for a while. Too early to tell but I wouldn't worry at this age. thank you his brother did well on the mchatt or whatever it is and I don't know anybody on either side of the family diagnosed so I'm hopeful that it's unlikely he'll have it, it's not the end of the world I just know it makes parenting a bit more complicated and I'm barely hanging on as it is. Sounds more like reflux than signs of autism. My second is drastically different than my first. The differences worried me at first but he seems to just be doing his own thing.
