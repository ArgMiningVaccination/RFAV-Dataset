Launched in 2015, IPC includes interactive online courses, in-person experiential sessions, and a clinical component with supervision. T wenty-one residents and fellows havecompleted the curriculum. The purpose of the IPC is 2-fold: to enhance patient wellness through training residents and fellows in evidence-based whole-person care and to improve physician well-being through enhanced stress management and self-awareness utilizing the practice of mind-body skills within a supportive small group setting. Course participants aretrained in a broad range of prevention and treatment options and learn about their evidence base; they then practice incorporating IM into diagnosis and treatment plans through supervised clinical experience. This article describes the development of IPC and its elements. Efforts are underway to further develop and standardize the offerings and increasethe portability of the course, making it easier for Psychiatry training programs with limited faculty expertise in IM to provide the curriculum for residents and fellows. T o reach the goal of disseminating such a curriculum for integrative psychiatry, further funding and collaboration with multiple residency training programs is needed.

Accepted for publication April 4, 2019 Introduction As dened by the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health, Integrative Medicine (IM) \"reafrmsthe importance of the relationship between practitioner andpatient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evi-dence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic andlifestyle approaches, healthcare professionals and disci- plines to achieve optimal health and healing.\" 1The empha- sis on empirical evidence of effectiveness distinguishes IMfrom the original concept of Complementary andAlternative Medicine (CAM). In addition, an increasingnumber of approaches, such as mindfulness meditationor the use of Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, previ-ously considered \"alternative,\" are now developing a grow-ing evidence base for their use within the context of mentalhealth conditions. 2,3In many such cases, despite a growing body of evidence for efcacy and safety, it can take years for new scientic knowledge to be implemented into wide- spread clinical practice.4 The healthcare system continues to face many chal- lenges: rising costs, inability to effectively mitigate theburden of chronic disease, distrust of medical professio- nals, and a crisis in physician wellness that leaves up to 42% of doctors suffering from burnout and contributes to high physician suicide rates.5-12These factors paint a picture of a system in need of change. In addition, patients choose CAM methods in large numbers, includ- ing for common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.13-16Meanwhile, physician inter- est and research on the effectiveness of IM approaches are growing. All these factors contribute to the need for providers to be educated in IM. IM is especially relevant to psychiatric training because psychiatrists \"are qualied to assess both the 1Department of Psychiatry, University of Arizona, T ucson, Arizona 2Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Arizona, T ucson, Arizona Corresponding Author: Noshene Ranjbar, Department of Psychiatry, University of Arizona, T ucson, Arizona, USA.

This article describes an initiativeto develop a rigorous, standardized IM curriculum spe- cic to psychiatry, based on established IM programs for residency training in other elds and in line with guide-lines and recommendations such as those established bythe American Council on Graduate Medical Education(ACGME) and the Integrative Medicine in PreventiveMedicine Education Center. 22-24The innovative Integrative Psychiatry Curriculum (IPC) teaches psychi- atric residents and fellows the evidence-based practice ofIM, enabling them to care more holistically for patientsand for themselves. The IPC provides an opportunity toenhance the mental health system through improving the education of psychiatrists-in-training in a format that can be replicated across institutions. Process The IPC directors began the process of developing anIM curriculum for psychiatry trainees in November2014. Both directors completed certication with TheCenter for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM) as well as a1000-hour fellowship in IM with the Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine (AWCIM; formerly the University of Arizona Center for IntegrativeMedicine or UACIM) to deepen their own knowledgeand skills and to enhance networking with other expertsin IM. Upon approval by University of Arizona Department of Psychiatry leadership and residency training directors, IPC began as a pilot in July 2015.Through an iterative curriculum design involving feed-back from participants and continual improvement, theprogram has been updated and expanded over sever-al years. The IPC was developed in partnership with AWCIM, which provided the interactive online course work, fac-ulty mentorship, as well as research and IT support. The project was also bolstered by strong support from the Department of Psychiatry administration and leader-ship. Additional funding was received from The WeilFoundation beginning in July 2016. A University of Arizona Strategic Priorities Faculty Initiative grantaward provided faculty time for curriculum develop-ment, and existing AWCIM interactive online curricula for residents provided a model for the directors through- out this process. Integrative Medicine in Residency(IMR) was initially developed by AWCIM in 2008for Family Medicine and has since been adapted forInternal Medicine, Pediatrics, Preventive Medicine, andObstetrics. The IMR was originally implemented follow- ing a national needs assessment 25and addresses core competencies delineated by the ACGME. It was thenadopted and evaluated by 8 family medicine residencytraining programs. 26The successes and challenges of the IMR were instructive, and the IPC directors learned from faculty leaders of those programs throughout the development of the IPC as well as from a further needsassessment specic to psychiatry training. 21 Curriculum Content Currently, the IPC consists of 3 synergistic components:online, experiential, and clinical. Participants who suc-cessfully complete the rst year, IPC I, can elect to con-tinue for a second year in IPC II. Table 1 details the program requirements in 2018-2019. Online Component The aforementioned IMR curriculum developed for pri- mary care residents provides the foundation for theinteractive online component of IPC and is importantto the IPC for several reasons. As IM is a new eld, few psychiatry faculty have received training in or have had the opportunity to utilize IM in clinical practice.Thus, the availability of a standardized, online curricu-lum shown to be effective and feasible in other eldsensures that residents have access to consistent,evidence-based content that meets the highest standards of medical education and provides a broad foundation for IM training. 26Online courses also allow flexibility in scheduling; given the time demands on residents, it isimportant that they can access materials when andwhere they are able. The IM-trained and experiencedIPC directors selected 95 hours of the most essential and relevant content for psychiatry trainees from the existing AWCIM IMR online curricula. The IM curricu-lum includes Introduction to IM, Mind-Body Medicine,Physician Well-Being, Motivational Interviewing, Neuraland Mental Health, Complementary Medicine, DietarySupplements, Nutrition, and Special Topics (Table 2 ). Experiential Component The in-person experiential component of the IPC occurs during a 2-hour per week dedicated session2 Global Advances in Health and Medicinelongitudinally during the academic year. It starts with a 10-week Mind-Body Skills Group (MBSG) series MBSG promotes self-care and well-being among residents through learning and practicing skills to enhance self-awareness, resiliency, and stress management. The CMBM model is anevidence-based program developed in the mid-1990s,has been used to train more than 6000 physicians andcommunity leaders, and has been utilized at more than15 medical schools. 27This model was chosen because of its proven effectiveness and its foundation in evidence-based mind-body approaches and techniques. Themodel requires a CMBM-certied facilitator who canskillfully guide participants through the sometimes chal- lenging course. It is important that the facilitator not be in a supervisory position to the trainees so that they feelcomfortable discussing personal issues. In turn, the trustthat is developed among participants helps build a sup-portive community among colleagues that can ease thestrains of residency training. 27,28 Following the MBSG, other experiential sessions led by psychiatry faculty and select community practitioners of IM cover a variety of IM topics, including nutrition inmental health, biofeedback and neurofeedback, herbalmedicine, acupuncture, Ayurveda, and more. Thetopics are chosen because they reflect treatments patientsoften adopt on their own; hence, it is important forpsychiatrists to be familiar with up-to-date evidence on the safety and efcacy of these options. The experiential sessions familiarize trainees with a variety of IM techni- ques for themselves, based on the premise that familiar- ity through personal experience increases knowledge and condence in determining whether or not to consider or recommend an approach to a patient. The experiential sessions both augment and complement the online cur- riculum. For example, a presentation on motivational interviewing follows the online module on the topic. Many of the sessions cover psychiatry-specic topics that are not currently included in the online curriculum. Supplementary sessions include trainees facilitating journal club, an opportunity to critically analyze the lit- erature. Other sessions are devoted to case presentations, in which trainees synthesize and articulate what they have learned and discuss select cases in depth. Trainees write a reflection paper about their experience in the IPC as well as a literature review paper on an IM topic of choice as it relates to psychiatry. Clinical Component For the rst 2 months of the academic year, a series ofeducational patient evaluations are conducted at the Integrative Psychiatry Clinic, which opened in 2017 in response to repeated trainee requests for more clinicalTable 1.

In these sessions, the IPC supervising psychiatrist and one of the trainees interview the patient while the other IPC trainees observe behind a 1-way mirror. Following the hour- long interview, the supervising psychiatrist meets with the trainees to create a biopsychosocial-spiritual formu- lation and a comprehensive treatment plan utilizing an integrative approach. In addition, each IPC I trainee completes 2 to 3 new patient evaluations and approxi- mately 20 follow-up patient visits per month in the clinic. All patients seen by residents and fellows in the Integrative Psychiatry Clinic count toward the trainee's outpatient clinical requirements. In the setting of our busy resident/fellow university-based clinic, a mix of child, adolescent, and adult patients are assigned to the trainees depending upon residency or fellowship training status and interest. Some of the revenue generated from the clinic helps to fund the educational costs of the IPC program. Indirect supervision is provided by an IPCsupervising psychiatrist in a group format 2 to 3 times per week; these hour-long supervision sessions begin with a 5-minute mind-body skills exercise led by one of the trainees, followed by discussion of cases seen inthe clinic over the prior week. The supervision session also incorporates weekly \"Learning Rounds,\" in which each participant shares 1 interesting fact they have learned from the online modules or other readings relat- ed to integrative psychiatry. Supporting Materials In addition to the core online, experiential, and clinical components described above, the IPC directors have developed an electronic resource collection of course guidelines, syllabi, schedules, and sample documentation for initial evaluation and follow-up visits to support res- idents in training. The collection includes peer-reviewed articles on IM topics related to psychiatry; it alsoTable 2. Online Coursework.

In addition, several patient handouts have been developed, including a list of community practi- tioners for referrals, information on the use of supple- ments, mind-body skills, and lifestyle modicationtopics. Many of the handouts come from the AWCIM online curriculum; others are compiled by IPC directors or obtained from reputable evidence-based sources. Because it is electronic, this collection of resources can be distributed across institutions, making for a shared repository of knowledge and information that contrib- utes to the development and standardization of IM edu-cation in psychiatry. Integrative Psychiatry Curriculum II IPC II was rst offered in 2016-2017 and is available to residents and fellows who complete IPC I. It requires 2 or more hours per week of patient care in the IntegrativePsychiatry Clinic, consisting of new patient evaluations and/or follow-ups with supervision from IPC faculty. The goals are for trainees to further apply knowledge of IM in a clinical setting and to continue practicing mind-body techniques for their own well-being, self- awareness, and mindfulness in medical practice. Trainees participating in IPC II can choose to assist with experiential sessions for IPC I. IPC II requirements include engagement in scholarly activity by presenting at the Department of Psychiatry Grand Rounds or contrib- uting to a poster, book chapter, or journal article on anIM topic with faculty supervision. Participants can also take part in Quality Improvement projects to enhance the scheduling, flow, and patient care measurement out- comes at the Integrative Psychiatry Clinic, which hones administrative and management skills. Feedback and Response Twenty-one residents and fellows have completed IPC I over the 3 years it has been offered at the University of Arizona, and an additional 7 are enrolled in 2018-2019.To receive a certicate of completion in IPC I, residents must attend 80% of the experiential sessions (this takes into consideration leave for vacation and other excused absences). The average attendance since the inception of the IPC is 85%. Qualitative feedback and attendance rates support the hypothesis that the curriculum is a feasible means of teaching evidence-based IM within psychiatry residency and fellowship training while also advancing physicianself-care skills. Quantitative data on participants' medi- cal knowledge as well as surveys on participantwell-being and stress management are being collected for analysis and will be made available at a later date. Response to the MBSG has been very positive across all years of the IPC. Participants noted that theyadopted the mind-body techniques for their own self-care and well-being and utilized the techniques in their patient encounters. Although some participants said that they felt somewhat uncomfortable sharing their personalexperiences with their colleagues in the MBSG group,they all indicated that the course was worthwhile andthat they would recommend it to others. In fact, the strongly positive response to the MBSG led to residency training directors offering it as a required experience forall incoming residents beginning in 2018. Regarding the overall curriculum, trainees during the 2017-2018 qualitative exit interviews reported that eachcomponent (online, in-person experiential sessions, andclinical) of the curriculum was essential: the online curric-ulum provided quality information linked directly to the published sources, the in-person experiential teaching facilitated a deeper understanding of important topics,and the clinical experience allowed them to practice trans-lating their new-found knowledge to clinical cases. All theresidents and fellows stated that they would recommend the course to other trainees, and many stated that all psychiatry trainees should be taught IM. Next Steps For the IPC to achieve its full potential as a rigorous,standardized way to incorporate IM into psychiatrictraining, a number of steps are required. These include(1) building a scholarly community and recruiting otherinstitutions to adopt and pilot the course; (2) securing funding to support activities related to expansion and research; (3) creating additional online curriculum dedi-cated to psychiatric care, rening and distributing expe-riential sessions, and making adjustments to facilitatedistribution to other training institutions; and (4) con- ducting assessments and research to document the pro- gram's effectiveness and disseminating the results. Efforts to build community and recruit more institu- tions to adopt the IPC have already begun. In 2017, the University of New Mexico (UNM) Department ofPsychiatry became the rst satellite site to adopt theIPC. UNM began offering the interactive online curric-ulum with 2-hour optional experiential sessions as an elective for psychiatry residents and fellows in 2018- 2019. The IPC directors are supporting UNM effortsthrough teleconference and in-person consultations aswell as by conducting Grand Rounds at UNM and shar-ing electronic resources. Program development contin- ues at UNM, with plans to incorporate a clinical component and more structured experiential sessions inthe near future.Ranjbar et al. 5Additional support and community-building oppor- tunities are in place for institutions wishing to integrate IM into their residency training curricula. The AWCIM IMR Program has been training residents and develop-ing faculty for more than 10 years. AWCIM hosts an annual Faculty Development Meeting which includes a Resident Leadership track; it is a multiday meeting forIMR faculty site leaders and select residents from insti- tutions around the country who incorporate IMR in their training programs. Another source of supportand community for residents, fellows, faculty, and prac- ticing psychiatrists interested in IM is an Integrative Psychiatry Facebook Group, which is moderated bythe IPC directors. Participants are invited to share resources, post new published research, and offer ideas about how to approach challenging cases. Funding is crucial to support the activities associated with making improvements and adjustments to the course for wider distribution, creating the mechanisms for dis-semination, and conducting and publishing research. In order to develop a psychiatry-specic online integrative curriculum, beyond the current modules selected for theIPC from the existing AWCIM online curricula, addition- al resources are needed. Funding will also support record- ing of experiential sessions, therefore allowing forstandardization and for portability of the program to pilot sites with less faculty expertise in IM. In addition, funding will help with the enhancement of information onpatient safety and legal, regulatory, and ethical issues, and will aid in making available supporting tools such as webinars and in the distribution, growth, and updatingof the electronic resource collection. With additional institutions participating in a nation- al pilot, upgraded course materials optimized for distri-bution, and funding in place, standardized assessments across pilot institutions can be implemented, providing a broader evidence base for evaluation of the effectivenessof the program. This will facilitate the compilation and publishing of the results of such studies. IPC, the rst program of its kind, paves the way for bringing together a cohort of interested psychiatry resi- dency and fellowship training programs to implement IM in psychiatry across multiple sites. We envision that awell-designed and collaboratively implemented IM curric- ulum can enhance the prevention and treatment of psy- chiatric disorders while also teaching tools to enhanceresident self-care and well-being. It will address a current- ly unmet need and contribute to the future direction of graduate medical education and mental health care.
