Ministers are however, encouraged to publish all completed CRIAs . Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 2 Six Steps to Due Regard Step 1. What's the piece of work and its object ive(s) ? You may wish to include: A brief description of the piece of work What the time frame for achieving it is? Who are the intended beneficiaries? Is it likely that the piece of work will affect children? Will the piece of work have an affect on a particular group of children, if so, describe the group affected? The Social Services and Wellbeing (Wales) act 2014 provides a single Act that brings together local authorities' duties and functions in relation to improving the well -being of people wh o need care and support, and c arers who need to support. The Act provides a statutory framework to deliver the Welsh Government's commitment to integrate social services to support people as part of families and communities. Sections 166 -168 of the Act m ake provision for partnership arrangements between local authorities and Local Health Boards. The regulations in Part 9 of the Act set out the requirements for each Local Health Board and the local authorities within the area of each local health board to participate in partnership arrangements for the delivery of specified health and social services functions. The regulations also make provision, amongst other things, for the operation and management of the partnership arrangements, the establishment of re gional partnership boards and the establishment and maintenance of pooled funds. The purpose and intended effect of the legislation in sections 166 to 168 of the Act (partnership arrangements) is to achieve an appropriate balance between the level of direction required to drive progress and the level of discretion available to local partners to reach consensus and design appropriate operational a nd organisational arrangements to deliver integrated services in their areas. The purpose of the regulation m aking powers is therefore to ensure that local authorities and Local Health Boards work effectively together to plan and ensure the delivery of integrated services to best meet the needs of people in their local area including, of course, children and youn g people. This will include the development of new models and shifting the focus towards preventative services and early intervention. Despite the availability of Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 3 legal powers under the Health Act 1999 sand the NHS (Wales) Act 2006 which provided a legal u nderpinning for formal partnerships and pooled budgets progress in developing formal partnerships has been limited and not at the scale necessary to ensure a step change in the provision of services. Similarly very little use has been made of the legal powers under the Children Act 2004 to use pooled budgets. The broad objectives of integration include: Improving outcomes for individuals in need of care and support Offering more personalised care Improving outcomes for carers Making more effective use of resources Improving staff morale by reducing inappropriate bureaucracy and improving access to other professionals with expertise Strengthening governance arrangements through partnership working Introducing greater transparency between statutory partners in relation to aims, objectives, values and use of resources across integrated and inter dependent services This impact assessment should be read in conjunction with the other Children's Rights Impact Assessments because Part 9 of the Act relates to all us er groups including children, young people and their families; to all functions such as, for example, information advice and support, assessment, care and support planning, safeguarding and the commissioning and provision of services. The difference with part 9 of the Act is that the protection of these rights fully engages all partners. Step 2. Analysing the impact What are the positive and/ or negative impacts for children, young people or their families? Where the re are negative impacts ; what com pensatory measures may be needed to mitigate any negative impact? How will you know if your piece of work is a success? Have you developed an outcomes framework to measure impact? Have you considered the short, medium and long term outcomes? Do you need to engage with children & young people and/or stakeholders to seek their views using consultati on or part icipatory methods ? Do you need to produce child friendly versions of proposals/consultations? The integration of services for children and young peop le should only ha ve a positive impact on children's services. The criteria for integration will i nclude the improvement of outco mes for individuals and families. Our priorities for integration include: Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 4 Carers including young carers . These will Children with complex needs due to illness or disabi lity including the transition process from children to adult services. These groups require an integrated approach to care and support services and not a series of fragmented interventions which can cause confus ion and distress. Integrated Family Support Services. These teams are already in place. They were established under legislation which will be repealed with the introduction of the Social Services & Well -being (Wales) act 2014. The aim of IFSS has, from th e outset, been to work with parents and the extended family at an early stage before children become at risk of being taken into care. This is achieved by providing family focussed services to enable parents to improve their parenting skills. The Partne rship Arrangements Regulations require partnership arrangements between local authorities and Local Health Boards to ensure the delivery of IFSS. The Regulations also require the establishment of Integrated Family Support Teams. IFSS delivers family foc ussed services to enable parents to achieve the necessary behaviour changes that will improve their capacity and capability as parents. The principle behind IFSS is that the extended family is engaged with the process. The IFSS focusses services on chil dren in need, including those in need of protection and bridges children's and adults services across local authorities and Local Health Boards with both bodies being accountable to make sufficient provision, either directly or through coordinated arrangem ents, to support children and adults referred to them. Underpinning the service is a set of principles which require the IFSS to: Strengthen the safeguarding and welfare of children through restorative action to better support parents Improve the quality o f service experience by parents and children when they engage with professionals Be family focussed and family centred, ensuring their voices are heard and interventions are aligned with the outcomes they want to achieve Facilitate service change Be a res ource to existing services Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 5 Build trusting relationships Deliver holistic and intensive Evidence Based Interventions Provide a training resource to child and adult services on Evidence Based Interventions to engage complex families IFSS should embed the v alues of engagement and collaboration which builds on the family and individual strengths. The voices of the children and parents must be heard and focused on the outcomes they want to achieve. Each partnership should develop an integrated approach to the development of a continuum of services for children, young people and their families ranging from prevention through to statutory intervention inc luding support on leaving care. The purpose of developing such a range of services is to provide support to f amilies to prevent the need for children and young people to become looked after or enter custody and in cases when children and young people need become looked after or receive a custodial sentence they receive effective care and support. In the first ins tance pa rtnership boards need to consoli date the development of Integrated Family Support Services and develop an integrated approach to delivering services for Children with complex needs due to disability or illness (including transition from children's to adult social services and adult NHS services) and for Children and Ad olescents with mental health problems. The IFSS services have been subject to a detailed evaluation ; the outcome of which was positive. The Social Services and Well -being (Wales) A ct 2014 contains provisions to allow for Ministers to monitor functions of the Act carried out by local authorities and other bodies. Ministers may require these bodies to report on their duties in implementing these regulations. Partnership Boards wil l be required to provide an annual report on progress in relation to the integration of services. Two consultation events were held as part of the consultation process. The purpose of these to: Promote engagement with the consultation Provide a base level of understanding to key stakeholder groups of areas we were consulting on. Attendees were asked to participate in discussions on the implementation of the regulations, and also to share information from the events with their wider networks to provoke dee per engagement with the proposals and a wider span of consultation responses. The first event was held on 21 May in St George's Hotel, Llandudno. The second was held on 4 June in the Liberty Stadium, Swansea with 200 attendees overall, representing a range of organisations. The range of stakeholders included representation from: Age Alliance Wales British Deaf Association Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 6 Care Council for Wales Children in Wales College of occupational therapists CSSIW Disability Wales Learning Disability Wales Local autho rities Local Health Boards WLGA RNIB Cymru Public Health Wales Office of the Older People's Commissioner North Wales Social Services Improvement Collaborative. Workshops were held at the events on each of the parts of the Act subject to consultation under Tranche 2.The content of these workshops was tailored to suit the subject matter but at the core of each was a presentation from officials and group discussions and activities. The comments and outputs from these events were considered alongside the f ormal written responses in order to inform the final regulations, code(s) of practice and, in respect of Part 9 statutory guidance. In addition to this public consultation process, the proposals were discussed with the stakeholder reference group as well as the following groups: North Wales Directors, National Commissioning Board, National Provider Forum, Learning Disability Advisory Group, Care Homes Steering Group, National Partnership Forum for Older People, Cymru Older People's Alliance South, Wales C arers Alliance and the National Citizens Panel. A 12 week public consultation on these regulations and accompanying Code of Practice ran between 8/5/15 and 31/7/15. The Consultation Summary Report can be found at: http://gov.wales/consultations/healths ocialcare/part9/?status=closed&lang=en Step 3. How does your piece of work support and promote children' s rights? Dependant upon the impact of your piece of work, use balanced judgement to assess : Which UNCRC articles are most relevant to the piece o f work? Consider the articles which your piece of work impacts upon . http://uncrcletsgetitright.co.uk/images/PDF/UNCRCRights.pdf How are you improving the way children and young people access their rights? What aspects of children's lives will be affected by the proposal? What are the main issues that the CRIA should focus on? Does the piece of work help to maximise the outcomes within the articles of the UNCRC ? If no, h ave any alternatives to the current piece of work been considered? Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 7 An assessment of relevant UNCRC articles took place as part of the Explanatory Memorandum process for the Social Service and Well -being (Wales) Bill. A link is attached (pages 91 to 93 within th e impact on child ren's rights outlined in all the codes of practice in relation to the Act will apply to part 9 and will apply to partners. The positive impacts for children or their families can be related to the following specific articles of the UNCRC: Article 1 - Everyone under the age of 18 has all the rights in the Convention; And, Article 2 - The Convention applies to every child whatever their ethnicity, gender, religion, abilities, whatever they think or say, no matter what type of family they come from. The R egulations and code of practice apply to all local authorities in Wales when exercising their functions under the Act in respect of looked after and accommodated children. They determine local authorities responsibilities for assessing and meeting looked a fter and accommodated children's care and support needs, how they are to be maintained when under the care of a local authority and the arrangements and support that should be put in place for children and young people when leaving care. Article 3 - The best interests of the child must be a top priority in all actions concerning children. The Regulations and code of practice provide the framework for local authorities to act in the best interests of the child when determining whether a child's needs are s uch that they are entitled to have their needs met by the local authority. Part 9 will ensure that local authorities work with partners to ensure the best interests of the child. Article 4 - Governments must do all they can to fulfil the rights of every child. The Regulations create a consistent right for every child in Wales regarding the decision as to whether the child has needs which must be met by a local authority. Article 9 - Children must not be separated from their parents unless it is in the be st interests of the child (for example, in cases of abuse or neglect). A child must be given the chance to express their views when decisions about parental responsibilities are being made. Every child has the right to stay in contact with both parents, un less this might harm them. By establishing the extent to which a child's needs for care and support can be met by the child's family, the Regulations support the requirement in the Act for local authorities to enable the child to live with the child's fam ily or promote contact between the child and the child's family. The Welsh Government's over -arching policy intention under Part 6 includes strengthening the capacity of families to care for their children wherever it is safe to do so. Part 9 consolidates the development of Integrated Family Support Services designed to improve the capacity of parents to care for their children. Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 8 Step 4. Advising the Minister and Ministerial decision When giving advice and making recommendations to the Minister, cons ider: The ways in which the piece of work help s to maximise the outcomes within the articles of the UNCRC? Has any conflict with the UNCRC articles within the proposal been identified ? Consider the wider impact; d oes the proposal affect any other policy a reas? With regard to any negative impacts caused by the proposal ; can Ministers evidence that they have allocated as much resources as possible ? What options and advice should be provided to Ministers on the proposal? In relation to your advice on whether or not to proceed with the piece of work, is there any additional advice you should provide to the Minister ? Is it appropriate to advise the Minister to reconsider the decision in the future, in particular bearing in mind the availability of resources at this time and what resources may be available in the future? Have you pro vided advice to Ministers on a LF/ SF and confirmed paragraph 26? Is the advice supported by an explanation of the key issues ? Consultation process Two consultation events were h eld as part of the consultation process. The purpose of these to: Promote engagement with the consultation Provide a base level of understanding to key stakeholder groups of areas we were consulting on. Attendees were asked to participate in discussions o n the implementation of the regulations, and also to share information from the events with their wider networks to provoke deeper engagement with the proposals and a wider span of consultation responses. The first event was held on 21 May in St George's Hotel, Llandudno. The second was held on 4 June in the Liberty Stadium, Swansea with 200 attendees overall, representing a range of organisations. The range of stakeholders included representation from: Age Alliance Wales British Deaf Association Care Coun cil for Wales Children in Wales College of occupational therapists CSSIW Disability Wales Learning Disability Wales Local authorities Local Health Boards WLGA RNIB Cymru Public Health Wales Office of the Older People's Commissioner North Wales Social Serv ices Improvement Collaborative.
