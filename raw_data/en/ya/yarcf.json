The positive results and enjoyment we gain by putting out energy into projects based on Ayni, or reciprocity, have had life changing results for the whole Etnikas team. We have now prioritised the work Human Actions is involved with to be the main purpose for what we do. We provide responsible and sustainable social assistance, holistic healing, and cultural education. We focus our actions on the less favoured and vulnerable people and communities in Peru, having Etnikas as a supporting organisation. Our projects are based on social and community regeneration, animal rescue and environmental conservation and regeneration. Learn More Learn More I attended a five-day retreat at Etnikas in the summer and it was worth both the journey and the wait (wait due to covid restrictions). They have a great new premises which is secluded and peaceful. The management of the entire operation seamlessly transcends the different levels of formality and care as and when required; whilst being a generally self sufficient person, there were of course moments of fragility throughout the experience and the team were on hand every step of the way to make sure support was given. Infinite Love Etnikas Ayahuasca Retreats exceeded my expectations in every way. The place location is breathtaking, the level of care is superb, and the Spiritual holiness is in the air. Thank you Etnikas, I am forever grateful Till we meet again "}
