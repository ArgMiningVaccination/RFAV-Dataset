The Dr. Katie Detox is here to help you get back on track. Learn more about each of our programs. Why is it important to detoxify the body? Over time, we get buildup of toxins from our environment and lifestyle choices that can compromise the way our bodies work, taxing our systems more than what we are evolutionarily prepared for.

During the Dr. Katie Detox you will learn the tools to build a healthier lifestyle with nutritious food, daily movement, proper rest and connection to the Spiritual Self. \"Most detoxes feel harsh and extreme.
