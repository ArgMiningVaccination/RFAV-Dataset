If summer sees you struck down with streaming eyes, a blocked nose or a killer headache, you'll know there's so much more to hay fever than a few sneezes. Many hay fever sufferers opt to stay inside to avoid the onset of symptoms. SO RELATABLE: [10 annoying things people say to hay fever sufferers ](https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/2018062649732/hayfever-annoying-things-people-say/) DISCOVER: [Royal doctor reveals 5 ways to treat hay fever - and how to diagnose your symptoms](https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/2020060190751/royal-doctor-reveals-how-to-treat-hay-fever/) Whilst over-the-counter medicines often help to reduce symptoms, these can bring annoying side effects such as drowsiness. Luckily there are plenty of natural hay fever remedies that actually work to lessen the symptoms. Read on for tried and tested natural hay fever remedies that actually work. 1. Dry your clothes inside While drying clothes in the fresh air is one of summer's greatest simple pleasures, this brings pollen into your home without you realising it. Dry your clothes inside even when the sun is beaming, to limit the pollen brought inside. 2. Acupuncture for hay fever [Meghan Markle](https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/meghan-markle/) loves [acupuncture for anxiety and stress](https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/20220509139717/meghan-markle-acupuncture-mental-health-benefits/), but the ancient Indian practice of marmapuncture, a specific type of acupuncture that uses fewer needles, can also help with hay fever. Marmapuncture helps with hay fever because your reaction to pollen is an immune response - it's your body's way of dealing with an irritant. Acupuncture helps balance the body's energy system and immune response. 3. Wash your hair before bed If you're normally a morning hair wash person, it might be time to switch to bedtime bathing. A quick rinse in the shower rids your hair and body of pollen that can irritate you during the night. Wash your sheets more in the summer too, to cleanse them of pollen particles. 4. Try gua sha The art of gua sha is touted as being good for everything from clearing inflammation to refreshing the skin, and fans of the practice say it can help with hay fever too. Keep your gua sha tool in the fridge ten hold the chilled stone next to your nose and over your sinuses to draw out heat and help clear the sinuses 5.

Ditch the contact lenses According to [Specsavers](https://www.specsavers.co.uk/)' Clinical Services Director, Giles Edmonds, hay fever sufferers who wear contact lenses may notice the vision through their lenses can appear smeary and eyes can generally feel uncomfortable which can be calmed down with contact lens-friendly eye drops. Wearing prescription glasses (particularly wraparound sunglasses) can prevent pollen from getting into your eyes. He also suggests that those suffering with hay fever could also try [daily disposable lenses](https://www.specsavers.co.uk/contact-lenses/daily) during the summer months. 14. Try an eye humidifier If you can't bear to part with your contacts (or just suffer from very dry eyes) this portable eye humidifier from Peep Club is a game-changer. The gentle mist replaces moisture in the air to help your eyes stay hydrated and the benefits extend to your skin, too. 15. Switch to gin Asthma UK says that while alcoholic drinks like beer and red wine often make hay fever and asthma worse due to the histamine and sulphites they contain, switching your regular tipple to gin might help to relieve symptoms more than other drinks. Clear spirits like gin and vodka both have a low histamine content, while gin also contains no sulphites, so it is especially good for people who are suffering from itchy eyes and a runny nose. As happy as we are to hear this, it's important to note that G&T won't cure your hay fever, it is simply the best option for sufferers who want an alcoholic drink.

Massage your eyes BeGlow brand ambassador and skincare expert Danielle Hudson shares her top tips for soothing hay fever-induced eye irritation. \"Swollen and puffy eyes are commonplace for hay fever sufferers and aside from their visual appearance, can be a cause of great discomfort. Inflammation can often remain for a few hours as it can take time for the blood vessels to reduce to normal and excess fluid in the tissues to be re-absorbed. \"The skin around the eye area is tissue-thin and so it's important to give this delicate area the utmost care and attention in order to limit damage and preserve skin elasticity. Using a sonic device such as BeGlow TIA with its cooling titanium plate (\u00a3199, John Lewis) can help to assist drainage in the area - the ultimate eye reviver.\" Like this story? [ Sign up to "}
