The purpose of the project was to produce a handbook that would serve as a reference forestablishing, maintaining, and evaluating the success of registries created to collect data about patientoutcomes. Following award of the project on September 29, 2005, we created a draft outline for the document that was posted for public comment on AHRQ' s Effective Health Care Web site (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov) from January through March 2006. During that same period, we worked with AHRQ to create a process forselecting contrib utors and reviewers. We broadly solicited recommendations from a range of stakeholders, including government agencies, industry groups, medical professional societies, and other experts in the field; conducted a review of the pertinent literature; and contacted the initial list of contributors to confirm their interest and area of expertise and to seek further recommendations. Through that process and incollaboration with AHRQ and CMS, we arrived at a set of contributors and reviewers based on subject/content expertise, practical experience, and interest and availability, with balanced representation from key stakeholder groups for nearly all chapters. In addition, a request for submission of real-world case examples that could be used in the handbook to illustrate issues and challenges in implementing registrieswas posted on the Effective Health Care Web site. The primary selection criteria for these examples weretheir utility in illustrating a practical challenge and its resolution. An initial meeting of contrib utors was convened in February 2006. A second meeting including contributors and chapter re viewers was held in June 2006, following creation of an initial draft document and focused review by the reviewers. The collaborative efforts of contributors, reviewers, and editors resulted in a draft document that was posted for public comment on the Effective Health Care Web site in October and November 2006. In all, 39 contributors and 35 individual reviewers participated. These contributors and reviewers participated as individuals and not necessarily as representatives of their organizations. We are grateful to all those who contributed to the document and who reviewed it and shared their comments. To begin the discussion of registries, we would like to clarify some distinctions between registries and clinical trials. While this is further discussed in Chapter 1, from a high-level perspective, we offer the following distinctions: The clinical trial is an experiment in which an active intervention intended to change a human subject' s outcome is implemented , generall y through a randomization procedure that tak es decisionmaking away from the practitioner. The research protocol describes inclusion and exclusion criteria that are used to select the patients who will participate as human subjects, focusing the experiment on a homogeneous group. Human subjects and clinical researchers agree to adhere to a strict schedule of visits and to conduct protocol-specif ic tests and measurements. In contrast, registries use an observational study design that does not specify treatments (although a specific treatment may be an inclusion criterion) and observe without requiring any therapies intended to change patient outcomes. There are generall y few inclusion and e xclusion criteria in an ef fort to study a broad range of patients to make the results more generalizable. Patients are typically observed as they present for care and the data collected generally reflect whatever tests and measurements a provider customarily uses. Patient registries represent a useful tool for a number of purposes. Their ideal use and their role in evidence development, design, operations, and evaluation resemble but differ from clinical trials in a number of substantive ways, and therefore they should not be evaluated with the same constructs. This handbookivpresents what the contributors and reviewers consider to be good registry practices. Many registries today may not meet even the basic practices described. On the whole, registry science is in an active state ofdevelopment. This document is an important step in developing this field. This book is divided into three sections: Creating, Operating, and Evaluating Registries. The first two sections provide basic information on key areas of registry development and operations, highlighting thespectrum of practices in each of these areas and their potential strengths and weaknesses. Section I,\"Creating Registries,\" includes six chapters. \"Patient Registries\" defines and characterizes types ofregistries, their purposes, and uses, and describes their place within the scope of this document. \"Planning aRegistry\" focuses on the recommended steps in planning a registry, from determining if a registry is the right option to describing goals and objectives. \"Registry Design\" examines the specifics of designing a registryonce the goals and objectives are known. \"Data Elements for Registries\" provides an approach to selecting data elements that is both scientific and practical. \"Data Sources for Registries\" addresses how existing datasources (administrative, pharmacy, other registries, etc.) may be used to enhance the value of patientregistries. \"Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy\" reviews several key legal and ethical issues that should be considered in creating or operating a registry. Section II, \"Operating Registries,\" provides a practical guide to the day-to-day operational issues and decisions for producing and interpreting high-quality registries. \"Patient and Provider Recruitment and Management\" recr uiting and retaining pro viders and patients. \"Data Collection and Quality Assurance\" reviews key areas of data collection, cleaning, storing, and quality assurance for registries. \" Adverse Event Detection, Processing, and Reporting\" examines relevant practical and regulatory issues. \" Anal ysis and Inter pretation of Re gistry Data To Evaluate Outcomes\" addresses key considerations in analyzing and interpreting registry data. Interspersed throughout the first two sections of the handbook are case examples. As discussed above, the choice of examples was limited to those submitted for consideration during the public submission period.The purpose of their inclusion is solely to illustrate specific point(s) in the text from real-world examples,regardless of whether the source of the example is within the scope of the handbook as described in Chapter 1. Inclusion of a case e xample in this handbook is not intended as an endorsement of the quality of the particular registry, nor do the case examples necessarily present registries that meet all the criteria describedin Chapter 11 as basic elements of good practice. Rather , case e xamples are introduced to pro vide the reader with a richer description of the issue or question being addressed in the text. In some cases, we have no independent infor mation on the re gistry other than what has been provided by the contributor. Section III is \"Evaluating Registries.\" This final chapter summarizes key points from the earlier chapters in a manner that can be used to re view the structure, data, or interpretations of patient registries. It describes good registry practice in terms of \"basic elements\" and \"potential enhancements.\" This information might be used b y a person de veloping a registry, or by a reviewer or user of registry data or interpretations derived from registries.

For thepurpose of this handbook, a patient registry is anorganized system that uses observational study methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other)to evaluate specified outcomes for a population defined by a particular disease, condition, orexposure, and that serves a predetermined scientific, clinical, or policy purpose(s). The registry database is the file (or files) derived from the registry. Although registries can serve many purposes, this handbook focuses on registries that are created forone or more of the following purposes: to describe the natural history of disease, to determine clinicaleffectiveness or cost effectiveness of health care products and services, to measure or monitor safetyand harm, and/or to measure quality of care. Registries are classif ied according to ho w the populations are def ined. F or example, product registries include patients who have been exposed to biopharmaceutical products or medical devices. Health services registries consist of patients who have had a common procedure, clinical encounter, or hospitalization. Disease or condition registries are defined by patients having the same diagnosis,such as cystic fibrosis or heart failure. Planning There are se veral key steps in planning a patient registry, including articulating the purpose of the registry, determining whether the registry is an appropriate means for addressing the research question, identifying stakeholders, defining thescope and target population, assessing feasibility, and securing funding. The registry team and advisors should be selected based on expertise andexperience. The plan for registry governance andoversight should clearly address such issues as overall direction and operations, scientific content,ethics, safety, data access, publications, and changemanagement. It is also helpful to plan for the entirelifespan of a registry, including how and when theregistry will end and any plans for transitioning theregistry at that time. Registry Design A patient registry should be designed with respect to its major purpose, with the understanding thatdifferent le vels of rigor may be required for registries that are designed to address focused analytical questions to support decisionmaking, in contrast to those intended primarily for descriptivepurposes. The key points to consider in designing a registry include formulating a research question;choosing a study design; translating questions ofclinical interest into measurab le exposures and outcomes; choosing patients for study, including deciding whether a comparison group is needed; deter mining w here data can be found; and deciding how man y patients need to be studied and for ho w long. Once these key design items have been determined, the registry design should be reviewed to evaluate potential sources of bias (systematic error); these should be addressed to the extent that is practical and achievable. The specific research questions of interest will guide the registry design, identification of exposures and outcomes, and def initions of the tar get population (the population to which the findings are meant to apply). The registry population should be designed to approximate the characteristics of the target population as much as possible. The number of study subjects desired and length of observation (follo wup) should be planned in accordance with the overall purpose of the registry. The desired study size (in terms of subjects or person-years of obser vation) is deter mined b y specifying the magnitude of an expected clinically meaningful effect or the desired precision of effect estimates.Executive Summary 2Study size determinants are also affected by practicality, cost, and whether or not the registry isintended to support regulatory decisionmaking. Depending on the purpose of the registry, internal, external, or historical comparison groups strengthenthe understanding of whether the observed effectsare indeed real and, in fact, different from whatwould have occurred under other circumstances. Registry study designs often restrict eligibility for entry to individuals with certain characteristics toassure that they will assemble enough information for analysis (e.g., age restriction) or use some formof sampling\u2014random selection, systematic sampling, or a haphazard , nonrandom approach. The potential for bias refers to opportunities for systematic errors to influence the results. Theinformation value of a registry is enhanced by its ability to provide an assessment of the potential forbias and to quantify ho w this bias could affect the study results. Data Elements The selection of data elements requires balancing such factors as their importance for the integrity of the registry and for the analysis of primaryoutcomes, their reliability, their contribution to the overall burden for respondents, and the incrementalcosts associated with their collection. Selectionbegins with identifying relevant domains. Specificdata elements then are selected with consideration for estab lished clinical data standards, common data definitions, and the use of patient identifiers. It is important to determine which elements are absolutely necessary and which are desirable but not essential. In choosing measurement scales forassessing patient-reported outcomes, it is preferable to use scales that ha ve been appropriatel y validated, when such tools exist. Once data elements have been selected, a data map should be created, and the data collection tools should be pilot tested. Testing allows assessment of respondent burden, accuracy, and completeness of questions, and potential areas for missing data. Inter-rater agreement for data collection instruments can also be assessed,especially in registries that rely on chart abstraction. Overall, choice of data elements should be guidedby parsimony, validity, and a focus on achieving the registry' s purpose. Data Sources A single registry may integrate data from various sources. The form, structure, availability, andtimeliness of the required data are importantconsiderations. Data sources can be classified asprimary or secondary. Primary data are collectedfor direct purposes of the registry. Secondary dataare comprised of infor mation that has been collected for purposes other than the registry, and they may not be uniformly structured or validated with the same rigor as primar y data. Sufficient identifiers are necessary to guarantee an accurate matchbetween secondary sources and registry patients. Furthermore, a solid understanding of the original purpose of the secondary data and how they werecollected is advised , because the way that those data were collected and v erified or validated will help shape their use in a registry. Common secondary sources of data linked to registries include medical records systems, institutional or organizational databases, administrati ve health insurance claims data, death and bir th records, census databases, and related e xisting registry databases. Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy Critical ethical and legal considerations should guide the development and use of patient registries. The Common Rule is the unifor m set of re gulations on the ethical conduct of human subjects research from the Federal agencies that fund such research. Institutions that conduct research agree to comply with the Common Rule for federall y funded research and may opt to apply that rule to all human subjects acti vities conducted within their f acilities or by their employees and agents, regardless of the source of funding. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIP AA) and itsExecutive Summary 3implementing regulations (collectively, the Privacy Rule) are the legal protections for the privacy ofindividually identifiable health information created and maintained by health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses (called \"covered entities\"). The research purpose of a registry, the status of its developer, and the extent towhich registry data are individually identifiable largely determine applicable regulatoryrequirements. Other important ethical and legal concerns include transparency of activities, oversight, and data ownership. Patient and Provider Recruitment and Management Recruitment and retention of providers (as registry sites) and patients are essential to the success of aregistry. Recruitment typically occurs at severallevels, including facilities (hospital, practice, pharmacy), pro viders, and patients. The moti vating factors for participation at each level and the factors necessary to achieve retention differ according tothe re gistry. Factors that motivate participation include the perceived relevance, importance, or scientific credibility of the registry, as well as therisks and burdens of participation and any incentives for participation. Because provider and patientrecruitment and retention can affect how well a registry accurately represents the target population,well-planned strategies for enrollment and retention are critical. Goals for recr uitment, retention, and followup should be e xplicitl y laid out in the registry planning phase, and deviations during the conduct of the re gistry should be continuousl y evaluated for their risk of introducing bias. Data Collection and Quality Assurance The inte grated system for collecting, cleaning, storing, monitoring, reviewing, and reporting on registry data deter mines the utility of those data for meeting the re gistry's goals. A broad range of data collection procedures and systems are available. Some are more suitab le than others for par ticularpurposes. Critical factors in the ultimate quality of the data include how data elements are structuredand defined, how personnel are trained, and how data problems are handled (e.g., missing, out-of- range, or logically inconsistent values). Registriesmay also be required to conform to guidelines orstandards of specific end users of the data (e.g., 21Code of Federal Regulations, Part 11). Quality assurance aims to affirm that the data were, in fact,collected in accordance with established procedures and that they meet the requisite standards of quality to accomplish the registry' s intended purposes and the intended use of the data. Requirements for quality assurance should be defined during the registry' s inception and creation. Because certain requirements may have significantcost implications, a risk-based approach to developing a quality assurance plan isrecommended. It should be based on identifying themost impor tant or lik ely sources of er ror or potential lapses in procedures that may impact the quality of the registry in the context of its intended purpose. Adverse Event Detection, Processing, and Repor ting The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines an adverse event (AE) as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, whether or not related to or considered to have a causal relationship with thetreatment. AEs are categorized according to the seriousness and , for dr ugs, the e xpectedness of the event. Although AE reporting for all marketed products is dependent on the principle of \"becoming aware,\" collection of adverse event data falls into two categories: those events that are intentionally solicited (meaning data that are part of the uniform collection of infor mation in the re gistry) and those that are unsolicited (meaning that the AE is volunteered or noted in an unsolicited manner). Determining whether the registry should use a case repor t form to collect AEs should be based on the scientif ic impor tance of the information for evaluating the specified outcomes of interest.Executive Summary 4Regardless of whether or not AEs constitute outcomes for the registry, it is important to developa plan for detecting, processing, and reporting AEs for any registry that has direct patient interaction. If the registry receives sponsorship, in whole or inpart, from a regulated industry (for drugs ordevices), the sponsor has mandated reportingrequirements, and the process for detecting and reporting AEs should be established and registrypersonnel trained on how to identify AEs and to whom they should be reported. Sponsors of registries designed specifically to meet requirements for surveillance of drug or device safety are encouraged to hold discussions with health authorities about the most appropriate process for reporting serious AEs. Analysis and Interpretation Analysis and interpretation of registry data begin with answering a series of core questions. Who wasstudied? Ho w were the data collected, edited, and verified, and how were missing data handled? How were the analyses performed? Four populations are of interest in describing who was studied: the target population, the accessible population, the intended population, and the population actuall y studied (the \"actual population\"). The representati veness of the actual population to the tar get population is referred to as generalizability. Analysis of registry outcomes first requires an analysis of the completeness of data collection and data quality. Considerations include an evaluation of completeness for most if not all important covariates and an understanding of how missing data were handled and reported. Analysis of a registry should provide information on the characteristics of the patient population, the e xposures of interest, and the endpoints. Descriptive registry studies focus on describing frequency and patterns of various elements in a patient population, w hereas anal ytical studies concentrate on associations between patients or treatment characteristics and health outcomes of interest. A statistical analysis plan describes the analytical plans and statistical techniques that willbe used to evaluate the primary and secondaryobjectives specified in the study plan. Interpretation of registry data should be provided so that theconclusions can be understood in the appropriate context and so that any lessons from the registry can be applied to the target population and used toimprove patient care and outcomes. Evaluating Registries Although registries can provide useful information, there are levels of rigor that enhance validity andmake the information from some registries moreuseful for guiding decisions than the informationfrom others. The term \"quality\" can be applied to registries to describe the confidence that the design, conduct, and analysis of the registry can be shown to protect ag ainst bias and errors in inference\u2014that is, erroneous conclusions drawn from a registry.Although there are limitations in any assessment of quality, this handbook uses a quality component analysis to evaluate high-level factors that mayaffect results and differentiates between research quality (w hich per tains to the scientif ic process) and evidence quality (which pertains to the data/findings emanating from the research process). Quality components are classified as either \"basic elements of good practice, \" which can be viewed as a basic checklist that should be considered for all patientregistries, or as \"potential enhancements to good practice\" that may strengthen the information value in particular circumstances. The results of such an evaluation should be considered in the conte xt of the disease area(s), the type of registry, and the purpose of the re gistry, and should also tak e into account feasibility and affordability. Executive Summary 5Section I. Creating Registries 7Chapter 1. Patient Registries The purpose of this document is to serve as a guide for the design and use of patient registries forscientific, clinical, and health policy purposes.Properly designed and executed, patient registriescan provide a real-world view of clinical practice,patient outcomes, safety, and comparativeeffectiveness. This handbook primarily focuses on practical design and operational issues, evaluation principles, and best practices. Where topics are wellcovered in other materials, references and/or links are provided. The goal of this document is to provide stakeholders in both the public and privatesectors with infor mation that they can use to guide the design and implementation of patient registries,the analysis and interpretation of data from patientregistries, and the evaluation of the quality of a registry or one of its components. Where useful, case e xamples have been incorporated to illustrate particular points or challenges. The ter m \"re gistry\" 1is def ined both as the act of recording or registering and as the record or entry itself. Therefore, \"registries\" can refer to bothprograms that collect and store data and the records that are so created. The term \"patient registry\" is generally used to distinguish re gistries focused on health information from other record sets, but there is no consistentdefinition in current use. E.M. Brooke, in a 1974 publication of the World Health Or ganization, further delineated registries in health information systems as \"a file of documents containing uniform information about individual persons, collected in a systematic and comprehensi ve way, in order to serve a predetermined purpose.\" 2 The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics3describes re gistries used for a broad range of purposes in public health and medicine as \"an organized system for the collection, storage, retrie val, analysis, and dissemination of information on indi vidual persons w ho have either a particulardisease, a condition (e.g., a risk factor) that predisposes [them] to the occurrence of a health-related event, or prior exposure to substances (orcircumstances) known or suspected to cause adversehealth effects.\" This handbook focuses on patient registries that are used for evaluating patient outcomes. It is not intended to address several other types or uses for registries (although many of the principles may be applicable), such as geographically based populationregistries (not based on a disease, condition, or exposure); registries created for public health incidence reporting (without tracking outcomes); or listing registries that are used solely to identifypatients with particular diseases in clinical practicesbut are not used for evaluating outcomes. This handbook is also not intended to address the wide range of studies that utilize secondary analyses ofdata collected for other purposes. In the nar rower context of patient registries used for evaluating patient outcomes, this handbook uses the following definitions: A patient registry is an organized system that uses obser vational study methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to evaluate specified outcomes for a population defined bya particular disease, condition, or exposure, and that serves one or more predeterminedscientif ic, clinical, or policy purposes. The patient registry database describes a file (or files) derived from the registry. Based on these definitions, the handbook focuses on patient registries in which the following are true (although exceptions may apply): The data are collected in a naturalistic manner such that the management of patients is determined by the caregiver and patient together and not b y the re gistry protocol. 8 The registry is designed to fulfill specific purposes, and these purposes are defined beforecollecting and analyzing the data. In other words, the data collection is purpose driven rather than the purpose being data driven(meaning limited to or derived from what isalready available in an existing data set). The registry captures data elements with specific and consistent data definitions. The data are collected in a uniform manner for every patient. This consideration refers to boththe types of data and the frequency of their collection. The data collected include data derived from and reflective of the clinical status of the patient (e.g., history, examination, laboratory test, orpatient-reported data). Registries include the types of data that clinicians w ould use for the diagnosis and management of patients. At least one element of re gistry data collection is active, meaning that some data are collected specifically for the purpose of the registry (usually collected from the patient or clinician) rather than inferred from sources(administrative, billing, pharmacy databases,etc.) that are collected for another pur pose. This does not e xclude situations w here re gistry data collection is a specif ic, but not the exclusive, reason data are being collected, such as might be envisioned with future uses of electronic health records, as described in Chapter 8. It also does not exclude the incorporation of otherdata sources, as discussed in Chapter 5. Registries can be enriched by linkage with extant databases (e.g., to determine deaths andother outcomes or to assess pharmacy use or resource utilization). Current Uses for Patient Registries A patient registry can be a powerful tool to observe the course of disease; to understand variations in treatment and outcomes; to e xamine factors that influence prognosis and quality of life; to describecare patterns, including appropriateness of care and disparities in the delivery of care; to assesseffectiveness; to monitor safety; and to change behavior through feedback of data. 4Different stakeholders perceive and may benefit from thevalue of registries in different ways. For example,for a clinician, registries can collect data aboutdisease presentation and outcomes on large numbers of patients rapidly, thereby producing a real-worldpicture of disease. For a physician organization, a registry might assess the degree to which clinicians are managing a disease in accordance with evidence-based guidelines, focus attention on specific aspects of a particular disease that might otherwise be overlooked, or provide data forclinicians to compare themselves with their peers. 5 From a payer' s perspective, registries can provide detailed infor mation from lar ge numbers of patients on ho w procedures, de vices, or phar maceuticals are actuall y used and on their ef fectiveness in dif ferent populations. This information may be useful for determining coverage policies. For a drug or devicemanuf acturer , a registry might demonstrate the performance of a product in the real world, meet a postmarketing study commitment, develop hypotheses, or identify patient populations that will be useful for product development, clinical trialsdesign, and patient recr uitment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that \"throughthe creation of registries, a sponsor can evaluate safety signals identif ied from spontaneous case reports, literature reports, or other sources, and evaluate the f actors that af fect the risk of adverse outcomes such as dose, timing of exposure, or patient characteristics.\" 6 Evaluating Patient Outcomes Patient registries and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have important and complementary roles in evaluating patient outcomes. Patient registriescollect data in a comprehensive manner (with few excluded patients) and therefore produce outcome results that ma y be generalizab le to a wide range of patients. They also evaluate care as it is actually provided , because care is not assigned , deter mined, or even recommended by a protocol. As a result,Section I. Creating Registries 9the outcomes reported may be more representative of what is achieved in real-world practice. Patientregistries also offer the ability to evaluate patient outcomes when clinical trials are not practical (e.g., very rare diseases), and they may be the only optionwhen clinical trials are not ethically acceptable.They are a powerful tool when RCTs are difficult toconduct, such as in surgery or when very long-term outcomes are desired. RCTs are controlled experiments designed to test hypotheses that can ultimately be applied to real- world care. Because RCTs are conducted understrict constraints, with detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, they are sometimes limited in their generalizability. If RCTs are not generalizable to the populations to which the information will beapplied, they may not be sufficiently informative for decisionmaking. Conversely, patient registries thatobser ve real-world clinical practice may collect all of the infor mation needed to assess patient outcomes in a generalizable way, but interpreting this information correctly requires analytic methodology geared to addressing the potentialsources of bias that challenge all observationalstudies. Interpreting patient registry data also requires checks of inter nal v alidity and sometimes the use of e xternal data sources to v alidate k ey assumptions (such as comparing the k ey characteristics of registry participants with external sources to demonstrate the comparability of registry participants to the ultimate reference population). Patient registries, RCTs, other study designs, and other data sources should all be considered tools in the toolbox for evidence development, each with its own advantages and limitations. 7 Hierarchies of evidence. One question that arises in a discussion of this type is where to place patient registries within the hierarchies of e vidence that are frequently used in developing guidelines or decisionmaking. As observational studies, registries would be placed in a subordinate position to RCTs in some commonl y used hierarchies.8 However, much debate currently exists in the evidence community regarding these traditional methods of g rading le vels of e vidence and some oftheir underlying assumptions, their shortcomings in assessing certain types of evidence (e.g., benefit vs.harm), and inter-scale consistency in evaluating the same evidence. 9,10 The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) WorkingGroup has proposed a more robust approach thataddresses some of the decisionmaking issuesdescribed in this handbook. As noted by the GRADE collaborators: [R]andomised trials are not always feasible and, in some instances, observational studies mayprovide better evidence, as is generally the casefor rare adverse effects. Moreover, the results ofrandomised trials may not always be applicable-for example, if the participants arehighly selected and motivated relative to the population of interest. It is therefore essential to consider study quality, the consistency of resultsacross studies, and the directness of theevidence, as w ell as the appropriateness of the study design. 11 As the methods for grading evidence for different purposes continue to evolve, this handbook canserve as a guide to help such evaluators understandstudy quality and identify w ell-designed re gistries. Beyond the e vidence hierarch y debate, users of evidence understand the value of registries for providing complementary information that can extend the results of clinical trials to populations not studied in those trials, for demonstrating the real- world effects of treatments outside of the researchsetting and potentially in large subsets of affected patients, and for providing long-term followup when such data are not available from clinical trials. Defining patient outcomes . The focus of this handbook is the use of registries to evaluate patient outcomes. An outcome ma y be thought of as an end result of a particular health care practice or intervention. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), end results include ef fects that people experience and about which they care.12The National Cancer Institute fur ther clarif ies that \"f inal\" endpoints are to decisionmakers: patients,Chapter 1. Patient Registries 10providers, private payers, government agencies, accrediting organizations, or society.13,14Examples of these outcomes include biomedical outcomes, such as survival and disease-free survival, health- related quality of life, satisfaction with care, andeconomic burden. 15Although final endpoints are ultimately what matter, it is sometimes morepractical when creating registries to collect intermediate outcomes (such as whether processesor guidelines were followed) and clinical outcomes (such as whether a tumor regressed or recurred) that predict success in improving final endpoints. In Crossing the Quality Chasm ,16the Institute of Medicine (IOM) describes the six guiding aims ofhealth care as safe, effective, efficient, patient- centered, timely, and equitable. While these aimsare not outcomes per se, they generally describe the dimensions of results that matter to decisionmakersin the use of health care products and ser vices. Is it safe? Does it produce g reater benef it than har m? Is it clinically effective? Does it produce the desired effect in real-world practice? Is it cost effective or efficient? Does it produce the desired effect at areasonable cost relative to other potentialexpenditures? Is it patient oriented, timely, and equitab le? These last three aims focus on the delivery and quality of care. Does the right patient recei ve the right therapy or service at the right time? Most of the patient outcomes that registries evaluate reflect one or more of these guiding aims. For example, a patient presenting with an ischemic stroke to an emergency room has a finite window of opportunity to receive a thrombolytic drug, and the patient outcome, whether or not the patient achieves full recovery, is dependent not only on the productdissolving the clot but also the timeliness of its delivery. 17,18 Purposes of Registries As discussed throughout this handbook, registries should be designed and e valuated with respect to their intended purpose(s). Registry purposes can be broadl y described in ter ms of patient outcomes. While there are a number of potential purposes for registries, this document primarily discusses four major purposes: describing the natural history ofdisease, determining clinical and/or cost effectiveness, assessing safety or harm, andmeasuring or improving quality of care. Other purposes of patient registries mentioned but not discussed in detail in this document are for publichealth surveillance and disease control. Anextensive body of literature from the last halfcentury of experience with cancer and other disease surveillance registries is available. Natural history of disease. Registries may be established to evaluate the natural history of a disease, meaning its characteristics, management,and outcomes with and/or without treatment. Thenatural histor y may be variable across different groups or geographic regions, and it often changes over time. In many cases, the natural histories ofdiseases are not well described. Furthermore, the natural history of diseases may change after theintroduction of cer tain therapies. As an example, patients with rare diseases, such as the l ysosomal storage diseases, who did not previously survive to their twenties, may now be entering their fourth and fifth decades of life, and this uncharted naturalhistory is being first described through a registry. 19 Determining effectiveness. Registries may be developed to deter mine clinical ef fectiveness or cost effectiveness in real-w orld clinical practice. Multiple studies have demonstrated disparities between the results of clinical trials and results inactual clinical practice. 20,21Furthermore, efficacy in a clinical trial for a well-defined population may not be generalizab le to other populations or subgroups of interest. As an e xample, many important heart failure trials have focused on a predominantly white male population with a mean age of appro ximatel y 60 years, whereas actual heart failure patients are older, more diverse, and have a higher mortality rate than the patients in these trials.22Similarl y, underrepresentation of older patients has been reported in clinical trials of 15 different types of cancer (e.g., studies with only 25 percent of patients age 65 y ears and over, while the expected rate is greater than 60 percent).23Registries may also be particularl y useful for tracking ef fectiveness outcomes for a longer time period than is typicall y feasible with clinical trials. For example, someSection I. Creating Registries 11growth hormone registries have tracked children well into adulthood. In addition to clinical effectiveness, registries can be used to assess cost effectiveness. Cost effectivenessis a means to describe the comparative value of ahealth care product or service in terms of its abilityto achieve a desired outcome for a given unit ofresources. 24Registries can be designed to collect cost data and effectiveness data for the same patients to use in modeling cost effectiveness. Acost-effectiveness analysis examines the incremental benefit of a particular intervention and the costsassociated with achieving that benefit. Cost-effectiveness studies compare costs with clinical outcomes measured in units such as life expectancy or disease-free periods. Cost-utility studies compare costs with outcomes adjusted for quality of life(utility), such as quality-adjusted life years(QAL Ys). Utilities allow comparisons to be made across conditions because the measurement is notdisease specific. 25It should be noted that for both clinical and cost effectiveness, differences betweentreatments are indirect and must be inferred fromdata analysis, simulation modeling, or somemixture. Measuring or monitoring safety and harm. Registries ma y be created to assess safety vs. har m. Safety here refers to the concept of being free from danger or hazard. One goal of registries in this context may be to quantify risk or to attribute it properly. Broadly speaking, patient registries can serve as an active surveillance system for the occur rence of une xpected or harmful events for products and services. Such events may range from patient complaints about minor side ef fects to se vere adverse events such as drug reactions or patient falls in the hospital. Patient registries offer several advantages for active surveillance. First, the current practice of spontaneous repor ting of adv erse events relies on a nonsystematic recognition of an adverse event by a clinician and the acti ve effort by the clinician to make a report to manufacturers and health authorities. Second, these events are generally repor ted without a denominator (i.e., the e xposedpopulation), and therefore an incidence level is difficult to determine. Because patient registriescan provide systematic data on adverse events and the incidence of these events, they are being used with increasing frequency in the areas of health careproducts and services. Measuring quality . Registries may be created to measure quality of care. The IOM defines qualityas \"the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihoodof desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.\" Quality-focusedregistries are being used increasingly to assessdifferences between providers or patient populations based on performance measures that compare treatments provided or outcomes achieved with\"gold standards\" (e.g., evidence-based guidelines) or comparative benchmarks for specific healthoutcomes (e.g., risk-adjusted sur vival or infection rates). Such pro grams ma y be used to identify disparities in access to care, demonstrate opportunities for improvement, establishdifferentials for payment by third parties, or providetransparency through public reporting. There aremultiple examples of such differences in treatment and outcomes of patients in a range of disease areas. 26 Multiple purposes. While each of these purposes may drive the creation of a registry, many registrieswill be developed to serve more than one purpose. Taxonomy for Patient Registries Even limited to the def initions described abo ve, the breadth of studies that might be included as patient registries is lar ge. P atients in a re gistry are typically selected based on a particular disease, condition (e.g., a risk factor), or exposure. This handbook utilizes these common selection criteria to de velop a taxonomy or classification based on how the populations for registries are defined. Three general categories with multiple subcategories and combinations account for the majority of re gistriesChapter 1. Patient Registries 12that are developed for evaluating patient outcomes. These categories include observational studies, inwhich the patient has a particular disease or condition or has had an exposure to a product or service or various combinations thereof. Product Registries In the case of a product registry, the patient is exposed to a health care product, such as a drug or adevice. The exposure may be brief, as in singledose of a pharmaceutical product, or extended, as inan implanted device or chronic usage of a medication. Device registries may include all or a subset of patients w ho receive the device. A registry for all patients w ho recei ve an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, a registry of patients with hip prostheses, or a registry of patients who wear contact lenses are all examples of device registries. Biopharmaceutical product registries similarly have several archetypes, which may include all or subsets of patients w ho recei ve the biophar maceutical product. Again, the duration of exposure may range from a single event to a lifetime of use. Eligibility for the re gistry includes the requirement that the patient recei ved the product or class of products (e.g., COX-2 inhibitors). In some cases, such registries are mandated by public health authorities to ensure appropriate use of medications. Examples include registries for thalidomide, clozapine, and isotretinoin. Pregnancy registries represent a separate class of biopharmaceutical product registries that focus on possib le exposures during pre gnanc y and the neonatal consequences. The FDA has a specific guidance focused on pregnancy exposure registries, which is available at http://www.fda.gov/CbER/ gdlns/pregexp.htm. This guidance uses the term\"pregnancy exposure registry\" to refer to \"a prospecti ve obser vational study that actively collects infor mation on medical product e xposure during pregnancy and associated pregnancy outcomes.\" Health Services Registries In the context of evaluating patient outcomes, another type of exposure that can be used to defineregistries is exposure to a health care service.Health care services that may be utilized to defineinclusion in a registry include individual clinical encounter(s), such as office visits orhospitalizations, procedures, or full episodes of care. Examples include registries enrolling patientsundergoing a procedure (e.g., carotidendarterectomy, appendectomy, or primary coronaryintervention) or admitted to a hospital for aparticular diagnosis (e.g., community-acquired pneumonia). In these registries, one purpose of the registry is to evaluate the health care service with respect to the outcomes. Health care ser vice registries are sometimes used to evaluate theprocesses and outcomes of care for qualitymeasurement pur poses (e.g., Get With The Guidelines SMof the American Heart Association, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ofthe Department of Veterans Affairs). Disease or Condition Registries Disease or condition registries use the state of a particular disease or condition as the inclusion criterion. In disease or condition re gistries, the patient ma y always have the disease (e.g., a rare disease, such as cystic fibrosis or Pompe disease, or a chronic illness, such as hear t failure, diabetes, or end-stage renal disease) or may have the disease orcondition for a more limited period of time (e.g.,infectious diseases, some cancers, obesity). These registries typicall y enroll the patient at the time of a routine health care service, although patients also can be enrolled through voluntary self-identification processes that do not depend on utilization of health care services (such as Internet recruiting ofvolunteers.) In other disease registries, the patient has an underlying disease or condition, such as atherosclerotic disease, but is enrolled only at the time of an acute event or exacerbation, such as hospitalization for a m yocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. Section I. Creating Registries 13Combinations Complicating this classification approach is the reality that these categories can be overlapping inmany registries. For example, a patient withischemic heart disease may have an acutemyocardial infarction and undergo a primary coronary intervention with placement of a drug-eluting stent and postintervention management with clopidogrel. This patient could be enrolled in anischemic heart disease registry longitudinallytracking all patients with this disease, a myocardialinfarction registry cross-sectionally collectingpatients who present to hospitals with acute myocardial infarction, a primary coronary intervention registry that includes management with and without de vices, a coronar y artery stent re gistry limited to ischemic heart disease patients, or a clopidogrel product registry that includes patients under going primar y coronary interventions. Duration of Observation The duration of the observational period for a registry is also a useful descriptor. Observational periods may be limited to a single episode of care(e.g., a hospital discharge registry for diverticulitis),or the y ma y extend for as long as the lifetime of a patient with a chronic disease (e.g., c ystic f ibrosis or Pompe disease) or receiving novel therapy (e.g., gene therapy). The period of observation or followup depends on the outcomes of interest. From Registry Purpose to Design As will be discussed extensively in this document, the pur pose of the registry defines what the registry will focus on (e.g., product vs. disease) and therefore the registry type. A registry created for the pur pose of e valuating outcomes of patients receiving a particular coronary artery stent might be designed as a single product registry if, for example, the pur pose is to systematicall y collect adv erse event information on the first 10,000 patients receiving the product. However, the registry might alternatively be designed as a health care service registry for primary coronary intervention if a purpose is to collect comparative effectiveness or safety data on other treatments or products within the same registry. Patient Registries and Policy Purposes In addition to the growth of patient registries for scientific and clinical purposes, registries arereceiving increasing attention for their potential rolein policymaking or decisionmaking. 27,28As stated earlier, registries may offer a view of real-world health care that is typically inaccessible from clinical trials or other data sources and may provideinformation on the generalizability of the data from clinical trials to populations not studied in those trials. The utility of registry data for decisionmaking is related to three factors: the stakeholders, the primary scientific question, and the context. Thestakeholders are those associated with the disease or procedure that may be affected from a patient, provider, payer, regulator, or other perspective. The primary scientific question for a registry may relateto effectiveness, safety, or practice patterns. Theconte xt includes the scientific context (e.g., previous randomized trials and modeling ef forts that help to more precisel y def ine the primar y scientif ic question), as well as the political, regulatory, funding, and other issues that provide the practicalparameters around w hich the registry is developed. In identifying the v alue of information from registries, it is essential to look at the data with specific reference to the purpose and focus of theregistry and in that context. From a polic y perspective, there are several scenarios in w hich the decision to de velop a registry may arise. One possible scenario is as follows. An item or ser vice is considered for use. Stak eholders in the decision collaboratively define \"adequate data in support of the decision at hand.\" Here, \"adequate data\" refers to information of sufficient relevance and quality to permit an informed decision. Anevidence development strategy is selected from one of man y potential strategies (RCT, practical clinical trial, re gistry, etc.) based on the quality of the evidence provided by each design, as well as the burden of data collection and the cost that is imposed. This tradeoff of the quality of evidence vs. cost of data collection for each possible design isChapter 1. Patient Registries 14termed the \"value of information\" exercise (Figure 1). Registries should be preferred in thosecircumstances where they provide sufficiently high- quality information for decisionmaking and a sufficiently low cost (relative to other \"acceptable\"designs). One set of policy determinations that may be informed by a patient registry centers on the area ofpayment for items or services. For example, in theCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Guidance on National Coverage DeterminationsWith Data Collection as a Condition of Coverage, 28 CMS describes several examples of how data collected in a registry might be used in the contextof coverage determinations. As described in theGuidance: [T]he purpose of CED [Coverage with Evidence Development] is to generate data on the utilization and impact of the item or serviceevaluated in the NCD [National Coverage Determination], so that Medicare can a)document the appropriateness of use of that item or ser vice in Medicare beneficiaries under current coverage; b) consider future changes in coverage for the item or service; c) generateclinical information that will improve the evidence base on which providers base theirrecommendations to Medicare benef iciaries regarding the item or ser vice. The Guidance provides insight into when registry data may be useful to policymakers. These purposes range from demonstrating that a par ticular item or service was provided appropriately to patientsmeeting specific characteristics to collecting newinfor mation that is not a vailab le from e xisting clinical trials. CED based on registries may be especially relevant when current data do not address relevant outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries, off- label or unanticipated uses, important patientsubg roups, or operator e xperience or other qualifications. In many countries, policy determinations on payment rely on cost-effectiveness and cost-utility data and therefore can be informed by registries aswell as clinical trials. 29These data are used and reviewed in a variety of ways. In some countries, there ma y be a threshold abo ve which a payer is willing to pay for an improvement in patient outcomes.30In these scenarios\u2014par ticularl y for rare diseases, when it can be difficult to gather clinical effectiveness data together with quality-of-life data in a utility format\u2014the establishment of disease- specific data registries has been recommended tofacilitate the process of technology assessment and improving patient care. 31Section I. Creating Registries Evidence development strategy implementedFigure 1: Deciding When To Develop a Registry: The \"Value of Information\" Exercise Clinical/polic y question(s) formulated \"Adequate data\" defined List of alternative designs constructed \"Value of information\" exercise performedCurrent evidence reviewed Decision madeItem/ser vice presented for consideration Data deemed adequate for decisionmaking 15Consider the clinical question of carotid endarterectomy surgery for patients with a high degree of stenosis of the carotid artery. Randomized trials, using highly selected patients and surgeons, indicate a benefit of surgery overmedical management in the prevention of stroke.However, that benefit may be exquisitely sensitive tothe surgical complication rates (i.e., a relatively small increase in the rate of surgical complicationsis enough to make medical management the preferred strategy instead), and the studies of surgical performance in a variety of hospitals may suggest substantial variation in surgical mortality and morbidity for this procedure. In such a case, a registry to evaluate treatment outcomes, adjusted byhospital and surgeon, might be considered to suppor t a policy decision as to when the procedure should be reimb ursed (e.g., onl y when performed in medical centers resemb ling those in the v arious randomized trials, or onl y by sur geons or f acilities with an acceptably low rate of complications). 32 Global Registries As many stakeholders have international interests in diseases, conditions, and health care products andservices, it is not surprising that interest in patient registries is global. While some of the specif ic legal and re gulatory discussions in this handbook are intended for and limited to the United States, most of the concepts and specifics are more broadly applicab le to similar acti vities w orldwide. Chapters 6 and 9 are perhaps the most limited in their applicability outside the United States. In addition,there may be differences or additions to be considered in data element selection (Chapter 4)stemming from differences ranging from medical training to use of local remedies; the types of data sources that are available outside the United States(Chapter 5); the issues surrounding physician andpatient recruitment and retention in different healthsystems and cultures (Chapter 7); and specific data collection and management options andcomplexities (Chapter 8) ranging from available technologies to languages. Summary A patient registry is an organized system that uses observational study methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to e valuate specified outcomes for a population defined by a particular disease,condition, or exposure and that serves predetermined scientific, clinical, or policy purpose(s). Well-designed and well-performedpatient re gistries can provide a real-world view of clinical practice, patient outcomes, safety , and comparative effectiveness and serve a number of evidence development and decisionmaking purposes. In the chapters that follow, this handbook presents practical design and operational issues, evaluation principles, and good re gistry practices.Chapter 1. Patient Registries 17Chapter 2. Planning a Registry Registries are considered or created for a number of reasons, and there is tremendous variability in thesize, scope, and resource requirements of the various registries that currently exist. Registries may be large or small in their numbers of patients orparticipating sites. They may target rare or commonconditions and exposures, and they may require the collection of narrow or extensive amounts of data. There may be significant or limited resourcessupporting the registry. In addition, the scope and focus of a registry may be adapted over time to reflect updated information, to reach broader ordifferent populations, to assimilate additional data, to focus on or expand to different geographicalregions, or to add new research questions. Whilethis degree of flexibility confers enormous potential, registries require good planning to be successful. The initial steps in planning a registry should include: articulating the purpose and objective(s) ofthe re gistry; deter mining if the data being sought have already been collected elsewhere; deciding whether a registry is the most appropriate means foraddressing the research question; identifying the stakeholders; defining the scope of the registry,including the planned representati veness of the target population and the characteristics of the datato be collected; and assessing if the proposed registry is feasible and likely to be successful. Once a decision is made to proceed , the ne xt considerations in planning concern funding and what types of advisors, teams, and o versight are appropriate for the registry purpose. Plans must also be made to manage change through an orderly and predefined process. Finally, registry planners should determine what will happen when theregistry ends. The Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiolo gy Practice from the Inter national Society of Phar macoepidemiology is a useful resource for registry planners.33The Updated Guidelines f or Evaluating Pub lic HealthSurveillance Systems may also be useful to planners, especially the appendixes, which provide variouschecklists. 34 Purpose One of the first steps in planning a registry is defining and establishing a registry purpose. Having a clearly defined purpose and supporting rationale makes it easier to evaluate whether aregistry is the right vehicle for capturing the information of interest. 35In addition, a clearly defined pur pose helps clarify the need for certain data, including their scope and le vel of detail. Conversely, having a clear sense of how the data may be used will help refine the stated purpose. A registry may have a singular focus, or it may serve many purposes.36In either case, the overall purpose should be translated into specific objectivesor questions to be addressed through the re gistry. This process needs to tak e into account the interests of those collaborating in the registry and the keyaudiences to be reached. 37Clear objectives are essential to def ine the str ucture and process of data collection and to ensure that the re gistry effectively addresses the important questions through the appropriate outcomes anal yses. Specif ic objectives also help the registry to avoid collecting large amounts of data of limited v alue. The time and resources needed to collect and process data in a registry setting can be substantial,38and the identif ication of a core data set is essential. The benefits of any data element included in the registry must outweigh the costs of including it. Registry planners can begin to establish specific objecti ves by considering w hat k ey questions the registry needs to answer. Critical consideration needs to be given to defining the key questions in order to e valuate ho w best to proceed , as these 18questions will help to establish the type of registry, the data points to be captured, and the type ofanalysis that will be planned. Examples of key, or driving, questions are: What is the natural course of a disease in different geographic locations? Does a treatment lead to long-term benefits or harm, including delayed complications? How successful is a \"comprehensive\" childhood immunization program? How is disease progression affected by available therapies? What is the safety profile of a specific therapy? Is a specific product or therapy teratogenic? How do clinical practices vary when treating a specific disease? What characteristics or practices enhance compliance and adherence? Do quality improvement programs affect patient outcomes, and , if so, ho w? What are significant predictors of poor outcomes? What clinical outcomes should be measured to improve quality of patient care? Are there disparities in the delivery of care? Should a particular procedure or product be a covered benefit in a particular population? Two of the case examples in this chapter provide examples of how key questions have shaped registries. (See Case Examples 1 and 2.) Once the k ey questions ha ve been identif ied, the focus turns to practical issues, such as determining if relevant data already exist to answer these questions in a rigorous way or if an entirely new data collection effort needs to be initiated. In somesituations, adding new data to an existing registry rather than setting up an entirel y new registry may be possib le.Section I. Creating Registries Case Example 1: Developing a Registry To Determine Policy Description The ICD RegistryTMcollects detailed information on implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantationsand tracks the relationship between physician training and in-hospital patient outcomes. The registry meets the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage with Evidence Development policy for data collection on ICD implantations. Sponsor The Heart Rhythm Society and the American Colle ge of Cardiolo gy Foundation Y ear Started 2005 Y ear Ended Ongoing No. of Sites 1,448 hospital participants No. of Patients Over 100,000 patients annually Challenge In March 2004, a manufacturer requested that CMS reconsider its prior co verage decision on ICDs, using the new evidence from the SuddenCardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD- HeFT). CMS agreed to this request and reviewed evidence from SCD-HeFT, as well as outcomesfrom other trials. CMS concluded that \"the available evidence does not provide a high degree of guidance to pro viders to target these devices to patients who will clearly derive benefit.\" In other words, the e vidence did not clearl y support the appropriateness of the procedure for Medicare patients, who, with a median age of 70-75 years, (continued) 19Chapter 2. Planning a Registry are significantly older than the patients in the SCD-HeFT trial, where the median age was 60years. In addition, CMS raised questions about therelationship between the expanding physicianspecialties implanting ICDs and patient outcomes, stating, \"As with any invasive procedure,physicians who insert ICDs must be appropriately trained and fully competent to perform theimplantation.\" While CMS had clear concerns, theevidence from the randomized controlled trialspresented strong evidence that ICDs are effective for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death.CMS needed to make a coverage determination that w ould be in the best interest of its benef iciaries, b ut the g aps in the e vidence made this difficult. Proposed Solution In September 2004, CMS proposed that a national registry be developed as a condition for coveragefor Medicare beneficiaries receiving ICDs for primar y prevention. The Heart Rhythm Society convened a new National ICD Registry Working Group, which consisted of physician associations,health insurance providers, government officials, medical device manufacturers, and members-at- large with expertise in registry development, to determine how best to develop and implement the registry. In October 2005, CMS announced that the ICD Registry TMsatisf ies the data reporting requirements for the national coverage determination. All hospitals that implant ICDs for primar y pre vention in Medicare beneficiaries are required as a condition for coverage to routinely submit data to the registry. While hospitals can limit their data entry to Medicare beneficiaries for primaryprevention, the preferred approach is to enter allpatients receiving ICDs. Through the National ICD Registry, CMS hopes to gain information to\"determine whether primary prevention ICDimplantation procedures are appropriate forMedicare beneficiaries who meet the clinical conditions as identified in the Agency' s nationalcoverage determination\" (Hammill, 2006). Results With 1,448 hospitals participating, the registry collected over 100,000 patients in its first year. Many hospitals entered all patients receiving ICDs. CMS will ha ve data to conduct anal ysis and shape its ICD coverage decision, and the first outcome reports that compare the hospital participants with their peers are planned to be released in April 2007. Key Point Obser vational re gistries can quickl y accumulate large amounts of data on real-w orld practice and effectiveness of new treatments and procedures. Physicians and hospitals can use these data tofurther quality impro vement efforts at a local level, and ph ysician associations can evaluate data to deter mine the effectiveness of existing clinical guidelines. Payers can use these data to informcoverage decisions and shape public policy, particularl y in cases w here the clinical trial population differs from the potential beneficiaries.

Creating Registries Case Example 2: Using Registries To Understand Rare Diseases Description The International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry aims to enhance understanding of the variability, progression, and natural history of Gaucher disease, with the ultimate goals of better guiding and assessing therapeutic intervention and providing recommendations on patient care to the medical community. Sponsor Genzyme CorporationYear Star ted 1991 Year Ended Ongoing No. of Sites 732 (as of January 2007) No. of Patients 4,620 (as of January 2007), with open-ended followup Challeng e Rare diseases pose special research challenges. The small number of affected patients often resultsin limited clinical experience within individual centers. Therefore, the clinical description of rare diseases may be incomplete or skewed. Themedical literature often consists of indi vidual case reports or small case series, limiting understanding of the natural histor y of the disease. Furthermore, randomized controlled trials with adequate sample size and length of followup to assess treatment outcomes ma y be e xtremel y difficult or not feasible. The challenge is even greater for rare diseases that are chronic in nature, where long- term followup is especially important. As a result,rare diseases are often incompletely characterized and lack published data on long-term treatment outcomes. Gaucher disease, a rare enzyme deficiency affecting fewer than 10,000 known patientsworldwide, illustrates many of the challenges facing researchers of rare diseases. Physicianswho encounter patients with Gaucher disease typically have one or two patients in their practice;only a few physicians around the world have morethan 10 to 20 patients in their care. Understanding Gaucher disease is further complicated by the fact that it is a highly heterogeneous and rare disorder, and a patient cohor t from a single center may represent a subset of the entire spectrum of diseasephenotypes. The rarity and chronic nature of Gaucher disease also pose challenges in conducting clinicalresearch. The clinical trial that led to U. S. Food and Drug Administration approval of enzyme replacement therap y (ER T) for Gaucher disease (Ceredase\u00ae, alglucerase injection) in 1991 was a single-ar m, open-label study involving only 12 patients follo wed for 9-12 months. In 1994, a recombinant form of enzyme replacement therapy was approved (Cerezyme\u00ae, imiglucerase forinjection), based on a randomized two-arm clinical trial comparing Ceredase and Cerezyme in 30 patients (15 in each ar m) follo wed for 9 months. Proposed Solution With planning initiated in 1991, the registry is an international, longitudinal disease registry, open voluntarily to all physicians caring for patientswith all subtypes of Gaucher disease, regardless of treatment status or treatment type. Data on patient demo graphics; clinical characteristics; treatment regimen; and laboratory, radiologic, and quality-of- (continued) 21Chapter 2. Planning a Registry life outcomes are entered and analyzed to address the research challenges of this rare disease. Responsibility for the use, integrity, and objectivity of the data and analyses is invested in the ICGGboard, which is comprised of physician-investigators who are not employees of thesponsor. Results With an aggregated, international database, analysis of data from the registry has provided a much more complete clinical description of Gaucher disease and its natural history, with longitudinal data on more than 4,600 patients from over 700 centers in more than 55 countries. Theregistry has an open-ended followup period, withthe length of follo wup cur rently ranging from zero to 15 y ears. The re gistry has collected approximately 23,000 patient-years of followup over the past 15 years. With these extensive followup data, analysis of the registry has increased knowledge of longer term treatment outcomes for enzyme replacementtherap y. In 2002, the ICGG pub lished the clinical outcomes of 1,028 patients treated with ER T with up to 5 y ears of followup. A clinical trial of this size and duration would not be feasible for such a rare disease. As the registry database continues to grow in size and duration, further analyses of clinicall y significant long-term treatment outcomes are being conducted. A rare disease registry can also help foster the formation of an international community of expert physicians who can collaboratively developrecommendations on the clinical management ofpatients. The collective clinical experience of the ICGG led to the development of recommendationsfor evaluation and monitoring of patients withGaucher disease. The analysis of registry data ontreatment outcomes has facilitated theestablishment of therapeutic goals for patients withtype 1 Gaucher disease. Together, thesepublications have formed the foundation for a consensus- and evidence-based diseasemanagement approach, something usually only possible for much more common diseases. Key Point For rare or ultra-rare diseases such as Gaucher disease, an international, longitudinal disease registry may be the best or only feasible way tocomprehensi vely increase knowledge about the clinical characteristics and natural histor y of the disease and assess the long-term outcomes oftreatment.

Creating Registries Appropriateness for Answering the Key Questions Advances in epidemiological and biostatistical methods have broadened the scope of questions thatcan be addressed through observational designs.Stratification, propensity score matching, and riskadjustment are increasingly useful approaches foraddressing confounding issues and for creating comparably homogeneous subgroups for analysiswithin registry data sets (Chapters 3 and 10). 39,40 These techniques may allow registries to conduct infor mative and reliable analyses to support investigations of comparative safety and effectiveness. Including data quality measures such as source data v erification as part of registry operations can strengthen scientif ic rigor . A careful evaluation of the possibilities for data collection and registry design, the degree of certainty required, and the timeframe in which this certainty is expectedcan help in selecting an appropriate study design. Itis impor tant to note that, historicall y, there has been a lack of consensus standards for conducting and reporting methods and results for registries.Therefore, registries have tended to be more variablein implementation and are generall y harder to assess for quality than randomized controlled trials. Other Sources of Accessible Data Because there ma y be alter native ways to access data and/or analyses, an important question needs to be asked very early in planning a registry: Do these data already e xist and , if so, are the y accessib le? In some cases, the required data have already been collected through another source, or research may be underway. For example, relevant data could be extracted from electronic medical records oradministrative health insurance claims data. In such cases, re gistries might a void re-collecting data that have already been collected elsewhere and are accessible. Thought should be given to adapting the registry (based on e xtant data) and/or linking toother relevant data sources (including \"piggy- backing\" onto other registries). When the required data have not been sufficiently collected or are not accessible for the desiredpurpose, it is appropriate to consider creating a newregistry. Stakeholders Once registry planners have decided that a new registry is the most appropriate method of data collection, they should consider to whom the datamatter . It is important to recognize the potential stakeholders at an early stage, as these stakeholdersmay have important input into the type and scope ofdata to be collected, they may ultimately be users of the data, or they may have a key role in disseminating the results of the re gistry. One or more parties could be considered stakeholders of the registry. These parties could beas specif ic as a re gulator y agenc y that will be monitoring postmarketing studies or as broad as the general population. Often, a stakeholder' s input directl y influences whether a registry design can proceed. A regulator y agenc y looking for management of a therapeutic with a known toxicity profile may require a different level of rigor than a manuf acturer with general questions about how a product is being used. Typically, there are primary and secondary stakeholders for any registry. A primary stakeholder is usually responsible for creating and funding the registry. The party that requires the data, such as aregulatory authority, may also be considered a primary stakeholder. A secondary stakeholder may be a par ty that would benefit from knowledge of the data (or would be impacted by the results) but that is not instr umental in estab lishing the re gistry. Treating physicians and their patients could be considered secondary stakeholders. A partial list of possib le stak eholders follo ws: Regulatory authorities. Product manufacturers. 23 Health care service providers. Payer or commissioning authorities. Patients and/or advocacy groups. Treating physician groups. Universities or professional societies. Once the stakeholders have been established, consideration should be given to how the registry will be funded. Depending on the sources offunding for the registry, this process may identify a new stakeholder. This process of stakeholder definition will become relevant in a later section of this chapter, which discusses issues of oversight and governance for registries. Although interactions with the potential stakeholders will v ary, the registry will be best supported by defined interactions and communications with these parties. Defining these interactions during the planning stage will ensurethat adequate dialog occurs and appropriate input is recei ved to support the overall value of the registry. Interactions throughout the entire duration of theregistry can also assure stakeholders that the registryis aligned with the purposes and goals that were setout during the planning stages and that the registrycomplies with all required guidances, rules, and/or regulations. Characteristics of Data and Target Population Scope of Data Required After the re gistry purpose has been established and the registry stakeholders identified, the registry planners can proceed with deter mining the scope of the data required to address the key questions. The scope of a registry may be viewed in terms of size, setting, duration, geo graphy, and f inancing. The purpose and objectives of the registry should frame the scope, but other factors (aside from feasibility and cost) may ultimately shape it. For example, the scope may be affected by: Regulatory requirements, such as those imposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) as a condition of product marketing. Reimbursement decisions, such as national coverage decisions by the Centers for Medicare& Medicaid Services. National research interests, such as those driven by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Public health policy, such as policy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) and immunization policy. Manufacturers' interests. The scope is also affected by the degree of uncer tainty that is acceptab le to the primar y stakeholders, with that uncertainty being principally driven by the quantity, quality, and detail of the data collection balanced against its consideredimportance and value. Therefore, it is critical tounderstand the potential questions that ma y or ma y not be ans werable because of the quantity and quality of the data. Specific variables. Some of the specific variables that can characterize the scope of a registry include: Size: This may refer to the number and complexity of data points or to the enrollment ofinvestigators and patients. A registry with a large number of complex data points may allow for detailed and thoughtful analyses but may beso burdensome as to discourage investigator andpatient enrollments. In turn, a small registrywith few patients and data points may be easier to execute, but the data could lack depth and be less meaningful. 41Size also deter mines the precision with which measures of risk or risk difference can be calculated. Setting: This refers to the specif ic setting through w hich the registry will recruit investigators and patients as well as collect data (e.g., hospital, doctor' s office, pharmacy, home). Duration: The planning of a registry must reflect the length of time that the registry is expected to collect the data to achieve itsChapter 2. Planning a Registry 24purpose and provide analysis of the data collected. An example of a relevant factor iswhether a product is nearing the end of the life of its patent. Geography: The setup, management, and analysis of a locally run registry represent a very different scope than a global registry. Thegeographic scope impact includes many challenges (e.g., language, cultural, time zone, regulatory) that must be taken into considerationin the planning process. Financial investment: The scope of a registry will determine the cost of creating, managing,and analyzing the registry. Budgetary constraints must be carefully considered before moving from conception to reality. Additionally, the value of the information weighs in on the financial decisions. The cost of the re gistry should be less than (or at a minimum, equal to) the projected value gained through the infor mation generated. Some choices in planning, such as building on existinginfrastructure and/or linking to data sourcesrelevant to the purposes of the registry, may increase the net return. Richness of c linical data needed: In some situations, the outcome ma y be relati vely simple to characterize (e.g., death). In other cases, the focus of interest may be a complex set of symptoms and measurements (e.g., for Churg- Strauss Syndrome) or may require specialized diagnostic testing or tissue sampling to conf irm (e.g., sentinel node in melanoma). Someoutcomes may require assessment by an independent third par ty. (See \"Scientif ic Rigor ,\" below.) When data need to be a vailable for analysis. Meaningful data on disease pro gression or other long-term patient outcomes may not be available through a re gistry for man y years, w hereas safety data could be analyzed on a rolling basis. Therefore, the type of data on patient outcomes and when they will be available for analysis should be addressed from the perspective of the intended usesof the data in both the short term and long term. Scientific rigor. The content of the data to be collected should be driven by the scientific analyses that are planned for the registry, which in turn are determined by the objectives of the registry. A registry that is designed primarily for monitoringdrug safety will inevitably contain different dataelements from one that is designed primarily formonitoring drug effectiveness. Similarly, the extent to which data need to be validated will depend onthe purpose of the registry and the complexity of the clinical information being sought. Some outcomes may require formal adjudication by a committee, while others may require obtaining supporting documents from referrals or biopsies. Generally, registries that are undertaken for regulatorydecisionmaking will merit increased attention toward diagnostic confirmation (i.e., enhanced scientif ic rigor). Defining the Core Data Set Elements of data to be included must ha ve potential value in the context of the current scientific and clinical climate and be chosen by a team of experts, preferab ly with input from experts in biostatistics and epidemiolo gy. Each data element should be chosen for a reason related to the purpose of the registry. Ideally, each data element should addressthe central questions for w hich the re gistry was designed. While a certain number of speculative fields may be desired to generate and explore hypotheses, these must be balanced against the risk of overburdening sites with capturing superfluous data. The core data set variables (\"need to know\") define the information set needed to address the critical questions for which the registry was created. At aminimum, when calculating the resource needs and overall design of the registry, registry planners must account for these fields. If additional noncore variables (\"nice to know\") are included, such as explorator y variab les, it is impor tant that such data elements align with the goals of the registry and take into account the b urden of data collection and entry at the site level. A parsimonious use of \"nice to know\" variables is important for several reasons.Section I. Creating Registries 25First, when data elements change, there is a cascade effect to all dependent components of the registryprocess and outputs. For example, the addition of new data elements may require changes to the data collection system, retraining of site personnel on data definitions and collection practices, adjustments to the registry protocol, and amendmentsubmissions to institutional review boards. Such changes often require additional financial resources.Ideally, the registry would both limit the total number of data elements and include at the outset data elements that might change from \"nice to know\" to \"need to know\" during the course of the registry. In practice, this is a difficult balance to achieve, so most registries should plan for someresources to be used for change management. Second, a registry should not try to accomplish too many goals, or its burden will outweigh itsusefulness to the clinical sites and researchers.Examples e xist, ho wever, of registries that serve multiple purposes successfully without overburdening clinicians. (See Case Example 3.) Third, even \"need-to-know\" variables can sometimes be difficult to collect reliably (e.g., use of illegalsubstances) or without substantial burden (e.g.,unusual laborator y tests). Ev en with a limited core data set, feasibility must still be considered. (SeeChapter 4.) Defining Patient Outcomes The outcomes of greatest importance should be identified early in the concept phase of the registry. Having to delineate these outcomes (e.g., primary or secondar y endpoints) forces re gistry designers to establish priorities. Prioritization of interests in the planning phase will help focus the w ork of the registry and will guide study size requirements. (See Chapter 3.) Identifying the patient outcomes of the greatest importance will also help to guide the selection of the data set. Avoiding the temptation tocollect \"nice to know\" data that are likely of marginal value is of paramount importance, but some re gistries that accomplish their purposes do in fact need to collect large amounts of data. Having adequate data to properl y address potentialconfounders during analyses is one reason that extensive data collection is sometimes required. 42 Methods to ascertain the principal outcomes should be clearly established. The diagnostic requirements,level of data detail, and level of data validationand/or adjudication should also be addressed. Asnoted below in the context of identifying a targetpopulation, relying on established guidelines andstandards to aid in defining outcomes of interest has many benefits and should be considered. The issues of ascertainment noted here are important to consider because they will have abearing on some attributes by which registries maybe evaluated. 43These attributes include sensitivity (the extent to which the methods identify all outcomes of interest) and external validity(generalizability to similar populations), amongothers. Defining the Target Population The target population is the population to which the findings of the re gistry are meant to appl y. It must be defined for two basic reasons. First, the target population serves as the foundation for how to plan the re gistry. Second, it also represents a major constituenc y that will be impacted b y the results of the registry. Criteria for def ining the target population should be established. Since one of the goals for registry datamay be to enable generalization of conclusions from clinical research on nar rowly def ined populations to broader ones, the inclusion criteria for most (although not all) registries are relatively broad. As an example, screening criteria for a re gistry ma y allow inclusion of elderly patients, patients with multiple comorbidities, patients on multiple therapies, patients who switch treatments during the period of observation, or patients who are usingproducts \"off label.\" The definition of the target population will depend on man y factors (e.g., scope and cost) b ut ultimatel y will be dri ven by the purpose of the registry. As with defining patient outcomes, target population criteria and/or definitions should be consistent withChapter 2. Planning a Registry 26established guidelines and standards within the therapeutic area. Achieving this goal enhances thepotential utility of the registry by leveraging other data sources (historical or concurrent) with different information on the same target population andenhancing statistical power if similar information iscollected on the target population. In establishing target population criteria, consideration should be given to the feasibility of access to that population. One should try todistinguish the ideal from the real. Some questions to consider in this regard are: How common is the exposure or disease of interest? Can eligible persons be readily identified? Are other sources competing for the same patients? Is care centralized or dispersed (e.g., in a refer ral or ter tiary care f acility)? How mobile is the target population? Ultimately, methods to ascertain members of the target population should be carefully considered (e.g., use of screening logs that identify all potential patients and indicate w hether the y participate and, if not, why not), as well as use of sources outside the registry (e.g., patient groups). Greater accessibility of the tar get population will reap benefits in terms of enhanced representativeness and statistical power. Lastly, thought should be given to comparison (control) groups either internal or external to the registry. Again, much of this consideration will be driven by the purpose of the registry, as detailed in its objectives and questions. For example, no need for controls exists in natural history registries, but controls are especially desirable for registriescreated to e valuate comparative effectiveness or safety . Registry Funding Registries that meet the attrib utes described in this handbook will most likely require funding. The degree of expense incurred will be determined by the scope of the purpose of the registry and the rigorof data collection and audit that is required. The larger the scope of data collected and the greater theneed for representation from a wide variety of patient characteristics, the larger is the expense. In addition, the method of data collection will contribute to expense, with electronic collection being more expensive to implement but generallyless expensive to maintain compared with fax and scan or mailed forms. 44Funding will be affected by whether other relevant data sources and/or infrastructures exist that capture some of the information of interest, whether the registry adapts to new issues over time, and whether multiple funding sources participate. Funding needs also should be examined in terms of the projected life ofthe registry and/or its long-term sustainability. If de-identif ied data will be accessible to either internal or e xternal groups after the registry closes, it is impor tant to clarify ho w that acti vity will be managed and suppor ted. There are many potential funding sources for registries. Funding sources are likely to want to share in planning and provide input for the manychoices that will need to be made in theimplementation plans. Funding sources may negotiate to recei ve access to de-identif ied data as a requirement for their par ticipation. F or a v ariety of reasons, some funding sources (as is also the case in clinical trials) may require that such access berestricted or exclusive outside of addressing the scientif ic questions in the re gistry protocol. Funding models for registries may vary significantly, and a preferred approach does not exist. Rather, the funding model for a registry should be dictated by the needs of the registry. Potential sources of funding include: Government : The branches of the government, such as NIH, CDC, and State agencies, may be interested in a re gistry to determine long-term outcomes of agents, de vices, or g roups of drugs. While the pharmaceutical industry or device manuf acturers collect most long-ter m data on drug and device safety, many research questions arise that could potentially be suitable for government funding in the conte xt of sponsored Phase IV safety studies mandated by FDA. ToSection I. Creating Registries 27determine if there is interest in funding a registry, look for Requests for Proposals (RFPs)on the Web site of the funding agency. Direct contact with the study section secretary is also advisable to determine if there is potentialinterest in a registry to fill a niche need thatmay not be posted on the agency Web site. AnRFP posting or direct posting with NIH study section personnel would provide a great deal ofspecific information as to how a submission will be judged and what specific criteria would be needed in order for a proposal to be favorably ranked. Product manufacturers : Product manufacturers may be interested in studying the natural history of the disease for which they have (or aredeveloping) a product, demonstrating the effectiveness and/or safety of e xisting products in real-w orld use, or assisting pro viders in evaluating or improving quality of care. Foundation funding : National disease foundations may be in a position to awardapplications for registry design andimplementation from competitive grant applications. The need for a disease-specific registry is dependent on what already exists and whether the percei ved need is being met b y other organizations. Inquiries from investigators to foundation study section personnel areappropriate in order to determine the climate for a registry proposal to a foundation source. Private funding : Pri vate philanthropic individuals ma y be identified within the community who might have an interest in furthering research to better understand the effects of a particular intervention or sets of interventions on a disease process. Professional societies : Health care professional associations often have scientific committees that could deter mine w hether it is in the interest of the society to develop a registry. Such efforts have been rare because of competing needs for other activities (e.g., meetings, conferences). Professional society/pharmaceutical industry \"hybrid\" : Situations may exist in which a product manufacturer funds a registry that would be designed and implemented by a professional society to gain insight into a set ofresearch questions. Health plan providers : Under certain circumstances, health plan providers may be interested in funding a registry, as practicalclinical research is increasingly viewed as a useful tool for providing evidence for health coverage and health care decisions. 45 Multiple sponsors : Several registries may meet the goals of multiple stakeholders, and such stakeholders may each have an interest in funding. Registries for isotretinoin and antiretrovirals in pregnancy are examples, but many others e xist. Such re gistries can decrease the costs for each funding source. Recentl y, there have been several proposals for increasing postmark eting pro grams such as registries as a path to improved safety monitoring and for streamlining the cost of the drug development process.46,47,48At this stage, it is not clear how such efforts would be funded. Registr y Team Several different kinds of technical expertise and skills are needed to plan and implement a registry. In a small registry run by a single individual, consultants ma y be able to provide the critical levels of expertise needed to plan all components of the registry. In a large registry, a variety of individuals may work together as a team to contribute the necessar y components of e xpertise. Depending on the size, scope, and purpose of the registry, few, some, or all of the individuals representing the components of e xpertise described belo w ma y be included at the time of the planning process. Whatever number of individuals is eventually assemb led, it is important to build a group that can work to gether as a collegial team to accomplish the goals of the registry. Additionally, the team participants must understand the data sources. By understanding the goals and data sources, theChapter 2. Planning a Registry 28registry team will enable the data to be utilized in the most appropriate context for the mostappropriate interpretation. The different kinds of expertise and experience that are useful include the following: Subject matter : A registry must be designed so that it contains the appropriate data to meet its goals as well as the needs of its constituents. For example, experts in the treatment of the clinical disease to be studied who are alsofamiliar with the potential toxicities of the treatment(s) to be studied are critical to the success of the registry. Clinical experts must be able to apply all of the latest published clinical,toxicity, and outcome data to components of the registry and determine which elements arenecessary, desirable, or superfluous. The impor tance of this acti vity to the o verall success of the venture cannot be overemphasized. Registry science : Epidemiolo gy and biostatistics expertise specific to the subtleties of patientregistries is useful in the design, implementation, and analysis of registry data. Epidemiologists can provide the study designand can work in collaboration withbiostatisticians to de velop a mutual understanding of the research objecti ves. These scientists should w ork with the subject matter experts to ensure that appropriate analytic methods are being used to address the clinical issues rele vant to achie ving the goals of the registry. Data collection and data base mana gement : The decision to include various data elements can be made in consultation with experts in this field to place \"critical fields\" in a prominent and logical position on the data form for both paper-basedand electronic data collection tools. A final determination of what is usable and workable for data collection tools should be appro ved by all members of the team. These experts may also need to write specif ic pro grams so that the data received from the registry are grouped, stored, and identified. They may generate reports for individuals who track registryparticipation, and they may provide data downloads periodically to registry analysts.This team will also be responsible for implementing and maintaining firewalls to protect the data according to accepted levels ofsecurity for similar collections of sensitive data. Legal/patient privacy : In the present legal climate, it is critical that either information that identifies individual patients be excluded orspecific consent be sought to include information on the identity of a patient. This topic is quite complex and is dealt with in detailin Chapter 6. Legal and privacy expertise is needed to protect the patients and the owners of the database by ensuring that the registry complies with all national and local lawsapplicable to patient information. Quality assur ance : As discussed in Chapter 8, quality assurance of procedures and data isanother important component of registry success. Exper tise in quality assurance will help in planning a good registry. The goals forquality assurance should be established for eachregistry, and the efforts made and results achieved should be described. Project mana gement : Project management will be needed to coordinate the components of theregistry; to manage timelines, milestones, deliverables, and budgets; and to ensurecommunication with sites, stakeholders, oversight committees, and funding sources. Ongoing o versight of the entire process will require a team approach. (See the ne xt section.) Registr y Governance and Oversight Governance refers to guidance and high-level decisionmaking, including concept, funding,execution, and dissemination of information. The composition and relati ve mix of internal and external stakeholders and experts relate largely to the purpose of the registry. For example, if the purpose of the re gistry is to deter mine a comparative effectiveness or reimbursement policy, those impacted by the policy should not solelySection I. Creating Registries 29Chapter 2. Planning a Registry govern the registry. Broad stakeholder involvement is most desirable in governance boards when thereare many stakeholders. Depending on the size of the registry, governance may be assumed by various oversight committeesmade up of interested individuals who are part ofthe design team (internal governance) or whoremain external to the day-to-day operations of theregistry (external governance). Differences in the nature of the study questions, the overall resourcesbeing consumed by the registry, the soundness of the underlying data sources, and many other factorswill influence the degree of involvement and role ofoversight groups. In other words, the purpose of the committee functions described below is to lay out the roles that need to be assumed by the governancestructure of many registries, but these should be individualized for a particular registry. It is alsopossib le, if methods are clear and transparency self- evident, that o versight requirements ma y be minimal. Registries fulfill governance roles in a variety of ways. Many of the roles, for example, could be assumed by a single committee (e.g., a steeringcommittee) in some registries. Whatever model isadopted , it must accommodate all of the w orking constituencies and pro vide a mechanism for these individuals to work together to achieve the goals of the registry. All aspects of governance should be codified in a written for mat that can be re viewed, shared, and refined over time. In addition, governance is a dynamic process, subject to change in polic y as evidence emerges that is likely to lead to improvements in the process. Governance and oversight functions that may be considered include: Executive or steering : This function assumes responsibility for the major financial, administrati ve, legal/ethical, and scientific decisions that determine the direction of the registry. These decisions are made with appropriate input from legal, scientific, and administrative experts. Depending on theircapabilities and the size and resources of the registry, the group serving the steering function may also assume some of the functions described below. Scientific : This function may include experts ranging from database content, to general clinical research, to epidemiology andbiostatistics. This function may determine the overall direction of database inquiries andrecommend specific analyses to the executive or steering group. It is strongly desirable that the reports that emerge from a registry bescientifically based analyses that are independent and transparent. 49To enhance credibility and in the interest of full disclosure, the role of all stakeholders in the publicationprocess should be specified and any potential conflicts of interest identif ied. Liaison : In large registries, a function may be specified to focus on maintaining relationshipswith the funding source, health care pro viders, and patients who utilize the database. Thegroup serving this function may developmonitoring and satisfaction tools to assure that the day-to-day operations of the registry remain health y. Adjudication : Adjudication is used to re view and confirm cases (outcomes) that may be difficult to classify. Individuals performing thisfunction are generally blinded to the exposure (product or process) under study so that the confirmation of outcomes is made without knowledge of e xposure. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) : The majority of registries will not have a need for aDSMB, since a DSMB is commonly used to monitor the safety of dr ugs and devices in development and is rarely used in studies of marketed products and services. There may be situations in w hich the re gistry is responsib le for the primary accumulation of safety data on a particular intervention; in such situations, it is possible that a DSMB would be appropriate. Data access, use, and publications : A process by which registry investigators access and 30Section I. Creating Registries perform analyses of registry data for the purpose of submitting abstracts to scientificmeetings and developing manuscripts for peer- reviewed journal submission should be addressed by this function. Authorship(including registry sponsors) in scientificpublications should satisfy the conditions of theUniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals. 50The rules governing authorship may be affected by the funding source, as in the case of NIH or foundation funding, or by the biomedical journal. (See Case Example 3.) Other investigators may request permission to access the data. For example, a Ph.D. candidate at aninstitution might seek registry-wide aggregate data for the pur poses of evaluating a new scientif ic question. A process for reviewing and responding to such requests from otherinvestig ators should be considered in some registries that may generate broad external interest if the registry stakeholders andparticipants are ag reeable to such use. An example of a way to respond to these requests is the following: Proposals for dataanalysis are submitted using a uniform submission for mat that describes the h ypothesis to be tested , methods to be utilized in the analysis, likely significance of the results of theanalysis, and publication plans. These uniformsubmissions can be evaluated in a blinded manner by members of a designated group and assigned a numerical ranking, with input fromepidemiologists or biostatisticians as to the feasibility of the proposal. What Happens When the Registry Ends? Most registries have a finite lifespan. A registry that tests the safety of a product used during pregnancywill have a different lifespan from one that examinesthe effectiveness of new interventions in a chronic disease. Sponsors and registry participants shouldhave an understanding of the proposed lifespan of the registry at the time of its inception. The determination of who owns the data at the end of the natural lifespan of the registry and where the data are to be stored should also be defined at the time of re gistry inception. Possibilities include the principal investigator, the sponsor or funding source, or a related professional society. Chapter 6discusses issues in ownership. Registries that generate continuing societal v alue, such as quality improvement programs and safety programs, might consider transitions that continue the re gistry functions after the original funding sources have expired. 31Chapter 2. Planning a Registry Case Example 3: Creating a Registry To Fulfill Multiple Purposes and Using aPublications Committee To Review DataRequests Description The National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI) collects, analyzes, and disseminates data on patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction. Its goal is improvement of patient care at individual hospitals through the hospital team' s evaluation of data and assessment of care delivery systems. Sponsor Genentech, Inc.Y ear Started 1990 Y ear Ended OngoingNo. of Sites 451 hospitals (NRMI 5). Ov er 1,700 hospitals ha ve participated in NRMI o ver the past 16 y ears. No. of Patients 2,472,218 Challenge Over the past 20 years, there have been significant changes in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. Evidence from lar ge clinical trials has led to the introduction of new guidelines and therapies for treating AMI patients, including fibrinolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention. While these treatments canimprove both morbidity and mortality for AMI patients, the y are time sensitive and must be administered v ery soon after hospital arrival in order to be most effective. After the release of its first fibrinolytic therapy product in 1987, the sponsor' s field representatives learned from their discussions with emergencydepartment physicians, cardiologists, and hospital staff that most clinicians belie ved they were treating patients quickl y, although there w as no documentation or benchmarking to confirm thisassumption or to identify and correct delays. At that time, many emergency departments did not have readily available diagnostic tools (such asangiography labs) and hospitals with AMI-specificdecision pathways and treatment protocols were the exception rather than the rule. In addition, since fibrinolytic therapy was being widely used for the first time, the sponsor wanted to gather safety information related to its use in real-world situations and in a broader range of patientsthan those treated in the controlled environment ofa clinical trial. Proposed Solutions and Results The sponsor decided to create the National Re gistry of My ocardial Inf arction to fulf ill the multiple purposes of identifying treatment patterns, promoting time-to-treatment and other quality impro vements, and gathering real-world safety data. The scope of the data collection necessary to meet these needs could have made such a registryimpracticable, so the NRMI team faced the sizable challenge of balancing the data needs with thefeasibility of the re gistry. The sponsor for med a Scientif ic Advisor y Board with members representing the v arious clinical stakeholders (emergency department, cardiology, nursing, research, etc.). The Scientific Advisory Board developed the data set for the registry, keeping a fe w guiding principles in mind. These principles emphasized maintaining balance between the clinical research and the feasibility of the registry. The first principle was to determine whether the proposed data element was necessaryby asking several key questions: How will the data element be used in generating hospital feedback repor ts or research anal yses? Is the data element already collected? If not, should it be collected? If it should be collected , is it feasib le to collect those data? The second principle focused on using existing data standards whenever possible. If a data standard did not exist, the team tried to collect the data in the simplest possible way. The thirdprinciple emphasized data consistency and making the registry user friendly by continually refining (continued) 32Section I. Creating Registries data element definitions until they were as clear as possible. In 1990, the sponsor launched the registry. Over the past 16 years, the registry has proven that the advisory board' s efforts to create a feasible multipurpose registry were successful. To date, theregistry has collected data on the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes of over 2.4 million patients with AMI from more than 1,700 participating sites. The success of the registry presented a new challenge for the re gistry team. The sponsor receives a large volume of requests to analyze the registry data, often for research topics that fall outside of the standardized reports developed forthe registry. As a guiding principle, the registryteam is committed to making the data a vailable for research projects, b ut it has limited resources to support these requests. The team needed todevelop a process that would allow outsideresearchers to access the registry data withoutoverburdening the registry team. The registry team created a publication process to determine when another group could use the data for research. The team set high-level criteria that all data requests must meet. The request must be feasible given the data in the registry, and therequest must not represent a duplication of another research effort. To review the requests the re gistry team in volved its Scientific Advisory Board, made up of cardiologists, emergency department physicians, nurses, research scientists, pharmacists, and reviewers with specialties in biostatistics andstatistical programming, in creating a publication Review Committee. The role of the Review Committee is to e valuate all research proposals to determine originality, interest to peers, feasibility, appropriateness, and priority . The Re view Committee limits its review of research proposals to a set number of reviews per year, and it schedules the reviews and deadlines around theabstract deadlines for the major conferences. Research analyses must be intended to result in peer-reviewed presentations and publications. Researchers are asked to submit proposals thatinclude well-defined questions and an analysis plan. If the proposal is accepted, the researchersdiscuss any further details with the biostatisticiansand statistical programmers who will perform theanalyses (and who are employed at an independentclinical research organization). The results are sent directl y to the researchers. The Scientific Advisory Board and Review Committee remain involved in the process once adata request has been granted. All authors must submit their abstracts to the Review Committeebefore sending them to conferences. The Review Committee re views the abstracts and of fers constr uctive criticism to help the authors impro ve them. The Review Committee also reviews manuscripts before journal submission to help identify an y issues or concer ns that the authors should address. The publication process has enabled the wealth of data collected in this registry to be used in over150 scientific abstracts and 100 peer-reviewed articles, addressing each of the purposes of theregistry as well as other research topics. By involving the Scientif ic Advisor y Board and providing independent biostatistical support, the registry team has developed an infrastructure that enhances the credibility of the research uses of this observational database. Key Points Registries can be developed to fulfill more than one purpose, but this added complexity requires careful planning to ensure that the f inal re gistry data collection b urden and procedures are feasib le. Making sure that the advisory board includes representati ves with clinical and operational perspectives can help the board to maintain its focus on feasibility.Case Example 3: Creating a Registry To Fulfill Multiple Purposes and Using a Publications Committee To Review Data Requests (continued) (continued) 33Chapter 2.

Seven keyaspects of registry design should be considered andevaluated in the context of the registry purpose, be itclinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness, safety, or natural history, as shown in Table 1.Chapter 3. Registry Design Table 1: Considerations for Study Design Construct Relevant questions Research question What are the clinical and/or public health questions of interest? Study design What types of study designs can be used in re gistries? Exposures and How do the clinical outcomes questions of interest translate into measurable exposures and outcomes? Study population What types of patients are needed for study? Is a comparison g roup needed? Ho w should patients be selected for study? Data sources Where can the necessary data be found? Study size and For how long should data be duration collected , and for ho w man y patients? Potential for bias What is the potential for bias, and how does this af fect generalizability (external validity)?This chapter is intended as a high-level practical guide to the application of epidemiological methodsthat are particularly useful in the design of registriesthat evaluate patient outcomes. It is not intended toreplace a basic textbook on epidemiologic design.Throughout the design process, registry plannersmay want to discuss options and decisions with the registry stakeholders and relevant experts to ensure that sound decisions are made. The choice ofgroups to be consulted during the design phase generally depends on the nature of the registry, the registry funding source, and the funding mechanism. Research Questions That Are Appr opriate for Registries The questions typically addressed in registries range from purely descriptive questions aimed at understanding the characteristics of people whodevelop a disease and how the disease generallyprogresses, to highl y focused questions that are intended to suppor t decisionmaking. Re gistries focused on determining clinical or cost effectiveness or assessing safety or harm are generally hypothesisdriven and concentrate on e valuating the effects of specif ic treatments on patient outcomes. Registries are often considered as alternatives to conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs).While these can be complementary research methodolo gies, some research questions are better answered by one method than the other. RCTs are generally considered to provide the highest grade evidence for e valuating w hether a dr ug has the ability to bring about an intended effect in optimal or \"ideal world\" situations, a concept also known as \"efficacy.\" 51Registries may be preferable designs for studies of ef fectiveness\u2014that is, whether a drug, device, procedure, or program in fact achieves its desired ef fect in the real w orld. This is particularly true w hen the f actors sur rounding the decision to treat are part of what is intended to be studied. 36In many situations, nonrandomized comparisons either are sufficient to address the research questionor, in some cases, may be necessary because of the following issues with randomized treatment: Equipoise : Can providers ethically introduce randomization between treatments when thetreatments are not necessarily consideredclinically equivalent? Ethics : If reasonable suspicion about the safety of a product has become known, would it beethical to conduct a trial that deliberatelyexposes patients to potential harm? Is itreasonable to subject patients to \"sham\" surgery in an effort to blind investigators to treatment? How can pregnant women be ethically exposed to drugs that may be teratogenic? (See CaseExample 4.) Practicality : Will patients enroll in a study where the y might not recei ve the treatment? How can compliance and adherence to a treatment be studied, if not by observing what people do in real-w orld situations? Registries are particularly suitable for situations where experimental research is not feasible or practical, such as: Natural history studies where the goal is to observe clinical practice and patient experience but not to introduce any intervention. Measures of clinical effectiveness, especially as related to compliance, w here the pur pose is to learn about w hat patients actuall y do and how that affects outcomes, if at all, rather than to obser ve the ef fects of products used according to a study protocol. Studies of hetero geneous patient populations, since unlike randomized trials, registries generally have much broader inclusion criteria and fe wer exclusion criteria. These characteristics lead to studies with greater generalizability (external validity). Followup for delayed or long-term benefits or harm, since re gistries can e xtend o ver much longer periods than most clinical trials (because of their generally lower costs to run and lesser burden on participants).Section I. Creating Registries Case Example 4: Assessing the Safety of Products Used During Pregnancy Description The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry is the oldest ongoing pregnancy exposure registry. This multisponsor, international collaborative registry monitors prenatal exposures to all marketed antiretroviral drugs, which include several drug classes and multiple drugs in each class. Sponsor Abbott Laboratories; Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Pfizer Compan y; Aurobindo Ltd.; & Co., Inc.; Ranbaxy, Inc. Y ear Started 1989Year Ended Ongoing No. of Sites Not site based; open to all health care providers. Over 1,200 health care pro viders have enrolled patients. No. of P atients 10,000 Challeng e Data on the terato genic ef fects of phar maceutical products is often difficult to obtain. Most clinical trials exclude pregnant women because of the ethical concerns of potentially exposing the fetus to harm. While data on the teratogenic risk isavailable from preclinical animal testing, this infor mation is not al ways predictive of the effects of a dr ug tak en during human pre gnancy. As a result, data to help patients and physicians understand the potential risk and benef its of continuing a treatment during pregnancy are often lacking. (continued) 37Chapter 3. Registry Design There is a great need for this information, as pregnant women may receive drugs for variousreasons. For example, a pregnant woman mayneed drugs to treat an illness that arises duringpregnancy or to treat a chronic mental or physicalillness. Women may also become pregnant while taking a drug, resulting in an unintended exposure.This last scenario is particularly likely, given that 50 to 60 percent of all pregnancies in the UnitedStates are unintended, and most are not recognizeduntil late in the first trimester. Antiretro viral treatments represent an area of particular concer n, as w omen may need to take the drugs during pregnancy to manage their HIV infection. In addition, these drugs can reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to the infant, but that benefit must be weighed against the possible risk of teratogenic effects. Because of these factors, it is extremel y impor tant for clinicians and patients to understand the potential risks of using antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy in order to make an informed decision. However, ethical and practical concer ns mak e a randomized trial to gather these data difficult, if not impossible. Proposed Solution In 1989, the first manufacturer of an antiretroviral drug voluntarily initiated a pregnancy exposureregistry to track outcomes of women who had usedits product during pre gnancy. The purpose of the registry is to collect information on any teratogenic effects of the product by prospectively enrolling women during the course of their pre gnanc y and following up with them to deter mine the outcome of the pregnancy. Physicians enroll a patient by providing infor mation on the pre gnanc y dates, characteristics of the HIV infection, drug dosage, length of therapy, and trimester of exposure to the antiretroviral drug. Information on the pregnancy outcome is gathered through a followup form sentto the ph ysician after the expected delivery date. In 1993, the registry expanded to include all antiretro viral dr ugs, as other manuf acturersvoluntarily joined the registry once their drugs were on the market. The registry is international inscope and allows any health care provider to enrolla patient who has intentional or unintentional useof an antiretroviral drug during pregnancy. TheU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has used this registry as a model for newpregnancy registries, now requires participation in the registry for all new and generic antiretroviraldrugs. Results Since its inception 13 y ears ago, the re gistry has provided man y lessons in ho w to monitor the safety of these dr ugs during pre gnanc y. The registry has developed processes to monitor and assess the safety of these drugs in pregnancy. To ensure both rigor and consistenc y, it has predefined analytic methods and criteria for recognizing apotential teratogenic signal. The monitoring system de veloped b y the re gistry includes se veral g roups, w hich pro vide dif ferent levels of the monitoring. The groups include: Steering Committee (comprised of all groups below). Scientific Advisory Committee (comprised of FDA, Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, National Institutes of Health, andacademic experts). Birth Defect Review Committee (comprised of representatives from the other groups). Sponsor Committee (comprised of epidemiologists and safety experts). Consultants (geneticist and pharmacoepidemiologist). Coordinating Center staff (epidemiologist, project manager, and clinical research associates). Tools for coding and classifying birth defects have been developed specifically for the registry tomaximize identification of a teratogenic signal.Case Example 4: Assessing the Safety of Products Used During Pregnancy (continued) (continued) 38 Surveillance for rare events or of rare diseases. Studies for treatments in which randomization is unethical, such as intentional exposure to potential har m (as in safety studies of mark eted products that are suspected of being harmful). Studies for which blinding is challenging or unethical (e.g., studies of surgical interventions, acupuncture). Studies of rapidly changing technology. Studies of conditions with complex treatment patterns and treatment combinations. Studies of health care access and barriers to care. Evaluation of actual standard medical practice. (See Case Example 5.) A benefit of registries is the ability to conduct embedded substudies. These substudies can ha ve various designs (e.g., highly detailed prospective data collection on a subset of registry participants, case-control study focused on either incident or prevalent cases identified within the registry). (See Case Example 6.) The re gistry can also be used as a sampling frame for randomized controlled trials. (See Case Example 7.)Section I. Creating Registries This unique system groups birth defects by etiology or embryology rather than by generallocation or category, as in the Medical Dictionaryfor Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Groupinglike defects together increases the likelihood of detecting a potential signal. Another unique aspectof this registry that aids in signal detection is coding the temporal association between timing ofexposure and formation of the birth defect. Specif ic monitoring criteria have been developed for evaluating signals at various levels, including: Individual and composite data. Primar y anal ysis (statistical considerations, including power/relative risk calculation and statistical probabilities associated withdetecting various birth defects). Complementar y data, including clinical studies in pre gnanc y, retrospecti vely reported data, other registries or epidemiological studies, published studies, and case studies. These ef forts to monitor and study the teratogenic effects of antiretroviral use during pregnancy have produced many publications. Registry data have been used in se ven publications, four abstracts, and nine presentations, and the registry design and operation ha ve been the subject of many publications and presentations. The registry data and pub lications can help to provide clinicians andpatients with information to make informed decisions regarding use of antiretroviral drugsduring pregnancy. Key Point An observational registry can collect data to answer research questions in cases where arandomized trial is not feasible for ethical or practical reasons. For pregnancy exposureregistries, the observational model allows the researchers to gather data on women and infantsexposed to products during pregnancy withoutdeliberately introducing the exposure.

The primary purpose of the registry was to evaluate outcomes in the peri- approval setting, including the use of a detailed training program for physicians not experienced in carotid artery stenting. Sponsor Cordis Cor poration Year Star ted 2004 Year Ended 2006 No. of Sites 74 No. of Patients 1,493 Challenge In 2004, the sponsor received approval for a carotid stent procedure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), largely because of theresults of the Stenting and Angioplasty With Protection in Patients at HIgh Risk for Endar terectomy (SAPPHIRE) clinical trial. The SAPPHIRE trial studied the results of stent procedures performed by experts in the field. While the trial pro vided strong data to suppor t the approval of the carotid stent, FDA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) both questioned whether the outcomes of the trial were generalizable to procedures performed byphysicians without prior experience in carotid artery stenting. To respond to FD A and CMS requests, the sponsor needed to design a study to confirm the safety and effectiveness of carotid artery stenting in a variety of settings. The study needed to gather data fromacademic and nonacademic settings, from physicians with various levels of carotid stenting experience, from settings with varying levels ofcarotid stenting volume, and from a geographicallydiverse mix of sites. The study would also need to examine the effectiveness of a training programthat the sponsor had designed to teach physicians about the stenting procedure. Proposed Solution The sponsor designed a comprehensive training program for physicians and other health care professionals. The training program, which beganin 2004, included didactic review, case obser vations and simulation training, and hands-on experience. To study the effectiveness of the training program and to provide data on the clinical safety and ef fectiveness of carotid stenting in a variety of settings, the sponsor designed and launched the registry in 2004. The registry was a multicenter, prospective, observational study designed to assess stenting outcomes in relation to the outcomes of theSAPPHIRE trial (historic comparison g roup). The study enrolled 1,493 patients from 74 sites, usinginclusion and exclusion criteria that matched those of the SAPPHIRE trial. The patients in the studywere high-surgical-risk patients with de novoatherosclerotic or postendarterectomy restenotic obstr uctive lesions in native carotid arteries. Study participants completed clinical followups at 30 days and ag ain at 1 year after the procedure. The 30-day assessments included a neurological examination by an independent neurologist and an evaluation of adv erse e vents. The study defined the 30-day major adverse event rate as the 30-day composite of all deaths, myocardial infarctions, and strokes. Results The 30-day major adverse event rate of 5.0 percent met the criteria for noninferiority to the outcomesof stented patients from the pivotal SAPPHIRE trial. Outcomes w ere similar across le vels of physician experience, carotid stent volume, geographic location, and presence/absence of theChapter 3. Registry Design (continued) 40training program. The initial findings show that a comprehensive, formal training program in carotid stenting enables physicians from multiplespecialties with varying levels of experience in carotid stenting to achieve outcomes similar tothose achieved by the experts in the clinical trial. Key Point An observational registry can provide the necessary data for a postmarket evaluation ofdevices that are dependent on newly acquired skills. The registry can provide data to assessboth the clinical safety of the device and the effectiveness and success of a training pro gram. For More Information Y adav JS, Wholey MH, Kuntz RE et al.

Creating Registries Case Example 6: Analyzing Clinical Effectiveness and ComparativeEffectiveness in an Observational Study Description The National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS) collects data on children with growth disorders who are treated with a specific growth hormone (GH).The purpose of the multicenter, observational, postmarketing surveillance registry is to collect long-term safety and efficacy information on the GH preparations, with the goal of better understanding the growth response to GH therapy. Sponsor Genentech, Inc. Year Star ted 1985 Year Ended Ongoing No. of Sites More than 500 centers ha ve participated over the life of the registry No. of Patients 47,226 Challeng e Clinical trials of GH therapy for short children without GH deficiency and without known etiology for their growth failure (idiopathic short stature, or ISS) have generally only included a small number of patients. The registration trialfor the sponsor' s GH therapy for the ISS condition was comprised of 118 children at baseline. While the trial demonstrated the ef ficacy of the treatment and an indication was obtained, physicians and f amilies had lingering concer ns about the applicability (safety and effectiveness) of the results to clinical practice. Proposed Solution To provide further safety and effectiveness data, the sponsor compared the data in the registration trial with data in the existing NCGS registry. Inthe 18-y ear period used in the analysis, theCase Example 5: Designing a Registry To Study Outcomes (continued) (continued) 41Chapter 3. Registry Design registry contained 8,018 children without GH deficiency and with no identified etiology for theirgrowth failure. The analysis team extracted thedata from these 8,018 children as a comparator tothe 118 children in the sponsor' s clinical registration trial. For the purposes of the safety analysis, the analysis team summarized all reportable adverse events,serious adverse events, and certain targetedadverse events specified by the protocol for theregistry cohort and compared these data with data from the clinical trial cohort. For the purposes ofeffectiveness, the analysis team selected children from the re gistry who matched the clinical characteristics of the trial cohort (age 5 years or older , prepubertal, maximum stimulated GH 10 ng/ml or more, no te xt repor t of contraindicating diagnosis, na\u00efve to previous therapy, and receiving a dose of GH similar to that in the clinical trial). The team found 1,721 patients who had at least 1year of treatment data reported. The teamcompared these data with the g rowth rates of the children in the re gistration trial b y year of treatment. In addition, the team perfor med an analysis to look at children in the registry younger than those in the registration trial to provide clinical data that would be useful to clinicians but could not be obtainedeasily in a clinical trial. Lastly, the teamcompleted an analysis on children in puberty, another g roup that could not be studied in the registration trial because of the confoundingvariable of the puberty group and insufficient numbers in the trial to account for this variable vs.the effect of GH alone. Results The results of these analyses using the registry data and the sponsor' s registration trial datademonstrated that ISS patients in a clinical setting had a signif icant increase in height similar to that of patients in the registration trial, with no new safety signals. Children in groups not studied inthe re gistration trial had characteristic g rowth patterns that could be used by clinicians as comparators not available from the registration trial. Finally, the lack of new safety signals fromany of the groups in the registry provided data innumbers and in y ears of e xposure to GH that could never be obtained from a small re gistration trial. Key Point A large registry can provide a resource of study subjects for focused investigations. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be designed to match those of a registration trial to provide more robust dataon outcomes and safety . For More Information Kemp SF , Kuntze J, Attie KM et al.

Creating Registries Case Example 7: Using a Registry To Recruit Patients for Clinical Trials Description The Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Research Registry is an observational registry of individuals diagnosed with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and individuals identified as Alpha-1 carriers. The objective of the registry is to serve as a resource for investigators seekingindividuals with Alpha-1 to participate in clinical trials and to promote the development of improved treatments and a cure for Alpha-1. Sponsor Alpha-1 Foundation Y ear Started 1997Y ear Ended Ongoing No. of Sites One central recruitment siteNo. of Patients 3,000 Challenge Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (Alpha-1) is a hereditary, genetic condition that can cause serious lung and/or liver disease over the life of an individual. Alpha-1 results from a lack of theprotein alpha-1 antitr ypsin (AA T) in the blood. The AAT protein, which protects the lungs from inflammation caused b y infection and inhaled irritants, is produced in the li ver. In individuals with Alpha-1, the protein is not released from the liver at the nor mal rate, resulting in both lo w blood levels of AAT and a buildup of AAT in the liver, which can lead to liver disease. Although the exact number of affected individuals is unkno wn, cur rent e vidence suggests that up to 100,000 people in the Unites States have Alpha-1, which is commonly misdiagnosed as asthma or smoking-related chronic obstr uctive pulmonar y disease. Because Alpha-1 is a hereditary, geneticcondition, the patient population is highly sensitive to confidentiality and genetic discrimination issues. To prevent these concerns from limitingAlpha-1 research, the Alpha-1 Foundation, apatient-founded and patient-run nonprofit research foundation, needed to develop a method offacilitating research while protecting patient privacy. Proposed Solution The Foundation established the registry in 1997 to promote Alpha-1 research and the development of new treatments. The registry collects data fromindividuals with Alpha-1 and those identified as carriers through a central recr uitment site. Data on the unaffected spouses of individuals with Alpha-1 is also collected for use as controls. The patient- repor ted data include a three-page enrollment questionnaire and a yearly followup questionnaire,and patients are asked to submit their latest lung function testing (FEV1) result from their physician. Individuals who agree to participate inthe re gistry also consent to be contacted re garding clinical studies for w hich the y ma y qualify . Scientif ic and medical in vestig ators are encouraged to utilize the registry as a source of patients for clinical research and as a source of demographic information on the patient population. However, the registry uses a strict process to ensure patient conf identiality . Investigators who wish to recruit through the registry must apply to a committee made up of patients, scientists, and bioethicists. If the request is approved, the registry team matches the proposed inclusion and e xclusion criteria ag ainst the registry database to identify potentially qualifying subjects. The registry team then contacts the potential subjects with information about the proposed study, usually by mail.Subjects can decide if they wish to participate and, if so, contact the study sites directl y. The registry never provides subject contact information to the investig ators. (continued) 43Results By using a model that emphasizes patient privacy and promotes research on new treatments, theregistry has collected data on over 3,000 patientsand several hundred controls. The registry has helped man y investigators with recruitment for clinical trials, and the registry has used its database to conduct research for publications onthe cost of care to patients with Alpha-1, liver disease in Alpha-1 patients, and perceptions regarding genetic discrimination. Key Point A registry can serve as a source of potential subjects for clinical trials, particularly in caseswhere the population of interest is difficult to recruit directly or through health care providers.

Registry Design Study Designs for Registries While registries are, by definition, observational studies, the framework for how the data will beanalyzed drives the data collection. Theconventional study models of cohort, case-control,and case-cohort are commonly applied to registrydata and are described briefly here. Other models that are also useful in some situations, but are notcovered here, include case-crossover studies, which are efficient designs for studying the effects ofintermittent exposures (e.g., use of erectile dysfunction drugs) on conditions with sudden onset, and quasi-experimental studies in which providersare randomized as to w hich intervention or quality improvement tools they use, but patients are observed without further intervention. Also, therehas been recent interest in applying the concept of adaptive clinical trial design to registries. Anadapti ve design has been defined as a design that allows adaptations or modif ications to some aspects of a clinical trial after its initiation withoutundermining the validity and integrity of the trial. 52 While many long-term registries are modified after initiation, appl ying the more formal aspects of adaptive trial design to registries is an interesting area for future exploration but is not covered in this chapter . Deter mining what framework will be used to analyze the data is important in designing the registry and registry data collection procedures. Readers are encouraged to consult textbooks of epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology for more infor mation. (Many of the references in Chapter 10 relate to study design and analysis.) Cohort Cohort studies follow over time a group of people who possess a characteristic to see if the y develop a particular endpoint or outcome. Cohort studies are used for descriptive studies as well as for studies seeking to e valuate comparati ve effectiveness and/or safety and quality of care. Cohort studies may include only people with exposures (such as to a particular drug or class of drugs) or disease of interest. Cohor t studies ma y also include one orCase Example 7: Using a Registry To Recruit Patients for Clinical Trials(continued) 44more comparison groups, in which data are collected using the same methods during the sameperiod. A single cohort study may, in fact, include multiple cohorts, each defined by a common disease or exposure. Cohorts may be small, such as thosefocused on rare diseases, but often they target largegroups of people (e.g., safety studies), such as allusers of a particular drug or device. Some limitations of registry-based cohort studies mayinclude limited availability of treatment data and underreporting of outcomes if a patient leaves the registry or is not adequately followed up. 53These pitfalls should be considered and addressed when planning a study. Case-Control A case-control study design may be applied in registries when one anticipates the need todetermine what proportion of persons with or without a certain outcome has or had an exposure or characteristic of interest. In a case-control design,one gathers \"cases\" of patients who have aparticular outcome or who have suffered an adverse event and \"controls\" who have not but are considered otherwise comparab le. 54This design is optimal for understanding the etiology of rare diseases.55 Depending on the outcome or e vent of interest, cases and controls ma y be identifiable within a single registry. For example, in the evaluation of restenosis after coronary angioplasty in patients with end-stage renal disease, in vestig ators identif ied both cases and controls from an institutional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty registry; in this example, controls were randomly selected from the registry and were matched by ageand gender. 56Alternatively, cases can be identified in the re gistry and controls from outside the registry. Care must be taken, however, that the controls chosen from outside the registry are derived from the same base population. Matching, w hich ensures that certain patient characteristics such as age and gender are similar in the cases and their controls, must also be planned carefully to avoid potentialconfounding (if the matching factors are associated with the exposure) and overmatching, which is an inefficient use of the data. Properly executed, a case-control design can prove highly efficient if more extensive data are collectedby the registry only for the smaller number of subjects selected for the case-control study. This design is sometimes referred to as a \"nested\" case-control study, since subjects are taken from a largercohort. Nested case-control studies have beenconducted in a wide range of patient registries, from studying the association between oral contraceptivesand various types of cancer using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program 57,58,59 to evaluating the possible association of depression with Alzheimer' s disease. As an example, in the latter case-control study design, probable cases were enrolled from an Alzheimer' s disease registry andcompared to randomly selected nondemented controls from the same base population. 60 Case-Cohort Case-cohort design is a variant of a case-control study . In traditional case-control studies, each person in the source population has a probability ofbeing selected as a control that is, ideally, in propor tion to his or her person-time contribution to the cohor t; in a case-cohor t study , however, each control has an equal probability of being sampled from the source population. 61This allows for collection of per tinent e xposure data for the subcohort and the cases only, instead of the whole cohort. For example, in a case-cohort study of histopathologic and microbiological indicators of specif ic microor ganisms in the placenta, cases consisted of e xtreme preter m inf ants with cerebral palsy. Controls, which can be thought of as a randoml y selected subcohor t of subjects at risk of the event of interest, were selected from all infants enrolled in a long-term study of preterm infants.62 The type of sampling used for controls in case- cohort studies is sometimes referred to as \"densitysampling.\" 61By way of contrast, in a traditional case-control study , control selection is not random and is af fected b y the length of followup (person- time at risk). Section I. Creating Registries 45Translating Clinical Questions Into Measurable Exposures and Outcomes The specific clinical questions of interest in a registry will guide the definitions of study subjects,exposure, and outcome measures, as well as thestudy design, data collection, and analysis. Theclinical questions of interest can be defined byreviewing published clinical information, soliciting experts' opinions, and evaluating the expressedneeds of the marketplace. Examples of research questions, key outcome and exposure variables, andsources of data are sho wn in Table 2. As these e xamples sho w, the outcomes (generall y beneficial or deleterious outcomes) are the main endpoints of interest posed in the research question.Relevant exposures also derive from the mainresearch question and relate to why a patient might experience benefit or harm. Evaluation of anexposure often includes the exposure of interest as well as information that affects or augments themain exposure, such as dose, duration of exposure, route of e xposure, or adherence. In the conte xt of registries, the ter m \"e xposure\" is used broadl y to include treatments and procedures, health care services, diseases, and conditions. Other exposures of interest include independent risk factors for the outcomes of interest (e.g., comorbidities, age), aswell as variables, known as potential confoundingvariables, that are related to both the exposure and the outcome and are necessary for clarifyinganalyses. Confounding can result in the statistical detection of a significant association between the study variables where no real association betweenthem exists. For example, in a study of asthmamedications, prior history of treatment resistanceshould be collected or else results may be biased. The bias could occur because treatment resistancemay relate both to the likelihood of receiving the new drug (meaning that doctors will be more likely to try a new drug in patients who have failed other therapies) and the likelihood of having a poorer outcome (e.g., hospitalization). Refer to Chapter 4 for a discussion of selecting data elements. Choosing Patients for Study The purpose of a registry is to provide information about a specific patient population to whom all study results are meant to apply. Studies can beconducted of people w ho share common characteristics, with or without includingcomparison groups. For example, for the purposes of evaluating patient outcomes, studies can be conducted of: Those with a particular disease/outcome or condition. (These are person focused.) Examples include studies of the occurrence of cancer or rare diseases, quality of life, utilization of health ser vices, pre gnancyChapter 3.

Those with a particular exposure. (These exposures may be to a product, procedure, orother health service.) Examples include general surveillance, pregnancy registries for particular drugexposures, and studies of exposure tomedications and devices, such as stents. 63 They also include studies of people who were treated under a quality improvementprogram, as well as studies of a particular exposure that requires controlleddistribution, such as drugs with serious safety concerns (e.g., isotretinoin, clozapine, natalizumab [Tysabri\u00ae]), where the participants in the registry are identified because of their par ticipation in a controlled distribution/risk management program. Those w ho were part of a program evaluation, disease management ef fort, or quality improvement project. An example is the evaluation of the effectiveness of evidence-based programguidelines on improving treatment. Target Population Selecting patients for re gistries can be thought of as a multistage process that begins with understandingthe target population (the population to which the findings are meant to apply, such as all patients witha disease or a common exposure) and then selecting subpopulation(s) for study. The decision aboutstudying subpopulations relates to the accessibility of people for study , the subset of those who can actuall y be identif ied and invited for study, and the actual population who participate in the study. 64 While it is desirab le for the patients w ho par ticipate in the study to be representative of the target population, it is rarely possible to study groups that are full y representati ve from a statistical sampling perspective, either for budgetary reasons or reasons of practicality. For example, it is important to consider the ethical and legal challenges of studying select, impor tant populations, such as children andfetal exposures. While the information about such sensitive subgroups is often important and relevant,it is not always reasonable to expect that it will be ethical or that study budgets will be sufficient to meet the additional requirements of institutional review boards and other oversight groups. As with any research study, very clear definitions of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are necessaryand should be clearly documented, including the rationale for these criteria. A common feature ofregistries is that they typically have few inclusion and exclusion criteria, thus enhancing theirapplicability to broader populations. These criteriawill lar gely be driven by the study objectives and any sampling strategy. For a more detailed description of target populations and theirsubpopulations, and how these choices affect generalizability and interpretation, see Chapter 10. Once the patient population has been identified, attention shifts to selecting the g roups from w hich patients will be selected (e.g., choosing theinstitutions and providers). For more information on recruiting patients and providers, see Chapter 7. Comparison Gr oups Once the tar get population has been selected and the mechanism for their identification (e.g., providers) is decided, the next decision involves determining whether to collect data on comparators (sometimes called parallel cohorts). Depending on the purpose of the registry, internal, external, or historicalgroups can be used to strengthen the understanding of whether the observed effects are real, and in fact, different from w hat would have occurred under other circumstances. Comparison groups are most useful in re gistries w here it is impor tant to distinguish between alternative decisions or to assess differences, the magnitude of differences, or the strength of associations between groups. Registries without comparison groups can be usedfor descriptive purposes, such as characterizing the natural history of a disease or condition. Although it ma y be appealing to use more than one comparison group in an effort to overcome the limitations that may result from using a singleSection I. Creating Registries 47group, multiple comparison groups pose their own challenges to the interpretation of registry results.For example, the results of comparative safety and effectiveness evaluations may differ depending on the comparison group used. Generally, it ispreferable to make judgments about the \"best\"comparison group for study during the design phaseand then concentrate resources on these selected subjects. Alternatively, sensitivity analyses can beused to test inferences against alternative reference groups to determine the robustness of the findings. (See Chapter 10.) The choice of comparison groups is more complex in registries than in clinical trials. Whereas clinical trials use randomization to try to achieve an equal (or nearly equal) distribution of known andunknown risk factors that can confound the drug- outcome association, registry studies need to usevarious design and analytic strategies to control for the confounders that the y have measured. The concern for observational studies is that people who receive a new drug or device have different risk factors for adverse events than those who chooseother treatments or receive no treatment at all. Inother words, the treatment choices are often related to demo graphic and lifestyle characteristics and the presence of coe xisting conditions. 65 Design strategies that are used frequently to assure comparability of groups relate to individualmatching of exposed patients and comparators with regard to key demographic factors, such as age and gender . Matching is also achieved by inclusion criteria that could , for e xample, restrict the registry focus to patients who have had the disease for a similar duration or are recei ving their f irst dr ug treatment for a new condition. These inclusion criteria make the patient groups more similar but add constraints to the e xternal v alidity b y def ining the target population more narrowly. Other design techniques include matching study subjects on the basis of a large number of risk factors, such as by using statistical techniques (e.g., propensity scoring)to create strata of patients with similar risks. As an example, consider a recent study of a rare side ef fect in coronar y artery sur gery for patients with acute coronary syndrome. In this instance, themain exposure of interest was the use of antifibrinolytic agents during revascularizationsurgery, a practice that had become standard for such surgeries. This practice also complicated the planned design because only the sickest patients,who were most likely to have adverse events,received alternative treatments. To address this, theinvestigators measured more than 200 covariates (by drug and by outcome) per patient and used thisinformation in a propensity analysis. The results of this large-scale observational study revealed that the traditionally accepted practice (aprotinin) was associated with serious end-organ damage and that the less expensive generic medications were safe alternatives. 66 Case-control studies present special challenges with regard to control selection. For more informationon considerations and strategies, readers areencouraged to consult an e xcellent set of papers by Wacholder . 67,68,69 An inter nal comparison g roup refers to simultaneous data collection for patients who are similar to the focus of interest (i.e., those with a particular disease or exposure in common) but whodo not have the condition or exposure of interest.For example, a re gistry might collect infor mation on patients with ar thritis w ho are using acetaminophen for pain control. An internal comparison group could be arthritis patients who are using othermedications for pain control. Data about similar patients, collected during the same calendar period and using the same data collection methods, are useful for subg roup comparisons, such as for studying the effects in certain age categories or among people with similar comorbidities. Ho wever, the information value and utility of these comparisons depend largely on having adequate sample sizes within subg roups, and such anal yses may need to be specified a priori to ensure that recruitment supports them. Internal comparisons are particularly useful because data are collected during the same obser vation period as for all study subjects, which will account for time-related influences that ma y be e xternal to the study. For example, if an impor tant scientif ic article is published that affects general clinical practice andChapter 3. Registry Design 48the publication occurs during the period in which the study is being conducted, clinical practice maychange. The effects may be comparable for groups observed during the same period through the same system, whereas information from historicalcontrols, for example, would be expected to reflectdifferent practices. An external comparison group refers to patients who are similar to the focus of interest but who do not have the condition or exposure of interest and forwhom relevant data that have been collected outside of the registry are available. For example, the SEERprogram maintains national data about cancer andhas pro vided useful comparison information for many registries. 70External comparison groups can provide informative benchmarks for understandingeffects observed as well as for assessing generalizability. Also, large clinical andadministrati ve claims databases can contribute useful infor mation on comparab le subjects for a relatively low cost. The drawback of external comparison groups is that the data are generally not collected the same way and the same informationmay not be available. In addition, plans to mergedata from other databases require the proper privacy safeguards to compl y with le gal requirements for patient data; Chapter 6 co vers patient pri vacy rules in detail. A historical comparison group refers to patients who are similar to the focus of interest but who do not have the condition or exposure of interest and for whom information was collected in the past (such as before the introduction of an e xposure or treatment or development of a condition). Historical controls may actuall y be the same patients w ho later become exposed, or they may consist of a completely different group of patients. This design provides weak e vidence because symmetr y is not assured (i.e., the patients in different time periods may not be as similar as desirable). Historical controls are susceptible to bias by changes over time in uncontrollab le, confounding risk factors, such as differences in climate, management practices, and nutrition. Bias stemming from dif ferences in measuring procedures o ver time ma y also account for observed differences. There are several situations in which conventional prospective design is impossible and historicalcontrols may be considered: When one cannot ethically continue the older practices or when physicians and/or patientsrefuse to continue old practices, thus preventingthe researcher from identifying relevant sitesusing the \"older\" practices. When conventional treatment has been consistently unsuccessful and the effect of newintervention is obvious and dramatic (e.g., firstuse of a new product for a previouslyuntreatable condition). When collecting the control data is too expensive. When the Hawthorne effect (a phenomenon that refers to changes in the behavior of subjects because the y kno w the y are being studied or observed) makes it impossible to replicate actual practice in a comparison group during the sameperiod. When the desired comparison is to usual care or \"expected\" outcomes at a population level, and data collection is too e xpensi ve because of the distribution or size of that population. Sampling Various sampling strategies can be considered. Each of these has tradeoffs in terms of validity and infor mation yield. The less representati ve the study population is of the broader target population, the more questions will be raised about the external validity of the study . In contrast, more broadl y representative studies often suffer from insufficient information in subcategories of interest. Reviewing and refining the research question can help to define an appropriate target population and a realisticstrategy for subject selection. Registry studies often restrict eligibility for entry to individuals within a cer tain range of characteristics to assure that enough meaningful information will be available for analysis. Alternatively, they may use some form of sampling: random selection,Section I. Creating Registries 49systematic sampling, or a nonrandom approach. Often-used sampling strategies include the following: Restriction (specification) : Eligibility for entry is restricted to individuals within a certain rangeof values for a confounding factor, such as age,to reduce the effect of the confounding factorwhen it cannot otherwise be controlled.Restriction limits the external validity (generalizability) to those with the sameconfounder values but maximizes the information yield for the patients under study. Probability sampling : Some form of random selection is used, and each person in the population must have a known (often equal) probability of being selected. Despite their bestintentions, humans cannot choose a sample in arandom f ashion without a for mal randomizing mechanism. Examples are: Census : A census sample includes every individual in a population or group (e.g., all known cases). A census is not feasible when the group is large relative to the costs of obtaining information from individuals. Simple random sampling : The sample is selected in such a w ay that each person has the same probability of being sampled. Stratified sampling : The group from which the sample is to be taken is first stratifiedinto subgroups on the basis of an important, related characteristic (e.g., age, parity, weight) such that each individual in a subg roup has the same probability of being included in the sample, but the probabilities for dif ferent subg roups or strata are different. Stratified random sampling assures that the different categories of the characteristic that is the basis of the strata are sufficiently represented in the sample,but the resulting data must be analyzed using more complicated statistical procedures (such as Mantel-Haenszel) inwhich the stratification is taken into account. Systematic sampling : Every nthperson in a population is sampled. Cluster (area) sampling : The population is divided into clusters, these clusters arerandomly sampled, and then some or allpatients within selected clusters are sampled. This technique is particularlyuseful in large geographic areas. Multistage sampling : Multistage sampling can include any combination of the sampling techniques described above. Nonprobability sampling : Selection is systematic or haphazard but not random. The following sampling strategies generally posemore limitations in interpreting results than those described previously but can be useful insituations where probability sampling is not feasib le. Haphazar d, convenience, volunteer, or judgmental sampling : This includes an y sampling not involving a truly random mechanism. A hallmark of this form of sampling is that the probability that a given individual will be in the sample is unknownbefore sampling. The theoretical basis forstatistical inference is lost, and the result isinevitab ly biased in unkno wn w ays. Modal instance : The most typical subject is sampled. Purposive : Several predefined groups are deliberately sampled. Expert : A panel of experts judges the representativeness of the sample or is the source that contributes subjects to a registry. Consecutive (quota) sampling : Indi viduals with a given characteristic are sampled as they are presented until enough people with that characteristic are acquired. Individual matching of cases and controls is sometimes used as a sampling strate gy for controls. Cases are matched with individual controls who have similar confounding factors, such as age, to reduce the effect of the confounding factors on the association being investigated in analytic studies.Chapter 3. Registry Design 50Patients are recruited in a fashion that accomplishes individual matching. For example, if a 69-year-old\"case\" participates in the registry, a comparator near in age will be sought. Individual matching for prospective recruitment is challenging and notcustomarily used. More often, matching is used tocreate subgroups for supplemental data collectionfor case-control studies and cohort studies when subjects are limited and/or stratification is unlikelyto provide enough subjects in each stratum for meaningful evaluation. There are a number of other sampling strategies that have arisen from survey research (e.g., snowball,hetero geneity), but they are of less relevance to registries. Finding the Necessary Data The identification of key outcome and exposure variables and patients will drive the strategy for data collection, including the choice of data sources. A key challenge to registries is that it is generally notpossib le to collect all desired data. As discussed in Chapter 4, data collection should be bothparsimonious and broadly applicable. For example, while experimental imaging studies may provideinteresting data, if the imaging technology is not widely available, the data will not be available forenough patients to be useful in analysis. Moreover, the registry findings will not be generalizable if only sophisticated centers that have that technology participate. Instead , registries focus on collecting relevant data with relatively modest burden on patients and physicians. Registry data can be obtained from patients, clinicians, medical records, and linkage with other sources (in par ticular, extant databases), depending on the available budget. (See Chapter 8.) Examples of patient data include quality of life; utilities (i.e., patient preferences); use of over-the-counter (OTC), complementary, and alternative medication; beha vioral data (e.g., smoking and alcohol use); f amily history; and biological specimens. These data have the characteristics of relying on the subjecti ve inter pretation and reporting of the patient (e.g., quality of life, utilities); beingdifficult to otherwise track (e.g., use of complementary and alternative medication, smokingand alcohol use); or being unique to the patient (e.g., biological specimens). The primary advantage of this form of data collection is that it providesdirect information from the entity that is ultimatelyof the most interest-the patient. The primarydisadvantages are that the patient is not necessarily a trained observer and that various forms of bias, suchas recall bias, may influence subjective information. For example, people may selectively recall certain exposures because they believe they have a disease that was caused by that exposure, or their recall may be influenced by recent news stories claiming cause- and-effect relations. Examples of clinician data include clinical impressions, clinical diagnoses, clinical signs,differential diagnoses, laboratory results, andstaging. The primary advantage of clinical data is that clinicians are trained obser vers. Ev en so, the primary disadvantages are that clinicians are not necessarily accurate reporters of patient perceptions, and their responses may also be subject to recallbias. Moreover, the time that busy clinicians candevote to registry data collection is often limited. Medical records also are a repositor y of clinician- derived data. Electronic medical records, w hen available, improve access to the data within medical records. As discussed further in Chapter 8, theavailability of medical records data in electronic format does not by itself guarantee consistency of terminology and coding. For example, certain data, such as data on O TC medications, smoking and alcohol use, complementary and alternative medicines, and counseling acti vities b y the clinician on lifestyle modifications, are often not consistently captured in medical records of any type. Examples of other data sources include health insurance claims, phar macy data, laboratory data, other re gistries, and national data sets, such as Medicare claims data and the National Death Index. These sources can be used to supplement re gistries with data that may otherwise be difficult to obtain, subject to recall bias, not collected because of loss to follo wup, or lik ely inaccurate b y self-repor t (e.g., in those patients with diseases affecting recall,Section I. Creating Registries 51cognition, or mental status). See Table 7 in Chapter 5 for more information on data sources. Registry Size and Duration During the registry design stage, it is critical to explicitly state how large the registry should be, howlong patients should be followed, and thejustifications for these decisions. These decisionsare based on the overall purpose of the registry. Forexample, it is usually desirable to have preciseinformation such that one can confirm or rule outthe existence of an important effect and can makepolic y or practice decisions based on evidence. Precision in measurement and estimation corresponds to the reduction of random error; it canbe impro ved by increasing the size of the study and by modifying the design of the study to increase theefficiency with which information is obtained from a given number of subjects. 71 Study size deter minations are guided b y the intended purpose of the registry and are most often tempered b y budgetary constraints. Some registries are intended to ans wer a specif ic question at a single point in time. For example, if the goal of the registry is to compare the effectiveness of atechnologically stable health intervention in typical practice with the efficacy of this interventionobtained in randomized trials (which often include a high degree of selection), then such a registry could (and, indeed, should) include a defined end at which time data collection stops. Safety studies, in contrast, usually are created with specific study sizerequirements in terms of person-years of observation, and data collection stops when the study size is achie ved or the budget runs out. Studies intended to demonstrate equivalence betw een treatments (or , say, side effect profiles that are no worse than another therapy) are designed to collect enough information so that the upper bound of a conf idence inter val around the relati ve risk or risk difference is no greater than an arbitrary, acceptable, and affordable level. At the other end of the spectrum from registries for safety and effectiveness are quality assurance and qualityimprovement registries, where the goal is to assessthe performance of the participants (e.g., physicians, hospitals). Study size requirements are often morearbitrary for such programs than for safety and effectiveness registries. For example, obtaining a reasonable degree of precision to detect differencesbetween groups of practitioners or within the samegroups over time for particular quality measuresmay drive the study size at the practice level. Registries in which the goal is to assess a healthcare practice that is changing over time (e.g., a device with multiple versions, each presumably an improvement over the last) generally seek to study as many patients as possible in order to rule out large risks, but they face limitations because the exposure pool is relatively small. A detailed discussion of the topic of sample size calculations for registries is provided in AppendixA. For the present purposes, it is sufficient tobriefl y describe some of the critical inputs to these calculations that must be pro vided b y the re gistry developers: The expected timeframe of the registry and the time intervals at which analyses of registry data will be performed. Either the size of clinically important effects (e.g., minimum clinicall y impor tant dif ferences) or the required precision associated with registry-based estimates. Whether or not the registry is intended to support regulatory decisionmaking. If the results from statistical tests of signif icance from re gistry analyses will affect regulatory action\u2014for example, the lik elihood that a product ma y be pulled from the market\u2014then the general approach to the consideration of multiple comparisons is important. In a classical calculation of sample size, the crucial inputs that must be pro vided b y the in vestig ators include either the size of clinically important effects or their required precision. For example, suppose that the primary goal of the registry is to compare surgical complication rates in general practice withthose in randomized trials. The inputs to the power calculations w ould include the complication rates from the randomized trials (e.g., 4 percent) and theChapter 3. Registry Design 52complication rate in general practice that would reflect a meaningful departure from this rate (e.g., 6percent). If, on the other hand, the goal of the registry is simply to track complication rates (and not to compare the registry with an externalstandard), then the investigators should specify therequired width of the confidence interval associatedwith those rates. For example, in a large registry, the 95-percent confidence interval for a 5-percentcomplication rate might extend from 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent. If all of the points in this confidence interval lead to the same decision, then an interval of \u00b10.5 percent is considered sufficiently precise, and this is the input required for the estimation of sample size. Specifying the above inputs to sample size calculations is a substantial matter and usually involves a combination of quantitative andqualitati ve reasoning. However, the issues involved in making this specif ication are essentiall y similar for registries and other study designs. One approach to addressing multiple comparisons in the surgical complication rate example above is touse control chart methodology, a statistical approachused in process measurement to examine theobser ved variability and deter mine w hether out-of- control conditions are occur ring. Control char t methodology is used in sample size estimation, largely for studies with repeated measurements, toadjust the sample size as needed to maintain reasonably precise estimates of confidence limits around the point estimate. Accordingly, for registries that in volve ongoing evaluation, sample size per time interval could be determined by the precision associated with the associated conf idence interval, and decision rules for identifying problems could be based on control chart methodology.Potential for Bias and External Validity The potential for bias refers to opportunities for systematic errors to influence the results.Generalizability, also known as external validity, is aconcept that refers to the utility of the inferences for the broader population that the study subjects are intended to represent. To understand how the potential for bias affects generalizability, it is usefulto consider the differences between RCTs and observational registries, since these are the twoprincipal approaches to conducting clinicall y relevant research. The strong internal validity that earns RCTs high grades for evidence comes largely from therandomization of e xposures that helps ensure that the groups receiving the different treatments are similar in all measured or unmeasured characteristics. Thus any differences in outcome(beyond those attributable to chance) can bereasonab ly attributed to differences in the efficacy or safety of the treatments. Ho wever, it is worth noting that RCTs are not without their o wn biases, as illustrated by the \"intent-to-treat\" analytic approach, in which people are considered to haveused the assigned treatment, re gardless of actual compliance. The intent-to-treat analyses can minimize a real difference, known as bias toward the null, by including the experience of people whoadhered to the recommended study product along with those who did not. Another principal dif ference betw een re gistries and RCTs is that RCTs are often focused on a relatively homo geneous pool of patients from w hich significant numbers of patients are consciously excluded at the cost of external validity\u2014that is, generalizability to the target population of disease sufferers. Registries, in contrast, focus ongeneralizability so that their population will be representati ve and relevant to decisionmakers. The strong e xternal v alidity of re gistries is achie ved by studying more heterogeneous populations. Registries are often evaluated in terms of the extent to which study subjects are representative of theSection I. Creating Registries 53target population. Therefore, registry data represent the course of disease and impact of interventions inactual practice and are likely more relevant than the data derived from the artificial constructs of the clinical trial. In fact, even though registries havemore opportunities to introduce bias (systematicerror) because of their nonexperimentalmethodology, well-designed observational studies can approximate the effects of interventions as wellas RCTs on the same topic 72,73and, in particular, in the evaluation of health care effectiveness.74 The choice of groups from which patients will be selected directly affects generalizability. Noparticular method will assure that an approach to patient recruitment is adequate, but it is worthwhile to note that the way that patients are recruited,classified, and followed can either enhance or diminish the external validity of a registry. Someexamples of how these methods of patient recruitment and follo wup can lead to systematic error follow. If the registry' s principal goal is the estimation of risk, it is possible that adverse events or patients experiencing them will be underreported if thereporter will be viewed negatively for reportingthem. It is also possib le for those collecting data to introduce bias b y misrepor ting the outcome of an intervention if they have a vested interest in doing so. This type of bias is referred to as informationbias (also called detection, observer, ascertainment, or assessment bias), and it addresses the extent to which the data that are collected are valid (represent what the y are intended to represent) and whether they are accurate. This bias arises if the outcome assessment can be interfered with, intentionall y or unintentionally. On the other hand, if the outcome is objective, such as whether or not a patient died or the results of a lab test, then the data are unlik ely to be biased. A registry may create the incentive to enroll only patients who either are at low risk of complications or are kno wn not to ha ve suf fered such complications, biasing the results of the registry toward lower event rates. Those registries for which participants deri ve some sor t of benef it fromreporting low complication rates, such as surgical registries, are at particularly high risk for this typeof bias. Another example of how patient selection methods can lead to bias is the use of volunteers, which may lead to selective participation fromsubjects most likely to perceive a benefit, distortingresults for studies of patient-reported outcomes.Enrolling patients who share a common exposure history, such as having used a drug that has beenpublicly linked to a serious adverse effect, could distort effect estimates for cohort and case-control analyses. Registries also have the potential to selectively enroll people who are at higher risk of developing serious side effects, since having a high- risk profile can motivate a patient to participate in aregistry. The term \"selection bias\" refers to situations where the procedures used to select study subjects lead toan ef fect estimate among those participating in the study that is dif ferent from the estimate that is obtainable from the target population. 75Selection bias may be introduced if certain subgroups ofpatients are routinely included or excluded from theregistry. Channeling bias, also called confoundingby indication, is a form of selection bias, where drugs with similar therapeutic indications are prescribed to g roups of patients with pro gnostic differences. 76For example, physicians may prescribe new treatments more often to those patients who have failed on traditional, first-line treatments. One approach to designing studies to address confounding b y indication is to conduct a prospective review of cases in which external reviewers are b linded as to the treatments that were employed and are asked to determine whether a particular type of therapy is indicated and to rate the overall pro gnosis for the patient.77This method of blinded prospective review was developed to supportresearch on ruptured cerebral aneurysms, a rare and serious situation. The results of the blinded review were used to create risk strata for analysis so that comparisons could be conducted only for candidates for w hom both therapies under study w ere indicated , a procedure much lik e appl ying additional inclusion and exclusion criteria in a clinical trial. Chapter 3. Registry Design 54If there is any potential for tolerance to affect the use of a product, such that only those who perceivebenefit or are free from harm continue, the recruitment of existing users rather than new users may lead to the inclusion of only those who havetolerated or benefited from the intervention andwould not necessarily capture the full spectrum ofexperience and outcomes. Selecting only existing users may introduce any number of biases, includingincidence/prevalence bias, survivorship bias, and followup bias. By enrolling new users (an inception or incidence cohort), the study is ensuring that the population will reflect all users of the product, that the longitudinal experience of all users will be captured, and that the ascertainment of theirexperience will be comparable. 78 Loss to followup or attrition threatens generalizability if there is differential loss tofollowup for people with a particular exposure or disease, w hich could substantiall y affect the conclusions and interpretation of results. As with loss to followup, attrition is generally a serious concern only when it is nonrandom (that is, whenthere are systematic differences between those wholeave or are lost and those who remain). Remaining aler t for an y source of bias is impor tant, and the v alue of a re gistry is enhanced b y its ability to provide a formal assessment of the likely magnitude of all potential sources of bias. Anyinformation that can be generated regarding nonrespondents, missing respondents, and the like, even if it is just an estimation of their raw numbers, is helpful. As with man y types of survey research, an assessment of response rate and differential patient selection can sometimes be under taken w hen key data elements are available for both registry enrollees and nonparticipants. Such analyses can easily be under taken w hen the initial data source or population pool is that of a health care organization, employer, or practice that would have access to data other than key selection criteria (e.g., demographics, comorbidities). Another tool is the use of sequential screening logs, in which all subjects fitting the inclusion criteria are enumerated and a fe w key data elements are recorded for all those w ho are screened. This technique allows quantitative analysis of nonpar ticipants and assessments of theeffects, if any, on representativeness. Another technique, although not as rigorous as quantitativeapproaches, is to obtain an informed opinion of how the sample obtained is likely to differ from a true probability sample and why it is likely to differ. Solong as this assessment is made explicitly, usershave a framework for drawing their ownconclusions. Accordingly, two items that can be reported to help the user assess generalizability are a description ofthe criteria used to select registry sites and the characteristics of these sites, particularly thosecharacteristics that might have an impact on thepurpose of the registry. For example, if a registry for the purpose of assessing adherence to lipid screening guidelines requires that its sites have asophisticated electronic medical record in order to collect data, it will probably report better adherencethan usual practice because this same electronicmedical record f acilitates the generation of real-time reminders to engage in screening. In this case, a report of rates of adherence to other screening guidelines (for which there were no reminders),even if these are outside the direct scope of inquiry,would provide some insight as to the degree of overestimation. Finally, and most impor tantly, whether or not study subjects need to be evaluated on their representativeness depends on the purpose and kindof inference needed. For example, for understanding biological effects, it is not necessary to sample in propor tion to the underlying distrib ution in the population. It is more impor tant to demonstrate to the stakeholders the degree to which patients w ho are included in a re gistry are representative of the population from which they were derived. Summary In summary, the key points to consider in designing a registry include study design, data sources, patient selection criteria, comparison g roups, sampling strategies, considerations of possible sources of bias, and w ays to address them to the e xtent that is practical and achievable.Section I. Creating Registries 55Selection of data elements for a registry requires a balancing of potentially competing considerations.These considerations include the importance of thedata elements to the integrity of the registry, theirreliability, their necessity for the analysis of theprimary outcomes, their contribution to the overallresponse burden, and the incremental costs associated with their collection. Registries are generally designed for a specific purpose, and dataelements that are not critical to the successful execution of the registry or to the core planned analyses should not be collected unless there areexplicit plans for their analysis. The selection of data elements for a registry begins with the identification of the domains that must bequantified to accomplish the registry purpose. The specif ic data elements can then be selected , with consideration given to clinical data standards, common data definitions, and the use of patientidentif iers. Ne xt, the data element list can be refined to include only those elements that are necessary for the registry purpose. Once theselected elements have been incorporated into a data collection tool, the tool can be pilot tested toidentify potential issues, such as the time required tocomplete the form, data that may be more difficultto access than realized during the design phase, and practical issues in data quality (such as appropriate range checks). This infor mation can be used to modify the data elements and reach a final set of elements. Identifying Domains Registry design requires an explicit articulation of the goals of the re gistry and a close collaboration among disciplines, such as epidemiology, statistics, and clinical specialists. Once the goals of the study are determined, the domains most likely to influencethe desired outcomes must be defined. Registries generall y include personal, e xposure, and outcomes information. The personal domain consists of datathat describe the patient, such as information on patient demographics, medical history, health status,and any necessary patient identifiers. The exposuredomain describes the patient' s experience with theproduct, disease, device, or service of interest to theregistry. Exposure can also include other treatmentsthat are known to influence outcome but are not necessarily the focus of the study, so that their confounding influence can be adjusted for in theplanned analyses. The outcomes domain collects information on the patient outcomes that are of interest to the registry; this domain should includeboth the primar y endpoints and any secondary endpoints that are part of the overall registry goals. In addition to the goals and desired outcomes, it is necessary to consider the need to create important subsets w hen def ining the domains. Measuring potential confounding factors (variables that are linked with both the exposure and outcome) shouldbe tak en into account in this stage of re gistry development. Collecting data on potential confounders will allow for analytic or designcontrol. (See Chapters 3 and 10.) Understanding the time reference for all v ariables that can change over time is critical in order to distinguish cause-and-ef fect relationships. For example, a drug taken after an outcome is observedcannot possibly have contributed to the development of that outcome. Time reference periods can be addressed by including start and stop dates for variables that can change; they can also be addressed categorically, as is done in some quality impro vement registries. For example, the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry organized its patient-le vel infor mation into cate gories to reflect the timeframe of the stroke event from onset through treatment to followup. In this case, the domains w ere cate gorized as prehospital, emer gency evaluation and treatment, and treatment, discharge information, and postdischarge followup. 79Chapter 4. Data Elements for Registries 56Selecting Data Elements Once the domains have been identified, the process of selecting data elements begins with theidentification of the data elements that best quantifythat domain and the source(s) from which those dataelements can be collected. When selecting dataelements, gaining consensus among the registry stakeholders is important, but this must be achievedwithout undermining the purpose of the registry by including elements solely to please a stakeholder.Each data element should suppor t the purpose of the registry and answer a specific scientific question or address a specific issue or need. The most effectiveway to select data elements is to start with the study purpose and objective and then decide what types of measurements or calculations will be needed to analyze that objective. Once the plan of analysis isclear, it is possible to work backward into the dataelements necessar y to implement that analysis plan. This process k eeps the g roup focused on the re gistry purpose and limits the number of e xtraneous (\"nice to know\") data elements that may be included. 80 (See Case Example 8.) The data element selection process can be simplified if clinical data standards for a disease area e xist. Currently there are few, if any, consensus or broadly accepted sets of standard data elements and data definitions for most disease areas. Thus, different studies of the same disease state may use different definitions for fundamental concepts, such as the diagnosis of myocardial infarction or the definition of worsening renal function. To address this problem and to support more consistent data elements so that comparisons across studies can be more easil y accomplished , some specialty societies are beginning to compile clinical data standards. For example, the American College of Cardiology has created clinical data standards for acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, and atrialfibrillation. 81,82,83The use of established data standards, when available, is essential so that registries can maximally contribute to evolvingmedical knowledge. Section I. Creating Registries Case Example 8: Selecting Data Elements for a Registry Description The Dosing and Outcomes Study of Erythropoiesis-stimulating Therapies (DOSE) Registry is designed to understand current anemia management patterns and clinical, economic, and patient-reported outcomes in oncology patients treated in various outpatient oncology practice settings across the United States. The prospective design of the DOSE Registry enables the capture of data from oncolo gy patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating therapies. Sponsor Ortho Biotech Clinical Affairs, LLC Y ear Started 2003 Year Ended Ongoing No. of Sites 62 No. of Patients Over 1,500 Challenge Epoetin alf a was approved for patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia in 1994. In 2002, the U .S. Food and Drug Administration approved a second er ythropoiesis-stimulating therap y (EST), darbepoetin alfa, for a similar indication. While multiple clinical trials described outcomes following intervention with ESTs, littleinformation was available on real-world practice patterns and outcomes in oncology patients. To gain this information, the registry teamdeter mined that a prospective observational effectiveness study in this therapeutic area was needed. The three key challenges were to make the study representative of real-world practices and settings (e.g., hospital-based clinics, community oncology clinics); to collect dataelements that were straightforward to minimize (continued) 57Chapter 4. Data Elements for Registries potential data collection errors; and to collect sufficient data to study effectiveness whileensuring that the data collection remained feasibleand time efficient for outpatient oncology clinics. Proposed Solution The registry team began selecting data elements by completing a thorough literature review. Becausethis would be one of the first prospective observational studies in this therapeutic area, the team wanted to ensure that study results could bepresented to health care professionals and decisionmakers in a manner consistent with clinical trials. The team also intended to make the data reports from the study comparable with other study repor ts. To meet these objecti ves, data elements (e.g., baseline demographics, dosing patterns, hemoglobin levels) similar to those in clinical trials w ere selected w henever possible. For the patient-repor ted outcomes component of the registry, the team incorporated standard, validated instruments. This decision allowed theteam to avoid developing and validating newinstruments and supported consistency withclinical trial literature, as man y trials had incorporated these instruments. The team selected two instr uments, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT -An) tool and the Linear Analo g Scale Assessment (LASA) tool, to gather patient-reported data. The FACT -An tool, developed from the F ACT-General scale, w as previously designed and validated to measure the impact of anemia in cancer patients. The LASA tool measures quality of life by having patients rate their energy level, activity level, and overall qualityof life on a scale of zero to 100. Both tools are commonl y used to gather patient-reported outcomes data for cancer patients. Following the literature review, an advisory board was convened to discuss the registry objectives, data elements, and study execution. The advisory board included representatives from the nursingand medical professions. The multidisciplinary board pro vided insights on both the practical andclinical aspects of the registry procedures and data elements. Throughout the entire process, theregistry team remained focused on both the overallregistry objectives and user-friendly data collection. In particular, the team worked to makeeach question clear and unambiguous in order to minimize confusion and to enable a variety of site personnel to complete the registry data collection. Results The registry launched in 2003 as one of the first prospective observational effectiveness studies in this therapeutic area. To date, 62 sites and over 1,500 patients have enrolled in the study, with a target accrual of 2,000 patients. The sites participating in the re gistry represent a wide geographic distribution and a mixture of practice settings. Key Point Use of common data elements, guided b y a literature review, and validated instruments helps to make the registry data more generalizable, aswell as more comparable with trial data. A multidisciplinary advisory board can also helpensure collection of key data elements in anappropriate manner from both a clinical and practical standpoint.

Blood 2006;108:953a.Case Example 8: Selecting Data Elements for a Registry (continued) 58Although clinical data standards are important to allow comparisons between studies, there is aconcern that overlapping standards may be developed. To consolidate and align standards that have been developed for clinical research, theClinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium(CDISC) initiated work on the Biomedical ResearchIntegrated Domain Group (BRIDG) model, a domain-analysis model representing biomedical andclinical research. Other groups, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Health Level Seven (HL7), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, have joined this effort. In 2005, the HL7 Regulated Clinical Research Information Management Technical Committee adopted BRIDG as theirdomain-analysis model. The purpose of the project is to pro vide an overarching model that can be used to har monize standards betw een the clinical research domain and the health care domain. As development continues on this model, CDISC and NCI have made the BRIDG model freely available to the public as part of an open-source project atwww .bridgproject.or g. It is hoped that the BRIDG model, when completed, will guide registry creators in selecting approaches that will enable their registry data to be compared with other clinical data. 84,85 In cases w here clinical data standards for the disease area do not exist, established data sets may be widely used in the field. For example, United Netw ork of Or gan Sharing (UNOS) collects a large amount of data on organ transplant patients. Creators of a registry in the transplant field should consider aligning their data definitions and data element formats with those of UNOS to simplify thetraining and data abstraction process for sites. Other e xamples of widely used data sets are the Joint Commission (for merly JCAHO) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data elements for hospital data submission programs. These data sets cover a range ofprocedures and diseases, from heart failure and acute myocardial infarction to pregnancy and surgical infection prevention. Hospital-basedregistries that collect data on these conditions may want to align their data sets with the JointCommission and CMS. However, one limitation of tying elements and definitions to another datacollection program rather than a fixed standard is that these programs may change their elements or definitions. With Joint Commission core measureelements, for example, this has occurred with somefrequency. If clinical data standards for the disease area and established data sets do not exist, it is still possible to incorporate standard terminology into a registry.This will make it easier to compare the data with the data of other registries and reduce the training anddata abstraction burden on sites. Some examples ofstandard systems used to classify impor tant data elements are listed in Table 3. 86 After investigating clinical data standards, registry planners may find that there are no useful standards or estab lished data sets for the re gistry, or that these standards comprise only a small portion of the data set. In these cases, the re gistry will need to define and select data elements with the guidance of itsproject team, which may include an advisory board. When selecting data elements, it is often helpful to gather input from statisticians, epidemiologists,psychometricians, and experts in health outcomesassessment w ho will be anal yzing the data, as the y may notice potential anal ysis issues that need to be considered at the time of data element selection. Data elements may also be selected based on performance or quality measures in a clinical area. (See Case Example 9.) When beginning the process of defining and selecting data elements, it can be useful to star t by considering the registry design. Since many registries are longitudinal, sites often collect data at multiple visits. In these cases, it is necessary to determine which data elements can be collectedonce and which data elements should be collected at every visit. Data elements that can be collected once are often collected at the baseline visit. Inother cases, the registry may be collecting data at an event le vel, so all of the data elements will be collected during the course of the event rather than in separate visits. In considering when to collect a data element, it is also impor tant to deter mine the most appropriate order of data collection. DataSection I. Creating Registries 59Chapter 4.

Creating Registries Case Example 9: Using Performance Measures To Develop a Data Set Description Get With The GuidelinesSM (GWTG) is the flagship program for in-hospital quality improvement of the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA). The program uses the experience of the AHA/ASA to ensure the care that hospitals provide for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke is aligned with the latest evidence-based guidelines. Sponsor American Stroke AssociationY ear Started 2003Y ear Ended Ongoing No. of Sites 890No. of Patients 348,917 Challenge The primary purpose of the program is to improve the quality of in-hospital care for strok e patients. The pro gram uses the PDSA (Plan, Do, Study , Act) quality impro vement cycle, in which hospitals plan quality improvement initiatives, implement them,study the results, and then mak e adjustments to the initiati ves. To help hospitals implement this cycle, the program uses a registry to collect data on stroke patients and generate real-time repor ts sho wing compliance with a set of standardized strok e performance and quality measures. The reports also include benchmarking capabilities, enab ling hospitals to compare themselv es with other hospitals at a national and regional level, as well as with similar hospitals. In developing the registry, the team faced the challenge of creating a data set that would becomprehensive enough to satisfy evidence-basedmedicine but manageable by hospitals participating in the program. The program does not providereimbursements to hospitals entering data, so itneeded to keep the data set as small as possiblewhile still maintaining the ability to measure qualityimprovement. Proposed Solution The team began developing the data set by working backward from the performance measures.Performance measures, based on the sponsor' sguidelines for stroke care, contain detailed inclusionand e xclusion criteria to determine the measure population, and they group patients into the denominator and numerator groups. Using these criteria, the team developed a data set that askedonly the questions necessary to determinecompliance with each of the guidelines. The team then added a fe w additional questions to g ather information on the patient population characteristics. Results By using this approach, the registry team was able to create the minimum necessary data set formeasuring compliance with strok e guidelines. The program launched in 2003 and no w has 890 hospitals and over 345,000 patient records. The data from the program have been used in several abstracts and publications and have confirmed quality improvement in participating hospitals. Key Point Registry teams should focus on the outcomes or endpoints of interest when selecting data elements. In cases where compliance with guidelines or quality measures is the outcome of interest, teams can work backward from the guidelines or measuresto develop the minimum necessary data set for their registry. (continued) 61elements that are related to each other in time (e.g., dietary information and a fasting blood sample forglucose or lipids) should be collected in the samevisit rather than in different visit case report forms. International physician and patient participation may be required to meet cer tain registry data objectives. In such situations, it is desirab le to consider the international par ticipation in the conte xt of data element selection, especially if it will be necessary to collect and compare data from individual countries. Examination and laboratory test resultsor units ma y differ among countries, and standardization of data elements may become necessar y at the data-entry level. Data elements relating to cost-effectiveness studies may be particularly challenging, since there is substantial variation among countries in practice and the costs of medical \"inputs,\" relating largely to differences in national or re gional co verage practices and national health policies. Alternatively, if capture of internationally standardized data elements is not desirable or cannot be achieved, registry stakeholders should consider provisions to capturedata elements according to local standards. Later,separate data conversions and merging outside the database for uniform reporting or comparison ofdata elements captured in multiple countries can be evaluated and performed as needed if the study design ensures that all data necessary for suchconversions have been collected. Table 4 provides a listing of sample baseline data elements. These elements will vary depending onthe design, nature, and goals of the registry. Examples listed include patient identifiers (e.g., forlinkage to other databases), contact information (e.g., for telephone followup), and residencelocation of enrollee (e.g., for geographiccomparisons). Other administrati ve data elements that may be collected include the source of enrollment, enrollee sociodemographiccharacteristics, and information on provider locations. Depending on the purpose of a registry, other sets of data elements ma y be required (T able 5). In addition, data elements needed for specif ic types of registries are outlined below. For registries examining questions of safety for drugs, vaccines, procedures, or devices, keyinformation includes history of the exposure anddata elements that will per mit anal ysis of potential confounding f actors that ma y affect observed outcomes, such as enrollee characteristics (e.g., comorbidities, concomitanttherapies, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, environmental and social f actors) and pro vider characteristics. For drug exposures, data on use (start and stop dates), as w ell as pro viding continuing evidence that the drug was actually used (data on medication persistence and/or adherence), may be important. In some instances, it is also useful to record reasons fordiscontinuation. For registries examining questions of effectiveness and cost effectiveness, key information includes the history of exposure and data elements that will per mit analysis ofChapter 4.

In addition to those mentioned abo ve for safety, these may include individual beha viors and pro vider and/or system characteristics. For assessment of cost effectiveness, information may be recorded on the financial and economic burden of illness,such as of fice visits, visits to urgent care or the emer gency room, and hospitalizations, including length of sta y. For some studies, a quality-of- life instrument that can be analyzed to provide quality-adjusted life years (QAL Ys) or similar comparati ve data across conditions ma y be used. For registries assessing quality of care and quality impro vement, data that categorize and possibly differentiate among the services provided (e.g., equipment, training or experience level of providers, type of health care system) may be sought, as well as information that identifies individual patients as potential candidates for the treatment. In addition, self-reported data are valuable to assess the patients' perception of quality of care. For registries e xamining the natural histor y of a condition, the selection of data elements would be similar to that for effectiveness registries.If one goal of a registry is to identify patient subsets that are at higher risk for particular outcomes, more detailed infor mation on patient and provider characteristics should be collected. This information may be important in registries that lookat the usage of a procedure or treatment. Qualityimprovement registries also use this information to understand ho w improvement differs across many types of institutions. When selecting patient identif iers, there are a variety of options, including using the patient' s name, date of birth, and Social Security Number (orsome combination thereof), that are subject to le gal and security considerations. When the planned analyses require linkage to other data (such as medical records), more specific patient information may be needed. In selecting patient identifiers,some thought should be given to the possibility that patient identif iers ma y change during the course of the re gistry. For example, female patients may change their name during the course of the registry, and patients ma y mo ve or change their telephone number. Patient identifiers can also be inaccurate because of intentional falsification by the patient (e.g., for privacy reasons in a sexually transmitted disease registry), unintentional misreporting by thepatient or a parent (e.g., wrong date of birth), or 63Chapter 4.

In these cases, having more than one patient identifier for linkingpatient records can be invaluable. In addition, identifier needs will differ based on the registry goals. For example, a registry that tracks childrenwill need identifiers related to the parents, andregistries that are likely to include twins (e.g.,immunization registries) should plan for the duplication of birth dates and other identifiers. Inselecting patient identifiers for use in a registry, registry planners will need to determine what data are necessary for their purpose and plan for potential inaccurate and changing data. Generall y, patient identifiers can simplify the process of identifying patients and tracking patients for followup. Patient identifiers also allow for the possibility of identifying patients who are lost to followup due to death (i.e., through the NationalDeath Inde x) and linking to birth certificates for studies in children. In addition, unique patientidentifiers allow for analysis to remove duplicate patients. When considering the advantages of patient identifiers, it is important to take into account thepotential barriers that patient identifiers can present.Obtaining consent for the use of patient-identif iable infor mation can be an obstacle to enrollment, as it can lead to the refusal of patients to participate. Chapter 6 contains more information on the ethicaland legal considerations of using patient identifiers. In addition to the data points related to primar y and secondary outcomes, it is important to plan for patients w ho will lea ve the re gistry. While the intention of a registry is generally for all patients to remain in the study until planned followup is completed, planning for patients to leave the study before completion of full followup may reduceanalysis problems. By designing a final study visit form, registry planners can more clearly document when losses to follo wup occurred and possibly collect important information about why patients left the study . Not all re gistries will need a study discontinuation form, as some studies collect data on the patient only once and do not include followup infor mation (e.g., in-hospital procedure registries).Creating explicit data definitions for each variable to be collected is essential to the process ofselecting data elements. This is important to ensure internal validity of the proposed study so that all participants in data collection are acquiring therequisite information in the same reproducible way.(See Chapter 8.) The data definitions should alsoinclude the ranges and acceptable values for each individual data element, as well as the potentialinterplay of different data elements. For example, logic checks for the validity of data capture may be created for data elements that should be mutually exclusive. When deciding on data def initions, it is important to determine which data elements are required and which elements may be optional. This isparticularly true in cases where the registry may collect a few additional \"nice to know\" dataelements. Consideration should also be gi ven to how to account for missing or unkno wn data. In some cases, a data element may be unknown or not documented for a particular patient, and followup with the patient to answer the question may not bepossible. Including an option on the form for \"notdocumented\" or \"unknown\" will allow the person completing the case repor t form to pro vide a response to each question rather than lea ving it blank. Depending on the analysis plans for the registry, the distinction between undocumented data and missing data may be important. When collecting data for patient outcomes analysis, it is impor tant to use patient-centered outcomes that are v alid, reliable, responsive, interpretable, and translatable. Patient-centered outcomes reflect the patients' perceptions of their status and their perspective on health and disease. Patient-centered outcomes have become an increasingly important avenue of in vestig ation, par ticularl y in light of the recent Institute of Medicine report calling for a more patient-centered health care system. 87 Among the most important patient-centered outcome to quantify is health status. Health status includes the manifestations of a disease\u2014itssymptoms; the degree to which a disease limits patients ph ysicall y, emotionall y, and sociall y; and the impact on patients' quality of life\u2014as seen byChapter 4. Data Elements for Registries 66the patient. There are several methods for quantifying patients' health status, including the useof generic, disease-specific, and utility measures. Generic health status and utility measures seek to quantify the overall status of a patient' s health.Whereas generic health status measures often haveseveral domains, 88utility measures distill patients' health to a single value between 0 (indicating death) and 1.0 (indicating perfect health) that can be usedin economic analyses. 89,90,91,92In contrast to these approaches that seek to quantify the overall effects of patients' health on their health status, disease- specific measures focus on the specific symptoms, limitations, and quality-of-life impairment associated with a particular disease.93Because of the more narrow focus of disease-specificinstruments, they are often more sensitive to clinical change 94,95,96and \"actionab le\" b y physicians who are familiar with the clinicall y oriented domains assessed b y these instr uments.97 Prior to their use, however, patient-centered health status measures need to have appropriate psychometric characteristics. There are at least fivekey attributes that a health status measure shoulddemonstrate prior to its incorporation into a clinical study or re gistry. Rele vant attrib utes of a potential instrument (T include its v alidity , reliability , responsi veness to change, interpretability, and the availability of translations in other languages. 98 Often, explicit demonstration of these properties prior to the initial use of the instr ument is needed to be sure that the results are meaningful. When no instr ument e xists and a new one needs to be developed, a series of methodological studies should be perfor med to ensure that the instr ument meets these requisite qualities prior to investing in it for a larger study. While several resources exist for creating ne w measures, clearinghouses for previously created measures and the literature should be carefully searched before embarking on the lengthy and challenging process of new measure creation. (See Case Examples 10 and 11.) Registry Data Map Once data elements have been selected, a data map should be created. The data map identifies allsources of data (Chapter 5) and explains how thesources of data will be integrated. Data maps areuseful to defend the validity and/or reliability of the data, and they are typically an integral part of thedata management plan (Chapter 8). Pilot Testing After the data elements have been selected and the data map created, it is important to pilot test the datacollection tools to determine the time needed tocomplete the form and the resultingsubject/abstractor b urden. F or example, through pilot testing, registry planners might determine that it is wise to collect certain highly burdensome (or \"nice to kno w\") data elements in onl y a subset of participating sites (nested registry) that agree to the more intensi ve data collection, so as not to endanger participation in the re gistry as a w hole. Pilot testing should also help to identify the missing data rate and any validity issues with the data collectionsystem. The burden of form collection is a major factor deter mining a registry' s success or failure, with major implications for the cost of par ticipation and for the o verall acceptance of the registry by hospitals and health care personnel. Moreover,knowing the anticipated time needed for patient recruitment/enrollment will allow better communication to potential sites of the scope and magnitude of commitment required to participate inthe study. Registries that obtain information directly from patients have an additional issue of participant burden, with the potential for participant fatigue,leading to f ailure to answer all items in the registry. Highly burdensome questions can be collected in a prespecif ied subset of subjects. The purpose of these added questions should be carefully considered w hen deter mining the subset so that useful and accurate conclusions can be achieved. Pilot testing the registry also allows the opportunity to identify issues and mak e refinements in the registry data collection tool, including alterations inSection I.

Se xual dysfunction includes both erectile dysfunction (ED) and ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD), and health care providers treating patients with symptoms of BPH should evaluate men forboth types of dysfunction. Providers can use the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ), avalidated, self-administered, sexual function scaleto assess dysfunction, but the 25-item scale can be perceived as too long. To assess EjD moreefficiently, it was necessary to develop a brief, patient-administered , validated questionnaire. Proposed Solution The team used representati ve, population-based samples to develop a short-form scale for assessing EjD. The team administered the 25-item MSHQ to three populations: a sample of men from theMen' s Sexual Health Population Survey, a subsample of men from the Urban Men' s Health Study , and a sample of men enrolled in the observational registry. Using the data from the sample populations, the team conducted a series of analyses to develop thescale. The team used factor analysis to help select the items from the scale that had the highest correlations with the principal f actors. Using conventional validation, the team examined reliability (both inter nal consistenc y and test-retest repeatability). To assess validity, tests of repeatability and discriminant/convergent validity were used to determine that the short form successfully discriminated between men with no tomild LUTS/BPH and those with moderate to severe LUTS/BPH. Lastly, the team examined the correlation betw een the 7-item ejaculation domain of the 25-item MSHQ and the new short-form scale using data from the obser vational re gistry. (continued) 68Section I. Creating Registries Case Example 11: Understanding the Needs and Goals of the RegistryParticipants Description The Prospective Registry Evaluating Myocardial Infarction:Events and Recovery (PREMIER) studied the health status of patients for 1 year after discharge for a myocardial infarction. The registry focused on developing a rich understanding of the patients' symptoms, functional status, and quality of life by collecting extensive baseline data in the hospital and completing followup interviews at 1, 6, and 12 months. Sponsor CV Therapeutics and CV Outcomes Y ear Started 2003Y ear Ended 2004No. of Sites 19 No. of Patients 2,498 Challeng e With the significant advances in myocardial infarction (MI) care over the past 20 years, many studies have documented the improved mortality and morbidity associated with these new treatments. These studies typically have focusedon in-hospital care, with little to no followup component. As a result, information on the transition from inpatient to outpatient care w as lacking, as were data on health status outcomes. PREMIER was designed to address these gaps by collecting detailed information on MI patients during the hospital stay and through followuptelephone interviews conducted at 1, 6, and 12 months. The goal of the re gistry was to provide a rich understanding of patients' health status (their symptoms, function, and quality of life) 1 year after an acute MI. The re gistry also proposed toResults Based on the results of these analyses, the team selected three ejaculatory function items and oneejaculation bother item for inclusion in the newMSHQ-EjD Short Form. The new scaledemonstrates a high degree of internal consistency and reliability, and it providesinformation to identify men with no to mild LUTS/BPH and those with moderate to severe LUTS/BPH. Key Point Developing new instruments for collecting patient-repor ted outcomes requires careful testing of the new tool in representative populations toensure validity and reliability. Registries can provide a large sample population for validating new instruments. For More Information Althof SE, Rosen RC, Catania J et al.

To develop the registry data set, the team began by clearly defining the phases of care and recoveryand identifying the clinical characteristics thatwere important in each of these phases. Theseincluded patient characteristics upon hospital arrival, details on inpatient care, and details on outpatient care. The team felt that information oneach of these phases w as necessar y, since the variability of an y outcome o ver 1 y ear may be explained by patient, inpatient treatment, or outpatient factors. Health status also includesmany determinants beyond the clinical status of disease, such as access to care, socioeconomicstatus, and social support; the registry needed to collect these additional data in order to understand fully the health status outcomes. Proposed Solution While re gistries often tr y to include as many eligib le patients and sites as possib le by reducing the burden of data entry, this registry took an alternative approach. The team designed a data setthat included over 650 baseline data elements and over 200 followup interview-assessed data elements. Instead of allowing retrospective chartabstraction, the registry required hospitals to complete a f ive-page patient interview while the patient was in the hospital. The registry demanded significant resources from the participating sites. For each patient, the re gistry required about 4 hours of time, with 15 minutes for screening, 2 hours for chart abstraction, 45 minutes for interviews, 45 minutes for data entry, and 15 minutes of a cardiologist' s time to interpret the electrocardiograms and angiograms. A detailed, prespecified sampling plan was developed by eachsite and approved by the data coordinating center to ensure that the patients enrolled at each centerwere representative of all of the patients seen by that site. The registry team developed this extremely detailed data set and data collection process through extensive consultations with the registry participants. The coordinators and steeringcommittees reviewed the data set multiple times,with some sites giving extensive feedback.Throughout the development process, there was anongoing dialo g among the re gistry designers, the steering committee, and the re gistry sites. The re gistry team also used standard def initions and established instruments whenever possible to enable the registry data to be cross-referenced to other studies and to minimize the training b urden. The team used the American College ofCardiolo gy Data Standards for Acute Coronar y Syndromes for data def initions of an y overlapping fields. To measure other areas of the patient experience, the team used the Patient Health Questionnaire to e xamine depression, the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory to measure social suppor t, the Short Form-12 to quantify overall mental and physical health, and the SeattleAngina Questionnaire (SAQ) to understand the patients' perspecti ve on ho w coronary disease affects their life. Results The data collection burden posed some challenges. Two of the 19 sites dropped out of the registryearly on. Two other sites fell behind on their chart abstractions. Turnover of personnel and multiple commitments at par ticipating sites also dela yed the study. Despite these challenges, the registry experienced very little loss of enthusiasm or loss of sites once it was up and running. The remaining 17 sitesChapter 4.

Piloting may alsouncover problems in registry logistics, such as the ability to accurately or comprehensively identify subjects for inclusion. A fundamental aspect of pilot testing is evaluation of the accuracy and completeness of registry questionsand the comprehensiveness of both instructionalmaterials and training in addressing these potential issues. Missing data may cause bias and result ininaccurate or misleading conclusions. For example, time points, such as time to radiologic interpretationof imaging test, may be difficult to obtainretrospecti vely, and their presence in hospital charting may occur more frequently when the time span is short, making it difficult to evaluateassociation between time and various clinical or demographic factors. Pilot testing ranges in practice from ad hoc assessments of the f ace v alidity of instruments and materials in clinical sites, to trial r uns of the re gistry in small numbers of sites, to highly structured evaluations of inter-rater agreement. The level of pilot testing is determined by multiple factors.Accuracy of data entry is a key criterion to evaluateduring the pilot phase of the re gistry. When a \"gold standard\" e xists, the le vel of ag reement with a reference standard (construct validity) may be measured. 99Data collected by seasoned abstractors or auditors following strict operational criteria can serve as the gold standard on which to judge accurac y of abstraction for chart-based registries.100 In instances w here no reference standard is available, reproducibility of responses to registry elements b y abstractors (inter -rater reliability) or test-retest agreement of subject responses may be assessed.101Reliability and/or validity of data elements should be tested in the pilot phase whenever the element is collected in newpopulations or for new applications. Similar mechanisms to those used during the pilot phase can be used during data quality assurance (Chapter 8). Kappa statistic is a measure of how much the level of agreement between two observers exceeds the amount of ag reement e xpected b y chance alone. It is the most common method for measuringSection I. Creating Registries completed the registry and collected data on nearly 2,500 patients. In return for this datacollection, sites enjoyed the academicproductivity and collaborative nature of the study. The data coordinating center created a Web sitethat offered private groups for the principal investigators, so each investigator had access to all of the abstract ideas and all of the researchthat was being done. This structure provided nurturing and support for the investigators, andthey viewed the registry as a way to engagethemselves and their institution in research with a prominent, highl y respected team. On the patient side, the registry met followup goals. Over 85 percent of patients completed a 1-month follo wup inter view, and 87 percent of surviving patients completed at least part of their 6-month followup interview. The registry teamattrib uted this follo wup rate to the strong rapport that the inter viewers de veloped with the patients during the course of the followup period. Key Point This e xample illustrates that there is no maximum or minimum number of data elements for asuccessful registry. Instead, a registry can bestachieve its goals by ensuring that sufficient information is collected to achieve the purpose of the registry while remaining feasible for theparticipants. An open, ongoing dialog with the participants or a subgroup of participants can help to determine what is feasible for a particular registry and to ensure that the registry will retain the par ticipants for the life of the study .

Intra- class correlation coefficient, or inter-rater reliabilitycoefficient, provides information on the degree of agreement for continuous data. It is a proportion that ranges from zero to one. Item-specificagreement represents the highest standard forregistries; it has been employed in cancer registriesand to assess the quality of data in statewide stroke registries. Other methods, such as the Bland andAltman method, 102may also be chosen, depending upon the type of data and registry purpose. Overall, the choice of data elements should be guided by parsimony, validity, and consistent focuson achie ving the purpose for which the registry was created.Chapter 4. Data Elements for Registries 73Identification and evaluation of suitable data sources should be done within the context of the registrypurpose and availability of the data of interest. Asingle registry may have multiple purposes andintegrate data from various sources. When peoplethink of clinical registries, they typically think ofdata collected directly for registry purposes (primary data collection). However, this is not the only option, as important information can betransferred into the registry from existing databases. Examples include demographic information from a hospital admission, discharge, and transfer system;medication use from a phar macy database; and disease and treatment information, such as details ofthe coronary anatomy and percutaneous coronaryintervention from a (catheterization) laboratory infor mation system, electronic medical record , or medical claims databases. In addition, obser vational studies can generate as man y hypotheses as the y test, and secondar y sources of data can be mer ged with the primary data collection to allow for analyses of questions that were unanticipated whenthe re gistry was conceived. This chapter will review the various sources of both primar y and secondary data, comment on their strengths and weaknesses, and provide someexamples of how data collected from different sources can be inte grated to help answer important questions. Types of Data The types of data to be collected are closely linked with the registry design and data collection methods. The form, organization, and timing of required data are impor tant components in determining appropriate data sources. Data elements can be g rouped into cate gories identifying the specific variable or construct they are intended to describe. One framework for grouping data elements into cate gories follo ws:Patient identifiers : Patient identifiers are critical to linkage of all data elements in some registries. Registry data elements are linked to the specific patient through a unique patientidentifier or registry identification number. Patient selection criteria : The eligibility criteria in a registry protocol (or study plan) determinethe group that will be included in the registry. These criteria may be very broad or restrictive,depending on the purpose. Criteria often include demographics (e.g., target age group), adisease diagnosis, a treatment, or diagnosticprocedures and laborator y tests. Health care provider, health care facility or system, and insurance criteria may also be included in certain types of registries (e.g., following carepatterns of specific conditions at large medicalcenters compared with small pri vate clinics). Treatments and tests : Treatments and tests are necessary to describe the natural history of patients. Treatments can include pharmaceutical, biotechnolo gy, or device therapies or procedures, such as surgery or radiation. Ev aluation of the treatment itself is often a primar y focus of registries (e.g., treatment safety and effectiveness over 5 years). Results of laboratory testing or diagnostic procedures may be included as registryoutcomes and used in def ining a diagnosis or condition of interest. Confounders : Confounders are elements or factors that have an independent association with the outcomes of interest. These are particularly important because patients are typicall y not randomized to therapies in registries. Confounders such as comorbidities (disease diagnoses and conditions) can confuse analysis results and inter pretation of causality . Information on the health care provider, treatment facility, concomitant therapies, or insurance may also be considered. Chapter 5. Data Sources for Registries 74Outcomes : The focus of this document is on patient outcomes. Outcomes are end results andare defined for each condition. In some registries, surrogate markers, such as biomarkers or other interim outcomes (e.g., hemoglobinA1C levels in diabetes) that are highly reflectiveof the longer term end results, are used. The types of data elements included in this framework are further described below with respectto their source or the utility of the data for linking to other sources. Many of these may be available through data sources outside of the registry system. Patient identifiers \u2014Depending on the data sources required, registries may utilize certain personal identifiers for patients to locate specific patients and link the data. For example, Social SecurityNumbers (SSNs), as w ell as a combination of other personal identif iers, can be utilized to identify individuals in the National Death Inde x (NDI). Patient contact infor mation, such as address and phone numbers, may be collected to support tracking of participants over time. Information for additional contacts (e.g., f amily members) may be collected to support followup in cases where thepatient cannot be reached. In many cases, patientinfor med consent and appropriate pri vacy authorizations are required to utilize personal identifiers for registry purposes; Chapter 6 discusses the legal requirements for including patient identifiers. Systems and processes must be in placeto manage security and conf identiality of these data. Confidentiality can be enhanced by assigning a registry-specif ic identif ier via a crosswalk algorithm, as discussed below. Demographics, such as date of birth (to calculate age at any time point), gender, and ethnicity, are typically collected and may be used to stratify the registry population. Disease/condition \u2014Disease or condition data include those related to the disease or condition of focus for the re gistry and ma y incor porate comorbidities. Elements of interest related to the confirmation of a diagnosis or condition could be date of diagnosis and the specific diagnostic results that were used to make the diagnosis, depending onthe purpose of the registry. Disease or condition is often a primary eligibility or outcome variable inregistries, whether the intent is to answer specified treatment questions (e.g., measure effectiveness orsafety) or to describe the natural history. This information may also be collected in constructing a medical history for a patient. In addition to \"yes\" or\"no\" to indicate presence or absence of the diagnosis, it may be important to capture responses such as \"missing\" or \"unknown.\" Treatment/therapy \u2014Treatment or therapy data include specific identifying information for theprimary treatment (e.g., drug name or code, biologic, device product or component parts, orsurgical intervention, such as organ transplant orcoronar y artery bypass graft) and may include information on concomitant treatments. Dosage (or parameters for devices), route of administration, andprescribed exposure time, such as daily or three times weekly for 4 weeks, should be collected.Pharmacy data may include dispensing information, such as the primar y date of dispensation and subsequent refill dates. Data in device registries can include the initial date of dispensation or implantation and subsequent dates and specifics ofrequired evaluations or modifications. Compliancedata may also be collected if pharmacy representati ves or clinic personnel are eng aged to conduct and repor t pill counts or v olume measurements on ref ill visits or return visits for device evaluations and modifications. Laboratory/procedures \u2014Laboratory data include a broad range of testing, such as blood, tissue, catheterization, and radiolo gy. Specific test results, units of measure, and laborator y reference ranges or parameters are typically collected. Laboratory databases are becoming increasingl y accessib le for electronic transfer of data, whether through a system-wide institutional database or a private laborator y database. Diagnostic testing or evaluation may include procedures such as psychological or behavioral assessments. Results of these procedures and physician exam procedures may be difficult to obtain through data sources other than the patient medical record. Health care provider characteristics \u2014Information on the health care pro vider (e.g., ph ysician, nurse, or pharmacist) may be collected, depending on theSection I. Creating Registries 75purpose of the registry. Training, education, or specialization may account for differences in carepatterns. Geographic location has also been used as an indicator of differences in care or medical practice. Hospital/clinic/health plans \u2014System interactions include office visits, outpatient clinic visits, emergency room visits, inpatient hospitalizations,procedures, and pharmacy visits, as well as associated dates. Data on all procedures as definedby the registry protocol or plan (e.g., physical exam, psychological evaluation, chest x-ray, CAT scan),including measurements, results, and units of measure w here applicable, should be collected. Cost accounting data may also be available to match these interactions and procedures. Descriptiveinformation related to the points of care may be useful in capturing differences in care patterns andcan also be used to track patter ns of referral of care (e.g., outpatient clinic, inpatient hospital, academiccenter, emergency room, pharmacy). Insurance \u2014The insurance system or payer claims data can provide useful information on interactions with the health care system, including visits,procedures, inpatient stays, and costs associatedwith these e vents. Data Sources Data sources are classified as primary or secondary based on the relationship of the data to the registry purpose. Primary data sources incorporate data collected for direct pur poses of the re gistry (i.e., primaril y for the re gistry). Primary data sources are typically used when the data of interest are not availab le or, if available, are unlikely to be of sufficient accuracy and reliability for the planned analyses and uses. Primary data collection increases the probability of completeness, v alidity , and reliability (see Chapter 4) because the registry drives the methods of measurement and data collection. These data are prospecti vely planned and collected under the direction of a protocol or study plan, using common procedures and the same format across all re gistry sites and patients. The data are readily integrated for tracking and analyses. Sincethe data entered can be traced to the individual who collected them, primary data sources are morereadily reviewed through automated checks or followup queries from a data manager than is possible with many secondary data sources. Secondary data sources are comprised of data originally collected for purposes other than theregistry under consideration (e.g., standard medicalcare, insurance claims processing). Data that are collected as primary data for one registry would beconsidered secondary data from the perspective of a second registry if matching were done. These dataare often stored in electronic format and may beavailable with appropriate permissions and systems consideration for transfer and import into the registry databases. Health professionals areaccustomed to entering the data for defined purposes, and additional training and support fordata collection are not required. Often, these dataare not constrained b y a data collection protocol and represent the diversity observed in real-world practice. However, there may be increased probability of errors and underreporting because ofinconsistencies in measurement, reporting, andcollection. There may also be increased costs for matching the data from the secondar y source to the primar y source and dealing with an y potential duplicate or unmatched patients. Sufficient identifiers are necessary to accurately match data between the secondary sources and registry patients. The potential for mismatch errors and duplications must be managed. (See Case Example 12.) The comple xity and obligations inherent in the collection and handling of personal identif iers ha ve pre viously been mentioned (e.g., obligations for informed consent, appropriate data privacy, and confidentiality procedures). Some of the secondary data sources do not collect infor mation at a specific patient level but are anon ymous and intended to reflect g roup or population estimates. For example, census tract or ZIP-Code-le vel data are a vailab le from the Census Bureau and can be merged with registry data. These data can be used as \"ecological variables\" to support analyses of income or education w hen such socioeconomic data are missing from registryChapter 5.

The State had many children' s health initiatives, such as programs for hearing assessment and lead prevention, b ut these programs collected data separately and did not attempt to link the infor mation. This type of fragmented str ucture is common in public health agencies, as many programs receive funding to fulfill a specific need but no funding to link that information with other programs. This type of linkage would benefit thedepar tment' s activities, as children who are at risk for one health issue are often at risk for other health issues. By inte grating the data, the department would be able to better integrate services and pro vide better ser vice.To integrate the data from these multiple sources and to allow new data to be entered directly into the program, the department implemented acomputerized registry. The registry consolidatesdata from 11 different sources to provide an overall picture of a child' s use of preventive health careservices. The sources include newborn developmental risk screening; the immunization registry; lead screening; hearing assessment;Women, Infants, and (WIC); intervention; blood spot screening; foster care; birth defects; and vital records data.The goals of the registry are to monitor the use of preventive health services, proactively promote referrals when services are needed, provide a lead screening reminder and recall directl y to parents, and give providers reporting capacity to identify children who are behind in services. After launching in 1997, the registry began accumulating data on children w ho w ere bor n in the State or receiving preventive health care services in the State. Some of the 11 data sources entered data directl y into the re gistry, and some of the data sources sent data from another database to the registry. The registry then consolidated datafrom these 11 sources into a single patient recordfor each child b y matching the records using simple deter ministic logic. As the registry began impor ting records, the system held some records as questionable matches, since it could not determine if the record w as ne w or a match to an existing record. These records required manual re view to resolve the issue, which was time consuming, at appro ximatel y 3 minutes per record. Without resources to devote to the manual review, the number of records held as questionab le matches increased to 48,685 by 2004. The time to resolv e these records manuall y was estimated at 17 months, and the registry did not have the resources to devote to that task. However, the incomplete data resulting from so man y held records made the registry less successful at tracking children' s health and less utilized by providers.Section I. Creating Registries (continued) 77Proposed Solution To resolve the issue of patient matching, the sponsor implemented an automated solution to the matching problem after evaluating several options, including probabilistic and deterministic matching strategies and commercial and open-source optionsfor matching software. Since the State had limited funds for the project, an open-source product, Febrl, was selected. A set of rules to process incoming records was developed, and an interface was created for the manual review of questionable records. Using therules, the software determines the probability of a match for each record. The registry then setsprobability thresholds abo ve which a record is considered a certain match and below which a record is considered a ne w record. All of the records that f all into the middle g round require manual review. Results After considerable testing, the new system launched in spring 2004. Immediately upon implementation, 95 percent of the held recordswere processed and removed from the holding category, resulting in the addition of approximately11,000 new patient records to the registry. Thenew interface for manual review reduced the time to resolve an error from 3 minutes to 40 seconds. With these improvements, the registry now imports95 percent of the data sent to the database and is able to process the questionable records throughthe improved interface. Key Point Many strategies and products exist to deal with matching patients from multiple data sources. Once a product has been selected, careful consideration must be given to the probabilitythresholds for establishing a match. Setting the threshold for matches too high ma y result in an unmanageable burden of manual review. However,setting the threshold too low could affect dataquality , as records ma y be mer ged inappropriatel y. A careful balance must be found between resources and data quality in order for matching softw are to help the re gistry. For More Information Wild EL, Hastings TM, Gubernick R et al.

Data Sources for Registries Case Example 12: Integrating Data From Multiple Sources With Patient ID Matching (continued) 78primary data collection. The intended use of the data elements will determine whether patient-levelinformation is required. The potential for data completeness, variation, and specificity must be evaluated in the context of theregistry and intended use of the data. It is advisableto have a solid understanding of the original purposeof the secondary data collection, including processesfor collection and submission, and verification and validation practices. Questions to ask include: Isdata collection passive or active? Are standard definitions or codes used in reporting data? Arestandard measurement criteria or instrumentsutilized (e.g., diagnoses, symptoms, quality of life)? The existence and completeness of claims data, for example, will depend on insurance companycoverage policies. One company may cover many preventive services, whereas another may have morerestricted co verage. Also, coverage policies can change o ver time. These v ariations must be known and carefully documented so as not to misinterpret use rates. Additionally, secondary data may not all be collected in the format required for registrypurposes (e.g., units of measure) and may requiretransformation for integration and analyses. An o verview of secondar y data sources that may be used for re gistries is gi ven belo w. Table 7 identifies some key strengths and limitations of the identified data sources. Medical chart abstraction \u2014Medical charts primaril y contain infor mation collected as a par t of routine medical care. These data reflect the practice of medicine or health care in general and at a specific level (e.g., geographical, by specialty careprovider). Charts also reflect uncontrolled patient behavior (e.g., noncompliance). Collection of standard medical practice data is useful in looking attreatments and outcomes in the real world, including all of the confounders that impact the measurement of effectiveness (vs. efficacy) and safety outside of the controlled conditions of a clinical trial. Chart documentation is often much poorer than one might expect, and there may be more than one patient-specific medical record (e.g., hospital and clinical records). A pilot collection is recommended for thislabor-intensive method of data collection to explore the availability and reproducibility of the data ofinterest. It is important to recognize that physicians and other clinicians do not generally use standardized data definitions in entering informationinto medical charts, meaning that one clinician' sdocumented diagnosis of \"chronic sinusitis\" or\"osteoarthritis\" or description of \"pedal edema\" may differ from that of another clinician. Electronic medical records .\u2014The use of electronic medical records (EMRs) is increasing. EMRs have an advantage over paper medical records becausethe data in some EMRs can be readily searched andintegrated with other information (e.g., laboratory data). The ease with which this is accomplished depends on whether the information is in arelational database or exists as scanned documents. An additional challenge relates to terminology andrelationships. F or example, including the term \"fit\" in a search for patients with epilepsy can yield arecord for someone who was noted as \"fit,\" as in healthy. Relationships can also be difficult to identify through searches (e.g., patient had breastcancer vs. patient' s mother had breast cancer). Thequality of the information has the same limitations as described in the parag raph abo ve. Institutional or or ganizational data bases \u2014 Institutional or organizational databases may be evaluated as a potential source of a wide variety ofdata. System-wide institutional or hospital databases are central data repositories, or data warehouses, that are highly variable from institution to institution. They may include a portion of everything from admission, discharge, and transfer infor mation to data reflecting diagnoses and treatment, pharmacy prescriptions, and specific laboratory tests. The latter might be chemistry or histolo gy laborator y data, including patient identifiers with associated dates of specimen collection and measurement, results, and standard \"normal\" or reference ranges. Catheterization laborator y data for cardiac registries may be accessible and may include details on the coronary anatom y and percutaneous coronar y inter vention. Other or e xamples are phar macies, blood banks, and radiology departments. Section I. Creating Registries 79Chapter 5.

Use of abstraction and strict coding standards (including handling of missingdata) increases the quality and interpretation of data abstracted. The underlying information is not collected in a systematic way. For example, a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia by one physician may be based on a physical exam and patient report of symptoms, while another physician may record the diagnosis only in the presence of a confirmed laboratory test. It is dif ficult to inter pret missing data. For example, does absence of a specific symptom in the visit record indicate that the symptom was not present or that the physician did not acti vely inquire about this specific symptom or set of symptoms? Data abstraction is resource intensive. Complete medical and clinical history may not be available (e.g., new patient to clinic). (continued) 80Section I. Creating Registries Electronic medical records (EMRs) Information on routine medical care and practice, with more clinical context than coded claims. Potential for comprehensive view of patient medical and clinical history. Efficient access to medical and clinical data. Use of data transfer and coding standards (including handling of missing data) will increase the quality of data abstracted. Underlying information from physicians was not collected using uniform decision rules. (See example under \"Medical chart abstraction.\") Consistency of data quality and breadth of data collected varies across sites. Difficult to handle information uploaded as text files into the EMRs (e.g., scanned physician reports) vs. direct entry into data fields.

Important to be knowledgeable on data handling and coding systems used when incorporating the claims data into the administrative systems. Can be difficult to gain the cooperation of partner groups, particularly in regard to receiving the submissions in a timely manner. Death indexes Completeness\u2014death reporting is mandated by law in the United States. Strong backup source for mortality tracking (e.g., patient lost to followup). National Death Index (NDI)\u2014centralized database of death records from State vitalstatistics offices, database updated annually. NDI causes of death relatively reliable (93-96 percent) compared with State death cer tificates. Social Security Administration' s (SSA) Death Master File\u2014database of deaths reported to SSA, database updated weekly. Time delay\u2014indexes depend on information from other data sources (e.g., State vital statistics offices), with delays of 12 to 18 months or longer. It is impor tant to understand the frequenc y of updates of specif ic indexes that may be utilized. Absence of information in death indexes does not necessarily indicate \"alive\" status at a gi ven point in time. U.S. Census Bureau databasesPopulation data.

Must rely on the data quality of the other registry.Table 7: Key Data Sources\u2014Strengths and Limitations (continued) Data source Strengths and uses Limitations 82Administrative databases \u2014Private and public medical insurers collect a wealth of information inthe process of tracking health care, evaluating coverage, and managing billing and payment. Information in the databases includes patient-specific information (e.g., insurance coverage andcopays; identifiers such as name, demographics,Social Security Numbers, or plan numbers; and dates of birth) and health care provider descriptivedata (e.g., identifiers, specialty characteristics, locations). Typically, private insurance companies organize health care data by physician care (e.g., physician office visits) and hospital care (e.g., emergency room visits, hospital stays). Data include procedures and associated dates, as well ascosts charged by the provider and paid by the insurers. Amounts paid by insurers are often considered proprietar y and una vailable. Standard coding con ventions are utilized in the repor ting of diagnoses, procedures, and other infor mation. Coding conventions include the Current ProcedureTerminology (CPT) for physician services andInter national Classif ication of Diseases (ICD) for diagnoses. The databases serve the primary function of managing and implementing insurance coverage, processing, and pa yment. Research identif iable data f iles (RIFs) maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are good examples of accessible administrative databases. The RIFs contain person- specif ic data on pro viders, benef iciaries, and recipients, including individual identifiers that would permit the identity of a beneficiary or physician to be deduced. Data with personal identifiers are clearly subject to privacy rules andregulations. As such, the information is confidential and is to be used onl y for reasons compatible with the pur pose(s) for w hich the data are collected. The Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC), a CMS contractor , provides free assistance to academic, government, and nonprofit researchers interested in using Medicare and/or Medicaid data for their research. 103Death and birth records \u2014Death indexes are national databases tracking population death data(e.g., NDI 104and the Death Master File [DMF] of the Social Security Administration [SSA]105). Data include patient identifiers, date of death, andattributed causes of death. These indexes arepopulated through a variety of sources. Forexample, the DMF includes death information on individuals who had an SSN and had their deathreported to the SSA. Reports may come in to the SSA by different paths, including from survivors or family members requesting benefits or from funeral homes. However, because of the importance of tracking Social Security benefits, all States, nursing homes, and mortuaries are required to report alldeaths to the SSA, thus ensuring virtually 100- percent complete mor tality ascertainment for those eligib le for SSA benef its. The NDI is updated annuall y with computer death records submitted b y State vital statistics of fices and has all or nearl y all deaths in the United States. The NDI can be used to provide both fact of death and cause of death, asrecorded on the death cer tificate. Cause-of-death data in the NDI are relatively reliable (93-96 percent) compared with death certificates. 106,107Time delays in death repor ting should be considered w hen using these sources, and vital status should not be assumed to be ali ve by the absence of information at a recent point in time. These indexes are a valuablesource of data for death tracking. Of course, mortality data can be accessed directl y through queries of State vital statistics offices and health depar tments w hen tar geting infor mation on a specific patient or within a State. Likewise, birth certificates are available through State departments and may be useful in registries of children or births. Census data bases \u2014U.S. Census Bureau databases108 provide population-le vel data utilizing survey sampling methodology. The Census Bureau conducts man y different sur veys, the main one being the population census conducted every 10 years. The primary use of the data is to determine the number of seats assigned to each State in the House of Representatives, although the data areSection I. Creating Registries 83used for many other purposes. These surveys calculate estimates through statistical processing ofthe sampled data. Estimates can be provided with a broad range of granularity, from population numbers for large regions (e.g., specific States), to ZIPCodes, all the way down to a household level (e.g.,neighborhoods identified by street addresses).Information collected includes demographic, gender, age, education, economic, housing, and work data.The data are not collected at an individual level but may serve other registry purposes, such as understanding population numbers in a specific region or by specific demographics. Existing r egistry databases \u2014There are numerous national and regional registry databases that may be leveraged for incorporation into other registries(e.g., disease-specific registries managed by nonprofit organizations, professional societies, orother entities). An example is the National Marrow Donor Pro gram (NMDP), 109a global database of cord blood units and volunteers who have consented to donate marrow and blood cells. Databases maintained by the NMDP include identifiers andlocators in addition to information on thetransplants, such as samples from the donor andrecipient, histocompatibility , and outcomes. NMDP actively encourages research and utilization of registry data through a data application process and submission of research proposals. In accessing data from one registry for the purposes of another, it is impor tant to reco gnize that data ma y have changed during the course of the source registry, and this may or may not have been well documented by the providers of the data. For example, in the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), 110a vital part of personal identification is CMS 2728, an enrollment form that identifies the incident data for each patient as well as other per tinent infor mation, such as the cause of renal failure, initial therapy, and comorbid conditions. Originall y created in 1973, this for m is in its third version, having been revised in 1995 and again in 2005. Consequently, there are data elements that exist in some versions and not others. The coding for some variables has changed overtime. For example, race has been redefined to correspond with Office of Management and Budgetdirectives and Census categories. Further, in the early years of the registry, this form was optional, sountil 1983, it was only filled out for about one-half of the subjects. Since 1995 it has been mandatory for all persons with end-stage renal disease. Thesechanges in form content, data coding, andcompleteness would not be evident to mostresearchers trying to access the data. Other Considerations for Secondary Data Sources The discussion below focuses on logistical and data issues to consider when incorporating data fromother sources. Chapter 8 full y explores data collection, management, and quality assurance for registries. The importance of patient identifiers for linking to secondar y data sources cannot be overstated. Multiple patient identifiers should be used, andprimary data for these identifiers should not beentered into the re gistry unless the identifying information is complete and clear. While an SSN is very useful, high-quality probabilistic linkages can be made to secondar y data sources using v arious combinations of such information as name (last, middle initial, and first), date of birth, and gender. For example, the NDI will make possible matches based on any of seven conditions. As noted earlier, the v arious types of data (e.g., personal history, adverse events, hospitalization, drug use) have to belinked through a common identifier. It is common in clinical trials to embed some intelligence into that identifier, such as SSN, initials, or site identifiers.While this may make sense for a closed system, it raises privacy concerns. (Privacy issues are covered in detail in Chapter 6.) The best identifier is one that not only is unique but has no embedded personal identif ication, unless that infor mation is scrambled and the key for unscrambling is stored remotely and securely. The group operating the registry should ha ve a process b y which each ne w entry to the registry is assigned a unique code and there is a crosswalk file(s) to enable the system to append this identifier to all new data as they are accrued. The crosswalk file should not beChapter 5. Data Sources for Registries 84accessible by persons or entities outside the management group. In addition, consideration should be given to the fact that a registry may need to accept and link data setsfrom more than one outside organization. Eachinstitution contributing data to the registry will haveunique requirements for patient data, access, privacy, and duration of use. While having identical agreements with all institutions would be ideal, this may not always be possible from a practicalperspective. Y et all registries have resource constraints, and decisions about including certaininstitutions have to be determined based on theresources a vailable to negotiate specialized agreements or to maintain specialized requirements. To the extent that some variability is allowed,agreements should be coordinated as much as possible so that the function of the registry is notgreatly impaired. All organizations participating in the re gistry should ha ve a common understanding of the rules regarding access to the data. Although exceptions can be made, it should be agreed that access to data will be based on independentassessment of research protocols and thatparticipating organizations will not have veto power over access. When data from secondar y sources are utilized , agreements should specify ownership of the source data and clearly permit data use by the recipientregistry. The agreements should also specify the roles of each institution, its legal responsibilities, and an y oversight issues. It is critical that these issues and ag reements be put in place before data are transferred so that there are no ambiguities or unforeseen restrictions on the recipient re gistry later on.When incorporating other data sources, consideration should also be given to the registryupdate schedule. (See Case Example 13.) A mature registry will usually have a mix of data update schedules. The registry may receive an annualupdate of large amounts of data, or there could bemonthly, weekly, or even daily transfers of data.Regardless of the schedule of data transfer, routine data checks should be in place to ensure propertransfer of data. These should include simple counts of records as well as predefined distributions of key variables. Conference calls or even routine meetings to go over recent transfers will help avoid mistakes that might not otherwise be picked up until much later. An example of the need for regularcommunication is a situation that arose with the United Netw ork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data a few years ago. UNOS changed the coding for donor type in their transplant records. This resulted in an apparent 100-percent loss of li ving donors in a calendar year. This was not conveyed to USRDSand was not detected by USRDS staff. Standardanalysis f iles that had been sent to researchers with the errors had to be replaced. Summary In summar y, a re gistry is not a static enterprise. The management of re gistry data sources requires attention to detail, constant feedback to all participants, and a willingness to make adjustments to the operation as dictated b y changing times.Section I. Creating Registries 85Case Example 13: Incorporating Data From Multiple Sources Description The Registry of Liver Diseases provides a repository of patients with the most common liver diseases. The registry was initially designed to facilitate clinical research by providing information on the availability ofclinical subjects and to help identify and recruit subjects. As the Registry has gathered data, it has expanded its purpose to include providing a natural history of the diseases. Sponsor Roche Pharmaceutical (seed funding) Y ear Started 2004 Y ear Ended Ongoing No. of Sites 5 academic centersNo. of Records 47,000 Challenge The registry began as an outgrowth of a homegrown system created by a gastroenterologist. After seeing the possibilities for improving patient care and supporting research, the Liver Institutetook on the project of creating a re gistry that would include data from multiple centers. The project team be gan by developing a database that was scalab le and included pri vacy protections for the patients. They then assembled an advisory board , which selected the 12 li ver diseases to include. The board decided that the registry would collect basic data on all patients, plus specific data on each disease. The registry collects data on patients at multiple visits, creating a picture of thetreatment of these chronic diseases o ver time. The five centers that were participating in the registry each collected these data already , but the y were stored in various systems, and the registry team did not want to ask the sites to re-enter thosedata in another database. The registry team also wanted to include data from lab reports and images, and they wanted the registry to be a usefultool for participating sites. To meet these variousneeds, the registry team needed to find a way to integrate data from multiple sources. Proposed Solution The team decided to upload data from various systems into the database, thereby creating patientrecords without asking sites to re-enter data. The initial data uploads included mostly demographic data, and the data came from various sources,ranging from electronic medical record systems to Excel spreadsheets. Once the re gistry was launched, the team worked with sites to set up regular data uploads. The uploads occur nightly, impor ting all ne w data on all patients into the database. While the data stored locally include all patient identifiers, the identifiers are stripped during the upload process, so only de-identified data are in the registry database. After setting up the upload system for the sites, the team w orked on uploading lab data for the patients. The lab data w ere more challenging, as the Health Level 7 (HL7) format for lab data is complicated. The data were also coming from hospitals, and theteam had to coordinate with the hospitals' information technology (IT) departments to set upthe data transfers. When the lab data are uploaded to the database, the database compares the header of the lab data f ile to the records in the database and fills in all data that match. If lab reports come in for a patient who is not in the database, the database creates a record for that patient, assuming that the patient has been referred to the center andthe data will be useful. The team simplified the data transfers from the lab by opting to recei ve batches on a re gular basis. This approach also minimized the IT resources necessary on the hospital side, which made it easier to gain the cooperation of the hospital IT teams.Chapter 5. Data Sources for Registries (continued) 86Results The registry has successfully incorporated data from multiple databases on the site level andimported data from five hospital labs to create a registry database of 47,000 records. The database has been used to identify patients for clinicaltrials, and the team plans to use it for research on the natural history of liver diseases. Key Point Incor porating data from e xisting electronic sources can reduce the burden of data entry on sites and increase the completeness of patient records. However, integrating multiple datasources is a complex task that requires extensiveplanning, with technical resources and detailedworkflo w discussions with re gistry par ticipants. Without national standards for all required data transfers, these efforts may be more achievable inregistries with fewer sites.Section I. Creating Registries Case Example 13: Incorporating Data From Multiple Sources (continued) 87This chapter covers the ethical and legal considerations that should accompany thedevelopment and use of all health informationregistries, including patient registries as defined inthis document, for the purposes of public healthactivities, governmental health program oversight,quality improvement/assurance, and research. These considerations apply generally accepted ethical principles for scientific research involving humansubjects to health information registries. Related topics include issues of transparency in the operation of registries, oversight of registryactivities, and property rights in health care information and registries. The purpose of thischapter is solely to provide information that willhelp readers understand the issues, not to provide specif ic legal opinion or re gulator y advice. Le gal advisors should al ways be consulted to address specif ic issues and to ensure that all applicab le Federal, State, and local la ws are follo wed. In the context of this chapter, \"health information\" is broadly construed to include any individualpatient information created or used by health care providers and insurance plans that relates to a healthcondition, the pro vision of health care services, or payment for health care services. 111As a result, health information may include demographic infor mation and personal characteristics, such as socioeconomic and marital status, the e xtent of formal education, developmental disability, cognitive capacities, emotional stability , as w ell as gender, age, and race, all of which may affect health status or health risks. Health information as defined here should be regarded as intimately connected to individual identity, and thus intrinsically private.Typically, health information includes information about f amily members, so it also can have an impact on the pri vacy of third parties. Patients widely regard health information as a confidential communication to a health care pro vider and e xpect confidentiality to be maintained. Serious ethical concerns have led to Federal legal requirements for prospective review of registryprojects and specific permissions to use healthinformation for research purposes. The creation anduse of patient registries for a research purposeordinarily constitute \"research involving humansubjects\" as defined by regulations applicable to research activities funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 112(HHS) and certain other Federal agencies. Moreover, Federal privacy regulations resulting from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996(HIPAA) 113specif ically apply to the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable healthinformation for research purposes. The term \"human subjects\" is used throughout this chapter for consistenc y with applicab le Federal la w. Some may prefer the term \"research participants.\" This chapter provides a general guide to Federal legal requirements in the United States. (Legal requirements in other countries ma y also be rele vant and may be different from those in this country, but even a general discussion of the international situation is be yond the scope of this document.) These legal requirements may influence registry decisions in volving the selection of data elements and data verification procedures, as well as affectsubsequent uses of registry data for secondary research pur poses. State la ws also ma y appl y to the use of health information for research purposes. The purpose of a registry, the status of its developer, and the extent to which registry data are identifiable largely determine applicable regulatory requirements. Table 8, included at the end of this chapter , provides an o verview of the applicable regulatory requirements based on the type of registry developer and the extent to which registry data are identif iable. This chapter re views the most common of these interactions. The complexity and sophistication of registry structures and operations vary widely, with equally variable processes forChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 88obtaining data. Nonetheless, common ethical and legal principles are associated with the creation and use of registries; these commonalities are the focus of this chapter. Ethical concerns about the conduct of biomedical research, especially research involving theinteraction of the clinical research community with their patients and commercial funding agencies, have produced an impetus to make financial and other arrangements more public. The discussion oftransparency in this chapter includes recommendations for the public disclosure ofregistry operations as a means of maintaining publictrust and confidence in the use of health information. Reliance on a standing advisory committee is recommended to registry developers asa way to provide expert technical guidance for registry operations and firmly establish theindependence of the re gistry from committed or conflicted interests, as described in Chapter 2. This discussion of transparency in methods is not intended to discourage private investments in registries that produce proprietary information insome circumstances. Neither the funding source northe generation of proprietary information from a registry deter mines w hether a re gistry achieves the good practices described in this handbook. Registry developers are likely to encounter licensing requirements, including processing and use fees, in obtaining health and claims information. Healthcare providers and plans have plausible claims of ownership to health and claims information, although the pub lic response to these claims has not been tested. Registry developers should anticipate negotiating access to health and claims infor mation, especially when it is maintained in electronic form. The processes for use of registry datasets, especially in multiple anal yses b y different in vestig ators, should be publicly disclosed if the confidentiality protections required for health information are to remain credible. The ne xt section of this chapter discusses the ethical concerns and considerations involved with the uses of confidential health information in registries. The transfor mation of ethical concer ns into the le gal regulation of human subjects research andindividually identifiable health information is then described. After that, an overview is presented ofthese regulatory requirements and their interactions specifically as they relate to registries. Next, recommendations are made about registrytransparency and oversight, based on the need toensure the independence, integrity, and credibility ofbiomedical research, while preserving and improving the utility of registry data. In addition,this section discusses property rights in health information and registries. Ethical Concerns Relating to Health Information Registries Application of Ethical Principles The Belmont Report114 is a summary of the basic principles and guidelines de veloped to assist in resolving ethical problems in the conduct of research with human subjects. It was the work product of the National Commission for theProtection of Human Subjects of Biomedical andBeha vioral Research, w hich w as created by the National Research Act of 1974. 115 The Belmont Repor t identif ies three fundamental principles for the ethical conduct of scientific research that involves human subjects. These principles are respect for persons (as autonomous agents; self-determination), beneficence (do good; do no harm; protect from harm), and justice (fairness; equitable distribution of benefits and burdens; equal treatment). Together they provide a foundation for the ethical analysis of human subjects research, including the use of health infor mation in re gistries de veloped for scientif ic purposes with a prospect of producing social benefits. These principles are substantively the same as those identified by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) in its international guidelines for the ethical re view of epidemiologic studies.116 Nevertheless, the application of these principles to specif ic research acti vities can result in dif ferent conclusions about w hat comprises the ethical design and conduct of the research in question. TheseSection I. Creating Registries 89different conclusions frequently occur because the principles are assigned different values and relativeimportance by the person performing the ethical analysis. In most of these situations, however, a generally supported, consensus position on theethical design and conduct of the research is a desirable and achievable goal. This goal does not preclude reanalysis as social norms or concerns about research activities change over time inresponse to new technologies or persistent ethical questioning. The ethical principle of respect for persons supports the practice of obtaining individuals' consent to theuse of their health infor mation for research purposes that are unrelated to the clinical and insurance reasons for creating it. In connection with researchregistries, consent may have multiple components:(1) consent to registry creation by the compilationof patient infor mation; (2) consent to the initial research pur pose and uses of re gistry data; and (3) consent to subsequent use of registry data by the registry developer or others for the same or different research purposes. The consent process shouldadequately describe registry purposes and operationsto inform potential subjects' decisions about participation in a research re gistry. In some def ined circumstances, the principle of respect f or per sons may be subordinate to other ethical principles and values, with the result that an explicit consent process for participation in the registry may not be necessar y. A waiver of informed consent requirements may apply to the registry and be ethically acceptable. (See discussion of waivers of informed consent requirements in this chapter' s section \"Potential for Individual PatientIdentification.\") In these situations, alternatives to an explicit consent process for each individual contrib uting health infor mation to the re gistry may be adequate (e.g., readily accessible, publicly availab le infor mation about re gistry activities). A general ethical requirement for consent clearly implies that human subjects v oluntarily permit the use of their health information in a registry unless a specif ic exception to v oluntary participation applies to the re gistry. One such e xception is a legally mandated, public health justification for thecompilation of health information (e.g., certain infectious disease reporting). V oluntary agreementto the use of health information in a registry necessarily allows a subsequent decision to discontinue participation. Any inability to withdrawinformation from the registry (e.g., onceincorporation into aggregated data has occurred)should be clearly communicated in the consent process as a condition of initial participation. Theconsent process should also include instructions about the procedures for withdrawal at any time from participation in the registry unless a waiver of consent applies to the registry. Incentives for registry use of health information (e.g., insurance coverage of payments for health care services)should be carefully evaluated for undue influence on both the indi viduals whose health information is sought for re gistry projects and the health care providers of those ser vices. 117,118 Conflicts of interest ma y also result in undue influence on patients and compromise voluntary participation. One potential source of conflict widely identified with clinical research is the use ofrecruitment incentives paid by funding agencies tohealth care providers. 119Some professional societies and research or ganizations ha ve developed positions on recr uitment incenti ves. Man y entities ha ve characterized incenti ves that are significantly beyond fair market value for the work performed by the health care provider as unethical; others require disclosure to research subjects of an y conflicting interest, financial or otherwise.120Research organizations, particularly grantees of Federal research funding, may have systematic processes that registry developers can rely on for managingemployee conflicts of interest. Nonetheless, in their planning, re gistry developers should specify and implement recr uitment practices that protect patients against inappropriate influences. Further considerations in applying the principle of respect for persons to the research use of health infor mation generate ethical concerns about preserving the privacy and dignity of patients and about protecting the conf identiality of health infor mation. These concer ns ha ve intensified as health care services, third-party payment, and healthChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 90information systems have become more complex. Legal standards for the use and disclosure of healthinformation have replaced professional and cultural norms for handling individually identifiable health information. Nonetheless, depending on theparticular health condition or population of interest,safeguards for the confidentiality of registry databeyond applicable legal requirements may be ethically necessary to protect the privacy and dignityof those individuals contributing health information to the registry. The principle of beneficence ethically obligates developers of health information registries forresearch pur poses to minimize potential harms to the individuals or groups 121whose health information is included in the registry. There areusually no apparent benefits for offsetting harms to individuals or groups whose health information isused in the re gistry. Exceptions to this arise when the re gistry is designed to pro vide benef its to the human subjects, ranging from longitudinal reports on treatment effects or health status to quality-of- care reports. Risks to privacy and dignity areminimized by conscientious protection of theconfidentiality of the health information included in the re gistry 122through the use of appropriate physical, technical, and administrati ve safe guards for data in the operations of the re gistry. These safeguards should also control access to registry data, including access to individual identifiers that may be included in re gistry data. Minimization of risks also requires a precise determination of what information is necessary for the research purposes of the registry. In an anal ysis appl ying the principle of benef icence , research involving human subjects that is unlikely toproduce valid scientific information is unethical. This conclusion is based on the lack of social benefit to offset even minimal risks imposed by theresearch on participating individuals. Health information registries should incorporate an appropriate design (including, w here appropriate, calculation of the patient sample as described in Chapter 3) and data elements, written operating procedures, and documented methodolo gies, as necessary, to assure the achievement of their scientif ic pur pose. 123Certain populations of patients may be vulnerable to social, economic, or psychological harms as a resultof a stigmatizing health condition. Developers of registries compiling this health information must make special efforts to protect the identities of thehuman subjects contributing data to the registry.Pediatric and adolescent populations generateparticular ethical concern because of a potential for lifelong discrimination that may effectively excludethem from educational opportunities and other social benefits (e.g., health care insurance). 124 An ethical analysis employing the principle of justice also yields candid recognition of the potential risks to those w ho contribute health information to a registry and the probable lack of benefit to those individuals (except in the caseswhere registries are specifically constructed to provide benefit to those individuals). Theimbalance of b urden and benefit to individuals, which is an issue of distrib utive justice, emphasizes the need to minimize the risks from registry use of health information. Reasonably precise and well- developed scientific reasons for inclusion (orexclusion) of defined health information in aregistry contribute to making the research participation b urden f air. The abo ve anal ysis refers to research acti vities. However, the ethical concerns expressed also may apply to other activities that use the healthinformation of individuals in scientific methodologies solely for nonresearch purposes. Public health, oversight of the delivery of health care ser vices through go vernment programs, and quality improvement/assurance (I/A) activities all can in voke the same set of ethical concer ns as research activities about the protection of patient self-determination, privacy, and dignity; maintaining the conf identiality of indi viduall y identif iable health information to avoid potential socioeconomic harms; and imposing a risk of harm on some individuals to the benefit of others not at risk. In the past, dif ferent assignments of social value to these activities and different potential for the social benef its and har ms the y produce created different levels of social acceptance and for mal o versight for these activities than for research. Nonetheless, these activities ma y include a research component inSection I. Creating Registries 91addition to their ostensible and customary objectives, which reinforces the ethical concernsdiscussed above and produces additional concerns about compliance with the legal requirements for research activities. Registry developers should givecareful prospective scrutiny to the proposedpurposes for and activities of a registry inconsultation with appropriate institutional officials to avoid both ethical and compliance issues that mayundermine achievement of the registry' s objectives. Registry developers must also consider confidentiality protections for the identity of thehealth care providers, at the level of both individualprofessionals and institutions, and the health care insurance plans from which they obtain registry data. Information about health care providers andinsurance plans can also identify certain patient populations and, in rare circumstances, individualpatients. Moreo ver, the objectives of any registry, broadl y speaking, are to enhance the v alue of the health care services received, not to undermine the credibility and thus the effectiveness of health care providers and insurance plans in their communities.Developers of registries created for public healthinvestigations, health system oversight activities, and quality I/A initiati ves to monitor compliance with reco gnized clinical standards must consider and implement conf identiality safeguards for the identity of service professionals and institutions. Transformation of Ethical Concerns Into Legal Requirements Important ethical concerns about the creation, maintenance, and use of patient re gistries for research purposes involve risks of harm to the human subjects from inappropriate access to registry data and inappropriate use of the compiled health information. These concerns recognize publicexpectations of confidentiality for health infor mation and the importance of that confidentiality in preserving the privacy and dignity of indi vidual patients. Over the last decade, two rapid technological developments intensified these ethical concerns. One of these adv ances was DNA sequencing, replication, recombination, and the concomitantapplication of this technology to biomedical research activities in human genetics. The otheradvance was the rapid development of electronic information processing as applied to the management of health information. Widespreadanticipation of potential social benefits produced bybiomedical research as a result of these technologieswas accompanied by ethical concerns about the potential for dignity, economic, social, orpsychological harms to the individuals or related third parties. In addition to specific ethical concerns about the effect of technological advances in biomedicalresearch, general social concer ns about the privacy of patient information accompanied the advance of health information systems technology andcommunications. These social concerns produced legal protections, first in Europe and later in theUnited States. The discussion below about legal protections for the pri vacy of health infor mation focuses solely on U.S. law. Health information is also legally protected in European and some other countries by distinctly different and even morecomplex rules, none of which are discussed in thischapter. If registry developers intend to obtain health infor mation from outside of the United States, the y should consult le gal counsel earl y in the registry planning process for the necessary assistance. The Common Rule . The analysis in the Belmont Report on the ethical conduct of human subjects research e ventually resulted in a uniform set of regulations from the F ederal agencies that fund such research known as the \"Common Rule.\"125,126The legal requirements of the Common Rule appl y to research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the 17 Federal departments and agencies that adopted it. (Some of these agencies may require additional legal protections for humansubjects. The Department of Health and Human Services regulations will be used for all following references to the Common Rule.) Among these requirements is a formal, written agreement from each institution eng aged in such research to compl y with the Common Rule. F or human subjects research conducted or supported by most of theChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy Case Example 14: Considering the Institutional Review Board Process DuringRegistry Design Description The National Oncologic PET Registry (NOPR) collects data to assess the impact of positron emission tomography with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (PET) on cancer patient management. The re gistry was designed to meet the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data submission requirements for expanded coverage for new indications and additional cancers. Sponsor Academy of Molecular Imaging (AMI), managed by American Colle ge of Radiolo gy (ACR) through the American Colle ge of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) Y ear Started 2006 Year Ended Ongoing No. of Sites Began accepting re gistrations in late 2005 No. of Patients Began accepting patients in 2006 Challenge The NOPR is one of the f irst examples of CMS' s new co verage with evidence development (CED) approach. For the expanded coverage of PET for cancer , the agenc y required the collection of prospective clinical and demographic data. From the beginning, the organizations developing the registry understood the need to define the requirements for institutional review board (IRB)appro val and informed consent. They were uncertain, however, about how Department of Health and Human Ser vices (HHS) regulations for the protection of human research subjects, including IRB requirements, w ould appl y to the planned registry. Implementing NOPR required ACR and AMI, in conjunction with CMS and92Federal entities that apply the Common Rule, the required agreement is called a FederalwideAssurance (FWA). 127Research institutions may opt in their FWA to apply Common Rule requirements to all human subjects research activities conductedwithin their facilities or by their employees andagents, regardless of the source of funding. Theapplication of Common Rule requirements to a particular registry depends on the institutionalcontext of the registry developer, relevant institutional policies, and whether the health information contributed to the registry maintains patient identifiers. The Of fice for Human Research Protections (OHRP) administers the regulation of human subjects research conducted or supported by HHS.Guidance published by OHRP discusses research use of identifiable health information. Thisguidance mak es clear that OHRP considers the creation of health infor mation re gistries for research purposes containing individually identifiable private information to be human subjects research for the institutions subject to its jurisdiction. 128In \"Research Transparency, Oversight, andOwnership,\" the applicability of the Common Rule to research re gistries is discussed in more detail. Regulations for human subjects protection require prospective review and approval of the research by an institutional review board (IRB) and the informedconsent (usually written) of each of the human subjects involved in the research unless an IRB expressly grants a waiver of informed consent requirements. 129(See Case Example 14.) A research project must satisfy certain regulatory conditions to obtain IRB appro val of a w aiver of the informed consent requirements. (See \"Potential for Individual Patient Identification\" for discussion of waivers of infor med consent requirements.) A registry plan is the research \"protocol\" reviewed by the IRB. At a minimum, the protocol should identify (1) the research purpose of a health information registry, (2) detailed ar rangements for obtaining informed consent or detailed justifications for not obtaining infor med consent to collect health infor mation, and (3) appropriate safe guards for protecting the confidentiality of registry data, in addition to anySection I. Creating Registries (continued) 93Chapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy HHS' s Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), to resolve these issues. Based on their initial assessment of the registry, as well as discussions with CMS, the sponsorsbelieved that the registry was not subject to IRBapproval because it was \"conducted by or subject to the approval of Department or Agency heads\" forthe purpose of evaluating a \"public benefits or services program.\" The ACR IRB likewise judgedupon review of the proposal that the registryqualified for the \"public benefits\" exemption.Several IRBs at institutions planning to participate in the re gistry reached the same conclusion. Accordingly, the registry' s original design did not include a provision for obtaining IRB approval or patient consent. However, 1 week before theregistry was to begin operation, registryinvestig ators and CMS staf f received an email from OHRP rejecting that inter pretation on the g rounds that the purpose of the registry was not only to evaluate Medicare coverage policy but also togenerate clinical data that w ould potentiall y affect patient management. OHRP' s decision raised theprospect that each of the hundreds of participating hospitals and freestanding PET facilities would berequired to obtain approval from its own IRB (or a commercial IRB)\u2014a process that w ould have been administrati vely cumbersome, expensive, and very time consuming. The registry investigators suspended the launch and , in consultation with several IRB Chairs, CMS, and other HHS staff, sought to de velop an alter native approach. Proposed Solution The issue w as ultimatel y resolv ed onl y when registry investigators and IRB Chairs from Duke University, Washington University, and ACR spoke directly with OHRP . The parties reached consensus that ACR, the institution operating the registry, wasthe only entity engaged in research, and that the registry therefore needed to be approved only by a single IRB designated under ACR's Federalwide Assurance (FWA). This plan reflects guidance under de velopment at OHRP , and lik ely could not have been devised without the help of that agency.The ACR IRB has since approved the use of data collected by the registry for research purposesbased on this model. Results Under this approach, individual PET facilities and referring physicians do not have to obtain IRB appro val in order to submit data to the registry, thus avoiding the waste and redundancy of requiring parallel action by hundreds of individual IRBs.Both patients and referring physicians areconsidered research subjects, ho wever, and must therefore pro vide infor med consent before their data can be used for research. With the guidance of OHRP , registry investigators also developed a rationale for waiver of written consent. Eitherbefore or upon ar rival at a PET facility, each patient receives a standard registry information document,describing the registry and requesting that the patient pro vide oral consent for the use of his or her identified data for research purposes. Consent from the refer ring physician, who also receives a standard re gistry infor mation sheet, is recorded on one of the two data collection forms the physician must complete. If either the patient or the refer ring physician withholds consent, the identified data arestill collected by the PET facility, sent electronicall y to the re gistry, and then submitted to CMS for the purpose of determining payment; however, the data will not be used for research. In such cases, CMS ne vertheless pa ys for the PET scan. Key Point Even when the primary purpose of a medical data registry is to evaluate Medicare payment policy, its implementation necessarily involves a host of issues related to protecting the subjects w hose data will be used. It is essential to address these issues early, so that appropriate systems and procedures can be incorporated into the design of the registry. Additionally, if the institution operating the registry is the onl y entity eng aged in research, then the registry needs to be approved only by a single IRB designated under that institution' s FWA. Case Example 14: Considering the Institutional Review Board Process During Registry Design (continued) 94other information required by the IRB on the risks and benefits of the research.130 As noted previously, for human subjects research conducted or supported by most Federaldepartments and agencies that have adopted theCommon Rule, an FWA satisfies the requirementfor an approved assurance of compliance. Someresearch organizations extend the application oftheir FWA to all research, regardless of the funding source. Under these circumstances, any patientinformation registry created and maintained within the organization may be subject to the CommonRule. In addition, some research organizations haveexplicit institutional policies and procedures that require IRB review and approval of all human subjects research. The Privacy Rule . In the United States, the Health Insurance P ortability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations131(here collecti vely called the Privacy Rule) created legal protections for the pri vacy of indi viduall y identifiable health information created and maintained by so-called \"covered entities.\" Covered entities are health care providers that engage incertain financial and administrative health caretransactions electronicall y, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. 132For the pur poses of this chapter, the relevant entities are covered health care providers and health care insurance plans, whichmay include individual health care providers (e.g., a physician, pharmacist, or physical therapist). The discussion in this chapter assumes the data sources for re gistries are \"co vered entities\" to which the Privacy Rule applies. In the unlikely event a registry developer intends to collect and use data from sources that are notcovered entities under the Privacy Rule, these sources are subject only to applicab le State la w and accreditation requirements, if any, for patient information. Although data sources are assumed to be subject to the Privacy Rule, registry developers and the associated institutions w here the re gistry will reside may not be. Notably, the Privacy Rule does not apply to registries that reside outside of a covered entity . Within academic medical centers, forexample, registry developers may be associated with units that are outside of the institutional health carecomponent to which the Privacy Rule applies, such as a biostatistics or economics department. But because many, if not virtually all, data sources forregistries are covered entities, registry developersare likely to find themselves deeply enmeshed in thePrivacy Rule. This involvement may occur with noncovered entities as well\u2014for instance, as a resultof business practices developed in response to the Privacy Rule. In addition, the formal agreements required by the Privacy Rule in certain circumstances in order to access, process, manage, and use certain forms of patient information impose continuing conditions of use that are legallyenforceable by data sources under contract law. Therefore, re gistry developers should become cognizant of the patient pri vacy considerations confronting their lik ely data sources and should consider follo wing cer tain Pri vacy Rule procedures, necessary or not, for reasons of solidarity with those data sources. In general, the Privacy Rule defines the circumstances under which health care providersand insurance plans (covered entities) may use and disclose patient infor mation for a v ariety of purposes, including research. Existing State la ws protecting the conf identiality of health information that are contrary to the Privacy Rule are preempted unless the State law is more protective (which it may be). 133The Pri vacy Rule regulates the use of identifiable patient information within health care providers and insurance plans and the disclosure of patient information to others outside of the institution that creates and maintains theinformation. 134The initial collection of registry data from co vered entities is subject to specific Privacy Rule procedures, depending on the re gistry's purpose, whether the registry resides within a covered entity or outside of a co vered entity , and the extent to which the patient information identifies individuals. The health care providers or insurance plans that create, use, and disclose patient information for clinical use or business purposes aresubject to civil and criminal liability for violations of the Privacy Rule.Section I. Creating Registries 95Registry developers should be sufficiently knowledgeable about the Privacy Rule to facilitatethe necessary processes for their data sources. They should expect this assistance to involve interactions with clinicians, the Privacy Officer, the IRB orPrivacy Board staff, health information systemrepresentatives, legal counsel, compliance officials,and contracting personnel. Subsequent use and sharing of registry data may be affected by the regulatory conditions that apply toinitial collection, as well as by new ethical concerns and legal issues. The Privacy Rule created multiplepathways by which registries can compile and usepatient infor mation. To use or share compiled registry data for research purposes, a registry developer may need to employ several of thesepathways sequentially and satisfy the regulatory requirements of each pathway. For instance, aregistry within a covered entity may arrange to obtain written documentation of an authorizationrequired by the Privacy Rule from each patient contributing identifiable information to a registry for a particular research project, such as therelationship between hypertension and Alzheimer' sdisease. If the registry then seeks to make a subsequent use of the data for another research purpose, it ma y do so if it uses another per mission in the Pri vacy Rule\u2014for example, by obtaining additional patient authorizations or first de- identifying the data to Privacy Rule standards. The authors recommend that registry developers plan a detailed tracking system, based on the e xtent to which re gistry data remain identifiable for individual patients, for the collection, uses, and disclosures of re gistry data. The tracking system should produce comprehensive documentation of compliance with both Privacy Rule requirements and le gally binding contractual ob ligations to data sources. The Pri vacy Rule defines research as \"a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and e valuation, designed to de velop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.\" 135 Commentary by HHS to the Privacy Rule explicitly includes the de velopment (b uilding and maintenance) of a repository or database for futureresearch purposes within this definition of research.136The definition of \"research\" in the Privacy Rule partially restates the definition of research in the preexisting Common Rule for the protection of human subjects of the HHS and other Federal agencies.137Some implications of this partial restatement of the definition of research are discussed later in this chapter. Guidance published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) discusses how the Privacy Ruleimpacts health services research and research databases and repositories. The NIH guidanceidentifies the options available to investigators underthe Pri vacy Rule for access to the health information held by health care providers and insurance plans. 138 In addition to provisions for the use or disclosure of identifiable patient information for research, the Privacy Rule per mits health care pro viders and insurance plans to use or disclose patient infor mation for cer tain defined public health activities.139(See Case Example 15.) The Pri vacy Rule defines a public health authority as \"an agency or authority of the United States, a State, a territory, a political subdivision of a State or territory, or anIndian tribe, or a person or entity acting under agrant of authority from or contract with such pub lic agenc y . . . that is responsib le for pub lic health matters as part of its official mandate.\" 140The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and HHS have jointly published specific guidance on the Privacy Rule for public health activities.141 Other Privacy Rule provisions permit the use or disclosure of patient health infor mation as required by other laws.142 The pri vacy protections for patient information created by the Privacy Rule that are generally relevant to registries developed for research purposes include e xplicit indi vidual patient authorization for the use or disclosure of identifiable information,143legally binding agreements for the release of \"limited data sets\" between health information sources and users,144the removal of specified identifiers or statistical certification to achie ve de-identification of health information,145 and an accounting of disclosures to be madeChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 96Case Example 15: Using Registries for Public Health Activities Description Immunization registries collect data on vaccinations within a geographic area. The registries consolidate records from multiple sources, provide vaccination reminders, and support public health entities in improving and sustaining high vaccination rates. Many State and local public health agencies use immunization registries to improve and track vaccination rates in their area. The MichiganChildhood Immunization Registry, San Diego Regional Immunization Re gistry, and Utah Statewide Immunization Information System are three examples of such registries. Sponsor Michigan: Healthy Michigan Fund and Medicaid match dollars San Die go: Centers for Disease Control and Pre vention (CDC), State of Califor nia, County of San Diego Utah: Health plans, Medicaid , State of Utah, CDC Y ear Started Michigan: 1996 San Diego: 1996 Utah: 1995 Y ear Ended Michigan: Ongoing San Diego: Ongoing Utah: Ongoing No. of Sites Michig an: 2,600 San Die go: 151 Utah: 203 No. of Records Michigan: 3.3 million San Diego: 560,000 Utah: 1.6 millionChallenge Children often receive vaccinations from different providers. Because these data are then stored in different locations, it is difficult for new providersto assess a child' s vaccination history in order to understand what vaccinations may be needed. Thislack of consolidated information impacts both thechild' s health and, potentially, the health of thecommunity at large, as vaccinations support public health. Proposed Solution and Results Immunization registries consolidate vaccination data from multiple caregivers into one central database. From this database, other providers can check the status of a child' s vaccinations. Schoolscan also conf irm vaccination records before enrolling a child. With data on w hat v accinations a child has received and what shots may be due, the registry can issue reminders to providers. These functions ser ve the public health purpose of monitoring vaccination status and increasing thenumber of children who are up to date on all of their v accinations. The impor tance of these pub lic health goals is underscored by the national health objective regarding immunization registries. The objective for 2010 is to increase the propor tion of children under the age of 6 w ho are enrolled in immunization registries to 95 percent. To meet this goal, 37 States have implemented registries that target their entire State. Seven other States have registries that focus on regions within theState. Three examples of these immunization registries are the Michig an Childhood Immunization Registry (MCIR), the San Diego Regional Immunization Registry (SDIR), and the Utah Statewide Immunization Information System (USIIS). Each of these re gistries meets the basic needs outlined above. In addition, each registry focuses on a unique challenge in pro viding vaccinations and uses the registry data and framework to address those issues. The MCIR focuses on inte grating health plan data into the registry to create a smooth flow of information.Section I. Creating Registries (continued) 97The SDIR implemented new procedures to improve the quality of vaccinations by identifyingpotential errors through the registry data. TheUSIIS has identified and addressed geographicvagaries using the registry data. The purpose of the MCIR is standard for an immunization registry: to protect communitiesfrom vaccine-preventable diseases and to assurethat all children in Michigan are appropriatelyimmunized. Data from the registry indicated room for impro vement in the area of Medicaid recipient children. To address this gap, the registry added afield for the Medicaid ID number. The Medicaid ID number is updated on a monthl y basis, along with information on the child' s health plan enrollment. Coverage reports are generated on a monthly basis; children who do not have completeimmunization records are identified and lists are distrib uted to health plans. Integrating the MCIR with the Medicaid ID number is a k ey strate gy for addressing these deficiencies in child immunization records. It allows providers to verify the age-appropriateimmunization status of all Medicaid recipientchildren, and it allo ws qualified health plans to more accuratel y assess their population coverage levels as required for HEDIS (Health planEmployer Data and Information Set) reporting.This integration has enabled the registry to provideclinicians with health plan enrollment data. As a result, pro viders save time by knowing to which plan to bill the immunizations. The health plan benefits from having a central repository of immunization data for HEDIS repor ting. The child benefits from having up-to-date vaccinations. In San Diego, the registry team focused on a different aspect of immunizations: not only is it impor tant to v accinate all children, but it is critical to pro vide the v accinations on the right schedule. The registry team used the data from the registry to evaluate immunization procedures and identify probable errors. These errors included giving influenza vaccines to infants under 6 months of age, giving PPV23 doses to children under 1 yearof age, and giving the Hib vaccine to children 5 and over. By developing and implementing a dataquality plan, the registry team was able to identifythese types of issues. The team then used registryliaisons to deliver this information to the health care providers. The SDIR experience demonstrated that reviewing registry data for less than optimal immunizationpractices is critical to ensuring the adequateimmunization coverage of the public. Generating regular reports from the registry is an efficient method of quality assurance review that canquickly identify problem areas to focus on in other quality impro vement programs. Utah also used the data in its registry to identify issues with the immunization practices in the State. In this case, the National Immunization Survey, ayearly assessment of immunization rates forchildren ages 19-35 months conducted by CDC, indicated that immunization rates had declined signif icantl y in Utah from 2003 to 2004. The rates dropped from 80.4 percent to 75.4 percent. To better understand the drop, Utah turned to the datain USIIS. The USIIS program developed a strategy to identify where the lowest immunization rates werewithin the State by utilizing the immunization registry, Geographic Information System software,and digital maps pro vided b y the Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center. Analyses were conducted for each of the 12 local health districts. The results of the anal yses sho wed that the rates of adequately immunized children ranged from 82 percent to 39 percent. Using these data, local health departments determined to focus their efforts and resources on the areas that needed themost improvement. Key Point Immunization registries are an example of how a registry can be used to consolidate data from multiple care givers to achie ve a national health objective. Chapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy Case Example 15: Using Registries for Public Health Activities (continued) 98available to patients at their request.146In addition, if certain criteria required by the Privacy Rule are satisfied, an IRB or Privacy Board can grant a waiver of individual patient authorization for the use or disclosure of health information in research.147 FDA regulations . U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory requirements forresearch supporting an application for FDA approvalof a product also include protections for human subjects, including specific criteria for protection ofprivacy and maintaining the confidentiality of research data. 148 Applicability of regulations to research; multiple- purpose registries . At many institutions, the IRB or the office that provides administrative support for the IRB is the final arbitrator of the activities thatconstitute human subjects research and thus may itself require IRB re view. A registry developer is strongly encouraged to consult his or her organization' s IRB early in the registry planning process to a void dela ys and re vision of documentation for the IRB. Distinctions between research and other activities that apply scientific methodologies are frequently unclear. Such otheractivities include both public health practice 149and quality-related in vestig ations.150Both the ostensib le and secondar y pur poses of an acti vity are f actors in the determination of whether registry activities constitute research subject to the Common Rule. Asinterpreted by OHRP , if any secondary purpose of an activity is research, then the activity should be considered research. 151This OHRP inter pretation of research pur pose dif fers from that of the Privacy Rule where quality-related studies performed by health care pro viders and insurance plans are concerned. Under the Privacy Rule, only if the primary purpose of a quality-related activity is to obtain generalizab le kno wledge do the research provisions of the Privacy Rule apply; otherwise, the Privacy Rule defines the activity as a \"health care operation.\"152 Registry developers should rel y on their Privacy Officer' s and IRB' s experience and resources in defining research and other activities for their institutions and deter mining w hich acti vities requireIRB review as research. In response to accreditation standards, inpatient facilities typically maintainstanding departmental (e.g., pediatrics) or service (e.g., pharmacy or nursing) committees to direct, review, and analyze quality-related activities. Somephysician groups also establish and maintainquality-related programs, because good clinicalpractice includes ongoing evaluation of any substantive changes to the standard of care. Theseinstitutional quality committees can provide guidance on the activities that usually fall within their purview. Similarly, public health agencies typically maintain systematic review processes for identifying the activities that fit within their legal authority. As briefly mentioned previously, use of registry data for multiple research purposes may entail obtaining additional permissions from patients or satisfyingdifferent regulatory requirements for each research purpose. Standard conf identiality protections for registry data include requirements for physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to be incorporated into plans for a registry. In someinstances, an IRB may not consider legally requiredprotections for the research use of patientinfor mation suf ficient to address rele vant ethical concer ns, including the protections of the Pri vacy Rule that ma y be applicable to registries created and maintained within health care providers and insurance plans as covered entities. For example, infor mation about cer tain conditions (such as alcoholism or HIV -positive status) and certain populations (such as children) may present an unusual potential for harm from social stigma and discrimination. Under these circumstances, the IRBcan make its approval of a registry plan contingent on additional safe guards that it determines are necessar y to minimize the risks to indi viduals contributing health information to the registry.Section I. Creating Registries 99Applicable Regulations This section describes the specific applicability of the Common Rule153and the Privacy Rule154to the creation and use of health information registries. The discussion in this chapter assumes three general models for health information registries. One model is the creation of a registry containing the contact, demographic, and diagnostic or exposureinformation of potential research subjects who will be individually notified about projects in which theymay be eligible to participate. The notification process permits the registry to shield registry participants from an inordinate number of invitations to participate in research projects, as wellas to protect pri vacy. This model is particularly applicable to patients with unusual conditions, patients who constitute a vulnerable population, 155or both (e.g., children with a rare condition). A secondmodel is the creation of a registry and allsubsequent research use of re gistry data by the same group of in vestigators. No disclosures of registry data will occur and all research activities have the same scientific purpose. This model applies ingeneral to quality-related investigations of a clinical procedure or ser vice. A third model is the creation of a registry for an initial, specific purpose by a group of investigators with the express intent to use registry data themselves, as well as to disclose registry data to other investigators for additional related or unrelated scientific purposes. An example of this last model is a registry of health information from patients diagnosed with a condition that has multiple kno wn comorbidities to which registry data can be applied. This third model is most directl y applicab le to industr y-sponsored registries. The American College of Epidemiology encourages the data sharing contemplated in this last registry model. 156Data sharing enhances the scientific utility of registry data and diminishes thecosts of compilation. A registry developer should try to evaluate how the regulations appl y to each of these models. Re gistry developers are strongly encouraged to consult with their organization' s Privacy Officer and IRB or Privacy Board early in the planning process toclarify applicable regulatory requirements and the probable effect of those requirements onconsiderations of registry design and development. Public Health, Health Oversight, FDA-Regulated Products When Federal, State, or municipal public health agencies create registries in the course of publichealth practice, specific legislation typicallyauthorizes the creation of the registries and regulatesdata acquisition, maintenance, security, use, and disclosures of registry data for research. Ethicalconsiderations and concerns about maintaining the confidentiality of patient information used by publichealth authorities are similar to those for research use, b ut they are explicitly balanced against potential social benef its during the le gislati ve process. Nonetheless, if the registry supports research activities as well as its public health purposes, Common Rule requirements for IRB review may apply to the creation of the registry. Cancer registries performing public health surveillance acti vities mandated by State law are well-kno wn e xceptions to Common Rule re gulation. Secondary uses of public health registry data for research and the creation of registries funded bypublic health agencies such as the CDC and theAgenc y for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as sponsored research acti vities may be subject to the Common Rule. The Common Rule' s definitions of human subjects research 157may encompass these activities, which are discussed in the next subsections of this chapter. Not all cancer registries suppor t pub lic health practice alone, e ven though the registries are the result of governmental programs. For example, the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, funded by the National Cancer Institute, operatesand maintains a population-based cancer reporting system of multiple re gistries, including public use data sets with public domain software. SEER program data are used for man y research purposes in addition to aiding pub lic health practices. 158 Disclosures of health information by health care providers and insurance plans for certain defined public health activities are expressly recognized asChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 100an exception to Privacy Rule requirements for patient authorization.159An example of a public health activity is the practice of surveillance, which monitors and disseminates the distributions and trends of designated risk factors, injuries, ordiseases in populations. 160Health care providers or insurance plans are likely to demand documentationof public health authority for legal review before making any disclosures of health information.Registry developers should obtain this documentation from the agency that funds or enters into a contract for the registry and present it to the health care provider or insurance plan well in advance of data collection efforts. The Privacy Rule permits uses and disclosures by health care providers and insurance plans for \"healthoversight activities\" authorized by law. 161These activities include audits and investigations involvingthe \"health care system\" and other entities subject togovernment re gulatory programs for which health information is relevant to determining compliance with program standards. 162The collection of patient information, such as occurrences of decubitusulceration, from nursing homes that are operatingunder a compliance agreement with a Federal or State health care pro gram is an e xample of a health oversight acti vity. The Privacy Rule characterizes responsibilities related to the quality, safety, or effectiveness of aproduct or activity regulated by FDA as public health activities. This public health exception for uses and disclosures of patient infor mation in connection with FD A-regulated products or activities includes adverse event reporting; product tracking; product recalls, repairs, replacement, or look-back; and postmarketing surveillance (e.g., aspart of a risk management program that is a condition for appro val of an FD A-regulated product). 163 Research Purpose of Registr y The Common Rule defines \"research,\" and that definition is partially restated in the Privacy Rule. These regulatory definitions affect how the regulator y requirements of each r ule are applied to research activities.164In the Common Rule: Research means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing andevaluation, designed to develop or contribute togeneralizable knowledge. Activities which meetthis definition constitute research for purposesof this policy, whether or not they are conductedor supported under a program which isconsidered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and serviceprograms may include research activities. 165 OHRP interprets the Common Rule definition of research to include activities having anyresearch purpose, no matter what the ostensible objective of the activity may be. Compliance with Common Rule requirements depends on the nature of theorganization where the registry resides. If an organization receives Federal funding for research, then it is lik ely that Common Rule requirements apply. The Privacy Rule' s definition of research 166restates the first sentence of the Common Rule definition. However, the Privacy Rule distinguishes between research and quality improvement/assuranceactivities conducted by covered entities, 167which are defined as \"health care operations. \"168As a result, if the primary purpose of a quality-related re gistry maintained b y a covered entity is to support a research activity (i.e., to create generalizable knowledge), Privacy Rule requirements for research apply to the use or disclosure of the patient information to create the registry and to subsequent research use of registry data. If, however, the primary purpose is other than to create generalizable knowledge, the study is considered a health careoperation of the covered entity and is not subject to Privacy Rule requirements for research activities or patient authorization. As noted earlier, both public health practice and quality I/A activities can be difficult to distinguish from research activities. 169The determination of whether a particular registry should be considered as or include a research activity depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the or ganization where the registry will reside; the employmentSection I. Creating Registries 101duties of the people performing the activities associated with the registry; the source of fundingfor the registry; the original, intended purpose of the registry; the sources of registry data; and whether subsequent uses or disclosures of registry data arelikely. Quality I/A activities entail many of the same ethical concerns about protecting the confidentialityof health information as research activities do. Express consent to quality I/A activities is not theusual practice; instead, the professional and cultural norms of health care providers, both individual andinstitutional, regulate these activities. Registrydevelopers should consider whether the ethical concerns associated with a proposed quality I/A registry require independent review and the use ofspecial procedures, such as notice to patients. Registry advisory committee members, quality I/Aliterature, 170hospital ethics committees, IRB members, and clinical ethicists can mak e valuab le contributions to these decisions. To avoid surprises and delays, the decision about the nature of the activity that the registry is intended to support should be made prospectively, inconsultation with appropriate officials of thefunding agenc y and of ficials of the or ganization where the re gistry will reside. Some research institutions may have policies that either require IRB review for quality I/A activities, especially ifpublication of the activity is likely, or exclude them from IRB review. Most frequently, IRBs make this deter mination on a case-by-case basis. Potential for Individual Patient Identification The specif ic regulatory requirements applicable to the use or disclosure of patient information for the creation of a re gistry to suppor t research depend in part on the extent to which patient information received and maintained by the registry can be attributed to a particular person. Various categories of information, each with a variable potential foridentifying individuals, are distinguished in the Privacy Rule: individually identifiable health infor mation, \"de-identified\" information, and a \"limited data set\" of information. 171The latter twocategories of information may or may not include a code linked to identifiers. If applicable, Common Rule requirements affect all research involving patient information that isindividually identifiable and obtained by theinvestigator conducting the research. The definitionof \"human subject\" in the Common Rule is \"a livingindividual about whom an investigator (whetherprofessional or student) conducting research obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with theindividual, or (2) identifiable private information.\" This regulatory definition further explains: Private information includes . . . information which has been provided for specific purposesby an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (forexample, a medical record). Private information must be indi viduall y identif iable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascer tained b y the investigator or associated with the infor mation) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research involving human subjects. 172 In short, the Common Rule definition of \"human subject\" makes all research use of identifiablepatient infor mation subject to its requirements; if the identity of the patients w hose infor mation is used for research pur poses is notreadil y ascertainable to the investigator, the research is nothuman subjects research to which the Common Rule applies. Moreo ver, research in volving the collection of information from existing records is exempted from the Common Rule if the information is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, directly or through identifiers(coded link), to the subjects. Registry developers should consult the IRB earl y in the process of selecting data elements to obtain guidance about whether registry activities constitute human subjects research or ma y be e xempt from Common Rule requirements. Also among the criteria specif ied by the Common Rule for IRB approval of research involving human subjects are pro visions to protect the pri vacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality ofChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 102data.173In addition, the consent process for research subjects should include explicit information about confidentiality protections for the use of records containing identifiers.174 Data collection frequently requires patient identifiers, especially in prospective registries withongoing data collection, revision, and updates.Secondary or subsequent research use by outsideinvestigators (i.e., those not involved in the original data collection) of patient information containingdirect identifiers is complicated, however, because ethical principles for the conduct of human subjectsresearch require that risks, including risks to confidentiality of patient information, be minimized. In addition, the Privacy Rule requires an authorization to specifically describe the purposeof the use or disclosure of patient information. Unless the registry developer sufficiently anticipatesthe pur poses of secondary research, the authorization ma y not be v alid for the use of identifiable registry data for secondary research purposes. The Privacy Rule provides options for the collection and use of health information that isidentifiable to a greater or lesser extent; it alsocontains standards for de-identifying information and creating limited data sets. 175Nonetheless, use of identif iable health infor mation ma y be essential to population-based studies and to achie ve certain scientific and public health goals. Direct identifiers generally include a patient' s name, initials, contact information, medical record number, and Social Security Number , alone or in combination with other infor mation. As described by the Privacy Rule standard, a limited data set of patient infor mation does not include specif ied direct identifiers of the patient or the patient' s relatives, employer, or household members.176 In an electronic environment, masking individual identities is a comple x task. Data suppression limits the utility of the infor mation from the re gistry, and linkage or even triangulation of information can re- identify indi viduals. A technical assessment of electronic records for their uniqueness within any data set is necessary to minimize the potential for re-identif ication. In agg regated pub lished data, standard practice assumes that a subgroup size ofless than six may also be identifiable, depending on the nature of the data. An evaluation for uniquenessshould ensure that the electronic format does not produce a potential for identification greater than this standard practice, even when the information istriangulated within a record or linked with otherdata files. If a registry for research, public health, or other purposes will use any of the categories of health information discussed below, a registry developershould consult the IRB, the Privacy Officer, and the institutional policies developed specifically inresponse to the Privacy Rule early in his or herplanning. These consultations should establish the purpose of the registry, the applicability of the Common Rule requirements to registry activities,and the applicability of the Privacy Rule to the collection and use of registry data. In addition, theregistry developer should consult a representative of the Infor mation Technolo gy or Health Information System office of each health care provider or insurance plan that will be a source of data for the registry to obtain feasibility estimates of dataavailability and formats, as well as a representativeof the IRB or Privacy Board, for each data source. De-identif ied patient inf ormation . The Pri vacy Rule describes tw o methods for de-identifying health information.177One method requires the removal of certain data elements. The other method requires a qualified statistician to certify that the potential for identifying an individual from the data elements is ne gligible. A qualified statistician should ha ve \"appropriate knowledge of and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientif ic principles and methods for rendering information not individually identifiable\" in order to make this determination.178De-identified infor mation ma y include a code per mitting re- identification of the original record by the data source (covered entity).179The code may not be derived from information about an individual and should resist translation. In addition, the decodingkey must remain solely with the health care provider or plan that is the source of the patient infor mation. 180Section I. Creating Registries 103Research on existing data in which individual patients cannot be identified directly or indirectlythrough linked identifiers, does not involve human subjects, as defined by the Common Rule, and thus is not subject to the requirements of the Common Rule. 181Refer to the discussion later in this chapter. As a prudent business practice, each health care provider or insurance plan that is a source of de-identified information is likely to require an enforceable legal agreement with the registrydeveloper. It should be signed by an appropriate institutional official on behalf of the registrydeveloper. At a minimum, this agreement will likelycontain the follo wing terms, some of which may be negotiable: the identification of the content of the data and the medium for the data; a requirement that the data recipient, and perhaps the health careprovider or insurance plan providing the data, makeno attempt to identify indi vidual patients; the setting of fees for data processing and data use; limitationson disclosure or further use of the data, if any; and an allocation of the risks of legal liability for any improper use of the data. Limited data sets of health information . De- identified health information may not suffice tocarry out the pur poses of a re gistry, especially if the registry will recei ve follo wup infor mation through the monitoring of patients over time or information from multiple sources to compile complete information on a health event (e.g., cancerincidence). Dates of service and geographic location ma y be crucial to the scientific purposes of the re gistry or to the integrity and use of the data. Health information provided to the registry without direct identif iers ma y constitute a limited data set as defined by the Privacy Rule. 182A health care provider or insurance plan may disclose a limited data set of health infor mation b y entering into a data use agreement (DUA) with the recipient. The terms of the DUA should satisfy specific Privacy Rule requirements.183Institutional officials for both the data source and the re gistry developer should sign the DUA so a legal contract results. The DUA estab lishes the uses of the limited data set per mitted by the re gistry developer (i.e., the creation of the registry and subsequent use of registry data forspecified research purposes). The DUA may not authorize the registry developer to use or discloseinformation in a way that would violate the Privacy Rule if done by the data source. 184 An investigator who works within a health care provider or insurance plan to which the Privacy Ruleapplies and that is the source of the health information for a registry may use a limited data set to develop a registry for a research purpose. In these circumstances, the Privacy Rule still requires aDUA that satisfies the requirements of the Privacy Rule between the health care provider or insuranceplan and the investigator. This agreement may be inthe for m of a written confidentiality agreement. 185 A registry developer may assist a health care provider or insurance plan by creating the limiteddata set. In some situations, this assistance may be crucial to data access and a vailability for the registry. In order for the registry developer to create a limited data set on behalf of a data source, thePrivacy Rule requires the data source (the co vered entity) to enter into a business associate agreement with the registry developer (the business associate) that satisfies certain regulatory criteria. 186The business associate agreement is a binding legalarrangement that should be signed b y appropriate institutional of ficials on behalf of the data source and registry developer. This agreement contains terms for managing health information that arerequired by the Privacy Rule and that become a legally binding contract between the data source and data recipient. 187Most health care pro viders have developed a standard business associate agreement in response to the Privacy Rule and will likely insist on using it, although it ma y require some ne gotiated modifications for the production of registry data. The registry populated with a limited data set may include a coded link that connects the data back to patient records, pro vided the link does not replicate part of a direct identif ier.188The k ey to the code may allow health information obtained from monitoring patients o ver time to supplement e xisting registry data or allow the combination of information from multiple sources. Chapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 104The DUA for a limited data set of health information requires the data recipient to warrantthat no attempt will be made to identify the health information with individual patients or contact those patients. 189 If the registry data obtained by investigators constitute a limited data set and do not contain a coded link to identifiers, then the research would not involve human subjects, as defined by HHS regulations at 45 Code of Federal Regulations(CFR) 46.102(f), and the Common Rule requirements would not apply to the registry. 190An IRB or an institutional official knowledgeable aboutthe Common Rule requirements should mak e the determination of whether a research registry involves human subjects; frequently, a special formfor this purpose is available from the IRB. The IRB (or institutional official) should providedocumentation of its decision to the re gistry developer . Direct identif iers:authorization and consent . The Privacy Rule permits the use or disclosure of patient information for research with a valid, written authorization from each patient whose informationis disclosed. 191The Privacy Rule specifies the content of this authorization, w hich gi ves permission for a specif ied use or disclosure of the health information.192Health care providers and insurance plans frequently insist on use of thespecific authorization form they develop to avoid legal review and potential liability from the use of other for ms. One e xception to the requirement for an authorization occurs when a health care provider or insurance plan creates a registry to support its \"health care operations.\" 193Health care operations specifically include quality I/A activities, outcomesevaluation, and the development of clinical guidelines; ho wever, the Privacy Rule definition of health care operations clearl y excludes research activities.194For example, a hospital registry created to track its patient outcomes ag ainst a reco gnized clinical care standard as a quality improvement initiative has a health care operations purpose. The hospital w ould not ha ve to obtain an authorization for use of the health information from the patients it tracks in this registry.Research use of health information containing identifiers constitutes human subjects research asdefined by the Common Rule. 195In general, the Common Rule requires documented, legally effective, voluntary, and informed consent of eachresearch subject. 196 Documentation of the consent process required by the Common Rule may be combined with theauthorization required by the Privacy Rule for disclosure and use of health information. 197A health care provider or insurance plan may not immediately accept the combination of these forms as a validauthorization; it may insist on legal review of thecombination for m before permitting disclosure of any health information. Authorizations for the use or disclosure of health information under the Privacy Rule and informed consent to research par ticipation under the Common Rule should be legally effective\u2014i.e., patients mustbe le gally competent to provide these permissions. Adults, def ined in most States as 18 y ears and o ver, are presumed legally competent in the absence of a judicially approved guardianship. Children under 18 years old are presumed legally incompetent; abiological, adoptive, or custodial parent or guardianmust pro vide per mission on the child' s behalf. Registry developers should consult le gal counsel about situations in which these presumptions seem inapplicable, such as a registry created to investigatecontraceptive drug and device use by adolescents, and to which State law exceptions may exist. (See Case Example 16.) In addition to being v oluntar y and le gally effective, consent should be informed about the research, including what activities are involved, as well as the expected risks and potential benefits from participation. The Common Rule requires theconsent process to include specific elements of infor mation. 198Registry developers should plan to provide non-English-speaking patients with appropriate resources to assure that the communication of these elements during the consent process is comprehensible. All written informationfor patients should be translated, or alternatively, arrangements should be made for qualif ied translators to attend the consent process.Section I. Creating Registries 105Case Example 16: Issues With Obtaining Informed Consent Description The Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network (RCSN) is a prospective, national registry ofstroke patients in Canada. The registry, currently in Phase III, isa non-consent-based registry that collects detailed clinical data on the acute stroke event, from the onset of symptoms, emergency medical service transport, and emergency department care to hospital discharge status. The purposes of the registry are to monitor stroke care delivery, to evaluate the Ontario Stroke System, and to pro vide a rich clinical database for research. Sponsor Canadian Stroke Network, Networks of Centres of Excellence, and Ministry of Health and Long Term Care of Ontario Year Star ted 2001 Year Ended Ongoing No. of Sites 12 in Phase III (21 sites in Phases 1 and II) No. of Records 23,886 Challenge The registry began in 2001 with Phase I, which gathered data from 21 hospitals in Canada. All patients admitted to the hospital or seen in the emergency department with symptoms of acute stroke within 14 days of onset or transient ischemic attack (TIA), as well as those with acutein-hospital strok e, were included in this phase. Research nurse coordinators identified eligible patients through dail y reviews of emergency and admission patient lists and approached thesepatients for consent. Informed patient consent was required for full data collection, linkages to administrative data, and 6-month followupinterviews. Despite the need for informed consent for full data collection, consent was obtained for only 39 percent of eligible patients. Subsequent analysesshowed that patients who consented to participate were not representative of the overall strokepopulation, as they were less likely to have severeor fatal stroke, and also less likely to have minorstroke or TIA. Phase II of the re gistry began in 2002, with 21 hospitals and 4 Ontario Telestrok e sites. In this phase, all patients admitted to the hospital or seen in the emergency department with symptoms ofacute stroke within 14 days of onset or TIA wereincluded. P atients with in-hospital stroke were no longer recruited. In order to standardize workload across the country, a random sample of eligible patients w as selected to be approached for consent for full data collection. Consent was obtained on50 percent of eligib le patients. After obtaining consent of onl y 39 percent and 50 percent of patients in Phases I and II, the teamrealized that obtaining written patient consent forparticipation in the registry on a representative sample of strok e patients was impractical and costly. Patient enrollment threatened the viability and generalizability of the stroke registry. The registry team published these findings in the New England J ournal of Medicine in April 2004. Proposed Solution The registry team approached the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner to discuss a non-consent-based re gistry for Phase III. Because of these discussions, the registry was \"prescribed\" by the Privacy Commissioner under the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004, which allowed the registry to collect datalegally on stroke patients without written consent.Chapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy (continued) 106Results Phase III of the registry includes all patients presenting to emergency departments of the 11Stroke Centres in Ontario and 1 Stroke Centre in Nova Scotia with a diagnosis of acute stroke or TIA within 14 days of onset. Nurse coordinatorsidentify eligible patients through daily reviews of emergency and admission patient lists. Patientsare identif ied prospectively with retrospective chart review without consent. No followup interviews are done. Because informed consent is not required, the data collected over the past 3years provide a representative sample of strokepatients in Canada, making the data more viab le for use in research and in de veloping initiati ves to improve quality of care. Key Point The impact of obtaining informed consent should be considered in developing a registry. Requiringthat registries obtain the consent of patients with acute medical conditions such as stroke mayresult in limited selecti ve par ticipation, as it is not possible to obtain consent on all patients. For example, patients who die in the emergency department and patients who have brief hospital visits ma y be missed. Mechanisms such as obtaining a w aiver of informed consent or using the approach outlined in this case ma y be alternatives. For More Information Tu JV , Willison DJ, Silver FL et al. The impracticability of obtaining informed consent in the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network. N Engl J Med 2004 Apr; 350:1414-21.Section I. Creating Registries IRBs may approve waivers for both authorization (for disclosure of patient information for registryuse) and consent (to registry participation), provided the research use of health information satisfies certain regulatory conditions. In addition, thePrivacy Rule created Privacy Boards specifically toapprove waivers of authorization for the research useof health information in organizations without an IRB. 199Waivers are discussed in detail below. An important distinction exists between the Common Rule and Privacy Rule concerning the scope of permission to use health information forresearch purposes. Under the Common Rule,consent for par ticipation in future, unspecified research may be obtained, provided potential subjects receive clear notice during the consentprocess that this research is intended to occur. For an authorization to be valid under the Privacy Rule,however, the authorization should describe each purpose of the use or disclosure of health information.200 In certain limited circumstances, research subjects can consent to future unspecified research using their identifiable patient information. The CommonRule permits an IRB-approved consent process to bebroader than a specif ic research project 201and to include infor mation about research that ma y be done in the future. In its review of such future research, an IRB subsequently can determine that thepreviously obtained consent (1) satisfies the regulatory requirements for informed consent or (2) does not satisfy the re gulatory requirements for infor med consent. If it does not satisfy the regulatory requirement for informed consent, it requires an additional consent process; alter natively, the IRB may grant a waiver of consent, provided the regulatory criteria for waiver are satisfied. For example, an IRB-approved consent process for the creation of a research re gistry should include a description of the specif ic types of research to be conducted using registry data. For any future research that in volves identif iable information maintained by the registry, the IRB may determine that the original consent process (for the creation of the research re gistry) satisf ies the applicab le regulatory requirements, because the prospect ofCase Example 16: Issues With Obtaining Informed Consent (continued) 107future research and future research projects were adequately described. The specific details of thatfuture research on registry data may have been unknown when data were collected to create the registry, but the future research may have beensufficiently anticipated and described to satisfy theregulatory requirements for informed consent. Forconsent to be informed as demanded by the ethical principle of respect for persons , however, any description of the nature and purposes of the research should be as specific as possible. If a registry developer anticipates subsequent research use of identifiable registry data, he or sheshould request an assessment b y the IRB of the description of the research used in the consent process for potential subjects at the time the data areinitially collected. Nonetheless, in its review of anysubsequent research, an IRB may find it appropriateto require an additional consent process for eachresearch subject or to g rant a w aiver for obtaining further consent. The commentary accompanying the publication of the Privacy Rule clearly rejected broadening the description of purpose in authorizations to includefuture, unspecified research. 202As a result, the research pur pose stated in an original authorization for a re gistry limits the use of re gistry data to that purpose.203Subsequent use of registry data maintained within a health care provider orinsurance plan for a different research purpose requires a new authorization from each individual whose registry data would be involved or an appro ved waiver of authorization. Alternatively, the use or disclosure of a limited data set or de- identif ied re gistry data can occur , provided regulatory criteria are satisfied. Registries maintained by organizations to which the Privacy Rule does notapply (e.g., funding agencies for research that are nothealth care providers or insurance plans, professional societies, or non- health-care components of hybrid entities such as universities) are not legally bound by the limited purpose of the original authorization. However, data sources subject to the Pri vacy Rule are likely to be unwilling to pro vide patient infor mation without a written agreement with the registry developer thatincludes legally enforceable protections against redisclosure of identifiable patient information. Avalid authorization contains a warning to patients that their health information may not be protected by Privacy Rule protections in recipientorganizations. 204 Registry developers can request that patients obtain and share copies of their own records from theirhealth care provider or insurance plan. This strategy can be useful for mobile populations, such as elderlyretirees who occupy different residences in winter and summer. A Federal privacy law 205protects the health records of children held by schools fromdisclosure without e xplicit parental consent; thus, parents can often obtain copies of these records more easily than investigators. Alternatively, individuals can simply volunteer health information in response to an interview or survey. Thesecollection strate gies do not require obtaining a Privacy Rule authorization from each subject; however, IRB review and other requirements of the Common Rule, including careful protections of the confidentiality of registry data, may nonethelessapply to a registry project with a research purpose.Moreover, a registry developer may encounter Privacy Rule requirements for the use or disclosure of patient infor mation b y a health care pro vider or insurance plan for recr uitment purposes. For example, a patient authorization or waiver of authorization (discussed below) may be necessary for the disclosure of patient contact infor mation b y a health care provider or insurance plan (covered entity) to a registry developer. Certificates of confidentiality and other privacy protections . Cer tificates of conf identiality g ranted by the National Institutes of Health permanently protect identifiable information about research subjects from le gally compelled disclosure. F ederal law authorizes the Secretary of HHS (whose authority is delegated to NIH) to provide this privacy protection for subjects of biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and other research.206Federal funding for the research is not a precondition for obtaining a cer tificate of conf identiality.207An investig ator w hose research project has been granted a certificate of confidentiality may refuse toChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 108disclose identifying information collected for that research even though a valid subpoena exists for theinformation in a civil, criminal, administrative, or legislative proceeding at the Federal, State, or local level. The protection provided by a certificate ofconfidentiality is intended to prevent the disclosureof personal information that could result in adverseeffects on the social, economic, employment, or insurance status of a research subject. 208Detailed information about certificates of confidentiality is available on the NIH Web site.209 The grant of a certificate of confidentiality to a research project, however, is not intended to affectState la ws requiring health care and other professionals to report certain conditions to State officials, such as designated communicable diseases,neglect and abuse of children and the elderly, or threatened violent harm. If investigators aremandator y reporters under State law, in general they continue to ha ve a le gal obligation to make these reports. 210In addition, other legal limitations to the privacy protection provided by certificates of confidentiality exist and may be relevant toparticular research projects. Information on theNIH Web site describes some of these other legal limitations. 211 Registry developers should also be a ware that Federal law provides specific confidentiality protections for the identifiable information ofpatients in drug abuse and alcoholism treatment programs that receive Federal funding. 212These programs may disclose identifiable information about their patients for research acti vities onl y with the documented approval of the program director.213 The basis for the director' s appro val is receipt of written assurances about the qualifications of the investigator to conduct the research, the confidentiality safe guards incor porated into the research protocol, and no further disclosure of identifying information by the investigator. Moreover, an independent review of the research project should deter mine and verify in writing that the protocol provides adequate protection of the rights and w elfare of the patients and that the benef its of the research outw eigh an y risks topatients.214Prior to submitting proposed consent documentation to an IRB, registry developers should consult legal counsel for important information about the limitations of these confidentiality protections. As a condition of approval, IRBs frequently require investigators to obtain a certificate of confidentialityfor research involving information about substanceabuse or other illegal activities (e.g., underage purchase of tobacco products), sexual attitudes andpractices, and genetic information. Registry developers should consult legal counsel to determineif and how the limitations of a certificate ofconfidentiality may affect privacy protection planning for registry data. In all circumstances, the consent process should communicate clear notice to research subjects about the extent of privacyprotections they may expect for their healthinfor mation when it is incorporated into a registry. In the absence of a cer tificate of confidentiality, a valid subpoena or cour t order for re gistry data will usually compel disclosure of the data unless State law specifically protects the confidentiality of data. For example, Louisiana' s laws specifically protectthe collection of information on tobacco use fromsubpoena. 215On the other hand , a subpoena or cour t order ma y supersede State la w conf identiality protections. These legal instruments can be challenged in the court having jurisdiction for theunderlying legal proceeding. In some circumstances, research institutions may be willing to pursue such a challenge. The remote yet definite possibility of this sor t of disclosure should be clearly communicated to research subjects as a limitation on conf identiality protections during the consent process and in an authorization for use or disclosure of patient information. State law may assure the confidentiality of certain quality I/A acti vities performed by health care providers as peer re view activities. 216When State law protects the confidentiality of peer review activities, generall y it is implementing pub lic polic y that encourages internal activities and initiatives by health care providers to improve health care services by reducing the risks of medical er rors andSection I. Creating Registries 109systematic failures. Protection by peer review statutes may limit the use of data generated byquality I/A activities for any other purposes. Waivers and alterations of authorization and consent . As mentioned above, the Privacy Rule authorizes Privacy Boards and IRBs to sometimeswaive or alter authorizations by individual patientsfor the disclosure or use of health information forresearch purposes. In addition, the Common Rule authorizes IRBs to waive or alter the consentprocess. The Privacy Rule and the Common Rule each specify the criteria under which waivers oralterations of authorization and the consent process are per mitted. 217The potential risks to patients participating in the registry resulting from these waivers of permission differ. A waiver ofauthorization potentially imposes the risk of a loss of confidentiality and consequent invasion ofprivacy. A waiver of consent potentially imposes risks of har m from the loss of self-deter mination, dignity, and privacy expected under the ethical principles of respect for persons and beneficence . Acknowledging these potential risks, regulatorycriteria for waiver and alterations require an IRB orPrivacy Board to determine that risks are minimal. This deter mination is a necessar y condition for appro val of an in vestig ator's request for a w aiver or alteration of these per missions. The following discussion refers only to waivers; registry developers should note that Privacy Boards and IRBs may approve alterations to authorizations or the consent process, pro vided a requested alteration satisf ies allthe same criteria required for a waiver by the Privacy Rule or Common Rule. Alterations are generall y preferab le to w aivers in an ethical analysis based on the principle of respect for persons , because they acknowledge the importance of self-deter mination. In requesting alterations to an authorization or to the consent process, registry developers should be prepared to justify each proposed change or elimination of required elements. Plausib le justifications include a registry to which a specific element does not apply or a registry in w hich one element contradicts other required infor mation in the authorization or consent documentation. The justifications for alterationsshould relate as specifically and directly as possible to the regulatory criteria for IRB or Privacy Boardapproval of waivers and alterations. The Privacy Rule authorizes an IRB or Privacy Board to approve a waiver of authorization if thefollowing criteria are met: (1) the use or disclosureinvolves no more than minimal risk to the privacy ofindividuals; (2) the research cannot be practicablyconducted without the waiver; and (3) the research cannot be practicably conducted without access toand use of health information. The determination of minimal risk to privacy includes several elements:an adequate plan to protect identifiers fromimproper use or disclosure; an adequate plan to destroy identifiers, unless a health or research justification exists to retain them; and adequatewritten assurances that the health information will not be reused or disclosed to others, except asrequired b y law, as necessary for oversight of the research, or as per mitted b y the Pri vacy Rule for other research. 218The Privacy Board or IRB should provide detailed documentation of its decision for presentation to the health care provider or insuranceplan (covered entity) that is the source of the healthinformation for registry data. 219The documentation should clearl y communicate that each of the criteria for a w aiver required b y the Pri vacy Rule has been satisf ied.220The Pri vacy Board or IRB documentation should also provide a description of the health information it determined necessary to the conduct of the research and the procedure it used to approve the waiver.221A health care provider or insurance plan may insist on legal review of this documentation before permitting the disclosure of any health information. The criteria for a waiver of consent in the Common Rule are similar to those for a waiver of authorization under the Pri vacy Rule. An IRB should determine that: (1) the research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects; (2) the waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects; (3) the research cannot practicab ly be carried out without a waiver; and (4) whenever appropriate, subjects will be pro vided with additional infor mation after par ticipation.222The criterion for additional information can be satisfiedChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 110at least in part by public disclosure of the purposes, procedures, and operations of a registry, asdiscussed later in \"Registry Transparency.\" Some IRBs produce guidance about what justifications constitute \"not practicable\" and thecircumstances in which these justifications apply.For population-based research projects, registrydevelopers may also present the scientificjustification of avoiding selection bias. A waiver permits the registry to include the healthinformation of all patients who are eligible. An IRB may also agree to consider requests for a limitedwaiver of consent that applies only to thoseindividuals who decline use of their health information in a registry project. This limited waiver of consent most often permits the collectionof de-identified and specified information sufficient to characterize this particular population. An important difference between the Common Rule and FD A regulations for the protection of human subjects in volves consent to research par ticipation. The FDA regulations require consent, except for emergency treatment or research, and do not permit the waiver or alteration of informed consent. 223If registry data are intended to support the labeling ofan FD A-regulated product, a re gistry developer should plan to obtain the documented , legally effective, voluntary, and informed consent of each individual whose health information is included inthe registry. The Pri vacy Rule creates a legal right for patients, by request, to receive an accounting of certain disclosures of their health infor mation that are made by health care providers and insurance plans. 224The accounting must include disclosures that occur with a waiver of authorization approved by a Privacy Board or IRB. The Privacy Rule specifies theinformation that an accounting should contain 225and requires it to co ver a 6-year period or any requested shorter period of time.226If multiple disclosures are made to the same recipient for a single purpose, including a research pur pose, a summar y of these disclosures may be made. In addition, because most waivers of authorization cover records of many individuals, and thus an indi vidualized accounting in such circumstances may be burdensome, the PrivacyRule provides that if the covered entity has disclosed the records of 50 or more individuals for a particularresearch purpose, the covered entity may provide to the requestor a more general accounting, which lists the research protocols for which the requestor' sinformation may have been disclosed, among otheritems. 227 The Common Rule permits an IRB to waive documentation of the consent process under two different sets of regulatory criteria. The first set ofconditions for approval of this limited waiver require that the only record linking an individualsubject to the research is the consent document; the principal risk to subjects is the potential har m from a breach of confidentiality; andeach subject individually determines whether his or her consent should be documented.228Alternatively, an IRB can waive documentation of consent if the researchinvolves no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects andno procedures for w hich written consent is normally obtained outside of a research context.229For either set of regulatory criteria, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjectswith written information about the researchactivities in which they participate. 230The written infor mation ma y be as simple as a statement of research pur poses and acti vities or more elaborate, such as a Web site for regularly updated information describing progress on the research project. Summary of Regulatory Requirements The use and disclosure of health information by health care pro viders and insurance plans for research purposes, including registries, are assumed by the authors of this chapter to be subject to regulation under the Privacy Rule and may be subject to the Common Rule. In general, the Privacy Rule permits the use or disclosure of patient information for a registry, subject to specific conditions, in the following circumstances: (1) registries serving public healthactivities, including registries developed in connection with FDA-regulated products; (2) registries developed for the health care operations of health care providers and insurance plans (coveredSection I. Creating Registries 111entities), such as quality I/A; (3) registries created by health oversight authorities for health systemoversight activities authorized by law; (4) registries using de-identified health information; (5) registries using a \"limited data set\" patient information thatlacks specified direct registries usinginformation obtained with patient authorizations; or(7) registries using information obtained with a waiver of authorization. The Common Rule will apply to the creation and use of registry data if (1) the organization where the registry resides is subject to Common Rulerequirements and has an FWA that encompasses theregistry project; and(2) the creation of the re gistry and subsequent research use of the registry data constitute human subject research as defined by theCommon Rule and are not exempt from Common Rule requirements; and(3) registry activities include a research pur pose, which may be in addition to the main pur pose of the re gistry. Registry developers are strongly encouraged to consult the IRB, not only about the applicability of the Common Rule, but also about the selection ofdata elements, the content of the consent process orthe regulatory criteria for waiver, and any anticipated future research in volving identif iable registry data. State laws regulate public health activities and also may apply in various ways to the research use ofhealth information. NIH can issue certificates of confidentiality to particular research projects for the protection of identif iable personal information from most le gally compelled disclosures. Federal law provides specific privacy protections to the health infor mation of patients in substance ab use pro grams that receive Federal funding. The institutional policies of health care providers and insurance plans may also af fect the use and disclosure of the health information from their patient and insured populations. Legal requirements applying to use or disclosures of health infor mation for research can signif icantl y influence the planning decisions of registry developers and investigators. Early and frequent consultation with institutional pri vacy officers, Privacy Board or IRB staff and members,information system representatives of health care providers and insurance plans\u2014plus technologytransfer representatives and legal counsel, as necessary\u2014is prudent. Registry Transparency, Oversight, and Data Ownership Registry Transparency Efforts to make registry operations transparent (i.e., making information about registry operations publicand readily accessible to anyone who is interested) are desirable. Such efforts may be crucial torealizing the potential benefits of research using health infor mation. Re gistry transparenc y can also educate about scientific processes. Transparency contributes to public and professional confidence inthe scientif ic inte grity and validity of registry processes, and therefore in the conclusions produced by registry activities. Public information aboutregistry operations may also increase the scientificutility of registry data by promoting inquiries fromscientists with interests to w hich re gistry data may apply. Registry developers can achieve transparency by making the registry' s scientific objectives, governance, eligibility criteria, sampling andrecruitment strategies, general operating protocol, and sources of data available to anyone who is interested. Proprietary interests by fundingagencies, contractual conditions, and licensing terms for the use of patient or claims infor mation ma y limit to some extent the information about the registry that is available to the public. It is impor tant to stress that, w hile transparenc y and access to information are values to be encouraged, investments in patient registries that produce proprietary information are not intended to be discouraged or criticized. Neither the funding source nor the generation of proprietary information from a registry determines whether a registryachie ves the good practices described in this handbook. Funding agencies, health care pro viders, and insurance plans, ho wever, also have anChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 112important stake in maintaining public confidence in health information management. The extent ofregistry transparency should be prospectively negotiated with these entities. Creating a Web site of information about registry objectives and operations is one method ofachieving transparency; ideally, registry informationshould be available in various media. An IRB mayrequire registry transparency as a condition of approval to satisfy one of the regulatory criteria forgranting a waiver of consent. The regulatory requirement is to provide \"additional pertinentinformation after participation.\" 231Currently, an international transplant registry maintains a Web site that provides a useful model of registry transparency.232 Registry Oversight Registry governance must reflect the nature and extent of registry operations. As described in Chapter 2, possib le go verning structures can vary widel y, from the re gistry developer as a sole decisionmaker to committee(s) comprising representatives of all stakeholders in the registry,including in vestigators, the funding agency, patients, clinicians, biostatisticians, information technologyspecialists, and government agencies. Registry developers should also consider appointing an independent advisory board to provide oversight of registry operations. An advisory board can assist registry operations in two important areas: providingguidance for the technical aspects of the registry operations and estab lishing the scientific independence of the re gistry. The latter function can be valuable when dealing with controversies, especiall y those about patient safety and treatment, or actions by a regulatory agency. Advisory board members collectively should have relevant technical expertise but include appropriate representatives of other registry stakeholders, including patients.Advisory board oversight should be limited to making recommendations to the ultimate decisionmak er, whether that is an executive committee or the registry developer. Registry developers may also appoint other types ofoversight committees to resolve specific recurring problems, such as verifying diagnoses of patientconditions or adjudicating data inconsistencies. Data Ownership Health information ownership in general . Multiple entities are positioned to assert ownershipclaims to health information in various forms. Certain States have enacted laws that assignownership to health records. 233The Privacy Rule was not intended to affect existing laws governingthe ownership of health records. 234At the current time, such claims of ownership are plausible, butnone is known to be legally tested or recognized, with the e xception of cop yright. The entities potentially claiming ownership include health care providers and insurance plans, funding agencies forregistry projects, research institutions, andgovernment agencies. Individuals may also assert ownership claims to health information, including patients, re gistry developers, and in vestigators. The basis for these claims is control of the tangible expression of and access to the health information. There is no le gal basis for assertions of ownership for facts or ideas; in f act, estab lished pub lic policy supports the free exchange of ideas and wide dissemination of facts as fundamental to innovationand social pro gress. 235As health infor mation mo ves from its creation as a tangible expression to various forms in the control of successive entities, rights of ownership may be transferred (assigned), shared, or maintained , with use of the information licensed (i.e., a limited transfer of rights for use on specif ic terms and conditions). Cur rently, in each of these transactions, the rights of ownership will be negotiated on a case-b y-case basis and for malized in written private agreements. The funding agency for a registry may also assert claims to ownership as a matter of contract law in their sponsorship agreements with research organizations. Many health care pro viders are cur rently installing systems for electronic health records at great expense. Man y are also contemplating an asser tion of ownership in their health records, which may include ownership of copyright. The claim to ownership by health care providers may be anSection I. Creating Registries 113overture to commercialization of their health care information in aggregate form.236Public knowledge of and response to such assertions of ownership are uncertain at this time. A licensing program for the use of health information may permit health careproviders to recoup some of their investment inelectronic health records and the infrastructure,including full-time technicians, required to maintain them. In the near future, research use of healthinformation for a registry may require licensing in addition to the terms and conditions in data use agreements and, if necessary, in business associate agreements required by Privacy Rule regulations. Subsequent research use of the registry data will likely depend on the terms of the original license foruse. Publication rights are an important component of intellectual property rights in data for academicinstitutions. F ormal institutional policies may address pub lication rights resulting from f aculty educational and research activities. Moreover, the social utility and benefit of any registry is evaluated on the basis of its publicly known findings and anyconclusions based on them. The authors stronglyencourage registry developers to maximize public communication of re gistry findings through the customar y channels of scientif ic conferences and peer-reviewed journals. The goals of public communication for scientific findings and conclusions apply equally to registries operated outside of academic institutions (i.e., directl y by industry or professional societies). For further discussion of developing data access and publication policies for a registry, see Chapter 2. The concept of o wnership does not f it health information comfortably, because it largely fails to acknowledge individual patient privacy interests in health infor mation. An inescapab le personal ne xus exists between individuals and information about their health. A similar failure that occurred recently with regard to patient interests in residual tissue from clinical procedures resulted in widel y publicized litigation. 237Alternatively, the legal concept of custody ma y be useful. Custodians ha ve legal rights and responsibilities; for instance, those that a guardian has for a ward or parents have fortheir children. Custody also has a protective function, which supports public expectations ofconfidentiality for health information that preserves the privacy and dignity of individual patients. Custody and its associated legal rights andresponsibilities are also transferable from onecustodian to another. The concept of custody cansupport health care provider investments in information systems and the licensed use of healthinformation for multiple, socially beneficial purposes without denying patient interests in their health information. The sharing of registry data subsequent to their collection cur rently presents special ethical challenges and legal issues. 238The arrangements that will determine the essential conditions forshared use include applicable Federal or State law and regulatory requirements under which the healthinfor mation was originally obtained. These legal and re gulator y requirements, as w ell as processing and licensing fees, claims of property rights, and concerns about legal liability are likely to result in formal written agreements for each use of registrydata. To educate patients and to establish thescientific independence of their registry, registry developers should mak e transparent the criteria under w hich uses of data occur . In short, no widely accepted social or legal standards currently govern property rights in healthinformation, with the possible exception of copyright, which is discussed below. At this time, agreements between health information sources and other users pri vately manage access and control. The Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of health infor mation b y covered entities (certain health care providers and insurance plans), plus certain third parties working on behalf of covered entities, b ut does not af fect cur rent la ws re garding property rights in health information, when they exist. Copyright protection for health information registries . In theor y, a health infor mation re gistry is likely to satisfy the statutory definition of a compilation239and reflect independent creativity by its de veloper .240Thus, cop yright la w ma y pro vide certain protections for a health information registryChapter 6. Principles of Registry Ethics, Data Ownership, and Privacy 114existing in any medium, including electronic digital media. The \"facts\" compiled in a healthinformation registry, however, do not correlate closely to other compilations protected by copyright, such as telephone books or even genetic databases. 241 Instead registry data constitute legally protected, confidential information about individual patients towhich independent and varied legal protections apply. Copyright protections may marginallyenhance, but do not diminish, other legal restrictions on access to and use of health information and registry data. For more information on copyright law, see Appendix B. Conclusions Ethical considerations are in volved in many of the essential aspects of planning and operating aregistry. These considerations can affect the scientific, logistical, and regulatory components of registry development, as well as claims of propertyrights in health infor mation and the registry. The guiding ethical principles for these considerationsare respect for persons , beneficence , and justice . At the most fundamental level, investigations that involve human subjects and are not capable ofachieving their scientific purpose are unethical. The risk-benefit ratio of such studies is unacceptable inan analysis based on the principle of beneficence , which obligates investigators to avoid harmingsubjects, as well as maximizing the benefits and minimizing the har ms of research projects. Ethical scientific design must be robust, be based on an important question, and incorporate sufficient statistical power, precise eligibility criteria, appropriatel y selected data elements, and adequately documented operating procedures and methodolo gies. In addition, an ethical ob ligation to minimize har ms involves planning adequate protections for the confidentiality of the health information disclosed to a re gistry. Such planning should include devising physical, technical, and administrati ve safeguards for access to and use of registry data. Reducing the potential har ms from the use of health infor mation in a registry is particularly important, becauseordinarily no offsetting benefit from participation in a registry accrues to individuals whose healthinformation is used in the registry. In an analysis applying the principle of justice , research activities that produce a significant imbalance of potentialrisks and benefits to participating individuals areunethical. Protection of the confidentiality of the health information used to populate a registry reflects the ethical principle of respect for persons . Health information intimately engages the privacy and dignity of patients. Registry developers shouldacknowledge public expectations of protection forpatient pri vacy and dignity with clear and consistent communications to patients about protections against inappropriate access to and use of registry data. The re gulator y requirements of the Pri vacy Rule and Common Rule have deep connections to past ethical concer ns about research in volving human subjects, to general social anxiety about pri vacy associated with rapid advances in health information systems technology and communications, and to current biomedical developments in human genetics.Compliance with these regulatory requirements notonly is a cost of doing b usiness for a re gistry project but also demonstrates reco gnition of the ethical considerations accompanying use of health information for scientific purposes. Complianceefforts by registry developers also acknowledge the important public relations and liability concerns of health care pro viders and insurance plans, public health agencies, health o versight agencies, and research organizations. Regulatory compliance contrib utes to and generall y suppor ts the credibility of scientific research activities and research organizations, as well as that of particular projects. Public conf idence is cr ucial to the continuing support of health care institutions, to which society entrusts the sick, and to academic institutions, to which society entrusts its children and its hopes for the future. Other Federal and State privacy laws may affect registry development, especially registries created for pub lic health pur poses. These la ws express an explicit, legislatively determined balance ofSection I. Creating Registries 115individual patient interests in health information against the potential social benefits from varioususes of health information, including research. Consultation with legal counsel is strongly recommended to determine the possible effect ofthese laws on a particular registry project. Ethical considerations also affect the operational aspects of registries, including governance,transparency, and data ownership. Registry governance, discussed in Chapter 2, should reflectboth appropriate expertise and representation of stakeholders, including patients. Advisorycommittee recommendations can provide usefulguidance in dealing with contro versial issues. Transparency involves making information about registry governance and operations publiclyavailable. Registry transparency improves both public and professional credibility for the scientificendea vors of a registry, the confidential use of health infor mation for scientif ic pur poses, and the results produced from analyses of registry data. In short, registry transparency promotes public trust. Claims of \"ownership\" for health information and registries are feasible, but have not yet been legallytested. In addition, public response to such claimsis uncer tain. On their f ace, such claims do not seem to ackno wledge patient interests in health information. Nonetheless, in theory, copyright protections for compilations may be applied to thepatient information held by health care providers and insurance plans, as well as to registries. Ingeneral, claims of property rights in health information are likely to be negotiated privately asadditions to the regulatory terms and conditions in formal agreements between registry developers, funding agencies, and health care providers orinsurance plans. As a practical matter, \"ownership\"implies operational control of registry data andpublication rights. In summary, careful attention to the ethical considerations related to the design and operation ofa registry, as well as the applicable legal requirements, will contribute to the success ofregistry projects and ensure the realization of theirsocial and scientif ic benefits. Summary of Privacy Rule and Common Rule Requirements In Table 8, which summarizes Privacy Rule and common Rule requirements, it is generally assumedthat the Privacy Rule applies to the data source\u2014i.e., that the data source is a \"co vered entity .\" The exception is Category 8, registry developers that use data not subject to the Pri vacy Rule. The infor mation in the tab le is merel y a summary that is subject to change by other applicable law and may be amplified by institutional policies. Reference to this tab le is not a substitute for consultation with appropriate institutional officials about the regulatory requirements that may apply to a particular registry project.Chapter 6.

Operating Registries 121Recruitment and retention of providers and patients are essential elements in the design and operation of a registry. The problems commonly described for clinical studies in general, such as difficulties withpatient enrollment, losses to followup, and certainsites contributing the majority of patients, can haveprofound negative consequences on registry validity because the registry patients that are enrolled are not randomized. When registry patients are notrepresentative of the target population, the results obtained are not meaningful. For policy determinations, the enrolled sites or providers mustbe representati ve of the types of sites and providers to which the policy determination would apply forthe results of the registry to be generalizable.Differences in how effectively sites enroll or follow patients can sk ew results and o verly reflect the sites with the most data. This oversampling within a particular site or location must also be considered in sample size calculations. If the sample size of a k ey unit of analysis is not sufficient to detect a clinically important difference, the validity of the entireregistry is weakened. (See Chapters 3 and 10.) Well-planned strategies for enrollment and retention are critical to a voiding these types of concerns about registry validity. Because registries typicallyoperate with limited resources and with voluntary rather than mandator y par ticipation by both providers and patients, it is par ticularl y important to keep an appropriate balance between participation burden and re ward. The ter m \"v oluntary\" in this context is intended to mean that participation in the registry by either providers or patients is not mandated (e.g., by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), nor is participation required as anecessary condition for a patient to gain access to a health care product or for a pro vider to be eligible for pa yment for a health care ser vice. Registries that are not voluntary have different drivers for participation. In general, the b urden of par ticipation should be kept as low as possible while the relative rewards, particularly nonmonetary rewards, shouldbe maximized. As described in Chapters 2 and 4, minimizing burden typically starts with focusing onthe key goals of the registry. Building participation incentives into a registry should also be included in the planning phase. Abroad range of incentives, spanning a spectrum from recognition, to monetary incentives, to useful data and reports, can and have been used in registries and are described further in this chapter. Many registries incorporate multiple types of incentives,even w hen the y pay for participation. Monetary incentives can be very helpful in recruiting sites. However, because the payments should not exceed fair market value for work performed, registriescannot solely rely on these incentives. A number ofnonmandated registries have achieved success in recruitment and retention b y pro viding a combination of ethical incentives that are tailored to and aligned with the specific groups of sites,providers, and patients that are ask ed to par ticipate. (See Case Examples 17, 18, and 19.) Recruitment Depending on the pur pose of a registry, recruitment may occur at any of three levels: facility (e.g., hospital, practice, phar macy), provider, or patient. While frequently these levels are a means to accrue patients for sample size pur poses, such as for a safety registry, they may also constitute potential units of analysis. As an example, a registry focused on systems of care that is e xamining both hospital system processes and patient outcomes might need to consider characteristics of the individual patients, the providers, and/or the places where they practice (i.e., clusters). If the question is about the practicesof orthopedic surgeons in the United States, the registry will be strengthened b y describing the number and characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and geographic distribution) of U.S. orthopedic surgeons, perhaps b y citing membership data from the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.Chapter 7. Patient and Provider Recruitment and Management 122Case Example 17: Building Value as a Means To Recruit Hospitals Description Get With The GuidelinesSM (GWTG) is the flagship program for in-hospital quality improvement of the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA).

As a result, in the absence of specific benefits, many hospitals defer the data collection and repor t utilization required for successful QI execution. Like most registries and QI programs, the sponsor' s program faced barriers to data entry. Unlike other registries, GWTG offered no reimb ursements for data entry and entered a market characterized by significant competition.The registry team wanted to motivate resource- strapped hospitals to consistently and proactively enter data and analyze improvement. Proposed Solution The team began by listening to the customer through indepth interviews designed to understandthe motivations and deterrents underlying behavior.Interviews were conducted with hospital decisionmakers at all levels (nurses, QIprofessionals, administrators/chief executive officers, and physicians). Based on the research findings, the team developed strategies that differentiated and built value for the pro gram. Some of the more noteworthy strate gies included the follo wing: Systems were designed to allow data transmission from and to Joint Commission and CMS v endors, enab ling hospitals to reduce the burden of duplicate data entry while still participating in other programs.

(See Chapter 3.) Hospital Recruitment A hospital or health system may choose to participate in a patient registry for many reasons, including the research interest of a particularinvestigator or champion, the ability for the hospitalto achieve other goals through the registry (such asrequirements for reimbursement, certification, or recognition), or the general interest of the particularinstitution in the disease area (e.g., specialty hospitals). Increasingl y, external mandates to document compliance with practice standards provide an incentive for hospitals to participate inregistries that collect and report mandatory hospitalperformance or quality-of-care data. For example, a number of registries allow hospitals to document their perfor mance to meet the Joint Commission (formerly JCAHO) requirements for hospitalaccreditation. 242Hospitals in the United States must submit these data to maintain accreditation.Therefore, hospital administrators ma y be willing to supply the staff time to collect these data without the need for any additional financial incentives from theregistry sponsor , provided that re gistry par ticipation allows the hospital to meet external quality-of-care mandates. In other cases, participation in a quality monitoring or health system surveillance registry may be required by payers or governments for differential pa yments or patient referrals under various pro grams, ranging from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services public reporting initiati ve, to centers of e xcellence pro grams, to pay- for-performance programs. The presence of quality assurance depar tments in U.S. hospitals provides a natural foundation for recruiting and supporting cooperative, hospital- based outcomes and perfor mance re gistries. In addition, the American Hospital Association database pro vides a v aluab le resource for identifying hospitals by key characteristics, including hospital ownership, number of beds, and the presence of an intensive care unit. 124Case Example 18: Using Registry Tools To Recruit Sites Description The objective of the OPTIMIZE- HF (Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with HeartFailure) registry was to improve quality of care and promote evidence-based therapies in heart failure. The registry provided a comprehensive process-of-care improvement program and gathered data that allowed hospitals to track their improvement over time. Sponsor GlaxoSmithKlineY ear Started 2003Y ear Ended 2005 No. of Sites 270 hospitalsNo. of Patients Over 50,000 Challeng e The re gistry was designed to help hospitals improve care for patients hospitalized with heart failure. The objective was to accelerate the adoption of evidence-based guidelines and increase the use of the guideline-recommended therapies,thereb y impro ving both short-term and long-term clinical outcomes for heart failure patients. Proposed Solution To increase compliance with guidelines, the registry team promoted the implementation of a process-of-care impro vement component and the use of comprehensive patient education materials. They combined these materials into a hospital toolkit, which included evidence-based practice algorithms, critical pathways, standardized orders, discharge checklists, pocket cards, and chart stickers. The toolkit also included algorithms anddosing guides for the guideline-recommendedtherapies and a comprehensive set of patient education materials. The team engaged the steering committee in designing the toolkit to ensure that the materials reflected both the guideline-recommended interventions and the practical aspects of hospital processes. In addition to the toolkit, the registry offered point- of-care tools, such as referral notes and patient letters that could be customized for each patient based on data entered into the registry. The registry also included real-time performancereports that hospitals could use to assess theirimprovement on a set of standardized measures based on the guidelines. Results The hospital toolkit was a key component of the marketing campaign for the registry. Hospitals could vie w the toolkit at recr uitment meetings, but they did not receive their own copy until they joined the program. The toolkit gained credibilityamong hospitals because its creators included some of the most prominent members of the heartfailure community . Hospitals also actively used the repor ts to track their impro vement o ver time and identify areas for additional work. Overall, the registry recruited 270 hospitals and met its patientaccrual goal 6 months ahead of schedule. Key Point Nonfinancial incentives, such as patient education materials, toolkits, and repor ts, can encourage sites to join a re gistry. Incentives that also add value for the site by improving their processes or providing materials that the y use frequentl y can aid retention.

Operating Registries 125Case Example 19: Using Proactive Awareness Activities To Recruit Patients fora Pregnancy Exposure Registry Description The Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry is a component of the Ribavirin Risk Management Program. It was designed to evaluate the association between ribavirin and birth defects occurring in the offspring of female patients exposed to ribavirin during pregnancy or the 6 months prior to conception, as well as female partners of male patients exposed to ribavirin during the same time period. The registry collects prospective, observational data on pregnancies and outcomes following pre gnanc y exposure to ribavirin. Sponsor Hoffmann-La Roche Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. Y Started 2003Year Ended Ongoing No. of Sites N/A (population-based)No. of Records Appro ximately 100 Challenge Ribavirin is used in combination with interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alfa for the treatment of hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C presents a serious health concern for approximately three million Americans, as the infection, if leftuntreated , can lead to end-stage liver disease, primary liver cancer, and death. When used as part of a combination therapy, ribavirin can significantly increase both viral clearance and liverbiopsy improvement for hepatitis C patients. However, ribavirin showed teratogenic properties in all animal models tested, making pregnancyexposure a concern. There are minimal data onribavirin exposure in human pregnancies. Thus the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)designated ribavirin as a Pregnancy Category X product based on the animal data, and ribavirin carries product label warnings against becomingpregnant. Despite the product warnings, pregnancies are likely to occur during ribavirin use because theincidence of hepatitis C is highest among people with reproducti ve potential (25-45 years of age). Health care professionals have insufficient data onthe teratogenic properties of ribavirin in humans to counsel pre gnant women exposed to ribavirin either during pregnancy or in the 6 months prior to conception. The registry was established to gather prospecti ve data on riba virin e xposure in pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes in order to better understand the actual risk. The re gistry collects data on direct exposures through the pre gnant female and indirect e xposures through her male sexual partner. Health care providers, pregnant patients, or pregnant patients'male sexual partners may submit data to the registry. The registry collects minimal, targeted data at each trimester and at the outcome of the pregnancy through the obstetric health careproviders. For live births, the registry collects data at 6 months and 12 months after the bir th by contacting the pediatric health care provider. To gather data on these patients, the re gistry needed to develop proactive awareness activities to make patients and pro viders a ware of the pro gram and encourage enrollment without promoting ribavirin use during pregnancy. Proposed Solution The registry team developed a multipronged approach to recruiting patients. First, the team developed a comprehensive Web site with infor mation for patients and pro viders. The WebChapter 7. Patient and Provider Recruitment and Management (continued) 126site contains fact sheets, data forms, information on how to participate, and contact information.The site also contains a complete slide set that health care providers can use for teachingactivities. While the site contains detailedinformation on the scientific reasons for theregistry, the tone and content of the Web site arepatient friendly, making it a good resource for bothpotential patients and providers. Next, the team began targeting professional service groups whose members might treat patients withribavirin e xposure during pre gnanc y. The gists, astroenterolo gists, obstetricians, and pediatricians. By contacting the groups' leadership and sending individualizedmailings to members, the team hoped to raiseawareness across a broad spectrum of providers.The team also talked to nursing groups, including a nursing group specifically focused on hepatitis and liver disease, with the goal of utilizing thenurse' s role as a patient educator . As a result of these ef forts, the American Gastroenterolo gical Association placed a link for the registry Web site on its Web site, and the American Association forthe Study of Li ver Diseases posted an expert opinion piece written by the registry advisory board chair on its Web site. The registry team also raised awareness among professional groups by attending conferences. In 2005, the team presented a poster about the registry, including some information ondemographics and program objectives, at the Centers for Disease Control and Pre vention (CDC) National Viral Hepatitis Pre vention Conference. To raise awareness among patients, the team talked to hepatitis C patient advocacy groups. The registry gained exposure with patients when one patient group wrote an article about the registry forits newsletter and included the registry phone number on its f act sheet. This effort led to many patient-initiated enrollments, despite the lack of patient incentives. In working with patients, the registry has found that emphasizing the goal ofgathering information to help future patients make better decisions resonates with patients. Mostpatients submit data to the registry over the phone, and the rapport that the interviewers havedeveloped with patients has helped to reduce thenumber of patients who are lost to followup. In addition to targeting providers and patients directly, the team enlisted the help of public healthagencies, since the registry has a strong public health purpose. CDC agreed to include a link on its Web site to the registry Web site, and theregistry team is no w tar geting other pub lic health agencies in hopes of posting infor mation on their Web sites. The team also re viewed the registry process to identify an y potential bar riers to enrollment. Under the initial rules for giving informed consent, the registry call center contacted patients and asked them if they were interested in participating. If patients agreed to participate over the phone, thecall center sent a package of infor mation through the mail, including an infor med consent document, which the patients needed to sign and return before they could enroll. While many patients agreed toparticipate o ver the phone, a much smaller number actually returned the informed consent document.The team identif ied the process of obtaining written informed consent as a key barrier to enrollment. After discussions with FDA, the registry team and FDA approached the study Institutional Re view Board (IRB) about recei ving a w aiver of written informed consent because of the public health impor tance of the re gistry. The IRB ag reed that oral consent over the phone would be sufficient for this study. Now, the call center can complete the enrollment process in a single step, as they can obtain oral consent over the phone and thenproceed with the interview. This change improved and streamlined the enrollment process and signif icantl y increased the number of par ticipants in the registry.Section II. Operating Registries Case Example 19: Using Proactive Awareness Activities To Recruit Patients for a Pregnancy Exposure Registry (continued) (continued) 127Throughout all of these recruitment activities, the registry team has emphasized that the purpose ofthe registry is to answer important safety questions for the benefit of future patients and providers. By focusing on the public healthpurpose of the registry, the team has been able toencourage participation from both patients and providers. The team has also found that a keyelement of their recruitment strategy is theirdetailed awareness plan, which calls for completing a wareness activities every month or two. Because the leadership and membership of professional groups change and new patientsbegin taking ribavirin, the team has found that continual awareness activities are important for keeping patients and providers aware of theregistry. Results Through proacti ve awareness acti vities, the registry team has generated interest in the project and enrolled appro ximatel y 100 exposed pregnancies with outcome information to date.The streamlined oral consent process has proven successful in this re gistry, and other pre gnancy registries have begun adopting it as a way to increase enrollments. Key Point Recr uitment acti vities ma y include w orking with professional groups, contacting patient groups, targeting public health agencies, and using a Web site to share information. Once recruitment and enrollment have begun, the registry team mayneed to re-evaluate the process to identify any potential bar riers to enrollment, if enrollment is not proceeding as planned. If a re gistry has an ongoing enrollment process, a plan to continually raise a wareness about the re gistry is an important part of the recruitment plan.Chapter 7. Patient and Provider Recruitment and Management Case Example 19: Using Proactive Awareness Activities To Recruit Patientsfor a Pregnancy Exposure Registry(continued)Table 9 describes characteristics of registries that can be critical for success in recruiting hospitals andlists methods that might be used for recruiting hospitals. While programs need not incorporate all of these characteristics or use all of these methods, successful programs typically incorporate several. Physician Recruitment There are many reasons why a physician practice may or may not choose to participate in a voluntaryregistry. As with hospitals, these reasons caninclude the research interests of the physician and the ability of the practice to achieve other goalsthrough the registry (such as reimbursement or recognition). When deciding to par ticipate, physicians often focus on several concerns: Relevance : Does the registry have meaning for the practice and patients? Trust : Are the goals clearly stated? Is the registry transparent? Risks : Will confidentiality be maintained? Are patient records secure? Effort: Will the amount of ef fort expended be properly compensated? Disruption : Will participation disrupt the activity of the staf f? Physicians who manage only a few patients per year with the disease that is the subject of the registry are less lik ely to be interested in enrolling their patients than physicians who see many such patients unlessthe disease is rare or extremely rare, in which case the registry may be of great interest. Because most re gistries are voluntary and physicians in nonacademic practice settings ma y have less infrastructure and staff available to enroll their patients, recr uitment of representati ve physicians is a major challenge for registries that aim to compare physician practices across a full spectrum of practice settings. In general, community-based physicians are less well equipped to collect data for research 128Table 9. Hospital Recruitment Keys to hospital recruitment The condition being studied satisfies one of the hospital' s quality assurance mandates. Sufficient funds, data, or other benefits will be realized to justify the effort required to participate. The confidentiality of the hospital' s performance data is ensured. Clinically relevant, credible, timely, actionable self-assessment data\u2014ideally data that are risk adjusted and benchmarked\u2014are provided back to the hospital to help it identify opportunities for enhancing patient care outcomes. High-profile hospitals (regional or national) are participating in the registry. Participation assists the hospital in meeting coverage and reimbursement mandates, gaining recognition as a center of excellence, or meeting requirements for pay-for-performance initiatives. Methods of hospital recruitment Identify eligible hospitals from the American Hospital Association database. Utilize stakeholder representatives to identify potentially interested hospitals.Enroll hospitals through ph ysicians w ho w ork there and are interested in the registry. Use invitation letters or cold calls to directors of quality assurance or chiefs of the clinical depar tment responsib le for the condition that is the tar get of the registry. If the registry has a physician advisory board, ask the board members to network with their colleagues in other hospitals. Reach out to physician contacts or hospital administrators through relevant professional societies or hospital associations. Leverage mandates by external stakeholders, including third-party payers, health plans, or government agencies.Section II. Operating Registries studies because they work in busy practices that are geared to routine clinical care rather than research.To increase recruitment of nonacademic physicians,it can be helpful to clearl y explain the purpose and objectives of the registry, how registry data will be used and specif ically that indi vidual results will not be shared or published and that registry outcomes data will be released only in large aggregates that protect the identities of individual hospitals, physicians, and patients. Table 10 describes some considerations that might improve success in recruiting physicians to participate in patient re gistries and outlines se veral methods of physician recruitment that are employed in different registries. Some registries use more than one approach. Vetting Potential Hospital and Physician Par ticipants Once potential hospital or physician participants have been identified, it is important to vet them to ensure that the registry is gathering the appropriate mix of data. Issues to consider when vettingpotential participants include: Representativeness. Hospital characteristics (e.g., bed size, geographic location). Physician characteristics (e.g., specialty training). Practice setting (health maintenance organization [HMO], private practice). Ability to recruit patients. V olume of target cases per year. 129Chapter 7. Patient and Provider Recruitment and Management Table 10. Physician Recruitment Keys to physician recruitment The condition being studied is part of the physician' s specialty. The registry is viewed as a scientific endeavor. The registry is led by respected physician opinion leaders. The registry is endorsed by leading medical, government, or patient advocacy organization(s). The effort needed to recruit patients and collect and submit data is perceived as reasonable. Useful self-assessment data are provided to physicians. The registry meets other physician data needs, such as maintenance of certification requirements, credentialing requirements, or quality-based differential reimbursement payment programs (pay-for-performance). Methods of physician recruitment Purchase mailing lists from physician specialty organizations. Ask opinion leaders in the f ield to suggest interested colleagues. Partner with local medical societies or large physician hospital organizations. Use stak eholder representati ves to identify interested physicians. Recruit and raise awareness at conferences. Advertise using e-mail and Web. Inter nal resources. Availability of a study coordinator on local physician or hospital staff. Availability of computer facilities (Internet connecti vity) for studies with electronic data capture. Patient Recruitment Patients may be recruited based on the judgment of the ph ysician w ho pro vides their care; the diagnosis of a disease; receipt of a procedure, operation, device, or pharmaceutical; membership in a health insurance plan; or being a member of a group of individuals who have a particular exposure.Recruitment of patients by the physician who is providing their care is one of the most successful strategies. The direct involvement in and support of the registry by their personal physicians is an impor tant f actor for patients. Since re gistries should not modify the usual care that physicians provide to their patients, there should be little or no conflict between the role of the physician as the patient' sdoctor and the role of the physician as a scientist in a research program (See Chapter 6.) In addition,patients ma y see par ticipation in the registry as an opportunity to increase their communication with their doctor. Another incentive for many patients is the feeling that the y are contrib uting to the knowledge base of sometimes poorly understood and under treated conditions. Recruitment of patients presents different challenges, depending on the nature of the condition being studied. In general, patient recr uitment plans should address the following questions: Does the plan understand the needs and interests of potential participants? Does the plan address patient recruitment issues and procedural challenges, including informed consent and e xplanation of risks? What are the patient retention goals? What is a reasonab le followup period? What is a reasonab le follo wup rate? When does retention compromise validity? What, if any, patient incentives are offered, including different types of incentives and the ethical, le gal, or study validity issues to be considered with patient incentives? What are the costs of patient recruitment and retention? Table 11 describes several keys to patient recruitment and outlines methods of recruitment,grouped by the basic categories of patients at thetime of recruitment. Partnerships as Recruitment Tools Many agencies/organizations can assist in the recruitment of physicians and patients. Thesepartners may have access to patients or their families and physicians who treat the condition, andthey may lend credibility to the effort. These agencies/organizations include: Government agencies. Physician professional associations or State medical associations. Patient advocacy groups (e.g., Muscular Dystrophy Association). Nonprofit foundations (e.g., Robert Wood Johnson F oundation). Industr y (e.g., phar maceutical companies). HMOs and other third-party insurance providers. Procedural Considerations Related to Recruitment When developing a recruitment plan for a registry, consideration should be given to the proceduralconcerns that may be factored into potential participants' decisions. These concerns include the clarity of the contract, the process for institutionalreview board (IRB) approval, and confidentiality. The f irst step in recr uiting par ticipants is usually the development of a generic contract that can be presented to hospitals or physicians. This contract should clearl y state the roles and responsibilities of the participants, the data coordinating center, and the sponsor. If monetary remuneration is being offered, the amount and requirements that need to be fulfilled before payments are made should be stated.It is often worthwhile to explain to sites the concept of fair mark et value. There is no specific formula (such as whether to separate startup payments fromper-patient payments), but total remuneration must reflect work effort and should be determined basedon the facts in each registry. Some individual factors, ranging from location to specialty, may have a bearing on fair market value. It is also importantto spell out which body will have ownership of thedata and how the data will be used. The contract should clearly explain the registry policy regarding any necessary approvals. Generic templates can be offered to participants to assistthem in obtaining ethical and IRB approval. Because the costs of obtaining IRB approval areoften substantial, it is essential that the contract with the par ticipants clearly indicates which party is responsible for bearing this cost. Lastly, confidentiality is a key requirement. Methods of ensuring institutional, physician, and patient conf identiality need to be clearl y elucidated in all registry-related documentation. Case-report forms and patient lo gs must be designed to minimize patient identif ication (such as b y transmitting limited data sets rather than more identifiable information if such information is notrequired to meet a registry objective). Retention Once hospitals and ph ysicians are recruited into registries, maintaining their participation becomes akey to success. All of the factors identified as important for recruitment are important for retention as well. A critical factor in retention is ensuring that promises made during recr uitment (e.g., that the burden of par ticipation is lo w) prove to be true during site implementation. By carefully pilot testing all aspects of the re gistry prior to full recruitment, there is less likelihood that problems will arise that threaten the reputation of the registry. Registries with an advisor y board or steering committee can use this resource to help with retention. The advisory board adds transparency and credibility , sets appropriate expectations among its peers on w hat to e xpect from a registry (e.g., compared with a clinical trial), ensures that the burden of the re gistry is minimized (or at least ne ver outweighs its value to participants), and maintains130Section II. Operating Registries 131Chapter 7. Patient and Provider Recruitment and Management Table 11. Patient Recruitment Keys to patient recruitment Recruit through a physician who is caring for the patient. Communicate to the patient that registry participation may help to improve care for all future patients with the target condition. Write all patient materials (brochures, consent forms) in a manner that is easily understandable by the lay public. Keep the survey forms short and simple. Provide incentives\u2014nonmonetary (such as newsletters, reports) and in some cases, monetary (if approved by the Institutional Review Board). Methods of patient recruitment Noninstitutionalized residents of the general U.S. population: Recruit via letter survey or by telephone. Recruit during well-patient visits to outpatient clinics. Outpatients attending the clinic of a physician who is participating in the registry: Recruit through the patient' s physician. Recruit via brochures placed in physician' s office. Hospital inpatients w ho are hospitalized for treatment of a condition that is the subject of the registry: Recruit through the patient' s physician.Recruit through hospitalists or consultant specialists. Recruit through a hospital research nurse. Residents of nursing homes and similar long-term care facilities: Establish a relationship with the nursing home and staff. the rele vancy and currency of the registry for the investigators. Ideally, advisory board members serve as ambassadors for the program. The level of credibility , engagement, practicality, and enthusiasm of the advisory board can significantly affectprovider recruitment and retention. For example, anadvisor y board whose clinical members are not themselves participating in the registry will have greater dif ficulty addressing the concerns of participating practices that invariably arise over the course of the re gistry. Throughout the registry, communication from the data coordinating center and the advisors, as well ascommunity building, are important for strong retention. Earl y and continued engagement of the site champions or principal in vestigators can help tremendously. Some registries utilize a small number of f ace-to-f ace meetings of all site principal investigators. While this is not always economically feasible, online meetings can be performed with similar effect. Visibility of the registry at relevantnational meetings can help maintain clinician awareness and sense of community, and regular presentations and pub lications reinforce the credibility of the re gistry to its participants. As the data set grows, so too does the value of the registryfor all participants, and regular updates on theregistry growth can be important. Finally, enhancing site value through nonfinancial rewards can be par ticularl y useful in retention, and the registry should continually seek to bring value to the participants in creati ve and useful w ays. Participation retention tools include: Web sites. Newsletters.Telephone help lines. Instruction manuals. Training meetings. Site audit/retraining visits. Customer satisfaction/opinion surveys. Regular data reports to stakeholders. Presentations at conferences. Regular reports to registry participants on registry growth and publications. Pitfalls in Recruitment and Retention Pitfalls abound in recruitment and retention. The most impor tant is the risk of bias. Targeting hospital- or academic-based physicians to the exclusion of community-based physicians istempting because the former are often moreaccessible and are frequently more open toinvolvement in and more experienced in research projects. If an advisor y board or committee is used to help design the registry and aid in recruitment, there may be a tendency for advisors to recruitknown colleagues or target disease experts, when a wider range of participants may be necessary toprovide the appropriate data to meet the researchgoals. Biases in patient recr uitment can also occur . For example, older and more seriously ill patients may be excluded because of challenges in enrollment and followup. F rom the outset, ph ysicians in volved in recruitment efforts need to be aware of the potential for bias, and they must understand the importanceof adhering to well-delineated inclusion and exclusion criteria. They must also adhere to the registry' s enrollment strategy, which is typicallydesigned to reduce this bias (e.g., consecutive or randomized enrollment). In addition, o verly demanding followup schedules can affect retention. The schedule should be designed to obtain relevant data in a timel y fashion without o vertaxing the resources of patients and providers. Another major pitfall is confusing terminology. This can be a major problem when the registry is international. When designing training materials, instruction manuals, and questionnaires, it is critical that the language and terminology are clear and concise. Materials that are translated into other languages must undergo strict quality assurancemeasures to ensure that terms are translated properly.Proposed Model for Registry Site Recruitment and Management The model presented here describes the five basic steps of site participation in a registry. Each site may go through Steps 1 and/or 2 to establish interest in the registry and determine the feasibility ofparticipation. Participating sites then go throughSteps 3 through 5. Step 1 . Prerecruitment considerations: Does a site/organization meet the inclusion criteria for the registry? (See \"Vetting Potential Hospitals and Ph ysicians. \") Does the site ha ve an adequate population of cases? Does it have the necessary resources to support insertion of data into the registry (personnel orelectronic data transfer str uctures)? Are there barriers to contracts or IRB issues that are so significant as to impede a reasonable timeframe to recruit a site? Step 2 . During this phase, all points in \"Procedural Considerations Related to Recr uitment\" need to be reviewed as part of the feasibility assessment andfinal agreement to participate in the registry. Step 3 . Issues raised in \"Retention\" need to be addressed. Retention could include, but is not limited to, instruction manuals (paper/online) andtraining meetings. Step 4 . Is the site delivering quality data? Sites that do not deli ver quality data ma y need to be decommissioned. Step 5 . At the conclusion of a registry, it is desirable to share the results with the sites.132Section II. Operating Registries 133This chapter focuses on data collection procedures and quality assurance principles for patient registries. The integrated system for collecting, cleaning, storing, monitoring, reviewing, andreporting on registry data determines the utility ofthe data for meeting the goals of the registry.Quality assurance, on the other hand, aims to assure that the data were in fact collected in accordance with these procedures and that the data stored in theregistry database meet the requisite standards of quality, which are generally defined based on the intended purposes. In this chapter, the term\"registry coordinating activities\" is used to refer to the centralized procedures performed for a registryand the term \"registry coordinating center\" refers tothe entity or entities that performs these procedures and o versees the re gistry acti vities at the site and patient le vels. Because the range of registry purposes can be broad, a similar range of data collection procedures ma y be acceptable, but only certain methodologies may be suitable for particular purposes. Furthermore,certain end users of the data may require that data collection or validation be performed in accordancewith their o wn guidelines or standards. For example, a registry that collects data electronicallyand intends for those data to be used by the U.S. Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA) should meet the systems v alidation requirements of that end user of the data, such as 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 11 (21 CFR P art 11). Such requirements ma y have a substantial effect on the registry procedures. Similarly, registries may be subject to specific processes depending on the type of data collected, the types of authorization obtained, and thegovernmental regulations. Requirements for data collection and quality assurance should be def ined during the re gistry inception and creation phases. Certain requirements may have significant cost implications, and these should be assessed on a cost-to-benefit basis in the context of the intended purposes of the registry.This chapter describes a broad range of centralized and distributed data collection and quality assuranceactivities that are currently in use or expected tobecome more commonly used in patient registries. Data Management Database Requirements or Case Report Forms Chapter 1 def ined a k ey characteristic of patient registries for evaluating patient outcomes as the use of highly structured data. As in randomizedcontrolled trials, the case report form (CRF) is theparadigm for this structure. A CRF is a formatted listing of data elements that can be presented in paper or electronic for mats. More impor tantly, a CRF is a representation of the patient-level fields and data entry options in the registry database; it could also be described as the database requirements. Def ining the re gistry CRFs or database requirements is the first step in data collection. Chapter 4 describes the selection of data elements for a re gistry. Two related documents should also be considered part of the database requirements: the data dictionary (including data definitions) and the data validation parameters or edits. The data dictionar y and definitions describe both the data elements and how those data elements are interpreted. The data dictionary contains a detailed description of each variable used by the registry, including the source ofthe variable, coding information if used, and normal ranges if rele vant. For example, the term \"current smoker\" should be defined as to whether \"smoker\" refers to tobacco or other substances and whether \"current\" refers to acti ve or within a recent time period. Several cardiovascular registries, such as the Get With The Guidelines SMCoronar y Artery Disease program,243define \"current smoker\" as someone who smoked tobacco within the last year.Chapter 8. Data Collection and Quality Assurance 134Data validation parameters refer to the logical checks on data entered into the database againstpredefined rules for either value ranges (e.g., systolic blood pressure less than 300 mmHg) or logical consistency with respect to other data fieldsfor the same patient; these are described more fullyunder \"Cleaning Data,\" below. While neitherregistry database structures nor database requirements are standardized, the Clinical DataInterchange Standards Consortium 244is actively working on representative models for data interchange and portability using standardized concepts and formats. Chapter 4 further discusses these models, which are applicable to registries as well as clinical trials. Data Collection: Procedures, Personnel, and Data Sources Data collection procedures need to be carefully considered in planning the operations of a registry. Successful registries depend on a sustainableworkflow model that can be integrated into the day-to-da y clinical practice of acti ve physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients with minimal disr uption. (See Chapter 7.) Programs can benefit tremendousl y from preliminary input from health care w orkers or study coordinators w ho are likely to be participants. Pilot testing . One method of g athering input from likely participants before the full launch of a registry is pilot testing. Whereas feasibility testing, which is discussed in Chapter 2, focuses on whether a registry should be implemented, pilot testing focuses on ho w it should be implemented. Piloting can range from testing a subset of the procedures, CRFs, or data capture systems to a full launch of the registry in a limited subset of sites and patients. The k ey to ef fective pilot testing is to conduct it at a point where the results of the pilot can still be used to modify how the registry will be implemented. Through pilot testing, one can assess comprehension, acceptance, feasibility, and otherfactors that influence how readily the patient registry processes will fit into patient lifestyles and the nor mal practices of the health care provider. Chapter 4 discusses pilot testing in more detail.Documentation of procedures . The data collection procedures for each registry should be clearlydefined and described in a detailed manual. The term \"manual\" here refers to the reference information in any appropriate form, including hardcopy, electronic, or via interactive Web or software-based systems. Although the detail of this manualmay vary from registry to registry depending on the intended purpose, the required information generallyincludes protocols, policies, and procedures, as well as the data collection instrument and a listing of all the data elements and their full definitions. If the registry has optional fields (i.e., fields that do not have to be completed on every patient), these should be clearly specified. In addition to patient inclusionand exclusion criteria, the screening process should be specif ied, as should any documentation to be retained at the site le vel and any plans for monitoring or auditing of screening practices. Ifsampling is to be perfor med, the method or systems used should be explained, and tools should be provided to simplify this process for the sites. Themanual should clearl y explain how patient identification numbers are created or assigned and how duplicate records should be prevented. Any required training for data collectors should also bedescribed. If paper CRFs are utilized , the manual should describe specifically how the paper CRFs are used and which parts of the forms (e.g., two-part or three- part no-carbon-required for ms) should be retained , copied, submitted, or archived. If electronic CRFs are utilized, clear user manuals and instructions should be available. These procedures are an important resource for all personnel involved in theregistry (and for external auditors who might be asked to assure the quality of the registry). The impor tance of standardizing procedures to ensure that the registry uses uniform and systematic methods for collecting data cannot be overstated. At the same time, some level of customization of data entry methods may be required or permitted to enable the participation of particular sites or subg roups of patients within some practices. As discussed in Chapter 7, if the re gistry pro vides payments to sites for participation, then the specificSection II. Operating Registries 135requirements for site payments should be clearly documented, and this information should beprovided with the registry documents. Personnel . All personnel involved in data collection should be identified, and their job descriptions andrespective roles in data collection and processingshould be described. Examples of such \"roles\" include patient, physician, data entry personnel, site coordinator, help desk, data manager, and monitor. The necessary documentation or qualificationrequired for any role should be specified in the registry documentation. As an example, someregistries require personnel documentation such as acurriculum vitae, protocol signoff, attestation of intent to follow registry procedures, or confirmation of completion of specified training. Data sources . The sources of data for a registry may include ne w infor mation collected from the patient, new or existing information reported by or derived from the clinician and the medical record, and ancillar y stores of patient infor mation such as laboratories. Since registries for evaluating patient outcomes should employ uniform and systematic methods of data collection, all data-relatedprocedures\u2014including the permitted sources ofdata; the data elements and their def initions; and the validity , reliability , or other quality requirements for the data collected from each source\u2014should be predetermined and defined for all collectors of data. As described under \"Quality Assurance,\" data quality is dependent on the entire chain of data collection and processing. Therefore, the validity and quality of the re gistry data as a whole ultimately derive from the least rigorous link, not the most. In Chapter 5, data sources are classified as primary or secondary based on the relationship of the data to the registry purpose and protocol. Primary datasources incorporate data collected for direct purposes of the registry (i.e., primarily for the registry). Secondary data sources are comprised of data originally collected for purposes other than the registry (e.g., standard medical care, insurance claims processing). The data are abstracted for registry purposes. The section below incorporates and e xpands on these def initions.Patient-reported data . Patient-reported data are data specifically collected from the patient for thepurposes of the registry rather than interpreted through a clinician or an indirect data source (e.g., laboratory value, pharmacy records). Such data mayrange from basic demographic information tovalidated scales of patient-reported outcomes. Froman operational perspective, a wide range of issues should be considered in obtaining data directly frompatients. These range from presentation (e.g., font size, language, reading level) to technologies (e.g., paper-and-pencil questionnaires, computer inputs, telephone or voice inputs, or hand-held patient diaries). Mistakes at this level can inadvertently bias patient selection, invalidate certain outcomes,or significantly affect cost. Limiting the patient- repor ted data to particular languages or technologies may limit par ticipation. Patients with specific diagnoses ma y have difficulties with specific technolo gies (e.g., small font size for visuall y impaired, paper and pencil for those with rheumatoid arthritis). Other choices, such asproviding a patient-repor ted outcomes instrument in a format or method of delivery that differs from how it was validated (e.g., questionnaire rather than interview), ma y invalidate the results. (See Case Example 20.) Clinician-r eported data . Clinician-repor ted or -derived data can also be divided into primary and secondary. As an example, specific clinician rating scales (e.g., National Institutes of Health Strok e Scale)245may be required for the registry but not routinely captured in clinical encounters. Some variables might be collected directly by the clinician for the registry or obtained from the medical record.Data elements that must be collected directly by the clinician (e.g., because of a par ticular definition or need to assess a specif ic comorbidity that ma y or may not routinely be in the medical record) should be specif ied. These designations are impor tant because they determine who can collect the data for a particular registry or what changes must be made in the procedures that the clinician follows in recording a medical record for a patient in a registry.Furthermore, the types of error that arise in registries (discussed under \"Quality Assurance\")Chapter 8. Data Collection and Quality Assurance 136Case Example 20: Developing Data- Collection Tools and Systems for Patient-Reported Data Description The Patient-Centered Diabetes Registry provides support for evidence-based diabetes care in several primary care practices in Colorado. The registry uses its database to send diabetes summary reports to patients and provides information to providers to be used at the point of care. The goal of the registry is to evaluate and improve diabetes care. Sponsor Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Year Star ted Planning be gan in 2004, with registry launch in late 2006 Y ear Ended To be determined No. of Sites 6No. of Records Registry is in initial launch phases Challeng e The registry works with six physician office practices to gather data on type 2 diabetes patients. These clinical data are extracted from electronic systems, including billing, laboratory, and pharmacy systems, and do not require any directdata entry on the part of clinicians or staff. The registry matches the clinical data with patient- repor ted data, w hich are gathered over the phone, by Web, or on paper. The registry uses the clinical and patient-repor ted data to produce patient care reports that summarize the patient' s diabetes care and self-management. These reports are sent to the patient and the provider in order to improve patient self-management and guideline-concordantcare. During the registry planning phase, the registry team w orked with its infor mation technolo gy (IT)department to develop data transfer systems to upload the clinical data from the practices' electronic systems. Once the clinical data were inplace, the registry team needed to develop datacollection tools and systems that the patients would find easy to use and accessible to collect thepatient-reported data. Proposed Solution The team planned to offer telephone, Web-based, and paper data entry options for patients. While they wanted to push the telephone and Web-based options, they did not want to eliminate anypotential patients because of type of data collection. To develop user -friendl y systems, the team completed extensive rounds of user acceptance testing before the registry launch. Most of the user acceptance testing focused on thetelephone and Web-based systems. While the technology was being built, the team completed a round of mock telephone testing and Web testing using screenshots and mock-ups. Thisallowed the team to make critical changes beforethe technolo gy de velopment was finished. Next, the team did a round of real-time \"w alk-throughs\" with volunteers. This round generated more feedback for the IT team, but the registry teamfound it difficult at times to convey the issues tothe IT team. To address this communication gap, the re gistry team included an IT team member in the user testing. Once the team had completed the user acceptance testing in English, it completed another round of testing in Spanish to make sure that all of thechanges were appropriate for the Spanish-language systems and for ms. To encourage participation in user testing, the team used incenti ves. Results Most of the par ticipants in the user testing w ere able to use and liked both the Web and telephone systems. Project staf f hoped that the telephone would be viewed as a helpful replacement to paper entry. Patients can call the system, and the system Section II. Operating Registries (continued) 137Chapter 8. Data Collection and Quality Assurance will differ by the degree of primary and secondary sources, as well as other factors. As an example,registries that utilize medical chart abstracters, as discussed below, may be subject to more interpretive errors. 246 Data abstraction . Data abstraction is the process by which a data collector other than the clinician interacting with the patient extracts clinician-reported data. While physical exam findings, such as height and weight, or laboratory findings, such aswhite blood cell counts, are straightforward, abstraction usually involves varying degrees ofjudgment and interpretation. Clarity of description and standardization of definitions are paramount to the assurance of dataquality and to the prevention of interpretive errorswhen using data abstraction. Knowledgeable registry personnel should be designated as resources for the data collectors in the field, and processes should be put in place to allo w the data collectors in the f ield continuous access to these designated registry personnel for questions on specific definitions and clinical situations. Registries that span long periods, such as those intended forsurveillance, may be well served by a structure thatallows for the re view of def initions on a periodic basis to ensure the timeliness and completeness of data elements and definitions and to add new data elements and definitions. A new product orprocedure introduced after the start of a registry is a common reason for such an update. Abstracting data from unformatted hard copy (e.g., a hospital char t) is often an arduous and tedious process, especially if free text is involved, and it usually requires a human reader. The reader, whose qualifications may range from a trained \"medical record analyst\" or other health professional to anuntrained research assistant, may be required to decipher ille gible handwriting, translate obscure abbre viations and acron yms, and understand the clinical content sufficiently to extract the desired infor mation. Re gistry personnel should de velop formal chart abstraction guidelines, documentation, and coding forms for the analysts and reviewers to use. Generall y, the guidelines include instr uctions to search for particular types of data that will go intoCase Example 20: Developing Data- Collection Tools and Systems for Patient-Reported Data (continued) also places outgoing calls to prompt patients to enter information on diabetes care, exercise,weight management, and tobacco use. The registry populates the database with thisinformation and matches it to the clinical datafrom the practices to produce short but detaileddiabetes summary reports. These reports areavailable on the Web and by mail for patients, and they are sent to the practices. The system also places outgoing calls as reminders for upcomingvisits. The registry was initially scheduled to launch in 2005, but the launch was delayed because oftechnology issues and changes that were made as a result of the user testing. The re gistry is currently in its launch phase, and while it is too soon to measure its success, the initial response tothe patient recr uitment ef forts has been positi ve. Key Point User acceptance testing can provide valuable information on how the registry procedures anddata collection tools will be percei ved by potential users. In cases w here patient-reported data are collected , user acceptance testing can be an important way to determine if the registry is patient friendl y and if there are an y procedures that could lead to selection bias in patient enrollment. 138the registry (e.g., specific diagnoses or lab results). Often the analyst will be asked to code the data,using either standardized codes from a codebook (e.g., the ICD-9 code [International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision]) corresponding to a textdiagnosis in a chart, or codes that may be unique tothe registry, (e.g., a severity scale of 1 to 5). Allabstraction and coding instructions must be carefully documented and incorporated into a datadictionary for the registry. Because of the \"noise\" in unstructured, hard-copy documents (e.g., spurious marks or illegible writing) and the lack of precision in natural language, the clinical data abstracted by different abstracters from the same documents may differ. This is a potential source of error in aregistry. To reduce the potential for this source of error, registries should ensure proper training on theregistry protocol and procedures, condition(s), data sources, data collection systems, and , most importantly, data definitions and their interpretation. While training should be provided for all registry personnel, it is particularly important fornonclinician data abstracters. Training time dependson the nature of the source (charts or CRFs), comple xity of the data, and number of data items. A variety of training methods, from li ve meetings to online meetings to interacti ve multi-media recordings, have all been used with success. 247 Training often includes test abstractions using sample char ts. F or some pur poses, it is best practice to train abstracters on using standardized test charts. Such standardized tests can be further used both to obtain data on the inter-rater reliability of the case report forms, definitions, and coding instructionsand to determine whether individual abstracters can perfor m up to a defined minimum standard for the registry. Registries that rely on medical chart abstraction should consider reporting on the perfor mance characteristics associated with abstraction, such as inter-rater reliability. 248Some key considerations in standardizing medical chart abstractions are: Standardized materials (e.g., def initions, instructions). Standardized training. Testing with standardized charts. Reporting of inter-rater reliability. Electronic medical record . The electronic medical record (EMR) will play an increasingly importantrole as a source of clinical data for registries. The medical community is currently in a transitionperiod in which the primary repository of a patient' smedical record is changing from the traditionalhard-copy chart to the EMR. The main function ofthe EMR is to aggregate all clinical electronic dataabout a patient into one logical computer schema, inthe same way that a hard-copy medical chart aggregates paper records from various personneland departments responsible for the care of the patient. Depending on the extent of implementation, the EMR may include patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, progress notes, orders, flo w sheets, medications, and allergies. The primary sources of data for the EMR are the health care providers. Data may be enteredinto the EMR through k eyboards or touch-screens in medical offices or at the bedside. In addition, the EMR system is usually interfaced to ancillarysystems (see below), such as laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, and pathology. Ancillary systems, which usuall y have their own databases, export relevant patient data to the EMR system, w hich impor ts the data into its database. Since EMRs include the majority of clinical data available about a patient, they can be a major sourceof patient information for a registry. What an EMR usually does not include is registry-specific (primary source) data that are collected separatelyfrom hard-copy or electronic forms. In the next several years, suitable EMR system interfaces may be able to present data needed by registries in accordance with registry-specified requirements either within the EMR (w hich then populates the registry) or in an electronic data capture system (which then populates the EMR). EMRs already serve as secondary data sources in some registries, and this practice will continue to grow as EMRs become more widely used. In these situations, data may be extracted from the EMR, transformed intoregistry format, and loaded into the registry, where they will reside in the re gistry database togetherSection II. Operating Registries 139with registry-specific data imported from other sources. In a sense, this is similar to medical chartabstraction except that it is performed electronically. There are two key differences. First, the data are \"abstracted\" once for all records. In this context,abstraction refers to the mapping and other decisionmaking that needs to be made to bring the EMR data into the registry database. It does not eliminate the potential for interpretive errors, asdescribed later in this chapter, but it centralizes that process, making the rules clear and easily reviewed. Second, the data are uploaded electronically, eliminating the extra data entry. While EMRs of fer interesting potential for registries, the reality is that only a minority of U.S. patients currently have their data stored in systemsthat are capable of retrieval at the level of a data element. Furthermore, only a small number of thesesystems cur rently store data in structured formats with standardized data def initions for those data elements that are common across different vendors. A significant amount of attention is currently focused on both interchange formats betweenclinical and research systems (e.g., from HealthLevel Seven [HL-7] 249to Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consor tium250models) and the prob lems of data syntax. (See Chapter 4.) Other data sources . Some of the clinical data used to populate registries may be derived from repositories other than EMRs. Examples of other data sources include billing systems, laboratory databases, and other re gistries. Chapter 5 discusses the potential uses of other data sources in more detail. Data Entry Systems Once the primary and any secondary data sources for a registry have been identified, the registry team can determine how data will be entered into the registry database. Many techniques andtechnologies exist for entering or moving data into the registry database, including paper CRFs, direct data entr y, facsimile or scanning systems, and electronic CRFs. There are also different models for how quickl y those data reach a central repositor y for cleaning, reviewing, monitoring, or reporting. Eachapproach has advantages and limitations, and each registry must balance flexibility (the number ofoptions available) with data availability (when the central repository is populated), data validity (whether all methods are equally able to produceclean data), and cost. Appropriate decisions dependon many factors, including the number of dataelements, number of sites, location (local preferences that vary by country, languagedifferences, and availability of different technologies), registry duration, followup frequency, and available resources. Paper CRFs . With paper CRFs, the clinician enters clinician data on the paper for m at the time of the clinical encounter or other data collectors abstract the data from medical records after the clinicalencounter. CRFs may include a wide variety ofclinical data on each patient gathered from differentsources (e.g., medical char t, laboratory, pharmacy) and from multiple patient encounters. Before thedata on formatted paper forms are entered into a computer, the forms should be reviewed for completeness, accuracy, and validity. Paper CRFscan be entered into the database by either direct dataentry or computerized data entry via scanning systems. With direct data entr y, a computer k eyboard is used to enter data into a database. Key entry has a variable error rate depending on personnel, so anassessment of error is usually desirable, particularly when a high volume of entry is performed. Double data entr y is a method of increasing the accuracy of manuall y entered data b y quantifying error rates as discrepancies between two different data entry personnel, and impro ving data accurac y by having up to two individuals enter the data and a third person review and manage discrepancies. With upfront data v alidation checks on electronic entr y interfaces, the likelihood of data entry errors significantly decreases. Therefore, the choice of single versus double data entry should be driven by the ability of each method to achie ve a specific error rate in key measures in the particular circumstance and b y the requirements of the re gistry for a par ticular er ror rate. Doub le data entr y, while a standard of practice for registrational trials, mayChapter 8. Data Collection and Quality Assurance 140add significant cost. Its use should be guided by the need to reduce an error rate in key measures and thelikelihood of accomplishing that by double data entry as opposed to other approaches. In some situations, assessing the data entry error rates by re-entering a sample of the data is sufficient forreporting purposes. With hard-copy structured forms, entering data using a scanner and special software to extract the data from the scanned image is possible. If data arerecorded on a form as marks in checkboxes, the scanning software enables the user to map thelocation of each checkbox to the value of a variablerepresented b y the text item associated with the checkbox and determine whether the box is marked. The presence of a mark in a box is converted by thesoftware to its corresponding value, which can then be transmitted to a database for storage. If the formcontains hand-printed or typed te xt or numbers, optical character reco gnition (OCR) softw are is often effective in extracting the printed data from the scanned image. However, the print font must be of high quality to avoid translation errors, andspurious marks on the page can cause errors. Errorchecking is based on automated parametersspecif ied b y the operator of the system for e xception handling. The comments on assessing er ror rates in the section abo ve are applicable for scanning systems as well. Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) . An eCRF is defined as an auditable electronic record designed to record infor mation required by the clinical trial protocol to be repor ted to the sponsor on each trial subject.251 An eCRF allows clinician-reported data to be entered directl y into the electronic system b y the data collector (the clinician or other data collector). Site personnel in many registries still commonly complete an inter mediate hard-cop y worksheet representing the CRF and subsequently enter the data into the eCRF . While this approach increases work effort and error rates, it is not yet practical for all data entr y to be performed at the bedside, during the clinical encounter, or in the midst of a busy clinical da y. An eCRF may originate from local computerized databases (including those on an individualcomputer, a local area network server, or a hand- held device) or directly from a central database server via an Internet-based connection or a privatenetwork. For registries that exist beyond a singlesite, the data from the local system mustsubsequently communicate with a central data system. An eCRF may be presented visually (e.g.,computer screen) or aurally (e.g., telephonic data entry, such as interactive voice response systems). Specific circumstances will favor different presentations. For example, in one clozapine patient registry that is otherwise similar to Case Example 21, both pharmacists and physicians can obtain andenter data via a telephone-based interactive voice response system as w ell as a Web-based system. 252 The option is successful in this scenario because telephone access is ubiquitous in phar macies, and the eCRF is v ery brief. A common method of electronic data entry is to use Web-based data entry forms. Such forms may be used by patients, providers, and interviewers to enterdata into a local repository. The forms reside onservers, which may be located at the site of the registry or co-located an ywhere on the Inter net. To access a data entr y for m, a user on a remote computer with an Inter net connection opens a browser window and enters the address of the Web server. Typically, a login screen is displayed and the user enters a user identif ication and pass word, provided by personnel responsible for the Web site or repository. Once the server authenticates the user, the data entry form is displayed, and the user can begin entering data. As described in \"CleaningData,\" many electronic systems can perform data validation checks or edits at the time of data entry. When data entr y is complete, the user submits the form, which is sent over the Internet to the Web server. Hand-held devices, such as personal digital assistants (PD As) and cell phones, may also be used with Web-based or other forms to submit data to a server. Mobility has recently become an important attrib ute for clinical data collection. Softw are hasSection II. Operating Registries 141been developed that enables wireless PDAs and cell phones to collect data and transmit them over theInternet to database servers in fixed locations. As wireless technology continues to evolve and data transmission rates increase, these will become more important data entry devices for patients and clinicians. Advantages and Disadvantages of Data Collection Technologies When the medical record or ancillary data are in electronic format, they may be abstracted to theCRF by a data collector or, in some cases, uploaded electronically to the registry database. The ease ofextracting data from electronic systems for use in aregistry depends on the design of the interfaces of ancillar y and re gistry systems and the ability of the EMR or ancillary system software to serve up the requested data. However, as system vendors increasingly adopt standards for medical systems called HL-7 and interchange models betweenschema, transferring data from one system toanother will lik ely become easier . The American Health Infor mation Community 253is acti vely working toward improved standards with organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technolo gy (NIST).254 Electronic interf aces are necessary to move data from one computer to another . If clinical data are entered into a local repository from an eCRF form or entered into an EMR, the data must be e xtracted from the source data set in the local repository, transformed into the format required by the registry, and loaded into the re gistry database for per manent storage. This is called an \"extract, transform, and load\" (ETL) process. Unless the local repository is designed to be consistent with the registry database in terms of the names of variables and their values,data mapping and transformation can be a complex task. In some cases, manual transfer of the data may be more efficient and less time consuming than the ef fort to de velop an electronic interface. If an interface between a local electronic system and registry system is developed, it is still necessary to communicate to the ancillar y system the criteria forretrieval and transmission of a patient record. Typically, the ancillary data are maintained in arelational database, and the system needs to run an SQL (Structured Query Language) query against the database to retrieve the specified information. AnSQL query may specify individual patients by anidentifier (e.g., a medical record number) or byvalues or ranges of specific variables (e.g., all patients with hemoglobin A1C over 8 mg/dl). Theresults of the query are usually stored as a file (e.g., ASCII, CSV , CDISC ODM) that can be transferred to the registry system across the interface. A variety of interface protocols may be used to transfer the data. Because data definitions and formats are not yet standardized nationally, transfer of data from anEMR or ancillary system to a registry database is prone to error. Careful evaluation of the transferspecif ications for interpretive or mapping errors is a critical step that should be v erified b y the re gistry coordinating center. Furthermore, a series of test transfers and validation procedures should be performed and documented. Finally, error checkingmust be part of the transfer process because newformats or other errors not in the test databases may be introduced during actual practice, and these need to be identif ied and isolated from the re gistry itself. Even though each piece of data may be accurately transferred, the data may have different representations on the different systems (e.g., value discrepancies such as the meaning of \"0\" vs. \"1, \" fixed vs. floating point numbers, date format, integer length, and missing values). In summary, any system used to extract EMR records into registry databases should be validated and includean interval sampling of transfers to ensure that uploading of this infor mation is consistent over time. The ancillary system must also notify the registry when an error correction occurs in a record already transferred to the registry. Registry software must be ab le to receive that notification, flag the erroneous value as invalid, and insert the new, corrected v alue into its database. F inally, it is impor tant to reco gnize that the use of an electronic-Chapter 8. Data Collection and Quality Assurance 142to-electronic interchange requires not only testing but also validation of the integrity and quality of thedata transferred. Few ancillary systems or electronic medical records systems are currently validated to a defined standard. For registries thatintend to report data to the FDA or to other sponsorsor data recipients with similar requirements\u2014including electronic signatures, audit trails, and rigorous system validation\u2014the ways in which theregistry interacts with other systems must be carefully considered. Cleaning Data Data cleaning refers to the correction or amelioration of data prob lems, including missing values, incorrect or out-of-range values, orresponses that are logically inconsistent with otherresponses in the database. While all registries strivefor \"clean data,\" in reality, this is a relative term. How and to what level the data will be cleaned should be addressed upfront in a data managementmanual that identifies the data elements that areintended to be cleaned, describes the data validation parameters or lo gical checks for out-of-range values, and e xplains ho w missing v alues and v alues that are logically inconsistent will be handled. Data management manual . Data managers should develop formal data review guidelines for the reviewers and data entry personnel to use. The guidelines should include information on how to handle missing data; invalid entries (e.g., multiple selections in a single-choice f ield, alphabetic data in a numeric field); erroneous entries (e.g., patients of the wrong gender answering gender-based questions); and inconsistent data (e.g., an answer to one question contradicting the answer to anotherone). The guidelines should also include procedures to attempt to remediate these data prob lems. For example, with a data error on an interview form, it may be necessary to query the interviewer or the patient, or to refer to other data sources that ma y be able to resolve the problem. Documentation of any data re view acti vity and remediation ef forts, including dates, times, and results of the query, should be maintained. Automated data cleaning . Ideally, automated data checks are preprogrammed into the database forpresentation at the time of data entry. These data checks are particularly useful for cleaning data at the site level while the patient or medical record isreadily accessible. Even relatively simple editchecks, such as range values for laboratories, canhave a significant effect on improving the quality of data. Many systems allow for the implementationof more complex data edit checks, and these checks can substantially reduce the amount of subsequent manual data cleaning. A variation of this method is to use data cleaning rules to deactivate certain data fields so that erroneous entries cannot even be made. A combination of these approaches can alsobe used. For paper-based entry methods, automated data checks are not a vailable at the time the paper CRF is being completed b ut can be incor porated when the data are later entered into the database. Man ual data cleaning . Data managers perfor m manual data checks or queries to review data for unexpected discrepancies. This is the standard approach to cleaning data that are not entered intothe database at the site (e.g., for paper CRFs enteredvia data entry or scanning). By carefully reviewing the data using both data e xtracts anal yzed b y algorithms and hand re view, data managers identify discrepancies and generate \"queries\" to send to the sites to resolve. Even eCRF-based data entry withdata validation rules may not be fully adequate to ensure data cleaning for cer tain pur poses. Anticipating all potential data discrepancies at the time that the data management manual and edit checks are developed is very difficult. Therefore, even with the use of automated data validationparameters, some manual cleaning is often still perfor med. Query r epor ts. The re gistry coordinating center should generate, on a periodic basis, query reports that relate to the quality of the data received based on the data management manual and, for some purposes, additional concurrent review by a data manager. The content of these reports will differ depending on w hat type of data cleaning is required for the re gistry pur pose and ho w much automated data cleaning has already been performed. QuerySection II. Operating Registries 143reports may include missing data, \"out-of-range\" data, or data that appear to be inconsistent (e.g.,positive pregnancy test for a male patient). They may also identify abnormal trends in data, such as sudden increases or decreases in laboratory testscompared to patient historical averages or clinicallyestablished normal ranges. Qualified registrypersonnel should be responsible for reviewing the abnormal trends with designated site personnel. Themost effective approach is for sites to provide one contact representative for purposes of queries or concerns by registry personnel. Depending on the availability of the records and resources at the site to review and respond to queries, resolving all queries can sometimes be a challenge. Creating systematic approaches to maximizing site responsiveness isrecommended. Data tracking . For most registry purposes, tracking of data recei ved (paper CRFs), data entered, data cleaned , and other parameters are impor tant components of active registry management. By comparing indicators, such as expected to observed rates of patient enrollment, CRF completion, andquery rates, the registry coordinating center canidentify problems and potentially take corrective action-either at indi vidual sites or across the registry as a w hole. Coding data . As further described in Chapter 4, the use of standardized coding dictionaries is an increasingly important tool in the ability toaggregate registry data with other databases. As the health infor mation community adopts standards, registries should routinel y apply them unless there are specific reasons not to use such standard codes. While such codes should be implemented in the data dictionaries during registry planning, including allcodes in the interface is not always possible. Some free te xt ma y be entered as a result. When free te xt data are entered into a registry, recoding these data using standardized dictionaries (e.g., MedDRA, WHODRUG, SNOMED \u00ae) may be worthwhile. There is cost associated with recoding, and ingeneral, it should be limited to data elements that will be used in anal ysis or that need to be combined or reconciled with other datasets, such as w hen acommon safety database is maintained across multiple registries and studies. Storing and securing data . When data on a form are entered into a computer for inclusion in a registry, the form itself, as well as a log of the data entered, should be maintained for the regulatoryarchival period. Data errors may be discovered longafter the data have been stored in the registry. Theerror may have been made by the patient or interviewer on the original form or during the dataentry process. Examination of the original form and the data entry log should reveal the source of theerror. If the error is on the form, correcting it mayrequire re-inter viewing the patient. If the error occurred during data entry, the corrected data should be entered and the registry updated. By then, theerroneous registry data may have been used to generate reports or create cohorts for populationstudies. Therefore, instead of simply replacing erroneous data with cor rected data, the re gistry system should have the ability to flag data as erroneous without deleting them and to insert the corrected data for subsequent use. Once data are entered into the registry, the registry must be backed up on a regular basis. There are twobasic types of backup, and both types should beconsidered for use as best practice b y the re gistry coordinating center. The first type is real-time disk backup, which is done by the disk storage hardwareused by the registry server. The second is a regular (e.g., daily) backup of the registry to removable media (e.g., tape, CD-R OM, DVD). In the first case, as data are stored on disk in the re gistry server, they are automatically replicated to two or more physical hard dri ves. In the simplest e xample, called \"mirroring,\" registry data are stored on a primary disk and an exact replica is stored on the mirrored disk. If either disk f ails, data continue to be stored on the mirrored disk until the failed disk is replaced. This failure can be completely transparent to the user, who may continue entering and retrie ving data from the registry database during the failure. More complex disk backup configurations exist, in w hich ar rays of disks are used to provide protection from single disk f ailures.Chapter 8. Data Collection and Quality Assurance 144The second type of daily backup is needed for disaster recovery. Ideally, a backup copy of theregistry database stored on removable media should be maintained off site. In case of failure of the registry server or disaster that closes the data center,the backup copy can be brought to a functioningserver and the registry database restored, with theonly loss of data being for the interval between the regularly scheduled backups. The lost data canusually be reloaded from local data repositories or re-entered from hard copy. Managing Change Like all other registry processes, the extent of change management will depend on the types of data being collected, the source(s) of the data, andthe overall timeframe of the registry. There are two major drivers behind the need for change during the conduct of a registry: internal- driven change to refine or improve the registry or the quality of data collected and e xternal-dri ven change that comes as a result of changes in the environment in which the registry is being conducted. Inter nal-driven change is generally focused on changes to data elements or data v alidation parameters that arise from site feedback, queries,and query trends that may point to a question,definition, or CRF field that was poorly designed or missing. If this is the case, the registry can use the information coming back from sites to add, delete,or modify the database requirements, CRFs, definitions, or data management manual as required. Exter nal-dri ven change generally arises in multiyear registries as new information about the disease and/or product under study becomes a vailab le or as new therapies or products are introduced into clinical practice. Change and turnover in registry personnel is another type of change, and one that can be highly disruptive if procedures are notstandardized and documented. Proper management of change is crucial to the maintenance of the re gistry. A consistent approach to change management, including decisionmaking, documentation, data mapping, and validation, is animportant aspect of maintaining the quality of the registry and the validity of the data. While thespecific change management processes might depend on the type and nature of the registry, change management in registries that are designedto evaluate patient outcomes requires, at the veryleast, the following structures and processes: Detailed manual of procedures : As described earlier, a detailed manual that is updated on a regular basis\u2014containing all the registrypolicies, procedures, and protocols, as well as a complete data dictionary listing all the dataelements and their definitions\u2014is vital for thefunctioning of a re gistry. The manual is also a crucial component for managing and documenting change management in a registry. Governing body : As described in Chapter 2, registries require o versight and advisory bodies for a number of pur poses. One of the most impor tant is to manage change on a re gular basis. Keeping the registry manual and data definitions up to date is one of the primary responsibilities of this go verning body. Large prospective registries, such as the NationalSurgical Quality Improvement Program, havefound it necessar y to dele gate the updating of data elements and definitions to a special Definitions Committee. Infrastructur e for ongoing training : As mentioned above, change in personnel is a common issue for registries. Specific processes and an infrastructure for training should be available at all times to account for anyunanticipated changes and turnover of registry personnel or pro viders who regularly enter data into the registry. Method to communicate change : Since registries frequently undergo change, there should be a standard approach and timeline for communicating to sites w hen changes will tak e place. In addition to instituting these str uctures, registries should also plan for change from a budget perspecti ve (Chapter 2) and from an anal ysis perspective (Chapter 10).Section II. Operating Registries 145Chapter 8. Data Collection and Quality Assurance Special Case: Performance-Linked Access System (PLAS) A performance-linked access system (PLAS), also known as a restricted access or limited distribution system, can be described as a special application of a registry. Unlike a disease and exposure registry, a PLAS is part of a detailed risk minimization actionplan that sponsors develop as a commitment toenhance the risk-benefit balance of a product whenapproved for the market. The purpose of a PLAS isto mitigate a certain known drug-associated risk byensuring that product access is linked to a specific performance measure. Examples include systems that monitor laboratory values, such as white bloodcell counts during clozapine administration to prevent severe leukopenia or routine pregnancytesting during thalidomide administration to pre vent utero e xposure to this kno wn terato genic compound. Additional information on PLAS can be found in Guidance for Industry: Development and Use of Risk Minimization Action Plans .255(See Case Example 21.) Quality Assurance Observational studies based on patient registries are being used toda y to suppor t the results and assist in the planning of randomized controlled trials. Someare even substituting for clinical trials in the assessment of the comparative safety and effectiveness of specific pharmacologicinterventions. 256It is therefore imperative that patient re gistries be held to high standards of quality , particularly when they are intended to evaluate patient outcomes. Methods of quality assurance ma y vary depending on the intended purpose of the registry, and they generally fall under three main categories: quality assurance of data, quality assurance of re gistry procedures, and quality assurance of computerized systems. The level of quality assurance that can be obtained is always limited by budgetary constraints. A risk-based approach that focuses on the most impor tant sources of error or procedural lapses from the perspective of the re gistry's purpose should be defined duringinception and design phases. For example, a registry describing the natural history of a diseaseand a registry determining the safety of a product may have very different quality assurance plans. Assurance of Data Quality Structures, processes, policies, and procedures need to be put in place to ascertain the quality of the data in the registry and to ensure against several types oferrors, including: Errors in interpretation or coding : An example of this type of error would be two abstracterslooking for the same data element in a patient' s medical record but extracting different data from the same char t. Variations in coding of specif ic conditions or procedures also f all under the category of interpretive errors. Avoidance or detection of interpretive error includes adequate training on definitions, testing against standard charts, testing and reporting on inter-rater reliability , and re-abstraction. Errors in data entry, transfer, or transformation accuracy : These occur when data are entered into the re gistry inaccurately\u2014for example, a laborator y value of 2.0 is entered as 20. Avoidance or detection of accuracy errors can be achieved through upfront data quality checks (such as ranges and data v alidation checks), re- entering samples of data to assess for accuracy,and rigorous attention to data cleaning. Errors of intention : Examples of intentional distortion of data (often referred to as \"gaming\") are inflated reporting of preoperativepatient risk in registries that compare risk- adjusted outcomes of sur gery or selecting only cases with good outcomes to repor t (\"cher ry- picking\"). Avoidance or detection of intentional error can be challenging. Some approaches include checking for consistency of data between sites, assessing screening log infor mation ag ainst other sources (e.g., billing data), or performing onsite audits (including monitoring source records) either at random or \"for cause.\" 146Section II. Operating Registries Case Example 21: Developing a Performance-Linked Access System Description The Clozapine Patient Registry is one of several national patient registries for patients taking clozapine. The registry is a performance-linked access system (PLAS), mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, that collects patient lab data and contact information and investigates any adverse events that may be connected to clozapine. Sponsor IV AX Pharmaceuticals (a member of the Teva Group) Y ear Started 1997Y ear Ended Ongoing No. of Sites 40,000 registered health care providers (physicians and pharmacists) No. of Patients 47,000 Challenge Clozapine is indicated for patients with severe schizophrenia who fail standard therapy and for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior inschizophrenia or schizoaf fective disorder. However, it has potentially serious side effects that require careful medical super vision. The primary goal of the re gistry is to pre vent clozapine from being prescribed and dispensed to patients with a known histor y of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and to detect leukopenic events (decrease in white blood cell counts). Because of the potential serious side effects, the U.S. Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA) requires manufacturers of clozapine to maintain a patient monitoring system. Designed as a performance- linked access system, the re gistry needs to assure the eligibility of patients, pharmacies, andphysicians; monitor white blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reports for low counts; assure compliance with lab reportsubmission timelines; and respond to inquires andreports of adverse events. Proposed Solution The registry was developed to meet these goals. Patients must be enrolled in the registry prior to receiving clozapine, and they must be assigned to adispensing pharmacy and treating physician. After the patient has initiated therapy, a current and acceptable WBC count and ANC value arerequired prior to dispensing clozapine. Once a patient is enrolled and eligibility is conf irmed, a 1-, 2-, or 4-week supply of clozapine can be dispensed, depending on patient experience and the physician' s prescription. Health care professionals are required to submit lab reports to the registry based on the patients' monitoring frequency. Patients are monitoredweekly for the first 6 months. If there are no low counts, the patient can be monitored every 2 weeksfor an additional 6 months. Afterw ard, the patient may qualify for monitoring e very 4 w eeks (depending on the physician' s prescription). The re gistry provides reminders if lab data are not submitted according to the schedule. If a lo w count is identified, registry staff will inform the health care pro viders to mak e sure that the y are aware of the event. Results By linking access to clozapine to a strict schedule of lab data submissions, the sponsor can ensurethat onl y eligible patients are taking the drug, detect lo w counts, prevent inappropriate rechallenge (or re-e xposure) in at-risk patients, and monitor the patient population for any adverse events. This system pro vides the sponsor with data on the frequency and severity of adverse events while ensuring that onl y the proper patient population receives the drug. (continued) 147Steps for assuring data quality include: Training : Educate data collectors/abstracters in a structured manner. Data completeness : When possible, provide sites with immediate feedback on issues such asmissing or out-of-range v alues and lo gical inconsistencies. Data consistency : Compare across sites and over time. Onsite audits for a sample of sites : Review screening logs and procedures and/or samples of data. To further minimize or identify these errors and to ensure the overall quality of the data, the followingshould be considered. A designated individual accountable for data quality at each site . Sites submitting data to a registry should have at least one person who is accountable for the quality of these data,irrespective of whether the person is collecting the data as w ell. The site coordinator should be fully knowledgeable of all protocols, policies, procedures, and def initions in a re gistry. The site coordinator should ensure that all site personnel in volved in the registry are knowledgeable and that all datatransmitted to registry coordinating centers are valid and accurate. Assessment of training and maintenance of competency of personnel . Thorough training and documentation of maintenance of competency forboth site and registry personnel are imperative to thequality of the registry. A detailed andcomprehensive operations manual, as describedearlier, is crucial for the proper training of all personnel involved in the registry. Routinecognitive testing (surveys) of health care provider knowledge of patient registry requirements andappropriate product use should be performed tomonitor maintenance of the kno wledge base and compliance with patient registry requirements. Retraining programs should be initiated whensurvey results provide evidence of lack of knowledge maintenance. All registry trainingprograms should provide means by which the knowledge of the data collectors about their registries and their competence in data collection can be assessed on a regular basis, particularly when changes in procedures or definitions areimplemented. Data quality audits . As described above, the level to which re gistry data will be cleaned is influenced by the objecti ves of the re gistry, the type of data being collected (e.g., clinical data vs. economic data), the sources of the data (e.g., primary vs. secondary), and the timeframe of the registry (e.g., 3-month followup vs. 10-year followup). These registry characteristics often affect the types and number of data queries that are generated bothelectronically and manually. In addition to identifying missing v alues, incor rect or out-of-range values, or responses that are logically inconsistent with other responses in the database, specifically trained re gistry personnel can re view the data queries to identify possible error trends and to determine whether additional site training is required. For example, such personnel may identify a specif ic patient outcome question or eCRF field that is generating a larger than average proportion of queries, either from one site or across all re gistryChapter 8. Data Collection and Quality Assurance Case Example 21: Developing a Performance-Linked Access System(continued) Key Point A PLAS can ensure that only appropriate patients receive a treatment. These systems can also help sponsors to monitor the patient population tolearn more about adverse events and the frequency of these events. For More Information Reid WH. Access to care: clozapine in the public sector. Hosp Community Psychiatry 1990 Aug;40(8):870-3. 148sites. Using this information, the registry personnel can conduct targeted followup with the sites toretrain them on the correct interpretation of the eCRF field in question, with the goal of reducing the future query rate on that particular question orfield. These types of \"training tips\" can also beaddressed in a registry newsletter as a way tomaintain frequent, but unobtrusive, communication with the registry sites. Should the registry purpose require a more stringent verification of the data being entered into the database by registry participants, registry plannersmay decide to conduct audits of the registry sites.Like queries discussed above, the audit plan for a specific registry will be influenced by the purpose of the registry, the type of data being collected, thesource of the data, and the overall timeframe of the registry. In addition, registry developers must findthe appropriate balance betw een the extensiveness of an audit and the impact on o verall re gistry costs. Based on the objectives of the registry, a registry developer can define specific data fields (e.g., key effectiveness variables or adverse event data) onwhich the audit can be focused. The term \"audit\" may describe examination or verification, ma y tak e place on site (sometimes called monitoring) or of f site, and ma y be e xtensi ve or very limited. The audit can be conducted on a random sample of participating sites (e.g., 5-20percent of registry sites); \"for cause\" (meaning only when there is an indication of a problem, such as one site being an outlier compared with most others); on a random sample of patients; or usingsampling techniques based on geography, practice setting (academic center vs. community hospital), patient enrollment rate, or query rate. The approachto auditing the quality of the data should reflect the most signif icant sources of er ror with respect to the purpose of the registry. Finally, the timeframe of the registry may help determine the audit plan. A registry with a short followup period (e.g., 3 months) ma y require only one round of audits at the end of the study prior to database lock and data analysis. F or registries with multiyear followup, registry personnel ma y conduct site audits e very 1 or 2 years for the duration of the registry. Inaddition to the site characteristics mentioned above, sites that have undergone significant staffingchanges during a multiyear registry should be considered prime audit targets to help confirm adequate training of new personnel and to quicklyaddress possible inter-rater variability. To minimizeany impact on the observational nature of theregistry, the audit plan should be documented in the registry manual. Registries that are designed for the evaluation of patient outcomes and the generation of scientific information and that utilize medical chartabstracters should assess inter-rater reliability indata collection with suf ficient scientific rigor for their intended purpose(s). For example, in one registry that uses abstractions extensively, a detailedsystem of assessing inter-rater reliability has been devised and published; in addition to requiring thatabstracters achie ve a certain level of proficiency, a propor tion of char ts are scheduled for re-abstraction on the basis of predefined criteria. Statistical measures of reliability from such re-abstractions are maintained and reported (e.g., kappa statistic). 257 Subsequent to audits (onsite or remote), communication of findings with site personnelshould be conducted in a f ace-to-f ace manner along with follo wup written communication of f indings and opportunities for improvement. As appropriate to meet registry objectives, the sponsor may requestcorrective actions from the site. Site compliance may also be enhanced with routine communication of data generated from the patient re gistry system to the site for reconciliation. Registry Procedures and Systems Exter nal audits of r egistry pr ocedur es. If re gistry developers determine that external audits are necessary to assure the level of quality for the specific purpose(s) of the registry, they should be conducted in accordance with pre-establishedcriteria. Pre-established criteria could include monitoring of sites with high patient enrollment or prior audit histor y with findings that require attention or monitoring based on level of site experience, rate of serious adv erse e vent reporting, or identified problems. The registry coordinatingSection II. Operating Registries 149center may perform monitoring of a sample of sites, which could be focused on one or several areas.This approach could range from review of procedures and interviewing site personnel, to checking screening logs, to monitoring individualcase records. The importance of having a complete and detailed registry manual that describes policies, structures,and procedures cannot be overemphasized in the context of quality assurance of registry procedures.Such a manual serves both as a basis for conducting the audits and as a means of documenting changesemanating from these audits. As was stated inrelation to data quality audits, feedback of the findings of registry procedure audits should be communicated to all stakeholders and documentedin the registry manual. Assur ance of system integrity and security . All aspects of data management processes should fallunder a rigorous life-c ycle approach to system development and quality management. Each process is clearly defined and documented. The concepts described below are consistent across many software industry standards and health careindustry standards (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11, legalsecurity standards), although some specif ics ma y vary. The processes and procedures described should be regularly audited by an internal quality assurance function at t he registry coordinatingcenter. When third parties other than the registry coordinating center perform activities that interact with the re gistry systems and data, they are typically assessed for risk and are subject to re gular audits b y the registry coordinating center. System development and validation . All software systems used for patient registries should follow the standard principles of software development. Thelife-cycle model refers to a common model that is well described in the software industry. In parallel, quality assurance of system development utilizes approved specifications to create a validation plan for each project. Test cases arecreated by trained personnel and systematically executed, with results recorded and reviewed. Depending on regulatory requirements, a finalvalidation report is often written and approved. Unresolved product and process issues aremaintained and tracked in a \"bug\" tracking system. Processes are similarly documented and audited. The information from these audits is captured,summarized, and reviewed with the applicable groupwith the aim of ongoing process improvement andquality improvement. Security All registries maintain health information, and, therefore, security is an important issue. The HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act of 1996) Security Rule lists the standards for security for electronic protected health information to be implemented by health plans,health care clearinghouses, and certain health careproviders. 258Although these standards are specific to electronic protected health information, the principles themselves are more broadly applicable. Security is achie ved not simpl y by technology but by clear processes and procedures. Ov erall responsibility for security is typically assigned. Security procedures are well documented andposted. The documentation is also used to train staff. System security plan . A system security plan consists of documented policies and standard operating procedures defining the rules of systems, including administrative procedures, physical safeguards, technical security services, technicalsecurity mechanisms, electronic signatures, and audit trails, as applicab le. The rules delineate roles and responsibilities. Included in the r ules are the policies specifying individual accountability for actions, access rights based on the principle of least privilege, and the need for separation of duties.These principles and the accompanying security practices provide the foundation for the confidentiality and integrity of clinical trial data.The rules also detail the consequences associated with noncompliance. Security assessment . Clinical data maintained in a registry can be assessed for the appropriate level ofsecurity. Standard criteria exist for suchChapter 8. Data Collection and Quality Assurance 150assessments and are based on the type of data being collected. Part of the validation process is a security assessment of the systems and operating procedures. One of the goals of such an assessment is effective risk management, based on determining possiblethreats to the system or data and identifying potential vulnerabilities. Education and training . All staff members of the registry coordinating center should be provided with periodic training on aspects of the overall systems,security requirements, and any special requirements of specific patient registries. Individuals shouldreceive training relating to their specific jobresponsibilities and document that appropriate training has been received. Access controls . Access to systems and data should be based on the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. No indi vidual should be assigned access privileges that exceed jobrequirements, and no indi vidual should be in a role that includes access rights that w ould allo w circumvention of controls or the repudiation of actions within the system. In all cases, access should be limited to authorized individuals. Electronic signatures . Logical access to systems and computerized data should require an electronicsignature\u2014either based on an encr ypted digital certificate stored on a password-protected device orin the for m of a unique user ID and pass word combination\u2014that is assigned to the individual whose identity has been v erified and whose job responsibilities require such access. Electronic signatures pro vide one of the foundations of individual accountability, helping to ensure an accurate change history when used in conjunction with secure, computer-generated, time-stamped audit trails. Most systems utilize an electronic signature. F or registries that report data to FDA, such signatures must meet criteria specified in 21 CFR Part 11 for general signature composition, use, and control (11.100, 11.200, and 11.300). However, evenregistries that do not have such requirements should view these as reasonab le standards. Before an individual is assigned an electronic signature, it isimportant to verify the person' s identity and train the individual in the significance of the electronicsignature. In cases where a signature consists of a user ID and a password, both management and technical means should be used to ensure uniqueness and compliance with password construction rules. Password length, charactercomposition, uniqueness, and validity life cycle should be based on industry best practices andguidelines published by the NIST. Rules should be established for situations in which passwords are compromised. As passwords expire, new password information should be sent to the individual by a secure method. Electronic signatures provide the basis for authentication and logical access to criticalsystems and data. Since the authenticity, integrity, and auditability of data stored in electronic systemsdepend on accurate indi vidual authentication, management of electronic signatures is an impor tant topic. Intrusion detection and firewalls should be employed on sites accessible to the Internet, with appropriate controls and rules in place to limitaccess to authorized users. Desktop systems shouldbe equipped with antivirus software, and servers should r un the most recent security patches. System security should be re viewed throughout the course of the re gistry to ensure that management, operational, personnel, and technical controls are functioning properly. Validation . Systems that store electronic records (or depend on electronic or handwritten signatures of those records) that are required to be acceptab le to FDA must be validated according to the requirements set for th in the 21 CFR P art 11 F inal Rule,259dated March 20, 1997. The rule describes the requirements and controls for electronic systems that are used to fulf ill records requirements set for th in agency regulations (often called \"predicate rules\") and for any electronic records submitted to the agency. FDA publishes nonbinding guidance documents from time to time that outline its cur rent thinking regarding the scope and application of the regulation. The cur rent guidance document is Guidance f or Industry , Part 11, Electr onic Records;Section II. Operating Registries 151Electronic Signatures - Scope and Application ,260 dated August 2003. Other documents that are useful for determining validation requirements of electronic systems are Guidance for Industry, Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials ,261 dated April 1999, and General Principles of Software V alidation; Final Guidance for Industryand FDA Staff ,262dated January 11, 2002. Resource Considerations Costs for registries can be highly variable, depending on the overall goals. Costs are also associated with the total number of sites, the totalnumber of patients, and the geographical reach of the re gistry pro gram. Each of the elements described in this chapter has an associated cost.Table 12 provides a list of some of the activities of the registry coordinating center as an example. Notall registries will require or can afford all of the functions, options, or quality assurance techniques described in this chapter. Registry planners mustevaluate benefit vs. available resources to determinethe most appropriate approach to achieve theirgoals.Chapter 8.

Operating Registries 153The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines an adverse drug experience as any adverseevent (AE) associated with the use of a drug inhumans, whether or not considered drug related. 263 For clinical safety data from clinical and investigational studies, an International Conferenceon Harmonisation guideline defines an AE as an untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, whether ornot related or considered to have a causal relationship with the treatment. 264AEs are categorized for regulatory purposes according to theseriousness and e xpectedness of the event. For adverse events occurring during postmarketingstudies and information concerning potentialadverse experiences derived during planned contacts and acti ve solicitation of infor mation from patients, such as re gistries of an FDA-approved product, 265,266 the requirements for mandator y repor ting include an additional cate gorization of \"relatedness\" that addresses whether or not there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverseexperience. 267For medical devices, reportable events include AEs and/or product problems. They are defined as events in which the device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury(AEs) or may have malfunctioned and would likelycause or contribute to death or serious injury if themalfunction w ere to recur (product problems). Most registries have the opportunity to identify and capture infor mation on AEs for biophar maceutical products and/or medical devices. Although there are no regulations in the United States that specifically require registries to capture and process AE reports (aside from reporting requirements for registries thatare sponsored by regulated industries), there is an implicit requirement from the perspecti ve of promoting pub lic health: an y individual who believes a serious and previously unknown AE may have occur red because of e xposure to a medical product should be encouraged to report that AE either to the product sponsor or directly to the FDA. AE reporting depends, in part, on the ability to include an identifiable patient. 268However, not all registries have direct contact with individualpatients. AEs can be detected through retrospectiveanalysis of a population database where directpatient contact does not occur, as well as throughinteraction with patients. Patient interactions could include clinical interactions or data collection by phone, Internet, or other means; perusal ofelectronic medical records or insurance claims data would not be considered direct patient interactions. Reporting is rarely required for individual AEsobser ved in aggregate population data, since there is no direct patient interaction where an associationmight be suggested or inferred. Nevertheless, ifaggregate or epidemiologic analyses suggest an AE is associated with e xposure to a dr ug or medical product, it is desirab le that this information be forwarded to the manuf acturer of that product, w ho will deter mine an y need for and timing of repor ting of study results to a regulatory authority. Figure 2 provides a broad overview of the reporting requirements for AEs and shows how the reporting differs according to whether the registry has directpatient interaction and w hether it receives sponsorship and/or financial support from a\"regulated industry.\" These industries may include entities with products subject to FD A regulation, including products with FD A appro val, an FDA- granted license, and unapproved marketed drug products, and others such as manuf acturers, pack ers, and distributors. This chapter addresses the identif ication, processing, and reporting of AEs that are detected in situations in w hich the re gistry has indi vidual patient contact.

Medical devices are significantly different from pharmaceuticals in the manner in which AEs andproduct problems present themselves, in the etiologyof their occurrence, and in the regulation governingdefining, and reporting of these occurrences, as wellas postmarketing study requirements. This chapteris focused on AEs related to pharmaceutical products. Other sources provide more informationabout defining and reporting of device-related AEs and product problems and about postmarketingstudies (including those involving registries). 269,270,271 AE Detection and Recording by the Registry All AE reporting begins with a suspicion by the site physician (or responsible person who obtains or receives information) that some adverse event hashappened to the patient and that the event has areasonab le possibility of being causall y related to the drug or device being used; this is referred to as the \"becoming a ware\" principle. It is important to develop a plan for detecting, processing, and reporting AEs for any registry that has direct patient contact. If the registry receives sponsorship in whole or part from a regulated industry (for drugs or devices), then the sponsor has mandated reporting requirements, including stringent timelines. (See AE reporting requirements for registry sponsors later in this chapter.) The process for detecting and repor ting AEs should be estab lished in collaboration with the sponsor and any oversight committees. (See Chapter 2.) Once the plans have been developed, sites should be trained about how to identify AEs and to whom they should be reported. AE reporting is based on categorization of the adverse event according to the seriousness of the event, e xpectedness of the e vent based on labeling, and presumed causality or possible association with use of the product, as follows: Seriousness : Serious drug-related AEs include those that result in death, are life threatening (an event in which the patient was at risk of death atthe time of the event), require or prolong inpatient hospitalization, result in persistent orsignificant disability or incapacity, or result in a congenital anomaly. Important medical events may also be considered serious when, based onmedical judgment, they may jeopardize theperson exposed and may require medical orsurgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (e.g., death, prolongedhospitalization). Expectedness : All drug-related AEs that are previously unobserved or undocumented arereferred to as \"unexpected\" in that the nature and severity are not consistent with information provided in the relevant product information (e.g., approved professional package insert orproduct label). Relatedness : \"Relatedness\" is intended to indicate that an evaluation has been made in which it was determined that the response thatoccur red in the indi vidual had a reasonable possibility of being related to exposure to theproduct. This assessment of causality is basedon factors such as biological plausibility, prior experience with the product, and temporal relationship betw een product e xposure and onset of the e vent, as w ell as de-challenge (to determine if the adverse event resolves) and re- challenge (to determine if the adverse eventreoccurs). Many terms and scales are used to describe the de gree of causality , including terms \"possib ly,\" or \"lik ely\" related or not related, but there is no standard nomenclature. 272 AE repor ts for a phar maceutical or biolo gical product should provide information about the four basic elements of an AE report: an identifiable patient, an identif iable repor ter, a suspect dr ug or biological product, and an adverse event or fatal outcome. Typically, forms such as a questionnaire or an AE case report form may be used to collect infor mation regarding an AE. When solicitation of specific AEs is not prespecified, it is good practice, although not required , to per mit AE detection by asking general questions, such as \"Ha ve you had any problems since your last visit or since we lastChapter 9. Adverse Event Detection, Processing, and Reporting 156spoke?\" and then following up any such reports with probes as to what happened, diagnoses, and otherdocumentation. Collecting AE Data in a Registry he collection of AE data by a registry generally is either intentionally solicited (meaning that the dataare part of the uniform collection of information in the registry) or unsolicited (meaning that the AEinformation is volunteered or noted in an unsolicitedmanner and not as a required data element through acase report form). As described further below, it is good practice for a registry to specify when and howAE information, and any other events of special interest, should and should not be solicited from patients by physicians or other responsible parties(referred to as \"sites\" hereafter) and, if thatinformation has been obtained, how and when thesite should inform the appropriate persons. While an AE may be reported to the manufacturer, FDA (via MedW atch), or the re gistry (and then from the registry to the manufacturer), it is strongly encouraged that the protocol document theprocedures that should be follo wed and that the sites be trained in these procedures, as w ell as general obligations and public health considerations. Determining whether the registry should use the case repor t form to collect AEs should be based on the principles described in Chapter 4, w hich refer to the scientific importance of the information for evaluating the specified outcomes of interest. This may mean that all, some, or no adv erse e vents are collected on the case report forms. However, if some AEs are collected in an intentional solicited manner (such as routine collection of a primary or secondary outcome via an AE case report form) andothers come to attention in an unsolicited, \"spontaneous\" w ay (e.g., reporting an AE in the course of registry contact, such as a call to the sponsor or registry Help Desk), then from a practical perspecti ve it is e ven more impor tant to have a clear process so that sites are not confused and AEs that require repor ting are identif ied. In this scenario, one best practice that has been introduced in electronic registry studies is to have a notification sent promptly to the sponsor' s safety group when a case report form is submitted that has specific orpotential information that a serious AE has occurred. This process allows for rapid followup bythe sponsor as needed. AE Reporting by the Registry Once suspicion has been aroused that an unexpected serious event has a reasonable possibility of beingcausally related to a drug, the AE should be reported to FDA through MedWatch, to the company thatmanufactures the product, or to the registrycoordinating center. A system needs to bedeveloped such that all appropriate events are captured and duplicate reporting is avoided to theextent possible. Generally, AE reports are submitted directl y to the manuf acturer , since the y are often most efficient at evaluating, processing, and reporting for regulatory purposes within therequired time periods. Alternatively, sites couldreport AEs directly to FDA; however, this often means companies are not notified of the AE and are not ab le to follo w it up. In f act, companies are not necessarily notified by the FDA if an AE report comes directly to FDA, since only certain reports are shared with industr y and reporters have an option to request that the infor mation not be shared directly with the company. 273When sites report AEs directly to FDA, this process can also riskinadv ertent duplication of infor mation for e vents recorded both by the registry and the company. Ideally, the practice for handling AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) should be applied to all treatments (including comparators) recorded in the registry, so that all subjects are treated similarly.Systematic collection of all AEs provides a unique resource of consistent and contemporaneously collected comparison information that can be usedat a later date to conduct epidemiologic assessments of relatedness (or causality). In f act, a strong advantage of registries with systematic data collection and internal comparators is that they provide both numerators and denominators for safety events; thus reporting of known AE rates in the conte xt of a safety e valuation pro vides useful information on real-world performance. Reporting AEs without this denominator information is less useful from a surveillance perspective.Section II. Operating Registries 157For postmarketing registries that are not financially supported by pharmaceutical companies, health careproviders at registry sites should be instructed that if they suspect or otherwise become aware of a serious and unexpected AE that has a reasonable possibilityof being causally related to a drug or product, theyshould report the event directly to the productmanufacturer (who must then report to FDA under regulation) or to FDA' s MedWatch program (or localhealth authority if the study is conducted outside of the United States). Reporting can be facilitated by providing the MedWatch 274template, as well as information regarding the process for submission and MedWatch contact information. For registries that are sponsored or financially supported in full or part by a regulated industry andthat study a single product, the most efficient monitoring system is one in which all physiciansparticipating in the registry report all AEs directly to the sponsor (manuf acturer) or centralized designated responsible personnel, who then reports to the regulatory authorities, in order to avoid duplicate reporting. However, when products other than thoseexclusively manufactured by the sponsor areinvolved, sponsors will need to determine how to process AE repor ts that are recei ved for comparator products. Sponsors are not generall y obligated to repor t AEs for their competitors, but from a public health perspective, specifying how the site should address those AEs (e.g., report directly to the comparator product' s manuf acturer or to FD A) is good practice. Options for the sponsor include (1) recommending that the AEs of comparators be reported directly to the manufacturer or to FDA; (2) collecting all AEs and forwarding the AE reportdirectly to the comparator' s manufacturer (who would then, in turn, report to FDA); and (3) actually repor ting the AE for the comparator product directl y to FDA. The MedWatch form 274should be used for postmarketing reporting for drugs and therapeutic biolo gics; for vaccines, consult the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS).275Foreign events ma y be submitted on a CIOMS form (the World Health Or ganization' s Council for International Organizations of MedicalSciences),276,277,278or a letter can be generated that includes the relevant information in narrative format. In most circumstances where a serious drug- associated AE is suspected, sites are encouraged tosubmit to sponsors supportive data, such as labvalues, vital signs, and examinations, along with theSAE report form. The sponsor then transfers theinformation provided by sites to a format that is required for submission to the health authority. Serious AEs that are unexpected and possibly related to drug exposure should be submitted to thesponsors as quickly as possible after becomingaware of the event so that the sponsor may, in turn,comply with 15-calendar-day reporting requirements. This submission can be accomplishedby phone or fax, or by means of automated rules built into the v ehicle used for data collection (such as automatic triggers that can be designed into electronic data capture pro grams). Coding Coding AEs into a standard nomenclature should be done by trained experts to assure accuracy and consistenc y. Reporters, patients, health care providers, and re gistry personnel should do their best to capture the primary data clearly, completely, and in as \"natural\" clinical language as possible. Since reporters may use different verbatim terms to describe the same particular AE, it is recommended that sponsors apply coding conventions to code theverbatim terms, e.g., MedDRA (International Conference on Har monisation). Coding the different v erbatim language to preferred terms allows similar events to be appropriately grouped. This also creates consistenc y among the ter ms for evaluation and maximizes the likelihood that safety signals will be detected. Sponsors should review the accuracy of the coding of verbatim AEs into appropriate ter ms. Review of the coding process should focus on the use of ter ms that do not accurately communicate the severity or magnitude of the AE or possib ly mischaracterize the AE. Review of the coded terms compared with reported verbatim terms should be performed inChapter 9. Adverse Event Detection, Processing, and Reporting 158order to ensure consistency and accuracy of the AE reporting and to minimize variability of coding ofsimilar adverse event terms. Attention to consistency is especially important, as many different individuals may code AEs over time andthis contributes to variability in the coding process. In addition to monitoring AEs individually for complete clinical evaluation of the safety data,sponsors should consider grouping and analyzing clinically relevant coded terms that could representsimilar toxicities or syndromes. Combining terms may provide a method to detect less common andserious events that would otherwise be obscured.However, sponsors should be careful when combining related terms to avoid amplifying a weak signal or obscuring important overall findings. In addition to monitoring individual AEs, sites and registry personnel should be attenti ve to to xicities that may cluster into syndromes. AE Management In some cases, such as a safety re gistry created as a condition of approval, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or Adjudication Committee may be estab lished with the primary role of periodically reviewing the data as the y are generated b y the registry. Such activities are generally discussed directly with the health authorities, such as FDA. These authorities are typically involved in the design and critique of protocols for postmarketing drug studies. Ultimately, registry planning and theregistry protocol should anticipate and clearly delineate the roles, responsibilities, process, for ms, and lines of communication about AE repor ting for sites; registry personnel; the DSMB or Adjudication Committee, if one e xists; and the sponsoring organization. Definitions and approaches should be documented for determining what is considered unexpected and possibly related to drug or device exposure. Management of AE reporting should beclearly stated in the registry protocol, including the roles, responsibilities, processes, and methods for handling AE reports by the various parties conducting the registry and responsibilities to perfor m follo wup acti vities with the site to ensure that complete information is obtained.Sponsors who are stakeholders in a registry should have a representative of their internal drug safetysurveillance group participate in the design and review of the registry protocol and have a role in the data collection and reporting process (discussed inChapter 2) to facilitate appropriate and timelyreporting and communication. For postmarketing studies financially sponsored by manufacturers, the overall company AE monitoring systems are usually operated by personnelexperienced in drug safety surveillance (also known as pharmacovigilance, regulatory safety, and safetyand risk management). If sites need to report ordiscuss an AE, they can call the contact number provided for the registry and are then prompted to press a number if reporting an AE. This numberthen transfers them to drug safety surveillance so they can interact directly with personnel in thisdivision and bypass the registry coordinating group. These calls ma y or ma y not be track ed by the registry. Alternatively, the registry system can provide instructions to the site on how to report AEs directly to the sponsor' s drug safety surveillancedivision. Through this method, the sponsor providesa separate contact number for AE reporting (independent of the re gistry Help Desk) that places the site in direct contact with dr ug safety surveillance personnel. This process minimizes the possibility of duplicate AE reports and the potentially complicated reconciliation of two different systems collecting AE infor mation. Use of this process is critical when dealing with products that are available via a registry system as well as outside of a registry system and allows sites to have one designated drug safety surveillancerepresentative for interaction. Sponsors are strongly encouraged to hold discussions with the health authorities w hen considering the design of the AE monitoring system for a registry that is designed specifically for surveillance of drug or device safety. These discussions should be focused on the pur pose of the registry, the \"best fit\" model for AE monitoring, and the timing of routine re gistry updates. With respect to inter nal operations chosen b y the sponsor to support the requirements of an AE monitoringSection II. Operating Registries 159system, anecdotal feedback suggests that health authorities expect compliance with the agreed-upon requirements. Details regarding the implementation are the responsibility of the sponsor. It should also be noted that FDA' s proposed rule for Safety Reporting Requirements for Human Drugand Biologics Products suggests that one point ofcontact should be provided for all AE reporting, andpreferably, this individual should be a licensed physician. Although this proposed rule is still not ineffect, the sponsor should consider appointment of such an individual who can provide responses tohealth authorities, upon request, regarding AEsrepor ted via the registry system. AE Required Reporting for Registry Sponsors Understanding the repor ting requirements of the sponsor directly affects how registries collect and report AEs. Sponsors that are regulated industriesare subject to the requirements shown in Table 13. ICH guidelines describe standards for expeditedrepor ting 279,280and pro vide recommendations forperiodic safety update reports281that are generally accepted globally. Requirements for regulated industries that sponsor or financially support a registry include expeditedreporting of serious and unexpected AEs madeknown to them via spontaneous reports. For studiessuch as registries, the 15-calendar-day notificationapplies if the regulated industry believes there is areasonable possibility that the unexpected SAE was causally related to product exposure. Best practicesfor international reporting are that all \"affiliates\" of a sponsor report serious, unexpected, and possiblyrelated events to the sponsor in a timely fashion,ideall y within 5 calendar days; this allows the sponsor, in turn, to complete notification to the responsible regulatory authority within a total of 15calendar days. Events that do not meet the requirements of expedited reporting (such asnonserious e vents or serious events considered expected or not related) ma y require submission through inclusion in an appropriate safety update, such as the New Drug Application (NDA) AnnualReport, Periodic Report, or Periodic Safety UpdateReports (PSUR), as applicable. 282In many cases,Chapter 9. Adverse Event Detection, Processing, and Reporting Table 13. Overview of Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for Marketed Productsa Type of requirement Drugs Devices U.S. postmarket regulations 21 CFR 310.305, 21 CFR 600.80 Required repor ting source Regulated industries Manufacturer, importer, user facility Required reports Serious, unexpected, and with a Death; serious injury; device malfunction reasonable possibility of being relatedto drug exposure Alternative reports Not applicable Summary reports (periodic line-listing of repor ts of well-known events) Timeframe for reporting 15 calendar days for required reports 10 to 30 calendar days, depending on source Repor ting for m MedWatch 3500A (for mandator y repor required of a MedWatch 3500 (voluntary) Web Conference on (ICH) guidances describe standards for e xpedited repor ting279,280and provide recommendations for periodic safety update reports281that are generally accepted globally. 160sponsors are also required to provide registry safety updates to the health authority. Thus, sponsors maycoordinate registry safety updates (i.e., determining the date for creating the data set [data cut off dates]) with the timing of the NDA Annual Report, PeriodicReport, PSUR, or other agreed-upon periodicreporting format. Devices have different reportingrequirements. (See www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdr.) In any event, sponsors should discuss safety reportingrequirements for their specific registries with the applicable health authorities (such as FDA and European Medicines Agency [EMEA]) before finalizing their registry protocol. In some cases, a re gistry sponsor may encourage the site to systematically report all potential SAEs to the sponsor. Given the potential for variousinterpretations by different sites in assessing the seriousness, expectedness, and relatedness of aparticular AE\u2014and therefore, inconsistency across sites in the e valuation of a par ticular adv erse event\u2014this method has certain advantages. However, this approach results in substantially greater demands on the sponsor to evaluate allreports. Further, U.S. and international regulationsdiffer as to whether the site or industry prevails if there is a disag reement about presumed expectedness or relatedness. F or these reasons, planning for good and consistent training in AE reporting requirements across sites is the preferred approach for a patient registry. Regardless of who assesses presumed relatedness and e xpectedness, sponsors should be prepared to manage the increased v olume of AE reports and sponsor registry staff should be trained to understand compan y polic y and re gulations on AE reporting in order to ensure compliance with local regulations. This training includes the ability to identify and e valuate the attrib utes of each adv erse event and determine the reportability status to the health authority in keeping with local regulation. Sponsors are encouraged to appoint a health care practitioner to this role in order to ensureappropriate assessment of the seriousness or severity of an AE.When biopharmaceutical or device companies are not sponsoring, financially supporting, orparticipating in a registry in any way, then AE reporting is dependent upon the \"become aware\" principle. If any agent or employee of the companyreceives information regarding an AE report, theagent or employee must document receipt andcomply with internal company policy and regulatory requirements regarding AE reporting to assurecompliance with applicable drug and device regulations. Special Case: Performance- Linked Access System (PLAS) A performance-linked access system (PLAS), also known as a restricted access or limited distribution system, can be described as a special application ofa registry. Unlike the less structured disease orexposure registries discussed above, a PLAS is part of a detailed risk minimization action plan that sponsors develop as a commitment to enhance therisk-benefit balance of an approved product. Thepurpose of a PLAS is to mitig ate a cer tain known drug-associated risk by ensuring that product access is tightly linked to some preventive and/ormonitoring measure. Examples include systems that monitor laboratory values, such as white blood cellcounts during clozapine administration to pre vent severe leukopenia or routine pregnancy testingduring thalidomide administration to prevent in utero e ferent the str nature of their protocols, both PLAS and other registries collect a batter y of infor mation using standardized instruments in a prospective manner. A PLAS ma y carry special AE reporting requirements. If such requirements exist, they should be made e xplicit in the re gistry protocol, with clear definitions of roles, responsibilities, and processes. Training of involved health care providers, such as ph ysicians, nurses, and pharmacists, can be undertaken with written instructions or via telephone and/or face-to-faceSection II. Operating Registries 161counseling. Training of these health care providers should also extend beyond AE reporting to thespecific requirements of the PLAS in question. Such training may include the intended use and associated risk of the product, appropriate patient enrollment, and specific patient monitoring requirements, including guidelines for productdiscontinuation and management of AEs, as well as topics to cover during comprehensive counseling ofpatients. The objectives of the PLAS system should be clearly stated (e.g., prevention of in utero exposure during therapy via routine pregnancy testing) and registration forms that document the physician' s and pharmacist' s attestation of their commitment to requirements of the patient registrysystem that should be completed prior to prescribing or dispensing the product. Chapter 9. Adverse Event Detection, Processing, and Reporting 163Registries have the potential to produce databases that are an important source of informationregarding health care patterns, decisionmaking, anddelivery, and their association with patientoutcomes. Registries, for example, can providevaluable insight into the safety and/or effectivenessof an intervention or the efficiency, timeliness, quality, and patient-centeredness of a health care system. The utility and applicability of registry dataheavily rely on the quality of the data analysis plan and the ability to interpret the results. Analysis and interpretation of registry data begin with a series of core questions: Study purpose : Were the objectives/hypotheses predef ined or post hoc? Patient population : Who was studied? Data quality : How were the data collected, reviewed, and verified? Data completeness : How were missing data handled? Data anal ysis: How were the anal yses chosen and performed? While the scientific opportunities that may result from a w ell-designed registry are clear, there are inherent challenges to making appropriate inferences. A principal concer n with re gistries is that of making inferences without regard to the quality of data, since quality standards have not been pre viousl y well estab lished or consistentl y reported. In some registries, comparison groups may be less robustly defined than in more formal obser vational designs (e.g., cohort, case-control studies). Infor mation pro vided about the external validity of a registry sample is often limited as well. This chapter explains how analysis plans are constructed for registries, how they differ depending on their purpose, and how registry design andconduct can af fect analysis and interpretation. The analytic techniques generall y used for registry dataare presented, addressing how conclusions may be drawn from the data and what caveats areappropriate. The chapter also describes howtimelines for data analysis can be built in at registryinception and how to determine when the registrydata are complete enough to begin analysis. Hypotheses and Purposes of the Registry While it may be relatively straightforward to develop hypotheses for registries intended toevaluate safety and effectiveness, not all registries have elegantly testable or simple hypotheses, and the study methodolo gy and presence or absence of a priori hypotheses or research questions may affectthe interpretation of registry data. The many possible scenarios are well illustrated by examples at the theoretical extremes. On one extreme, a study may evolve out of a clear and e xplicit prespecif ied research question and hypothesis. In such a study , there ma y have been preliminary scientific work that laid the conceptual foundation and plausibility of the proposed study.The investigators fully articulate the objectives and analytic plan before embarking on an y anal ysis. The outcome is clearl y defined and the statistical approach documented. Secondar y anal yses are identified and may be highlighted as hypothesis generating. The in vestig ators have no prior knowledge of analyses in this database that would bias them in the formulation of their study objective. The study is conducted and pub lished re gardless of the result. The paper states clearly that the objective and hypothesis were prespecified. For registries that are intended to support national coverage deter minations with data collection as a condition of coverage, the specific coverage decision question may be specif ied a priori as the research question, in lieu of a h ypothesis.Chapter 10. Analysis and Interpretation of Registry Data To Evaluate Outcomes 164On the other extreme, a study may evolve out of an unexpected observation in a database in the courseof doing analyses for another purpose. A study could also evolve from a concerted effort to discover associations\u2014for example, as part of a large effortto understand disease causation. In such a study, thefoundation for the study is developed post hoc, orafter making the observation. Because of the way in which the observation was found, the rationale forthe study is developed retrospectively. The paper does not state clearly that the objective and hypothesis were not prespecified. Of course, there are many examples that fall betw een these extremes. An investigator may suspect an association for many variables, but find the relationship for only one of them. Theinvestigator decides to pursue only the positive finding and develop a rationale for a study or grant.The association w as sought, but it was sought along with associations for man y other v ariab les and outcomes. Thus, while there is substantial debate about the importance of prespecified hypotheses, 283,284there is general agreement that it is informative to revealhow the study was developed. Transparency in themethods is needed so that readers ma y kno w whether these studies are the result of h ypotheses developed independently of the study database, or whether the question and analyses evolved fromexperience with the database and multiple iterations of exploratory analyses. Both types of studies have value. Patient Population The pur pose of a re gistry is to pro vide infor mation about a specific patient population to which all study results are meant to apply. To determine how well the study results appl y to the tar get population, four populations, each of which is a subset of the preceding population, need to be considered, along with ho w well each population represents the preceding population. These four populations are shown in Figure 3.The target population is def ined b y the study' s purpose. To assess the appropriateness of the target population, one must ask the question, Is this reall y the population that we need to know about? For example, the target population for a registry of oral contraceptive users would include women of childbearing age who could become pregnant andare seeking to pre vent pregnancy. Studies often miss important segments of the population in an effort to make the study population more homogeneous. For example, it is less informative than desirab le if a study to assess a medical de vice that is used to treat patients for cardiac arrhythmias defines only men as its target population, because the device is designed for use in both men and women. Section II. Operating Registries Figure 3: Patient Populations Target Population The population to which the study findings are meant to apply. Accessible Population Subset of target population who are specifically defined and available for study. Intended Population Members of the accessible population who are sampled according to the registry design. Actual P opulation People who actually participate in registry. 165The accessible population is defined using inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteriadefine the population that will be used for the study and generally include geographic (e.g., hospitals or clinics in the New England region), demographic,disease-specific, and temporal (e.g., specification ofthe included dates of hospital or clinic admission),as well as other criteria. Conversely, the exclusion criteria seek to eliminate specific patients fromstudy and may be driven by an effort to assure an adequate-sized population of interest for analysis. The same goals may be said of inclusion criteria, since it is difficult to separate inclusion from exclusion criteria (e.g., inclusion of adults aged 18 and over vs. exclusion of children under age 18). The accessible population may lose representativeness to the extent that convenience plays a part in its determination, because peoplewho are easy to enroll in the registry may differ in some critical respects from the population at lar ge. Similarly, to the extent that homogeneity plays a part in determining the accessible population, it is less likely to be representative of the entirepopulation because certain population subgroupswill be excluded. Factors to be considered in assessing the accessib le population' s representati veness of the tar get population include all the factors mentioned above that are used as inclusion and exclusion criteria.One method of evaluating representativeness is to describe the demographics and other key descriptors of the re gistry study population and contrast its composition with patients with similarcharacteristics who are identified from an external database, such as might be obtained from health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and theSurveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer re gistries. However, simple numerical/statistical representati veness is not the main issue. Rather, representativeness should be evaluated in the context of the pur pose of the study . (See Case Example 22.) For example, suppose that the purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of a drug in U.S. residents with diabetes. If the accessib le population includes no children, then the study results very wellmay not apply to children, since children often metabolize drugs very differently than adults. On the other hand, consider the possibility that the accessible population is generally drawn from ageographically isolated region, whereas the targetpopulation may be the entire United States or theworld. In that case, the accessible population is notgeographically representative of the targetpopulation, but that would have little or no impact on the representativeness of the study findings to thetarget population if the action of the drug (or its delivery) does not vary geographically (which wewould generally expect to be the case, unlesspertinent racial/genetic or dietary factors were involved). Therefore, in this example, the lack of geographical representativeness would not affectinterpretation of results. The reason for using an intended population , rather than using the whole accessible population for thestudy , is simpl y a matter of convenience and practicality . The issues to consider in assessing ho w well the intended population represents the accessible population are similar to those for assessing how well the accessible populationrepresents the target population. The maindifference is that the intended population ma y be specif ied b y a sampling scheme, w hich often tries to strike a balance among representativeness, convenience, and budget. If the intended populationis a random sample of the accessible population, it may be reasonably assumed that it will represent the accessib le population; however, for many if not most registries, a complete roster of the accessib le population does not exist. More commonly, the intended population is compared with the accessib le population in terms of pertinent variables. On the other hand, to the extent that convenience or other design (e.g., stratified random sample) is used to choose the intended population, one must consider the e xtent to w hich the sampling of the accessible population\u2014by means other than random sampling\u2014has decreased the representati veness of the intended population. For example, suppose that, for the sake of convenience, only patients who attend clinic on Monda ys are included in the study . If patients who attend clinic on Monday are similarChapter 10. Analysis and Interpretation of Registry Data To Evaluate Outcomes 166Section II. Operating Registries Case Example 22: Using Registry Data To Evaluate Outcomes by Practice Description The Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis (ESCF) Registry was a multicenter, encounter-based, observational, post-marketing study designed to monitor product safety, define clinical practice patterns, explorerisks for pulmonary function decline, and facilitate quality improvement for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The registry collected comprehensive data on pulmonary function, microbiology, growth, pulmonary exacerbations, CF-associated medical conditions, and chronic and acute treatments for childrenand adult CF patients at each visit to the clinical site. Sponsor Genentech, Inc.Y ear Started 1993 Y ear Ended Patient enrollment completed in 2005; follo wup ongoing No. of Sites 215 sites over the life of the registry No. of Records 32,414 patients and 832,705 encounters recorded Challenge Although guidelines for managing cystic fibrosis patients ha ve been widel y available for many years, little is known about variations in practice patterns among care sites and their associated outcomes. To determine whether differences in lung health existed between groups of patients attendingdifferent CF care sites and to determine whether these differences were associated with differences in monitoring and inter vention, data on a large number of CF patients from a wide variety of CF sites w ere necessar y.As a large, observational, prospective registry, ESCF collected data on a large number of patients from a range of participating sites. At the time ofthe outcomes study, the registry was estimated tohave data on over 80 percent of CF patients in the United States, and it collected data from more than90 percent of the sites accredited by the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Because the registry contained a representative population of CFpatients, the registry database offered strongpotential for analyzing the association between practice patterns and outcomes. Proposed Solution In designing the study , the team decided to compare CF sites using lung function (i.e., FEV1values), a common surrogate outcome forrespirator y studies. Data from 18,411 patients followed in 194 care sites were reviewed, and8,125 patients from 132 sites (minimum of 50patients per site) were included. Only sites with atleast 10 patients in a specified age group (6-12,13-17, 18 and older) w ere included for e valuation of that age g roup. F or each age g roup, sites w ere ranked in quar tiles based on the median FEV1 value at each site. The frequency of patient monitoring and use of therapeutic interventions were compared betw een upper and lo wer quartile sites after stratif ication for disease severity. Results Substantial differences in lung health across different CF care sites were observed. Within-site rankings tended to be consistent across the three age groups. Patients who were cared for at higherranking sites had more frequent monitoring of their clinical status, measurements of lung function, and cultures for respirator y patho gens. These patients also received more interventions, particularly intravenous antibiotics for pulmonar y exacerbations. The study concluded that frequent monitoring and increased use of appropriate medications in the management of CF are associated with improved outcomes. (continued) 167 in every rele vant respect to other patients, that may not constitute a limitation. But if Monda y patients are substantiall y different from patients who attend clinic on other days of the week (e.g., well-baby clinics are held on Mondays) and if those differences af fect the outcome that is being studied (e.g., proportion of baby visits for \"well babies\"), then that sampling strategy would substantially alter the interpretations from the registry and would be considered a meaningful limitation. Finally, the extent to which the actual population is not fully representative of the intended population is generall y a matter of real-w orld issues that pre vent the initial inclusion of study subjects or adequate followup. In assessing representativeness, one must consider the likely underlying factors that caused those subjects not to be included in the analysis ofstudy results and how that might affect the interpretations from the re gistry. For example, consider a study of a newly introduced medication, such as an antiinflammatory drug that is thought tobe as effective as other products with fewer side effects but is more costly. Inclusion in the actualpopulation may be influenced by prescribing practices governed by a health insurer (such as the new drug being approved for reimbursement onlyfor patients who have \"failed\" treatment with otherantiinflammatory products, resulting in an actualpopulation that is systematically different from the target population of potential antiinflammatory drugusers). The actual population may be refractory to treatment or have more comorbidities (e.g., gastrointestinal problems) and be specifically selected for treatment beyond the intention of the study-specified inclusion criteria. In fact, registries of newly introduced drugs and devices may ofteninclude patients who are different from the ultimate target population. A related issue is that of \"early adopters,\" in which practitioners w ho are quick to use a novel health care inter vention or therap y differ from those who use it only once it is well established. For example, a registry of the use of a new surgical technique may initially enroll largely academic physicians andonly much later enroll community-based surgeons.If the outcomes of the technique differ between the academic sur geons (earl y adopters) and community- based sur geons (later adopters), then the initial results of the re gistry may not reflect the true effectiveness of the technique in widespread use. Selective information about followup can also affect the representativeness of the actual population. For example, in the extreme scenario, subjects who die during the course of a study ma y be er roneously characterized as lost to followup and not accurately identif ied as deceased , and subsequentl y not identified for inclusion in the study results. In this scenario, the worst effects of the exposure may easily be missed. a aThis type of selection bias is particularly difficult to assess through comparison with e xternal data sources, such as health insurance databases, since deaths are generally not \"billable\" or coded events, and it is difficultto distinguish w hether an insurance plan member has changed plans, discontinued enrollment, or died.Chapter 10. Analysis and Interpretation of Registry Data To Evaluate Outcomes Case Example 22: Using Registry Data To Evaluate Outcomes by Practice (continued) Key Point Stratifying patients by quartile of lung function, age, and disease severity allowed comparison ofpractices among sites and revealed practicepatterns that were associated with better clinicalstatus. The large numbers of patients and sitesallowed for sufficient information to create meaningful and informative stratification andresulted in sufficient information within those strata to reveal meaningful differences in sitepractices.

Pediatrics 2007;119:E531-537. 168Data Quality Issues In addition to a full understanding of study design and methodology, analysis of registry events and outcomes requires an assessment of data quality.One must consider whether most (or all) importantcovariates were collected, whether the data werecomplete, and whether missing data were handled correctly. Collection of All Important Covariates Registry information is often collected for one purpose (e.g., provider performance feedback) butthen used for another (e.g., addressing a specific clinical research question). While using an a vailab le database for multiple purposes is a reasonable goal, one needs to be sure that all the information necessar y to address a specif ic research question was collected in a manner that is suf ficient to answer the question. For example, suppose the research question addresses the comparative effectiveness of twotreatments for a given disease using an existing registry. To be meaningful, the registry should have accurate, w ell-def ined, and complete infor mation, including potential confounding f actors, on the population (those with disease X); on other potentialconfounding factors; on the exposure (whether patients received treatment A or B); and on the patient outcome(s) of interest. Confounding factorsare variables that influence both the exposure (treatment selection) and the outcome in the analyses. These factors can include patient factors(age, gender , race, socioeconomic f actors, disease severity, or comorbid illness); provider factors (experience, skills); and system factors (type of care setting, quality of care, or re gional effects). While it is not possib le to identify all confounding f actors in planning a registry, it is desirable to give serious thought to w hat will be impor tant and ho w the necessary data can be collected. Analysis of registries requires information about such variables so that the confounding co variates can be accounted for using one of several analytic techniques coveredin upcoming sections of this chapter. In addition, as described in Chapter 3, eligibility for entry into theregistry may be restricted to individuals within a certain range of values for potential confounding factors to reduce their effects. Such restrictions mayalso affect the generalizability of the registry. Data Completeness Assuming a registry has the necessary data elements, the next step is to be assured that the dataare complete. Missing data can be a challenge forany registry-based analysis. Missing data include situations where a variable is directly reported asmissing or unavailable, where a variable is \"nonrepor ted\" (i.e., the obser vation is b lank), where the reported data may not be interpretable (e.g., the subjects provide responses that may be subject torecall bias), or where the value must be imputed tobe missing because of data inconsistency or out-of- range results. Before analyzing a registry database, the database should be \"cleaned\" (discussed inChapter 8), and attempts should be made to obtainas much missing data as realistically possible from source documents. Inconsistent data (e.g., ans wer yes to a question at one point and no to the same question at another) and out-of-range data (a 500-year-old patient) should be corrected. Finally, the degree of data completeness should be summarized for the researcher and eventual consumer of analyses from the registry. Handling Missing Data The intent of any analysis is to make valid inferences from the data. Missing data can threaten this goal b y both reducing the infor mation yield of the study and, in many cases, introducing bias. The first step in kno wing ho w to handle missing data is to understand why the data are missing. Missing data fall into three classic categories:286 Missing completely at random (MCAR) : Instances w here there are no dif ferences between subjects with missing data and those with complete data. In such random instances, missing data onl y reduce study po wer without introducing bias. Section II. Operating Registries 169Missing at random (MAR) : Instances where missing data depend on known or observedvalues but not unmeasured data. In such cases, accounting for these known factors in the analysis will produce unbiased results. Missing not at random (MNAR) : Here, missing data depend on events or factors not measuredby the researcher and thus potentially introduce bias. To gain insight into which of the three categories of missing data are in play, one can compare thedistribution of observed variables for patients with specific missing data to the distribution of thosevariables for patients for whom those same data are present. Alternatively, one can attempt to \"predict a missing variable\" using logistic regression analysis where the dependent variable is a dummy variable representing the missing data. There are se veral means of managing missing data within an analysis. For example, a \"complete case\" strategy limits the analysis to patients with complete infor mation for all v ariables. This is the default strategy used in many standard analytic packages (e.g., SAS, Cary, NC). A simple deletion of all incomplete observations, however, is not appropriate or efficient in all circumstances, and it may introduce signif icant bias if the deleted cases are substantively different from the retained, complete cases (i.e., not MCAR). In obser vational studies with prospective, structured data collection, missing data are not uncommon, and the \"complete case\" strategy is inefficient and not generally used. For example, patients with diabetes who werehospitalized because of inadequate glucose control might not retur n for a scheduled followup visit at which HbA1c was to be measured. Those missing values for HbA1c, then, would probably differ from the measured v alues because of the reason for w hich they were missing, and they would be categorized as MNAR. In an example of MAR, the availability of the results of certain tests or measurements may depend on what is covered by patients' health insurance (a known value) since registries typically do not pay for testing. Patients without thisparticular measurement may still contribute meaningfull y to the anal ysis. In order to not e xcludepatients with missing data, one of several imputation techniques may be used to estimate the missingdata. Imputation is a common strategy in which average values are substituted for missing data, usingstrategies such as unconditional and conditionalmean, multiple hot-deck, and expectation maximum,among others. 287,288For data that are captured at multiple time points, investigators often \"carry forward\" a last observation. However, such atechnique can be problematic if early dropouts occur and a response variable is expected to change overtime. \"Worst-case\" imputation is another means ofsubstitution in w hich investigators test the sensitivity of a finding by substituting a \"worst case\" value for all missing results. While this is conservative, itoffers a \"lower bounds\" on an association rather than an accurate assessment. One particularimputation method that has recei ved significant attention in recent anal yses has been ter med \"multiple imputations.\" Rubin first proposed the idea to impute more than one value for a missing variable as a means of reflecting the uncertaintyaround this value. 289The general strategy is to replace a missing value with multiple values from an appro ximate distrib ution for missing v data sets\" for anal ysis from w hich a single summary finding is estimated. A recent review provides insight, using cancer registry data, into the issues of how prognostic models for decisionmaking can be influenced by data completeness and missing data.290Burton and Altman re viewed 100 published multivariable cancer prognostic models published in seven leading cancer journals in 2002. They found that the propor tion of complete cases was reported in only 39 studies, while the percentage missing for important prognostic v ariab les w as repor ted in 52 studies. Comparison of complete cases with incomplete cases was provided in 10 studies, and the methods used to handle missing data were summarized in 32 studies. The most common techniques used for handling missing data were complete case analysis (12), dropping v ariab les with high numbers of missing cases from model consideration (6), and some simple author imputation rule (6). One articleChapter 10. Analysis and Interpretation of Registry Data To Evaluate Outcomes 170used multiple imputation techniques. The reviewers concluded there was room for improvement in thereporting and handling of missing data within registry studies. 291 Readers interested in learning more about methods for handling missing data and the potential for bias are directed to two other useful reviews, one by Greenland and Finkle292and the other by Hernan and colleagues.293 It is important to keep in mind that the impact of data completeness will differ, depending on the extent of missing data and the intended use of theregistry; it is less likely to influence descriptiveresearch than research that is intended to supportdecisionmaking. For all registries, it is important to have a strategy on how to handle missing data andhow to explicitly report on data completeness to facilitate inter pretation of study results. Data Analysis This section provides an overview of practical considerations regarding data analysis of a registry. As the name suggests, a descripti ve study focuses on describing frequenc y and patter ns of v arious elements of a patient population, whereas an analytical study focuses on examining associations betw een patients or treatment characteristics and health outcomes of interest (e.g., comparativeeffectiveness). Statistical methods commonly used for descriptive purposes include those that summarize information from continuous variables (e.g., mean, median) orfrom categorical variables (e.g., proportions, rates). Registries may use incidence (the proportion of the population that de velops the condition over a specified time interval) and prevalence (the propor tion of the population that has the condition at a specific point in time) to describe the population. Another summary estimate that is often used is an incidence rate. The incidence rate (also known as absolute risk) takes into account both the number of people in a population who develop the outcome of interest and the person-time at risk, or the length of time contributed by all people duringthe period when they were in the population and the events were counted. For studies that include patient followup, an important part of the description of study conduct ischaracterization of how many patients are \"lost\" ordrop out during the course of conducting a registryand at what point they are \"lost.\" Figure 4illustrates key points of information that provide auseful description of losses to followup and study dropouts. For analytical studies, the association between a risk factor and outcome may be expressed as attributablerisk, relative risk, odds ratio, or hazard ratio,depending on the nature of data collected, theduration of the study, and the frequency of the outcome. Attributable risk, a concept developed inthe field of public health and preventive medicine, is defined as the propor tion of disease incidence that can be attributed to a specific exposure, and it may be used to indicate the impact of a par ticular exposure at a population le vel. The v ast amount of information and large sample sizes often found in registries also support use of various modeling techniques, such as using propensity scores to createstrata of patients with similar risk sets or to createpropensity scores to use in multi variate risk modeling. 294,295,296,297The standard te xtbooks cited here have detailed discussions regarding epidemiologic and statistical methods commonlyused for the various analyses supported by registries. 298,299,300,301,302 For economic analyses, the analytic approaches often encountered are cost-ef fectiveness anal yses and cost-utility studies. To examine cost effectiveness, costs are compared with clinical outcomes measured in units such as life expectancy or years of disease avoided.303Cost-utility analysis, a closely related technique, compares costs with outcomes adjusted for quality of life (utility) using measures kno wn as quality-adjusted life y ears (QAL Ys). Since most new interventions are more effective but also more e xpensive, another analytic approach examines the incremental cost- effectiveness ratio (ICER) and contrasts that to the willingness to pa y. (W illingness-to-pa y anal yses are generally conducted on a country-by-country basis,Section II. Operating Registries 171since various factors relating to national health insurance practices and cultural issues affectwillingness to pay.) The use of registries for cost- effectiveness evaluations is a fairly recent development, and consequently, the methods areevolving rapidly. More information about economicanalyses can be found in standardtextbooks. 304,305,306,307,308,309 It is important to emphasize that cost-effectiveness analyses, much like safety and clinical-effectivenessanalyses, require prospective collection of specific data elements suited to the purpose. Although cost-effectiveness-type analyses are becoming moreimpor tant and registries can play a key role in such analyses, traditionally registries have not collected much information on quality of life or resource usethat can be linked to cost data. 310To be used for cost-effectiveness analysis, registries must bedeveloped with that purpose in mind. Developing a Statistical Analysis Plan Need f or a statistical anal ysis plan . It is impor tant to de velop a statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) that describes the analytical principles and statistical techniques to be employed to address the primaryand secondary objectives, as specified in the studyprotocol or plan. Generall y, the SAP for a registry study that is intended to suppor t decisionmaking, such as a safety registry, is likely to be more detailed than the SAP for a descripti ve study or health economics study. A registry may require a primary \"master SAP ,\" as well as subsequent, supplemental SAPs. Supplemental SAPs might be triggered by new research questions emerging afterthe initial \"master SAP\" was developed or because the registry evolved over time (e.g., additional data collected, data elements revised). Although theevolving nature of data collection practices in some registries poses challenges for data analysis and interpretation, it is important to keep in mind that the ability to ans wer questions emer ging during the course of the study is one of the adv antages (as w ell as challenges) of a registry. In the specific case of long-ter m rare disease re gistries, man y of the relevant research questions of interest cannot beChapter 10.

At times, the method ofstatistical analysis may have to be modified toaccommodate the amount and quality of dataavailable. Such supplemental analysis should be considered as prospectively defined analysis ratherthan exploratory analyses (sometimes referred to as \"fishing expeditions\"), in that the research question and SAP are formulated before the data analyses are conducted, and results are used to answer specific questions or hypotheses. The key to success is to provide sufficient details in the SAP that, togetherwith the study protocol and the case report form(s), dictate the o verall process of the data analysis and repor ting. Preliminary analysis to assist SAP development . During SAP de velopment, one par ticular aspect of a registry that is somewhat different from a randomized controlled study is the necessity to understand the \"shape\" of the data collected in thestudy. This may be crucial for a number of reasons. Given the broad inclusion criteria that most registries tend to propose, there might be a wide distrib ution of patients, treatment, and/or outcome characteristics. The distribution of age, for example, may help to determine if more detailed analysesshould be conducted in the \"oldest old\" age group (80 years and over) to help understand health outcomes in this subg roup that might be different from outcomes for their y ounger counter parts. Unless a registry is designed to limit data collection to a fixed number of regimens, in theory, the study population could experience many \"regimens,\" considering the combination of various dose levels,drug names, and even more importantly, frequency and timing of medication use (e.g., acute, chronic, intermittent). The scope and complexity of these variations constitute one of the most challenging aspects of anal yzing a re gistry, since treatment is given at each individual physician' s discretion. Grouping of treatment into \"regimens\" should be carefull y conducted , guided b y clinical e xperts in that therapeutic area. The full picture of treatmentpatterns may become clear only after a sizable number of the patients have been enrolled.Consequently, the treatment definition in a SAP may be refined during the course of the study. Furthermore, there may be occasions where aparticular therapeutic regimen is used in a muchsmaller number of patients than anticipated, sospecific study objectives focusing on this group of patients might become unfeasible. Also, the registrymight have enrolled many patients who would normally be excluded from a clinical trial because of significant contraindications related to comorbidity or concomitant medication use; in this case, the SAP may need to define how these patients will be analyzed (either as a separate group or aspart of the overall study population) and how these different approaches might affect the interpretation of the study results. There is a need to e valuate the presence of potential sources of bias and , to the e xtent feasib le, utilize appropriate statistical measures to address such biases. For example, the bias known as\"confounding by indication\" 311results from the fact that physicians do not prescribe medicine atrandom: the reason a patient is put on a particular regimen is often associated with his/her underl ying disease se verity and ma y, in tur n, affect treatment outcome. To detect such a bias, the distribution of various prognostic factors at baseline is compared for patients who receive a treatment of interest and those w ho do not. Another e xample is \"channeling bias,\" where drugs with similar therapeutic indications are prescribed to groups of patients with prognostic differences. 312To detect such a bias, registry developers and users must document thecharacteristics of the exposed and nonexposed participants and either demonstrate their comparability or use statistical techniques to adjust for differences. ( Additional information about biases often found in re gistries is detailed in Chapter 3.) In addition to such biases, analyses need to account for factors that are interrelated, also known as interaction terms. 313The presence of interaction terms may also be identified after the data arecollected. All of these issues should be taken into account in an SAP based on understanding of the patient population in the re gistry. Section II. Operating Registries 173Timing of Analyses During the Study Unlike a typical clinical trial, registries, especially those that take several years to complete, mayconduct \"intermediate\" analyses before all patientshave been enrolled and/or all data collection hasbeen completed. Such midcourse analyses may be undertaken for several reasons. First, many of theseregistries focus on safety outcomes, which may be catastrophic. For such safety studies, it is importantfor all parties involved to actively monitor thefrequency of such events at regular predefinedintervals so that further risk assessment or riskmanagement can be considered. The timing of such analyses may be influenced by regulatory requirements. Second, it may be of interest to examine treatment practices or health outcomes during the study to capture any emerging trends.Finally, it may also be important to provide intermediate anal ysis to document progress, often as a requirement for continued funding. While it is useful to conduct such intermediate analysis, careful planning should be given to theprocess and timing. The f irst questions are w hether a sufficient number of patients have been enrolled and w hether a suf ficient number of events have occur red. Both can be estimated based on the speed of enrollment and rate of patient retention, as well as the e xpected incidence rate of the event of interest. The second issue is whether sufficient timehas elapsed after the initial treatment with a product that, biolo gicall y speaking, it is plausib le for e vents to have occurred. (For example, some events can be observed after a relatively short duration, such as site reactions to injections, compared with cancers, which may have a long induction or latency.) Ifthere are too few patients or insufficient time has elapsed, premature analyses may lead to the inappropriate conclusion that there is no occur rence of a particular event. Similarly, uncommon events occur ring b y random chance in a limited sample may be incorrectly construed as a safety signal. On the other hand, it is inappropriate to delay analysis so long that an oppor tunity might be missed to observe emerging (safety) outcomes. Investigators should use sound clinical and epidemiological judgment when planning intermediate analysis and,whenever possible, use data from previous studies to help to determine the feasibility and utility of suchan analysis. When planning the timing of the analysis, it may be helpful to consider substudies if emerging questionsrequire data that were not collected originally.Substudies often involve data collection based onbiological specimens or specific laboratoryprocedures. They may, for example, take the form of nested case-control studies. In other situations, aresearch question may be applicable only to a subset of patients, such as patients who become pregnantwhile in the study. It may also be desirable toconduct substudies among patients in a selected site or patient group to confirm the validity of study measurement. In such instances, a supplemental SAP should be developed that describes thestatistical principles and methods. Factors To Be Considered in the Analysis Registry results are most meaningful when they are specif ic to w ell-def ined endpoints or outcomes in a specif ic patient population with a specif ic treatment status. Registry analyses may be more meaningful if variations of study results across patient groups,treatment methods, or subgroups of endpoints arerepor ted. In other words, analysis of a registry should e xplicitly provide the following information: Patient : What are the characteristics of the patient population in terms of demographics, such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance status, and clinical and treatment characteristics(e.g., past history of significant medical conditions, disease status at baseline, and prior treatment histor y)? Exposure (or treatment) : Exposure could be therapeutic treatment such as medication orsurgery, a diagnostic or screening tool, behavioral f actors such as alcohol or smoking habits, or other factors such as genetic predisposition. What are the distributions of the exposure in the population? Is the study objective specific to any one form of treatment? Chapter 10. Analysis and Interpretation of Registry Data To Evaluate Outcomes 174Endpoints (or outcomes) : Effectiveness (and comparative-effectiveness) outcomes includesurvival, disease recurrence, symptom severity, quality of life, and cost effectiveness. Safety outcomes include infection, cancer, organrejection, and mortality, for example. Are thestudy data on all-cause mortality or cause-specific mortality? Is information available on pathogen-specific infection (bacterial vs. viral,for example)? Was followup obtained equally across comparison groups? (See Case Example 23.) Time : Results should be described in a \"time- appropriate\" fashion. For example, is the risk consistent over time (in relation to initiation of treatment) in a long-term study? If not, whattime-related risk measures should be reported in addition to (or instead of) cumulati ve risk? When e xposure status changes frequentl y, what is the method of capturing the population at risk? Many observational studies of intermittent exposures (e.g., use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or pain medications) use time windows of analysis, such as looking at events following first use of a drug after aprescribed interval (e.g., 2 weeks) without drug use. Other f actors that are impor tant for registry anal yses include consideration of comparators to assist in determining whether an observed effect is, in fact, different from whatwould be expected otherwise in similar patients and consideration of how to address different lengths of observation for people who enroll ina registry at different time periods. Potential for bias : Successful analysis of observational studies depends to a large extent on the ability to measure and analyticallyaddress the potential for bias. Refer to Chapter 3 for a description of potential sources of bias. Choice of comparator . An example of a troublesome source of bias is the choice of comparator . When participants of a cohort are classified into two or more groups of individuals according to cer tain study characteristics (such as treatment status, with the \"standard of care\" g roup as the comparator), the registry is said to have aninternal, or concurrent, comparator. The theoretical advantage to such an internal comparator design isthat patients are likely to be more similar to than different from each other (in contrast to comparisons between registry subjects and externalgroups of subjects) except for their treatment status.In addition, consistency in data collection methodsmay also make the comparison more valid. Internal comparators are particularly useful for treatmentpractices that change over time. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to have or sustain a valid internal comparator. For example,there may be significant medical differencesbetw een patients who receive a particularly effective therapy and those who do not (e.g., underlying disease severity or contraindications), or it may notbe feasible to maintain a long-term cohort of patients who are not treated with such a medication.It is kno wn that external information about treatment practices (such as scientif ic pub lications or presentations) can result in physicians changing their practice of medicine such that they no longer prescribe the previously accepted standard of care.There may be a systematic difference betweenphysicians who are early adopters and those who start using the dr ug or de vice after its ef fectiveness has been more widel y accepted. Earl y adopters ma y also share other practices that dif ferentiate them from their later adopting colleagues. In the absence of a good internal comparator, one may have to leverage external comparators to provide critical context to help interpret data revealed by a registry. An external or historical comparison occurs when members of another study or another database that ha ve similar disease or treatment characteristics are compared with registry subjects. Such data may be viewed as a context for anticipating the rate of an e vent. One widel y used comparator is the SEER cancer registry data, because SEER provides detailed annual incidence rates of cancer stratified by cancer site, age group, gender , and tumor staging at diagnosis. A procedure for formalizing comparisons with external data is known as standardized incidence rate or ratio; 314 when used appropriatel y, it can be inter preted as a proxy measure of risk or relative risk.

Analysis and Interpretation of Registry Data To Evaluate Outcomes Case Example 23: Using Registry Data To Study Patterns of Use and Outcomes Description The Palivizumab Outcomes Registry was designed to characterize the population of infants receiving prophylaxis for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease, to describe the patterns and scope of the use of palivizumab, and to gather data on hospitalization outcomes. Sponsor MedImmune, Inc. Y ear Started 2000Y ear Ended 2004 No. of Sites 256 No. of Patients 19,548 infants Challeng e RSV is a signif icant cause of hospitalization, sometimes resulting in death for premature inf ants during their first 2 years of life. In 1998, the U.S.Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA) approved palivizumab as a proph ylaxis for RSV in pediatric patients at high risk for RSV disease, after clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of the product in preventing RSV hospitalizations. Two large retrospective surveys conducted after FDAappro val studied the effectiveness of palivizumab in infants, again showing that it reduces the rate of RSV hospitalizations. Despite the consistenc y of findings betw een the clinical trials and retrospective studies, questions remained about the target population and treatment patter ns. The manufacturer wanted to create a prospective study that would identify infants receiving palivizumab to better understand the population receiving the prophylaxis for RSV disease and to study thepatter ns of use and the hospitalization outcomes. Proposed Solution The manuf acturer decided to create a multicenter registry study to collect data on infants receiving palivizumab injections. The re gistry was initiatedduring the 2000-01 RSV season. Over 4 consecutive years, 256 sites across the United States enrolled infants who had receivedpalivizumab for RSV under their care, providedthat the infant' s parent or legally authorized representative gave informed consent forparticipation in the registry. Infants were enrolled at the time of their first injection, and data were obtained on palivizumab injections, demographics,and risk factors, as well as on medical and familyhistory. Followup forms were used to collect data on subsequent palivizumab injections, including dates and doses, during the RSV season. These data were then used to determine compliance with the prescribed injection schedule by comparing the number of injections actuall y received with the number of expected doses. Data were also collected for all enrolled infants hospitalized for RSV at the time of hospitalization. Adverse e vents were not collected and analyzed separately for purposes of this registry. Results From September 2000 through Ma y 2004, the registry collected data on 19,548 infants. The analysis presented injection rates andhospitalization rates for all infants by month ofinjection and by site of first dose (pediatrician' s office or hospital). The observed number of injections per infant was compared with the expected number of doses based on the month the first injection was given. Over 4 years of data collection, less than 2 percent (1.3 percent) of all infants w ere hospitalized for RSV . Inf ants w ho had greater adherence to the recommended injection schedule had lower RSV hospitalization rates. This analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of a palivizumab prophylaxis for RSV in a largecohort of high-risk infants from a geographically diverse group of practices and clinics. The registry data also showed that the use of palivizumab was mostl y consistent with the guidelines of the American Academ y of P ediatrics. (continued) 176Use of an external comparator, however, may present significant challenges. For example, SEER and agiven registry population may differ from each other for a number of reasons. The SEER data cover the general population, and have no exclusion criteriapertaining to history of smoking or cancer screening,for example. On the other hand, a given registrymay consist of patients who have an inherently different risk of cancer than the general population,resulting from the registry having excluded smokers and others known to be at high risk of developing a particular cancer. Therefore, the SEER population would be expected to overestimate the expected incidence rate in the absence of a treatment of interest. Regardless of the choice of comparator, similarity between the groups under comparison should not be assumed without careful examination of the studypatients. Dif ferent comparator groups may potentiall y result in v ery different inferences for safety and effectiveness evaluations; therefore, analysis of registry findings using different comparator groups may be used in sensitivityanalyses to determine the robustness of a registry' sfindings. Sensitivity analysis refers to a procedure used to deter mine the sensiti vity of the study result to alterations of a parameter . If a small parameter alteration leads to a relati vely large change in the results, the results are said to be sensitive to that parameter. This procedure may be used to determine how the f inal study results might change w hen taking into account those lost to followup. A simple hypothetical example is presented in Table 14. Table 14 illustrates the extent of change in the incidence rate of a h ypothetical outcome assuming varying degrees of loss to followup, and differences in incidence between those for whom there is infor mation and those for w hom there is no information due to loss to followup. In the first example, where 10 percent of the patients are lost to followup, the estimated incidence rate of 111/1,000 people is reasonab ly stable; it does not change too much when the (unknown) incidence in those lost to followup changed from 0.5 times the obser ved to 5 times the obser ved, with the cor responding incidence rate that would have been observedSection II. Operating Registries Case Example 23: Using Registry Data To Study Patterns of Use and Outcomes(continued) The registry succeeded in collecting nearly complete demographic information and more than99 percent of followup information on all enrolled infants, a level of completeness muchhigher than had been achieved in the retrospectivestudies. Key Point A simple stratified analysis was used to describe the characteristics of infants receiving injectionsfor RSV . Infants in the registry had a lowhospitalization rate, and these data suppor t the effectiveness of this treatment outside of a controlled clinical study. Risk factors for RSV hospitalizations were described and quantified bypresenting the number of infants with RSVhospitalization as a percentage of all enrolledinfants w ho w ere hospitalized. These data suppor ted an anal ysis of postlicensure effectiveness, in addition to describing the patient population and treatment patterns.

Pediatrics 1998;102:531-7. 177ranging from 106 to 156 per 1,000). On the other hand , when the loss to follo wup increases to 30 percent, the corresponding incidence rates that would have been observed range from 94 to 242.This procedure could be extended to a study wherethere is more than one cohort of patients, with one being exposed and the other being nonexposed. In that case, the impact of loss to followup on therelati ve risk could be estimated b y using sensiti vity analysis. Patient censoring . At the time of a registry analysis, e vents may not have occurred for all patients. For these patients, the data (e.g., survival) are said to be \"censored ,\" indicating that the observation period of the registry was stopped before all events occurred. In these situations, it is unclear when the event will occur, if at all. In addition, a registry may enroll patients until a setstop date, and patients entered into the registry earlier will ha ve a greater probability of having an event than those entered more recentl y because of the longer followup. An important assumption (and one that needs to be assessed in a re gistry) is that patients entered into the registry late have the same prognosis as those entered early. This may be a particularly problematic assumption in registries that assess innovative (and changing) therapies. Patientsand outcomes observed initially in the registry may differ from patients and outcomes observed later in the re gistry timeframe (or not at all). Patients with censored data, however, contribute importantinfor mation to the re gistry analysis and should not be excluded from the SAP . One method of analyzing censored data is to use the Kaplan-Meier method 315to estimate the conditional probability of the event occurring. In this method, for each timeperiod, the probability is calculated that those who have not experienced an event before the beginning of the period will still not have experienced it by theend of the period. The probability of an e vent occurring at any given time is then calculated from the product of the conditional probabilities of each time inter val. In summary, the development of a good SAP requires careful considerations of study design features and the nature of the data collected. Mosttypical cohort study analytical methods can be applied, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Efforts should be made to carefully evaluate thepresence of biases and to control for identified potential biases during data anal ysis. This requires close collaboration among clinicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, study coordinators, and others in volved in the design, conduct, and interpretation of the registry. Interpretation of Registry Data Interpretation of registry data is needed so that the lessons from the registry can be applied to the target population and used to change future health care and patient outcomes. Proper inter pretation ofChapter 10. Analysis and Interpretation of Registry Data To Evaluate Outcomes Table 14: A Hypothetical Simple Sensitivity Analysis [Impact of loss to follo wup on incidence rates per 1,000 in a study of 1,000 patients] Various assumptions of the observed incidence rate Assuming a 10-percent Assuming a 30-percent loss to followup loss to followup Incidence rates based on patients who stayed in the study 111 (100/900) 110 (77/700) Assuming the incidence of patients lost to followup is X times the rate of incidence estimated in those who stayed in the study: X=0.5 106 94X=1 111 110X=2 122 143 X=5 156 242 178registry data allows users not only to evaluate the hypotheses tested in the current registry but also togenerate new hypotheses to be tested by future registries or randomized controlled trials. If the purpose of the registry is explicit, the actualpopulation studied is reasonably representative ofthe target population, the data quality monitored,and the analyses performed so as to reduce potential biases, then the interpretation of the registry datashould allow a realistic picture of the safety, effectiveness, or value of a clinical evaluation, the quality of medical care, or the natural history of the disease process studied. Each of these topics needs to be discussed in the interpretation of the registry data, and potential shortcomings should be explored.Assumptions or biases that could have influenced the outcomes of the anal yses should be highlighted and separated from those that do not af fect the interpretation of the re gistry results. The use of a comparator that is of the highest reasonab ly possib le quality is integral to the proper interpretation of the analysis. Once analyzed, registries provide important feedback to several groups. One group is theregistry developers. Analysis and interpretation of the re gistry will demonstrate strengths and limitations of the original re gistry design and allo w the de velopers to make needed design changes forfuture versions of the registry. Another group comprises the study sponsors and relatedoversight/governance groups, such as the Scientific Committee and Data Monitoring Committee. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on registrygovernance and oversight.) Interpretation of theanalyses allows the oversight committees to offerrecommendations concerning continued use and/or adaptation of the registry and to evaluate patientsafety. The final group is the end users of the registry output, such as patients or other health care consumers, health services researchers, health care providers, and policymakers. These are the people for whom the data were collected and who may use the results to choose a treatment or intervention toprovide or undergo, to determine the need for additional research pro grams to change clinical practice, to de velop clinical practice guidelines, or to deter mine polic y. All three user groups work toward the ultimate goal of each re gistry\u2014 improving patient outcomes. Section II. Operating Registries 179Section III. Evaluating Registries 181Registries are undertaken for many purposes, ranging from descriptive studies intended tocontribute to scientific understanding of patientoutcomes to studies used to inform policy decisions.Some are undertaken with great urgency, whereasothers proceed with more deliberation. Budgetarysupport ranges from spartan to adequate. Most importantly, registries often serve multiple purposes and change over time to accommodate these variouspurposes\u2014in fact, these are hallmarks of registries. Although all registries can provide useful information, there are levels of rigor that enhancevalidity and make the information from some registries more useful for guiding decisions thanothers. To date, no standards have been developed by which to guide e valuation of re gistries, and the research into quality aspects of registries has been sparse. 316 Previous chapters of this handbook have described various attrib utes and characteristics that constitute good registries and \"good registry practice.\" This chapter provides an overview of key components ofthe design, execution, and analysis of a registry that promote reliability and validity of data on patientoutcomes. The aim of this chapter is to pro vide a simple and user-friendly system that allows registries to be described and evaluated in the context of the purpose for w hich the y are conducted. Infor mation is presented to help distinguish between: Basic good re gistry practices that are desirable to meet certain purposes. Future directions for practices that could enhance scientific rigor but may not be achie vable because of practical constraints. The items listed as \"basic elements of good practice\" are applicab le to all patient re gistries. While it ma y not be practical or feasib le to achie ve all of the basic elements of good practice, it is useful to consider these characteristics in planning and evaluating registries. The information describedin this handbook, and particularly in this chapter, is also designed to be used in reporting registry studyresults, much as CONSORT guidelines have beenused to improve reporting of clinical trials. 317 Defining Quality This chapter has adapted a def inition of \"quality\" that was developed for randomized controlled trials;318the term is used to refer to the confidence that the design, conduct, and analysis of the trial or registry can be shown to protect against bias (systematic er ror) and er rors in inference\u2014that is, erroneous conclusions dra wn from a study .319As used here, quality refers both to the data and to theconclusions drawn from analyses of these data. For more information about the types of biases that can affect observational studies, as well as strategies foraddressing and even avoiding these biases to theextent feasib le, see Chapters 3 and 10. F or more information about bias, validity, and inference, readers are encouraged to consult epidemiologictextbooks. 320,321,322 Measuring Quality There are two major difficulties with assessing quality in registries: It can often be difficult to differentiate between the quality of the design, the study conduct, and the information available. There is a lack of empirical e vidence for evaluating parameters purported to indicate quality and impact on the evidence produced from re gistries. In addition, registries vary widely in methodology, scope, and objecti ves, and therefore attrib utes that are important in one scenario may be less important in another. Furthermore, registries may be very useful vehicles for providing clinically relevant real- world information, even when they meet relativelyChapter 11. Assessing Quality 182few of the basic elements of good practice (typically because of budgetary limitations). In many cases,some data are better than no data, and even registries that fall short of including all the basic elements of good registry practice may still providevaluable insights about real-world medical andconsumer practices and disease etiology.Evaluations of the quality of any registry must therefore be done with respect to the context-specific purpose of the registry, must take into account both the internal and external validity of the data, and should be tempered by considerations of cost and feasibility. The most commonl y used method to assess quality of studies is a quality scale; there are numerous quality scales of varying length and complexity in existence, with strong views being expressed both for and against their use. 318,323,324Different scales emphasize distincti ve dimensions of quality and therefore can produce disparate results w hen applied to a given study. In most situations, a summary score is derived by adding individual item scores, with or without weighting. This method, however,ignores whether the various items may lead to a biastoward the null (suggesting the erroneous interpretation that there is no ef fect) or tend to exaggerate the appearance of an ef fect w hen none really exists, and the final score produced does not reflect individual components. 325 Rather than develop a checklist, the approach suggested here is to undertake a quality component analysis, an investigation of the components that may affect the results obtained.325In the quality component analysis, a differentiation is made betw een tw o domains: resear chquality , which pertains to the scientific process (in this instance, the design and operational aspects of the registry), and evidence quality , which relates to the data/findings emanating from the research process.326,327,328According to Lohr,329\"The level of confidence one might have in evidence turns on the underl ying robustness of the research and the analysis done to synthesize that research.\" To select the quality components for analysis, several k ey elements identif ied in pre vious research studies, among many consulted, were Guidelinesfor Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practice,330the ICH (International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) Guideline on Good Clinical Practice,331the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Guidelines for EthicalReview of Epidemiological Studies, 332the Evidence Report/Technology Assessment of Systems to Ratethe Strength of Scientific Evidence by West and colleagues, 324the guidance document prepared by Klaucke and colleagues from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with regard to assessing the overall quality of a surveillance system,333and Goldberg' s review of registry evaluation methods.334 The results of the quality component analysis must be considered in conjunction with context-specificsubstanti ve components that relate to the disease area, the type of re gistry, and the pur pose of the registry. (See Table 15.) For example, a disease- specific registry that has been designed to look at natural history should not be deemed low qualitysimply because it is not large enough to detect raretreatment effects. Quality Domains The quality domains shown here are the domains described earlier in this handbook. For research , the quality domains are planning; design; data elements and data sources; and ethics, pri vacy, and governance. For evidence , the quality domains are described separately for registry participants; data elements and data sources; data quality assurance; analysis; and reporting. Table 16 shows the basic elements of good registry practice for research, and Table 17 shows additional practices that ha ve the potential to enhance scientific rigor, and thus the validity and reliability of information resulting from registries. Similarly, Table 18 shows the basic elements of good registry practice for e vidence, and Table 19 shows additional practices that may enhance the evidence quality. It is impor tant to w eigh ef forts taken to promote the accuracy and completeness of evidence in balanceSection III. Evaluating Registries 183with the public health urgency of a problem, the types of interventions that are available, and therisks to public health from coming to a wrong conclusion. These lists of components are most likely incomplete, but the level of detail providedshould be useful for high-level quality distinctions. Most importantly, the basic elements of good practice, as well as the potential enhancements togood practice, depend to a great extent on the resources and budget available to support registry- based research. Chapter 11. Assessing Quality Table 15: Overview of Registry Purposes Determining clinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness, or comparative effectiveness of a test or treatment, including evaluating the acceptability of drugs, devices, or procedures for reimbursement. Measuring or monitoring safety and harm of specific products and treatments, including comparative evaluation of safety and effectiveness. Measuring or improving quality of care, including conducting programs to measure and/or improve the practice of medicine and/or pub lic health. Assessing natural histor y, including estimating the magnitude of a problem; determining the underlying incidence or prevalence rate; examining trends of disease over time, conducting surveillance; assessing service delivery and identifying g roups at high risk; documenting the types of patients ser ved by a health pro vider; and describing and estimating sur vival. 184Table 16: Research Quality for Registries\u2014Basic Elements of Good Practice Planning Sufficient thought has been given to identifying and capturing all the necessary aspects that are feasible to collect from the outset. A written registry plan documents the goals; design; target population; methods for data collection, including patient recruitment; data elements and data sources; a high-level data management plan; plans for protecting human subjects and for data review for quality; and a high-level analysis plan that contains sufficient detail to explain the main focus and proposed methods of analysis. The process for identifying serious events is described and a plan is created for reporting, as appropriate and consistent with regulatory requirements. A plan for communication of study results is addressed. Appropriate personnel and facilities are available, including facilities for secure storage of data. A process is established for documenting subsequent modifications to the registry plan. Design The literature has been reviewed to guide appropriate data collection. The tar get population is described , including plans to recr uit study subjects. Specific eligibility, inclusion, and exclusion criteria are specified. The size required to detect an effect, should one exist, or achieve a desired level of precision is specified, whether or not the sample size requirement is met. The followup time required to detect events of interest is specified, whether or not it is feasible to achieve; however, the followup time planned is adequate to address the main objective. Plans are made for how the analysis will be conducted, including what comparative information, if any, will be used to support study hypotheses or objectives. Data elements and data sources Outcomes are clinicall y meaningful and rele vant in that the information is useful to the medical community for decisionmaking . Operational definitions of outcomes are clearly defined. Important exposures, risk factors, and mitigating (or protective) factors are identified and collected to the extent feasib le. The individual(s) responsible for the integrity of the data, computerized and hard copy, are identified; it is determined that they have the training and experience to perform the assigned tasks. Data collectors are trained using standard techniques. A data and coding dictionary is maintained to provide explicit definitions and describe coding used. A quality assurance plan has been created and addresses data editing and verification, as appropriate. Ethics, privacy, and governance The issues of protection of human subjects\u2014including privacy, informed consent, data security, and study ethics\u2014ha ve been carefully considered and addressed in accordance with local, national, and international regulations. The registry has received review by any required oversight committees (e.g., ethics committee, privacy committee, or institutional review board, as applicable).Section III. Evaluating Registries 185Table 17: Research Quality for Registries\u2014Potential Enhancements to Good Practice Planning A formal protocol covers all the topics listed as basic elements of a study plan, covering some elements in depth. The protocol also includes objectives or hypotheses; governance, privacy, and ethics; plans for data entry; and reporting of study results. It may be helpful for stakeholders to have input in reviewing the protocol before it is finalized to assure clinical relevance and feasibility. The protocol includes a plan for training registry and site personnel about how to identify and report serious events that occur during the observation period and that could be causally related to the product or process under study, as appropriate. An advisory board has been established. A feasibility study or pilot test may be useful in certain situations, such as when studying hard-to-reach populations, when sensitive data are sought, and when critical registry methods are new or have not otherwise been tested. Feasibility assessment may include evaluation of factors such as means and likelihood of recruiting appropriate patients, as well as establishing and fine-tuning what data will be collected and the methods for data collection. A plan for quality assurance is described in the protocol. The sampling process is part of a risk-based strategy that focuses on detecting and quantifying the most likely causes of error and the types of error that are most likely to impact the registry purpose. For example, a registry might compare a random sample of patient data (e.g. 5 percent to 20 percent of patients and specif ic data variables) with patient charts or with a sample of registry sites based on \"for-cause\" reasons, or a combination of these approaches. The plan for generating and/or reviewing publications and presentations is defined. It includes review by knowledgeab le par ties. Plans for timely dissemination of information and a process for others to access the data are considered. Design Use of concur rent comparators may offer an advantage over historical or external comparison groups in situations where treatments are evolving rapidly. The methods of data collection do not limit site participation such that the representativeness of site selection is compromised. While single methods of data collection to a centralized database (e.g., via Web) are most efficient, a single method may not suit all registries. Multiple methods of data collection may be required for some purposes (e.g., where access to computers or Internet is limited). Formal statistical calculations ma y be used to specify the size of the registry (number of patients or patient-years of obser vation) needed to measure an ef fect with a cer tain le vel of precision or to meet a specif ied statistical power to detect an effect, should one exist, whether or not the desired size is achievable within the practical study constraints. Precision and po wer considerations must be balanced ag ainst b udgetary and feasibility constraints, and should not be used as a reason to a void conducting research in areas w here little e xists.Chapter 11. Assessing Quality (continued) 186Table 17: Research Quality for Registries\u2014Potential Enhancements to Good Practice (continued) Data elements and data sources Whenever possible, coding used is consistent with nationally approved coding systems to promote comparability of information among studies. Standardized data dictionaries, such as the ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision), are used where applicable. It is preferable to use scales and tests that have been validated when such tools exist for the purpose needed. Rigor can be enhanced by external validation for a sample of data and/or data review by an adjudication committee for complex conditions or endpoints for which established procedures and/or coding are not used. To reduce losses to followup, safety studies can be enhanced by collecting enough information on individual identifiers to permit linkage with external databases such as the National Death Index where such databases exist, as appropriate. However, the desire for long-term followup should be balanced by considerations relating to the challenges posed by collecting individually identifiable data (as opposed to \"de-identified data\"), especially with regard to institutional review policies. Levels of quality assurance activities may be adapted based on observed performance. For example, they would be increased for sites that appear to be having difficulty in study conduct or data entry. Ethics, privacy, and governance Potential conflicts of interest are considered and managed appropriately. Plans for timely review and dissemination of results are established at the outset.Publication policies are specif ied in adv ance of collecting data. Publishing results in the peer-reviewed literature is a desirable means of introducing information into the public domain.Section III. Evaluating Registries 187Chapter 11. Assessing Quality Table 18: Evidence Quality for Registries\u2014Basic Elements of Good Practice Registry participants Registry participants are similar to the target population, and attention has been paid to minimizing selection bias to the extent feasible. Eligibility (in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria) is confirmed upon patient enrollment. For safety studies, personnel are appropriately trained to ask about complaints or adverse events in a manner that is clear and specific (e.g., solicited vs. unsolicited) and to know how information should be reported to manufacturers and health authorities. Completeness of information on eligible patients has been evaluated and described. Data elements and data sources Information has been collected for relevant key exposures, risk factors, and mitigating or protective factors. Patient outcomes are clinically relevant (in terms of information that will assist medical professionals with decisionmaking) and clearly defined. Definitions are provided, especially for complex conditions or outcomes that may not have uniformly established criteria (e.g., specify how an \"injection site reaction\" is operationally defined). The followup period is reasonably sufficient to capture the main outcomes of interest. Data quality assurance Data are reasonab ly complete. Reasonable efforts have been expended to assure that appropriate patients have been systematically enrolled and followed in as unbiased a manner as possible. Reasonab le efforts have been devoted to minimize losses to followup. Data checks are employed using range and consistency checks. Analysis Accepted analytic techniques are used; these may be augmented by new or novel approaches. The role and impact of missing data and potential confounding f actors have been explored. Reporting A report describes the methods, including target population and selection of study subjects, compliance with applicab le regulator y rules and regulations, data collection methods, any transformation of variables and/or construction of composite endpoints, statistical methods used for data analysis, and a description of any circumstances that may have affected the quality or integrity of the data. Results are repor ted for all the main objecti ves. Followup time is described so that readers can assess the impact of the observation period on the conclusions drawn. The repor t includes a clear statement of an y conclusions dra wn from the analysis of the registry' s primary and secondary objectives and any implications of study results, as appropriate. All authors who are acknowledged have had a meaningful role in the design, conduct, analysis, or interpretation of results. 188Table 19: Evidence Quality for Registries\u2014Potential Enhancements to Good Practice Registry participants Selection bias is evaluated. The external validity is described (i.e., registry subjects are shown typical of the target population). It may also be informative to describe how the actual population was selected. For studies of comparative effectiveness and safety, contemporaneous data are collected for a comparison group to the extent that this is ethical and feasible, and that other clinically relevant, robust comparative data are not available. For registries where practice characteristics may impact outcome, diverse clinical practices are represented. Data elements and data sources The exposure data used to support the main hypothesis are as specific as possible. For example, data identify a specific product, including manufacturer, if available. Results that can be confirmed by an unbiased observer\u2014such as death, test results, and scores from validated measures for patient-reported results or clinical rating scales\u2014enhance accuracy and reliability. The followup period is sufficient to capture outcomes of interest. Data quality assur ance Reproducibility of coding is e valuated. Potential sources of errors relating to accuracy and falsification are rigorously evaluated and quantified (e.g., through database and site re views). For studies of safety, effectiveness, and comparative effectiveness, a sample of data are compared with patient records. Followup is reasonab ly complete for the registry purpose. Validated analytic tools are used for the main analysis (e.g., commercially available analytic packages are used). Anal ysis Loss to followup is characterized at key stages during the conduct of the study. For safety studies, the risks and/or benefits of products, devices, or processes under study are quantitatively evaluated beyond simply evaluating statistical significance (e.g., rates, proportions, and/or relative risks are reported). Sensitivity analyses are useful to examine the effect of varying the study population inclusion/exclusion criteria, the assumptions regarding exposure, and the definitions of potential confounders and outcomes on the association between the a priori exposure of interest and the outcome(s). If models are used, the specific data elements that are included are described. Reporting Consistency of results is compared and contrasted with other relevant research. Inferences about causal ef fects are based on a v ariety of f actors, including the strength of the association, biases, and temporal relations. The practice of making inferences about causation largely on the outcome of tests of statistical signif icance is discouraged. Section III. Evaluating Registries 1891.

Gaithersburg, MDCase Example Contributors 213For concreteness, assume that the outcome of interest is a dichotomous variable measured on eachpatient, such as the presence/absence of a complication associated with carotid endarterectomy (CE). (Typically, this literature considerscomplications within 30 days of the procedure.)Nothing essential changes for outcome variables measured on other scales, such as continuous or survival data. The dichotomous outcome (i.e.,presence or absence of a complication) is then aggregated across patients into a complication rate (e.g., 9 complications for 300 patients = 3-percent complication rate). As a general principle, sample size calculations depend on the study design, the study question, andthe scale of measurement of the variables being measured. Indeed , one of the benef its of perfor ming a sample size calculation is the requirement that each of these be specified, thus increasing thelikelihood that the proper v ariab les will be measured on the proper patients in the proper manner. For CE, some registry-based designs and study questions that might be of interest include the following. Design 1 : For patients at high risk of stroke, perhaps using an operational definition of\"symptomatic with 70-99 percent stenosis of the carotid artery,\" the study question is whether thesurgeons within a larger entity (e.g., a national chain of hospitals) are, in agg regate, achieving similar complication rates to those w ho par ticipated in the randomized trials demonstrating the efficacy of CE. (The reason that this is an open question is that the surgeons and institutions in these randomized trialsunderwent a high degree of selection, thus raising the concer n that sur gical outcomes w ere better than could be expected in usual practice.) The patient inclusion criteria for the registry are selected to be as close as possib le to those of the randomized trials; thus, w hile v arious characteristics might be collected on each patient, no formal adjustment for case mix is required. F or the present pur poses,\"case-mix adjustment\" is the inclusion of various patient characteristics believed to influencecomplications of CE into a mathematical model used to predict the likelihood of these complications. Here, the most natural such model is a logistic regression. In Design 1, it is assumed that the characteristics of the registry patients are so similar to those of patients in the original randomized trials that no such adjustment isrequired. Further, suppose that the 30-da y complication rate of CE in the randomized trials was 3 percent. The study question can then be translated into a statistical hypothesis of a one-sample comparison ofan observed complication rate vs. a prespecifiedvalue. In other words, the null hypothesis is that surgeons within the lar ger entity are, in agg regate, achieving complication rates that are the same (3 percent) as those of surgeons who participated in therandomized trials. The f inal input required to perform the sample size calculation is the complication rate under the alternative hypothesis.For example, if it is determined that the goal of the registry is to have high power to flag results asstatisticall y significant if the true complication rate is 6 percent or higher, then the complication rateunder the alternative hypothesis is 6 percent. In general, the value of the complication rate under the alter native hypothesis is deri ved using a combination of quantitative and qualitative reasoning. (The precise methods used to derive the alternative hypothesis are context dependent and thus not discussed in detail here.) In the presentexample, a cost-effectiveness analysis might suggest that complication rates of 6 percent and abo ve would call into question the efficacy of CE. Given these inputs, it can be shown that the effect size is 0.21, and the sample size required for 80-percent power is approximately 370. Design 2 : Continuing to follo w patients at high risk of stroke, now suppose that the goal of the registry is to compare complication rates across hospitals.Appendix A. An Illustration of Sample Size Calculations 214For simplicity, we continue to assume that patients are sufficiently similar to the comparator patientsthat no explicit adjustment for case mix is required. Design 2 is a simple form of benchmarking application. For example, the CE complication ratesfor each hospital might be reported to a regulatoryagency and/or the general public, the presumptionbeing that statistically significant differencesbetween complication rates can be used to identify hospitals with differences in quality of care. Theparticular danger in this design is that the complication rate for any particular hospital mightbe estimated with relatively little precision, thusgenerating results that ha ve more noise than signal. (Another danger, discussed later, is that case-mix adjustment is required and not performed, orperformed but not adequate.) We assume that the benchmarking will focus on comparing specific hospitals\u2014i.e., in the underlyingstatistical model, hospital will represent a \"f ixed\" rather than \"random\" ef fect. The null h ypothesis is that the complication rates for all the hospitals are identical, and the alternative hypothesis is that thecomplication rates follow some pattern other thanbeing identical. In this design, specifying thealternative hypothesis of interest is a potentiall y formidab le task. One w ay to for mulate this hypothesis is to focus on outlier hospitals. For example, suppose that there are 10 hospitals in theregistry, the overall complication rate among 9 of these is expected to be 3 percent, and the complication rate at the tenth hospital is 10 percent. This infor mation, along with e xpected number of cases in each hospital, is sufficient to calculate an effect size and thus perfor m the sample size calculation. When comparing complication rates among specific hospitals, some adjustment may be made for multiple comparisons\u2014that is, in an y group of hospitals, there will al ways be a hospital with the highest complication rate, and focusing on differences betw een the outcomes of this par ticular hospital vs. outcomes of the others will overstate the level of statistical significance. The initial statistical test used to assess the homo geneity of complication rates across all the hospitals in the registryimplicitly takes this multiple-comparison problem into account. Subsequent tests, in particular thosetests that compare apparent outlier hospitals with others, should include an explicit adjustment for multiple comparisons, and the sample size calculations should reflect the fact that an adjusted comparison is being made. In practice, the approach to this design might reasonably depend on whether registry data are being collected electronically or manually. If dataare being collected electronically, then the most sensible policy is to collect information on all CEprocedures performed within each hospital and touse the sample size for mula as an assessment of whether the registry as a whole is likely to produce results that are sufficiently accurate to supportdecisionmaking. This assessment can be framed in terms of statistical power (as discussed above) orprecision. Considering precision, a 95-percent conf idence interval for a nonzero complication rate for an y hospital is p \u00b1 1.96 sqrt (pq/n), where p is the observed complication rate, q = 1- p, and n is the sample size. Supposing that p = 3 percent and n =300 per hospital, within any particular hospital, thewidth of this conf idence inter val is e xpected to be appro ximatel y \u00b11.9 percent. If data are being collected manually, and thus the marginal cost of data collection per patient is high, then a reasonablepolicy would be to collect data on enough patients per hospital so that the precision of estimates of the complication rate within that hospital is considered adequate. As with hypothesis testing, in deriving the width of the confidence interval, the analysis usually applies a combination of qualitative and quantitative insights. In particular, the question can be reframedas the following: For what values of the complication rate will m y decision (whether taken from the perspecti ve of clinical medicine, public health, etc.) be the same? For example, if the decision is the same re gardless of w here the complication rate falls within the range of 2-4 percent, then an interval of this width is \"sufficientl y precise. \"Appendix A. An Illustration of Sample Size Calculations 215Unless sample sizes are large, using registries to compare individual hospitals is potentially quiteproblematic. Although determining the inputs to the power calculations is not always a straightforward task, performing this analysis is quite useful, even ifthe result is only to suggest extreme caution in theinterpretation of between-hospital differences. Design 3 : Continuing to follow patients undergoing CE, now suppose that the goal of the registry is to compare two different versions of the surgicalprocedure. For simplicity, continue to assume that patients are sufficiently similar to the comparatorpatients that no explicit adjustment for case mix isrequired. The following discussion (after including an adjustment for case mix, if appropriate) also applies to comparing two different versions of a medical device and similar applications. The key distinction between this design and Design 2 is thatthe primar y comparison or comparisons can be stated ahead of time and that the number ofcomparisons is relatively small, thus implying that the issue of multiple comparisons can be ignored. The analytic approach to this design is a logistic regression, with the input file having one record perpatient. The outcome variable is the presence orabsence of a complication, the cate goricall y scaled control v ariab le is the hospital, and the primar y predictor is the categorically scaled coding of the type of surgical procedure (i.e., CE using version Avs. CE using version B). The null hypothesis is that, after accounting for any differences in hospitals, the two different versions of the procedure have identical complication rates. The alter native hypothesis is that the rates differ by a specified amount, this amount being the \"minimum clinicall y significant difference\" interpreted to be of concern. Power calculations proceed in the same fashion as for lo gistic re gression with multiple predictors. The main pitf all in this design is that patients who recei ve version A of the surgical procedure might differ from those who receive version B of the procedure along some dimension that has an impact on outcomes. (This pitfall is discussed in moredetail under Design 4.)In this application, the null and alternative hypotheses are sometimes structured the same wayas in an equivalence trial\u2014that is, differences in complication rates are not expected, and the goal of the study is to demonstrate that complication rates for the two versions of the surgical procedure are similar within a certain level of precision. Thestructure of the analysis is not fundamentally different. Indeed, sample size calculations forequivalence trials sometimes are not performed within a hypothesis-testing framework but instead are performed by identifying a sample size of sufficient magnitude to make the confidence interval for the difference in the complication rates between the two versions of the surgical procedure acertain width. For simplicity of presentation, from now on, assume that any equivalence-trial-type calculations can be reframed into conf idence interval for mat, and thus need not be discussed separatel y. Design 4 : Continuing to follow patients at high risk of stroke and continuing to assume that the goal of the registry is to compare two different versions ofthe surgical procedure, now additionally assume thatthis comparison will adjust for case mix. Within the lo gistic re gression paradigm, v ariables used to adjust for case mix are accounted for as covariates (i.e., additional predictors). Alternatively, propensity-scoring methods could be used to adjust for those variables that predict the assignment ofpatients to particular versions of the procedure. For concreteness, focus on lo gistic regression. In order to perfor m a sample size calculation for a lo gistic regression, the analyst must specify the predictive ability of the co variates and the odds ratio associated with the predictor of interest. (For example, version B of the procedure might increase the odds of complications b y a factor of 1.5.) Once these inputs are specified, the sample size calculation is straightforward. Both the logistic regression and propensity-scoring approaches suf fer from the fundamental dra wback that they can adjust only for covariates that are observed. In particular, if there are variables that predict outcome that are unmeasured (e.g., physician' s assessment of a patient' s likelihood toAppendix A. An Illustration of Sample Size Calculations 216comply with treatment or stroke in evolution not included in the administrative database used as thesource of data for the registry), then the comparison between the two versions of the surgical procedure is potentially biased. Accordingly, before proposingto use a registry to compare complication rates (e.g.,across different versions of a procedure or a device)or other outcomes, it is critical to determine that the following three conditions do not all hold: (1) apatient, provider, system or other characteristic affects the complication rate; (2) this characteristic is unmeasured within the registry; and (3) there is a reasonable likelihood that this characteristic might be differentially distributed across the different versions of the procedure or the device. If all threeconditions (in epidemiologic terms, the conditions for \"confounding\") hold , use of the registry to compare outcomes is potentiall y dangerous. Critical to Designs 1-4 is the assumption that the CE complication rate is stab le over time. Thus, for example, it is appropriate to use the registry to estimate a single complication rate associated with version A of the procedure, estimate another singlecomplication rate associated with version B of theprocedure, and compare the rates. On the otherhand , if the technolo gy of CE materials, sur gical technique) is impro ving, then the registry should continue to monitor the performance of CE over time. Such an ongoing monitoring function seems particularly relevant for medical devices and similar applications. Even when the associated technology is assumed to be stab le, some re gistries are intended to provide ongoing assessments of outcomes. For example, in a quality assurance conte xt, CE complication rates might be assessed at individual hospitals on an annual basis (e.g., in order to check for problems that ha ve recentl y arisen). On the other hand , a registry whose purpose is to assess whether the complication rates that were observed in randomized trials could be achieved in usual practice could be designed with a sunset pro vision to cease operation once this question is answered. The latter type of re gistry might, for e xample, accompan y a conditional co verage decision b y the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.Having an ongoing monitoring function induces additional analytical complications, among others amultiple-comparisons problem. Traditional statistical power calculations are performed under the assumption that the sample size is fixed and that(unless otherwise noted) multiple comparisons are not a major issue. Sequential testing methods associated with randomized trials (where, for example, the type I error of .05 is apportioned intoan early test with alpha = .001 and a subsequent test with alpha = .499) do not apply to this particular design, since most of these methods assume that the maximum sample size is fixed. (Some methods assume that what is fixed is not the number of patients but the number of events, but these methodsare not a good match for registry applications either .) Design 5 : Suppose the goal is to estimate the complication rate associated with CE at multipletime points for the foreseeab le future. Control char t methodolo gy might reasonab ly be applied to this class of problems. This methodology, often used in the quality assurance and quality improvement context, was originally developed forindustrial applications. In this example, the nullhypothesis, under w hich the system in question is \"in control, \" is that the CE complication rate remains at the desired value of 3 percent throughout the entire followup period. Samples are taken ateach point in time (e.g., monthly). As an example, if these monthly samples are of size 100, then the standard er ror is approximately 1.7 percent. The analyst then creates a \"control char t\" by plotting these monthly complication rates over time and forming \"channels\" based on the standard er ror. In this example, the channel extending from the point estimate to 1 standard error above the point estimate is 3 percent to 4.7 percent. Once the basic control char t (which goes by different names depending on the scale of measurement of the outcome variable) is formed, the plot is check ed for v arious violations of the null hypothesis of constant complication rates. The set of possible violations to be flagged as statistically signif icant might include (1) an y obser vation more than 3 standard errors from the mean; (2) two ofAppendix A. An Illustration of Sample Size Calculations 217three consecutive observations more than 2 standard errors from the mean; (3) eight observations in arow that increase or decrease; and (4) eight observations in a row on one side of the mean. These rules of thumb implicitly take into accountthe multiple-comparisons problem by requiringnoteworthy departures from the null hypothesis inorder to be flagged, and they are based on the observed properties of physical machines as theyfall out of adjustment (suddenly breaking down and producing an extreme outlier, gradually heating and thus producing sequentially higher readings, etc.). Complication rates of CE might or might not follow the properties of physical machines, but the decision rules from control chart methodology are at least agood place to start.Appendix A.

Licensingordinarily consists of a private agreement governed by contract rather than copyright law. 336 The exclusive rights conferred by copyright to prepare derivative works and distribute copies of ahealth infor mation re gistry, however, may be limited by regulatory requirements. Privacy Rule restrictions may exist on data use, reuse, and disclosures or may require additional patientauthorizations for subsequent research use. Theconditions of institutional review board approval under the Common Rule ma y also limit reuse and further disclosure of registry data. The terms ofpatient authorization and consent, a data useagreement, or a b usiness associate ag reement may modify the scope and nature of rights protected by copyright law. These limitations can be avoided bythe use of de-identified health information, as defined by the Privacy Rule, plus information that isnot subject to the Common Rule, if the y suffice for the scientific or other purposes of the registry.Without resort to copyright protections, State laws may directl y restrict access to registry data, as well as the use and disclosure of data from re gistries developed by public health agencies. Formal copyright registration 337with the U.S. Copyright Office is not necessary but may be desirab le for registries anticipated to have commercial value. The owner of a copyright is generally the author338 or author' s emplo yer; ownership of the cop yright for a compilation is not ownership of the underlying facts or data.339Copyright law presumes that an emplo yer owns the copyright in materials created by an emplo yee within the scope of his or her employment as a \"work made for hire.\"340 Institutional policies and procedures frequentl yprescribe whether the registry developer, his or her employer, or a funding agency owns the copyright.Employee manuals often contain an employer' sposition on the intellectual property created byemployees. Research institutions frequently reservethe right to the intellectual property produced bytheir employees. Intellectual property issues are explicitly negotiated in most sponsored research contracts. Authors of a joint work are co-owners ofcopyright in the work. 341 Several f actors deter mine w hether the use of a registry protected by copyright for scholarship, research, or certain other purposes is within the statutory fair use limitation on copyright.342In general, these factors will support subsequent usesof registry data for research, even though it may be protected b y cop yright. In an y given set of circumstances, a specific analysis of the statutory factors is necessary to determine whether use islikely to be vie wed within the fair use limitation on copyright. 343 Copyright law may provide some legal protections for compilations such as health information registries. The extent of this protection depends on the specific characteristics of the registry. In general, the concept of o wnership does not comfortably apply to health information, even when limited to copyright. Nevertheless, some registry developers ma y want to consider adding the le gal protections of copyright to reinforce controls on access to and use of registry data. Registry developers may also encounter copyright protections on health infor mation held by health care providers. Use of health information protected by copyright for research pur poses ma y constitute f air use under copyright law.Appendix B.
