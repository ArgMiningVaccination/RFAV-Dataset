The Virginia Food Regulations (12VAC5 -421 & 2VAC5 -585) have been updated to include changes to the 2017 version of the US Food and Drug Administrat ion's Model Food Code . This update, effective June 24, 2021, requires food establishment to have written procedures for employees to follow when responding to vomiting or diarrheal events. Virginia Retail Food Regulatory Update WHAT? This guide serves to bring awareness to (1) the new requirement to have a written procedure to address vomit/diarrheal events in a food establishment, and (2) to provide guidance on how to effectively respond to such events in a manner to protect employees as well as the public. Mak e sure the plan you develop for your establishments includes the elements below then train your employees to follow the plan. WHY? When someone vomits or has diarrhea in a food establishment there is a high risk of transmission of illness in the establishm ent. By having a written plan and training employees on how to respond to these types of incidents you can limit the risk to your employees and customers. Employees who respond to these types of incidents should be properly trained to clean up fecal and vo mit matter in a way that protects them, the customers, and food. Effective clean -up of vomit or diarrhea in a food establishment is an important means of preventing the spread of harmful pathogens in the establishment and should be handled differently from routine cleaning. An effective clean -up policy involves more stringent cleaning and disinfecting processes than the cleaning and sanitizing protocols food establishments normally use. Clean up Surfaces Many types of surfaces can become contaminated when someone throws up or experiences diarrhea in your establishment. It is important that you use the correct clean -up procedure for the surface(s) that are contaminated. Three types of surfaces are common in food establishments: Hard surfaces (floors, tables, utensils) Soft surfaces that cannot be laundered (carpet and upholstered furniture) Soft surfaces that can be laundered (linens, towels, and clothing) Step 1: Cover Cover the vomit or diarrhea with paper towels or an absorbent powder (such as kit ty litter) to soak up liquids. Step 2: Remove Remove the paper towels or hardened powder with a scoop/scraper and immediately place them in a sealable plastic bag. Step 3: Wash Prepare a solution of soapy water. Wash all surfaces contaminated with vomit or diarrhea with this solution. This includes all nearby surfaces possibly splashed by vomit or diarrhea, such as chair legs, tables, walls, shelves, or counters. Wash as wide of an area surrounding the vomit or diarrhea as is possible. Work from the clean areas towards the most contaminated areas to minimize the spread of infectious material. Rinse the soapy water from all surfaces with clean water. Step 4: Disinfect Use paper towels or a mop with a disposable mop head, saturate all washed surfaces with a disinfectant. Prepare a chlorine bleach solution (CDC & EPA recommendations): 34 cup of concentrated bleach + 1 gallon water (concentration ~3500ppm) -OR- 1 cup of regular strength bleach + 1 gallon water Use a spray bottle and saturate the area and surf aces (25 foot radius). Leave surface wet for at least 5 minutes. Always follow the directions on product label. Wash, rinse, and sanitize all surfaces intended for food or mouth contact before use. After Clean Up Step 1: Remove Remove all personal protect ive equipment and place in the plastic bag. Do not touch any of the surfaces that were just cleaned as they can be re -contaminated. All personal protective equipment must be taken off before leaving the area that has been cleaned. Place all used cleaning supplies, such as paper towels and disposable mop heads, in the plastic bag. Seal the bag with a twist tie. Throw away all uncovered food near the vomit or diarrhea event as well as any food handled by the person who was sick. Remove all waste from the fac ility immediately following local, state, or federal rules. Step 2: Clean mops and scoops Wash and disinfect mop handles and other reusable cleaning supplies, such as scoops/scrapers, using the same steps as used for hard surfaces. Step 3: Wash hands Wash hands thoroughly before performing any other duties. Sample Clean Up of Vomit or Diarrhea Events -Checklist Upon discovery of a vomit or diarrheal event immediately take the following actions: IMMEDIATE Action Position signage and/or an employee to block entry into a contaminated area, whether in the food prep area or in a dining area. If the incident occurred in the food prep area, stop all food prep and serving operations. Discard any food that may have been contaminated in the process of preparation, cold holding, hot holding, or being served. Consider everything in t he 25 -ft radius of the incident as being contaminated. Because single -service items and portion packages are not practical to disinfect, discard these items. Ask employees in the area to wash their hands and, if needed, change glove s. Verify that dish machine is achieving sanitization temperature/chemical concentration. If the incident occurs in a dining area, remove/discard potentially contaminated self -service items such as mints, salt/pepper, creamers, etc. to prevent cross contamination and carry over to other custom ers. Disinfect or discard menus that may have been contaminated. Relocate customers within a 25 -foot radius of the area where the event occurred . To avoid the use of any potentially contaminated plates, cutlery, etc. remove all from the serving station and appoint an employee to issue freshly washed and sanitized items. Encourage hand washing for customers as well. Clean Up Action: Relocate people from areas to be disinfected. Put on PPE : apron, shoe covers, hair cover, face mask/shield or goggles for eyes, and gloves. Spread the absorbent powder over the vomit or diarrhea spill. Allow the absorbent powder to soak up any liquid and become solidified. Scrape and/or scoop up the absorbent powder and place without agitation or movement into the disposable bag. Apply disinfectant to the entire area and allow it to stand for the manufacturer's recommended time -10-20 minutes for chlorine bleach. Use paper towels or disinfectant wipes to clean up the disinfectant and place into disposable bag. Remove PPE and place it into disposable bag. (Triple bag) Close the bag with the twist tie and immediately transfer to outside dumpster. Disinfect restroom and all cleaning equipment not disposed of after use. Notes and comments : Facts about Nororvirus Norovirus is the leading cause of outbreaks with associated symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting in the US, and it spreads quickly. Norovirus spreads by contact with an infected person or a contaminated surface or by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. Norovirus particles can even float through the air and then settle on surfaces, spreading contamination. Norovirus particles are extremely small and billions of them are in the stool and vomit of infected people. Any vomit or diarrhea may contain norovirus and should be treated as though it does. People can transfer norovirus to others for at l east three days after being sick. "}
