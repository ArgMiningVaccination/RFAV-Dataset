Due to the widespread availability of COVID-19 testing available on the island and the sharp decrease in demand at WhidbeyHealth for coronavirus testing appointments, WhidbeyHealth will cease operating its scheduled or drive-up polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on November 12, 2021. Those in the community in need of elective PCR testing, pre-procedurally or for travel, should seek testing at a local pharmacy or with their prescribing provider. WhidbeyHealth will continue to administer PCR testing as a medical necessity for symptomatic patients at our Emergency Department and Walk-In Clinics.

With the rise of positive COVID-19 cases throughout our County, we want to make sure our community receives the testing they need, information about quarantine, and our recommendations to avoid exposure in the most transparent way possible. In this section you will find definitions and effective actions for COVID-19 related processes. Close Contact Exposure: is identified as exposure to a COVID-19 positive person within a 6 foot distance for a total of 15 minutes over a twenty four (24) hour period and applies to any scenario when contact like this is made. The exposure timeline begins two (2) days before the COVID-19 positive person is showing any symptoms or they receive a positive test result. General COVID-19 Testing: Effective COVID-19 Quarantine Process: Effective COVID-19 Isolation Process: General Safety Recommendations: Following these guidelines will help slow the spread of COVID-19 as most of the spread is directly linked to social gatherings and lack of face covers. WhidbeyHealth is working with Island County Department of Health and the Washington State Department of Health to help slow the spread of COVID-19 across the county and state. We've taken steps to protect the health and safety of our employees throughout this pandemic, and we are continuing to look for opportunities to work with public health agencies to benefit our Whidbey Island community and beyond. On November 30, Washington State launched WA Exposure Notifications (WA Notify). It uses smartphones to alert users if they may have been exposed to COVID-19. It is completely private, and doesn't know or track who you are or where you go. How does it work? When you enable WA Notify, your smartphone exchanges random, anonymous codes with the phones of people you are near who have also enabled WA Notify. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to exchange these random codes without revealing any information about you. If another WA Notify user you've been near in the last two weeks, later tests positive for COVID-19 and adds their verification code to the app, you'll get an anonymous notification that you've had a possible exposure. This lets you get the care you need quickly and helps prevent you from spreading COVID-19 to the people around you. How do I get WA Notify on my phone? On an iPhone: Go to settings > Scroll down to Exposure Notifications > Click \"Turn on Exposure Notifications\" > Select United States > Select Washington On an Android Phone: Go to the Google Play Store > Download the Washington Exposure Notifications app For more information about Washington Exposure Notifications please visit [https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/WANotify](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/WANotify).
