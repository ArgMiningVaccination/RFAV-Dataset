INTRODUCTION The Montana Immunization Program implements the national COVID -19 Vaccination Program within the state of Montana. This handbook contains Montana -specific information for enrolled provider s and is a component of the provider training program. It, combined with the documents on our Required Training webpage , prepares providers for receiving, managing, and administering CO VID-19 vaccine. Throughout this document, required activities are indicated in the section headings. The handbook and our COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Resource webpage will be updated as information changes and more vaccines are authorized. The primary vaccine coordinator at your facility will be notified of significant changes. Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 6 of 32 For Montana COVID -19 Vaccination Program support , email covidvax@mt.gov or call 406 -444-5580. 3. EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION AND FDA LICENSING Emergency Use Authorization COVID -19 vaccines are initially authoriz ed under an Emergency Use Authorization or EUA. An EUA allows the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to authorize the use of unapproved medical product s such as a vaccine during an emergency based on certain criteria. The EUA outlines how the COVID -19 v accine must be used and any required condition s of authorized use. Until full licensure, t he EUA is the primary source of information on each authorized COVID -19 vaccine. Use the link (s) below to access COVID -19 vaccine EUA fact sheets for healthcare prov iders : Pfizer -BioNTech EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers \u201412 years of age and older (purple cap, must dilute - retired December 23, 2021 ) Pfizer -BioNTech EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers \u201412 years of age and older (gray cap, DO NOT DILUTE \u2014Introduced December 23, 2021) Pfizer -BioNTech EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers \u20145-11 years of age (orange cap, must dilute) Moderna EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Provide rs Janssen EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Full FDA Licensing On Monday, August 23, 2021, FDA approved the Pfizer BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine for use as a two -dose series for individuals 16 years of age and older. The new t radename is Comirnaty \u00ae. The FDA licensure applies to purple -cap Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine (retired on December 23, 2021, but still in inventory in the state) and the gray -cap Pfizer -BioNTech product (introduced on December 23, 2021) for use as a 2 -dose primary series in individuals 16 years of age and older. The EUA remains in effect f or administering Pfizer -BioNTech purple cap and gray cap vaccine as follows: A 2-dose primary series to individuals 12 through 15 yea rs of age A third primary series dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have certain kinds of immunocompromise A single booster dose to individuals 16 years of age and older who have completed a primary series with Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vacci ne or Comirnaty \u00ae Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 7 of 32 A single booster dose to individuals 18 years of age and older who have completed primary vaccination with a different authorized COVID -19 vaccine. The full licensure language is captured in the current EUA Fact Sheet s for Healthcare Pro viders and in the prescribing information (product in sert) . Interchangeability of FDA authorized (EUA) and FDA approved COVID -19 Products: The FDA -approved - BioNTech product -19 -authorized -BioNTech COVID -19 under EUA can be used interchangeably to prov ide the COVID -19 vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns. Therefore, providers can use doses distr ibuted under the EUA to administer the vaccination series for those seeking the approved vaccine. The Fact Sheet for Recipi ents provides additional information about both the approved and authorized vaccine. Providers should continue to use the vaccines in their inventory to their expiration or beyond use dates . The pediatric Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine (orange cap) is only author ized under an EUA at this time. 4. VACCINE -19 Vaccine Official Website 800-565-4008 Vaccine Expiration Dates As stability data is collected on COVID -19 vaccine s, manufacturers may extend the expiration date on a particular lot . Alwa ys confirm that a n expiration date is still valid before discarding expired vaccine. Pfizer -BioNTech Pfizer Product \u201412 years of age and older (Purple cap. Must dilute) Lots of Pfizer vaccine for 12 years of age and older (purple cap) come with labeled expi ration dates. However, on August 23, 2021, FDA approved an extension to the Pfizer expiration dates for particular lots. Cartons and vials of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine with a printed expiration date of August 2021 through February 2022 may remain in use for 3 months beyond the printed date as long as they have been kept in ultra -cold storage between -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C ( -130\u00b0F to -76\u00b0F). We maintain current expiration dates in imMTrax . See table below for guidance: Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 8 of 32 Table 1 Pfizer -BioNTech Purple Cap Expiration Date Extensions (Source: CDC) Pfizer Product \u201412 years of age and older (Gray cap. DO NOT DILUTE) and 5-11 years of age ( Orange cap. Must dil ute) The Pfizer gray cap and orange cap vaccines come with the manufacture month and year printed on the vial and carton. The vaccine expires 9 months after the m anufacture date including the month of manufacture. The actual expiration date is the last day of that ninth month. imMTrax lists accurate expiration dates and not manufacture dates. You can refer to imMTrax for the accurate expiration dates. See table bel ow for guidance: Table 2 Pfizer -BioNTech Gray Cap Expiration Date Calc ulation (Source: CDC) Moderna and Janssen Lots of Moderna and Janssen vaccine do not come with labeled expiration dates. You can find the expiration date by entering the lot number printed on the carton into the manufacturers respective websites listed below or scanning the QR code on the vaccine. You can also check imMTrax for current expiration dates : Moderna online expiration dat e lookup tool Janssen online expiration date lookup tool imMTrax -Web Main Page Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 9 of 32 5. VACCINE PRIORITIZATION AND ACIP RECOMMENDATIONS - REQUIRED Montana currently follows the recomme ndations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for administering COVID -19 vaccines. ACIP recommendations are captured in the CDC-published \"Clinical Considerations\" documents linked below. Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 vaccines Currently Approved or Authorized in the US Summary of Clinical Considera tions for COVID -19 Vaccine Authorized in the US 6. PROVIDER ENROLLMENT - REQUIRED Healthcare facilities must enro ll with the Montana Immunization Program by submitting a CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement (Provider Agreement) in order to rece ive, store, and administer COVID -19 vaccine. The Immunization Program will confirm the following before appro ving an enrollment: Storage unit and temperature monitoring capabilities meet minimum CDC standards Medical licenses for prescribing providers l isted on the Provide r Agreement are current That we have the necessary information to enter your location into our vaccine distribution system. Contact covidvax@mt.gov or call 406 -444-5580 for information on how to en roll. 7. KEY STAFF & COVID-19 VACCINE MANAGEMENT PLAN You listed t hree points of contact on your Provider Agreement: an organization email (Section A) , and a location - specific primary and backup vaccine coordinator ( Section B) . Please refer to your Provider Agreement and be aware of who your points of contact are. Using the specific primary and back -up coordinators, an up-to-date COVID -19 Vaccine Management Plan must be completed and posted at your location (Appendix A). Enrolled VFC providers may use their Section 12 VFC vaccine management plan if the contacts and location information is the same. All state, federal, and contracted entities involved in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program will use these email addresses to communicate with your facility . Please ensure these ema il addresses are actively monitored , emailed information is read carefully , and instructions are followed accurately . Please keep your POCs up to date. Contact the Immunization Program if you need to update the points of contact at your fac ility. Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 10 of 32 8. PROVIDER TRAINING - REQUIRED The Montana Immunization Program is required to train providers on the COVID -19 Vaccination Program. Our required training program is located here: COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Required Training It consists of the primary vaccine coordinator at your facility doing the following : 1. Click ing the links on the Required Training webpage and r eading the require d information . 2. Sharing this information with staff at your facility as you deem appropriate. 3. Completing the online attestation form on the webpage attesting to the completion of the activities and keep a log of other employees who have completed the traini ngs (Appendix B) . Downloading the documents is optional but recommended so you have off -line versions but be aware that the Required Training webpage and handbook will be updated frequently as information changes and more vaccine s are authorized and app roved . Primary coordinators should keep up with and share changes with other staff but are not required to attest to their trai ning after the original attestation. Although o nly the primary vaccine coordinator is required to attest to training completion , we encourage all staff at your facility involved in COVID -19 vaccination to read and understand the training contents. Additional Resources The Montana COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Resources webpage has links to additional (not required) COVID -19 vaccine trainings and resources. 9. IMMTRAX - REQUIRED imMTrax , is Montana's Immunization Information System. imMTrax consolidates immunizatio n records from healthcare providers and \"shot cards\" to form one complete, digital record. imMTrax is the platform used to order and manage public vaccines, including COVID -19 vaccines. All providers enrolled in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program must partic ipate in imMTrax , and imMTrax onboarding is part of the enrollment process. Access to imMTrax is restricted. Staff needing access to imMTrax must submit a n imMTrax Access Request Form and be assigned a role commensurate with their activities in the system. Your primary and backup vaccine coordinato rs must have a vaccine management role in order to manage COVID -19 vaccine inventory in the syste m. If you need imMTrax access or have questions about your assigned role , email hhsphsiis@mt.gov or call 406-444-5580 . 10. ORDERING VACCINE Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 11 of 32 As of August 1, 2021, COVID -19 vaccine supply exceeds demand, and enrolled provi ders can order vaccine as needed in imMTrax. However, to prevent wastage, we encourage you to inquire locally about receiving a transfer of vaccine already in the state before placi ng a new direct -ship order especially if the minimum quantity for a direct -ship order is more than you need . Ordering Vaccine in imMTrax Before placing a vaccine order, you must have reconciled your inventory within the last 30 days. See Section 13 - Reconciling Vaccine in imMTrax for details on how to reconcile your inventory. Place orders in imMTrax by using the order form found at VOMS >>>Orders & Returns >>>Orders & Tran sfers >>>New Order . Click the drop -down arrow next to Choose a n Order Set: and select COVID -19. Order vaccine by putting the number of doses in the Doses Requested column next to the product you wish to order. T he quantity ordered must be divisible by the minimum dose order. A red callout box will appear with the minimum dose orde r requirement if your doses requested do not conform to the rules. DO NOT enter anyt hing in the Comments box. We do not use or monitor that field. Click Next. On the next page, confirm your shipping address and Primary Vaccine Coordinator. Contact the Immunization Program if you need to make changes. DO NOT worry about the delivery hours or enter any Delivery Instructions. We manage delivery hours in another program and do not use or monitor the Delivery Instructions field. When your order is ready, clic k Submit Order . DO NOT just Save your order. Saved orders are not sent to the Immunizat ion Program. You must SUBMIT ORDER . You can monitor the status of your order by going to VOMS >>>Orders & Returns >>>Orders & Transfers. Your order should show in the list with the status in the last column. You should receive your order within 1 -3 days of submitting your order. Please call the Immunization Program (406 -444-5580) if you do not receive your order within 5 days of placing your order. First and Second Dose s For vaccines with two -dose regimen s, providers are responsible for acquiring second doses to vaccinate recipients on time . Second doses no longer automatically ship in time for administration. Providers can either reserve second doses from current inventor y or place another order for their second doses. 11. RECEIVING VACCINE IN IMMTRAX You will receive an email from us the morning of the day your vaccine is scheduled to arrive at your facility , and your COVID -19 vaccines will automatically appear in your imMT rax inventory . You do not need to do anything . To view your inventory in imMTrax : 1. Log in to imMTrax . Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 12 of 32 2. Select Vaccine Management VOMS 2.0 from the left -hand menu. 3. Once in VOMS 2.0, select Inventory and then either Reconciliation or Add/Search . 4. You should see your COVID -19 vaccine listed i n your inventory under the Private tab. 12. VACCINEF INDER - REPORTING DAILY INVENTORY - REQUIRED VaccineFinder is a national online re pository of vaccine inventory that is being used to track COVID -19 vaccine doses at provider locations. Once you receive vaccine, vaccine providers are required to report COVID -19 vaccine inventory on hand in VaccineFinder each day your facility is open . Inventory on hand should be based on the doses in each multi -dose vial (MDV) as described in the EUA . (See Section 2 5 for more information on doses per vial and tracking inventory. ) Providers enrolled in the COVID -19 Vaccin ation Program will receive an email from the \"COVID Locating Health Provider Portal\" (vaccinefinder@auth.castlighthealth.com ) with instructions for enrolling in VaccineFinder. The initial email will be sent to the organization email entered on page 1 of your Provider Agreement. Multi -location organizations will have the choice of having one contact (org email on page 1 of your Pro vider Agreement) report inventory for all locations or having each location report inventory separately. Providers have two options for reporting inventory: manual entry or upload using a spreadsheet. Contact the Immunization Program if you do not receive an email onboarding your facility to VaccineFinder or if you have i ssues enrolling . In addition to inventory reporting, VaccineFinder has a public display function where you can opt to display your COVID -19 vaccine availability and services to the public in a n easy -to-use, searchable interface. Using the public display feature in VaccineFinder is optional, but we encourage you to use it if it makes sense in your vac cination efforts . The following link has more information on VaccineFinder including downloadable handouts an d training videos: VaccineFinder Provider Support 13. RECONCILING VACCINE IN IMMTRAX Once a month, you must reconcile your vaccine inventory in imMTrax . This involves accounting for the doses administered or otherwise removed from inventory since your last reconciliation. If you participate in other public vaccine programs such as the Vaccines for Children program , you should reconcile your COVID -19 vaccines at the same time you reconcile your other public vaccines. The p rocess differs depending on how you report administered vaccines to the system. See below for brief descriptions of the reconciliation process . Quick reference guides and videos on reconciling inventory can be found here: imMTrax Training . See Section 2 5 for information on accounting for extra doses due to vial overfill. Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 13 of 32 Aggregate Providers If you do not hand -key (direct enter) shots into imMTrax and shots come in through a data feed, you are an \"aggregate provider\" and should reconcile your inventory usi ng the following steps: 1. Log in to imMTrax . 2. Select Vaccine Management VOMS 2.0 from t he left -hand menu. 3. Once in VOMS, click the arrow next to Inventory in the left -hand menu. Then select Reconcile . 4.

VACCINATION RECORD C ARDS (R EQUIRED ) AND SECOND OSE EMINDERSD R Providers must provide a n accurately filled -out COVID -19 Vaccination Record Card to each vaccine recipient. Vaccination Record Cards are part of the ancillary kit included with each vaccine shipment. Providers must complete all required information (i.e., manufacturer, lot number, date of first dose, and second d ose due date) including t he second -dose appointment field , if possible . Contact the Immunization Program if you need additional Vaccination Record Card s. Pleas e keep paper and digital versions of the Vaccination Record Card in a secure place. Providers sh ould encourage the vaccine recipients to: Keep the card in a safe place and present it when they receive their second dose. Take a picture of their card with t heir Smartphone as a backup Enter their second -dose due date on any digital or paper calendars or reminder systems they use. For redundancy, providers should use any system available to them to remind vaccine recipients about their second dose including s cheduling an appointment for the second dose, if possible . V-safe - After Vaccinatio n Health Checker V-safe is a smartphone app that uses text messaging and web surveys to check -in with patients after they receive a COVID -19 vaccination. Through v-safe, patients can quickly tell CDC of post -vaccination side effects . Depending on what is reported to v-safe, CDC may follow up with the patient. V-safe will also remind patients to get their second dose , if indicated. Please encourage your patients to partici pate in v-safe by distributing a v-safe patient information sh eet (linked below) to all vaccine recipients . The v -safe Patient Information Sheet and a poster to display at your facility can be found on our COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Resources webpage . 17. TEMPERATURE MONITORING - REQUIRED COVID -19 vaccine providers are expected to follow the standards of practice for vaccine storage and handling as described in the COVID -19 Addendum to t he CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit (starts on page 49) . Digital and paper temperature records must be kept for a minimum of three years. Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 18 of 32 Continuous Monitoring COVID -19 vaccine providers must continuously monitor the temperature of vaccine storage units using a device called a data logger. Data loggers are digital thermometers capable of continuously recording temperatures on a predetermined schedule. Vaccine providers must have a data logger in each vaccine storage unit and transport cooler used for COV ID-19 vaccine . At a minimum, data loggers must: Be continuous recording devices that take readings at least every 30 minutes Be calibrated to accurat ely monitor the temperature r ange it is used for (i.e., refrigerator 2 to 8\u00b0C, frozen -25 to -15\u00b0C, ultra -cold -90 to -60\u00b0C) Read temperatures from a buffered probe . Display the current, minimum, and maximum temperatures on the outside of the storage unit or transport container Generate historic data that is able to be archived, reviewed, and sent to the Immunization Program. Daily Monitoring In addition to continuous monitoring, providers also must manually check storage unit temperatures once per day pre ferably in the morning before beginning to vaccinate and record : Minimum/maximum temp erature (If the data logger cannot display a min/max temperature , the current temperature must be recorded twice daily , morning and evening.) Date and time Name of person checking and recording temperature Actions taken and resolution if a temperature exc ursion occurred. 18. REPORTING TEMPERATURE EXCURSIONS - REQUIRED A temperature excursion occurs whenever vaccine is exposed to temperatures outside those allowed by the EUA and/or prescribing information. Refer to the EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Provider s for each vaccine for the exact storage conditions and any allowed deviations. Incidents within the confines of an allowed deviation are not considered excursion s. Incidents Involving Vaccine Shipments Pfizer Vaccine (Purple , Gray , and Orange Cap Products) Controlant \u00ae is contracted to monitor Pfizer vaccine shipments. Controlant \u00ae should know of any issues with your vaccine while it is in route to your facility and will contac t you if they are aware of iss ues. Once the thermal shipper arrives at your facility, press the Stop button on the data logger embedded in the thermal shipper for 5 seconds. You will receive an email from Controlant \u00ae with instructions. If you have question s about the condition Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 19 of 32 of the thermal shipper or temperatures upon arrival at your facility, immediately call Pfizer customer support at 877-829-2619 and follow the instructions in the shipper . Moderna and Janssen Vaccine s Follow the instructions that come with your Moderna and Janssen vaccine shipments and contact the phone number in the instructions if you have questions about the condition or temper atures of the shipment upon arrival at your facility. Either the Immunization Program or McKesson will follo w up with you with next steps. Incidents Involving Storage and Handling at your Facility While vaccine is in your custody, you must respond to temperature excursions involving COVID -19 vaccine immediat ely by taking the following steps: 1. Stop vaccinating and quarantine ( place a \"DO NOT USE\" designation ) on the affected vaccine . 2. Notify the primary or backup vaccine coordinator at your facility. 3. If possible, s tabilize the situation by placing the vaccine into appropriate storage temperatures. (DO NOT re-freez e thawed vials. ) 4. Download the temperature data for the timeframe of the excursion and ascertain the duration and extent (minimum or maximum temperature ac hieved). 5. Contact the Immunization Program at by submitting an online Vaccine Incident Report . You can also contact the Immunization Program at covidvax@mt.gov or 406 -444-5580.

VACCINE REDISTRIBUTION - REQUIRED (IF APPLICABLE TO YOUR FACILITY ) Whenever possible, COVID -19 vaccine will be directly shipped to the end -use facility. U nder certain circumstances it may be necessary to redistri bute COVID -19 vaccine beyond the direct ship locations . For instance, providers capable of storing large amounts of vaccine may be asked to redistr ibute vaccine to those with less capacity . Large healthcare organizations may wish to redistribute vaccine to other locations within their organization. Providers redistributing vaccine outside of their location must : 1. Have a CDC Supplemental COVID -19 Vacc ine Redistribution Agreement on file. Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 20 of 32 2. Only redi stribute vaccine to facilities enrolled in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program 3.

COVERAGE AND BILLING COVID -19 vaccine providers must not sell or seek reimbursement fo r COVID -19 vaccine and any adjuvant, syringes, needles, or other constituent products and ancillary supplies that the federal government provides without cost to the provider . Providers agree to administer vaccine reg ardless of a recipient's ability to pay and regardless of their coverage status, and may not seek any reimbursement, including through balance billing, from a vaccine recipient. Providers who have questions about billing or reimbursement of vaccine admini stration for patients covered by privat e insurance or Medicaid should contact the respective health plan or state Medicaid agency. Center for Medicare Services and Medicaid Toolkits To ensure adequate reimbursement for COVID -19 vaccine administration, CMS has the following webpage with informat ion and toolkits : (https://www.cms.gov/covidvax -provider ) To ensure broad and consistent coverage, the CMS toolkits have specific information for several programs , including: Medicare: Beneficiaries w ith Medicare pay nothing for COVID -19 vaccines , and their copayment/coinsurance and deductible are waived. Medicaid: State Medicaid agencies must provide vaccine administration with no cost sharing for most beneficiaries during the public health emergency . Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Immunization Prog ram MT IZ COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Handbook Page 23 of 32 Private Plans : CMS, along with the Departments of Labor and the Treasury, is requiring most private health plans an d issuers to cover a recommended COVID -19 vaccine and its administration, both in - network and out -of-network, with no cost sharing. The ru le also provides that out -of-network rates cannot be unreasonably high , and references CMS's reimbursement rates as a potential guideline for insurance companies. Uninsured: Providers will be able to be reimbursed for administering COVID -19 vaccine to ind ividuals without insurance through the Provider Relief Fund , administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).
