Food allergies are more common in babies and children.

Allergy symptoms Symptoms are different depending on the type of the allergies. In allergic rhinitis to dust or pollen, for example, you will probably experience sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itching in the nose.

In cases of food or medication allergy, the patient often has red spots on the skin with associated itching, although other symptoms may be included. In severe cases people can even have anaphylactic shock. How to properly treat allergies Sometimes it is possible to identify the cause of the allergy quickly, when we consume a different food than what we are used to, insert a different medication in the routine or even realize when we have been bitten by an insect that caused an allergic reaction in the body. The important thing is to understand what happened. Therefore, if the cause of the reaction is not known, the ideal is to do clinical tests for identification. Treatment for each type of allergy may vary. There are several drugs that can alleviate symptoms, but in the case of respiratory allergies the most effective treatment is specific immunotherapy that works like a vaccine and allows you to go several years without symptoms of allergies. There have been significant advances in efficacy and safety, even with the development of more concentrated treatments that allow mixing of different allergens. IV Therapy is also a super effective treatment option that boosts the immune system response and gives the body strength. The good side of this type of treatment is that the absorption of nutrients is almost absolute, since they are injected directly into the bloodstream. Contact us and schedule an appointment!
