It plays an important role in traditional systems of [China](/index.php?title=China&action=edit&redlink=1), [Japan](/index.php?title=Japan&action=edit&redlink=1), [Korea](/index.php?title=Korea&action=edit&redlink=1), [Vietnam](/index.php?title=Vietnam&action=edit&redlink=1), [Tibet](/index.php?title=Tibet&action=edit&redlink=1), and [Mongolia](/index.php?title=Mongolia&action=edit&redlink=1). Suppliers usually age the mugwort and grind it up to a fluff; practitioners burn the fluff or process it further into a stick that resembles a (non-smokable) [cigar](/index.php/Cigar). They can use it indirectly, with [acupuncture](/index.php/Acupuncture) needles, or sometimes burn it on a patient's skin. Terminology The word \"moxa\" comes from [Japanese](/index.php?title=Japanese_language&action=edit&redlink=1) mogusa () (the u is not very strongly enunciated). [Yomogi ()](/index.php?title=Artemisia_princeps&action=edit&redlink=1) also serves as a synonym for moxa in Japan. [Chinese](/index.php?title=Chinese_language&action=edit&redlink=1) uses the same character as mogusa, but pronounced differently: \u00e0i, also called \u00e0ir\u00f3ng of \u00e0i\"). The [Chinese character](/index.php?title=Chinese_character&action=edit&redlink=1) for moxa forms one half of the two making up the Chinese word that often gets translated as \" [acupuncture](/index.php/Acupuncture)\" zhnji (). Theory and practice Practitioners use moxa to warm regions and [acupuncture points](/index.php/Acupuncture_point) with the intention of stimulating [circulation](/index.php/Circulatory_system) through the points and inducing a smoother flow of [blood](/index.php/Blood) and [qi](/index.php/Qi). Research, for example at [Mugwort (Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine by Clare Hanrahan)](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2603/is_0005/ai_2603000533) has shown that mugwort acts as an [emmenagogue](/index.php/Emmenagogue), meaning that it stimulates blood-flow in the [pelvic area](/index.php/Pelvis) and [uterus](/index.php/Uterus). It is claimed that moxibustion militates against cold and dampness in the body and can serve to turn [breech babies](/index.php/Breech_birth) [[1]](#cite_note-1) Medical historians believe that moxibustion pre-dated acupuncture, and needling came to supplement moxa after the [2nd century BC](/index.php?title=2nd_century_BC&action=edit&redlink=1). Different schools of acupuncture use moxa in varying degrees. For example a [5-element acupuncturist](/index.php?title=Five_Element_Acupuncture&action=edit&redlink=1) will use moxa directly on the skin, whilst a [TCM](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_Medicine)-style practitioner will use rolls of moxa and hold them over the point treated. It can also be burnt atop a fine slice of ginger root to prevent scarring.[ [citation needed](/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Citation_needed&action=edit&redlink=1)] Practitioners consider moxibustion to be especially effective in the treatment of chronic problems, \"deficient conditions\" (weakness), and [gerontology](/index.php/Gerontology). [Bian Que](/index.php?title=Pien_Ch%27iao&action=edit&redlink=1) (fl. circa 500 BC), one of the most famous semi-legendary doctors of Chinese antiquity and the first specialist in moxibustion, discussed the benefits of moxa over acupuncture in his classic work. He asserted that moxa could add new energy to the body and could treat both excess and deficient conditions. On the other hand, he advised against the use of acupuncture in an already deficient (weak) patient, on the grounds that needle manipulation would leak too much [energy](/index.php/Energy). A huge classical work, Gao Huang Shu (), specialises solely in treatment indications for moxa on a single point (). Note that [Taoists](/index.php?title=Taoist&action=edit&redlink=1) use scarring moxibustion along with [Chinese medical astrology](/index.php?title=Chinese_medical_astrology&action=edit&redlink=1) for longevity. Practitioners may use acupuncture needles made of various materials in combination with moxa, depending on the direction of qi flow they wish to stimulate. Parallel uses of mugwort In [North](/index.php?title=North_America&action=edit&redlink=1) and [South America](/index.php?title=South_America&action=edit&redlink=1), indigenous peoples regard mugwort as a sacred plant of divination and spiritual healing, as well as a [panacea](/index.php/Panacea_(medicine)). Mugwort amongst other herbs were often bound into [smudge sticks](/index.php?title=Smudge_stick&action=edit&redlink=1). [Europeans](/index.php?title=Europe&action=edit&redlink=1) placed sprigs of mugwort under pillows to provoke dreams; and the herb had associations with the practice of [magic](/index.php?title=Magic_(paranormal)&action=edit&redlink=1) in [Anglo-Saxon](/index.php?title=Anglo-Saxon_England&action=edit&redlink=1) times.
