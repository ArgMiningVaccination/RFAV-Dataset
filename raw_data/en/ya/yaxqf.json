One such initiative refers to the organizatio n of Science Exhibitions at Regional and National levels every year in collaboration with NCERT to promote science and technology in our schools . This exhibition aims at providing a common platform to schools, teachers and students to give shape to their i nnovat ive ideas and learn from each others experiences.Children from all CBSE affiliated schools are encouraged to participate in this prestigious event. These exhibitions intend to provide a medium for popularizing science and increase awareness among th e stakeholders about close relationship between science, technology and society and encourage scientific and technological creativity among students. The Science Exhibition has always been a much awaited competition organized by the Board and is open to all its affiliated institutes. The first stage of the competition is organized at the regional level and a panel of judges shortlist selected entries for the national level competition to be held later. Each school is allowed two entries and has to provide a write up on the project they have showcased. The schools are asked to keep their displays ready a day in advance so that there are no last minute hiccups. The main objectives of organizing Science exhibitions can be summarized as: promoting interest in Science and Technology among younger generation. encouraging scientific and technological creativity among students and inculcating a sense of pride in their talent. providing exploratory experiences, encouraging creative thinking and promoting psychomotor skills among school students through self-designed models or simple apparatus. encouraging problem solving approach and developing appropriate technologies, especially for rural areas and integrating scientific ideas with daily life situations. popularising Science and technology among masses and creating an awareness regarding its impact on socio-economic and sustainable development of the country. Tak ing into consideration the enthusiastic response from participating schools in the past, CBSE again decided to organize Science Exhibitions for the year 2012. CBSE announced the dates for its regional level science exhibition by publish ingthe circular at CBSE website www.cbseacademic.in on 25th April 2012. The main theme and sub- themes for this years exhibition were: MAI N THEME: SCIENCE, SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT The six sub-themes were : Agricult ure and Food Security Energy-Resources and Conservation Health Environmental Issues and Concerns Mathematics and Everyday life Disaster Management 2 Sub Th eme - 1 Agriculture and Food Security Agriculture, directly or indirectly, has been the main source of livelihood for majority of Indian population. One of the greatest assets in rural areas could be an intelligent and effective use of emerging technologies such as biotechnology, microbiology, genetic engineering, etc. The agricultural activities that lead to food production are no longer a subject of classical farming only. The modern agriculture cannot sustain itself without the support of research work done by the scientists. With the help o f science and technology, we can enhance our agricultural knowledge to achieve food security to reduce hunger, malnutrition and poverty, and facilitate equitable, environmentally, socially and economically sustainable development. Sub Th eme - 2 Energy -Resources and Conservation After food and water; energy is our most basic need. All activities require energy to perform. Energy is an important concern that differentiates the global rich and the global poor. All conventional sources of energy are exhaustibl e. At the current rate of consumption, known reserves of petroleum will be exhausted in about 35 years, natural gases in about 50 years and coal sometime within 200 years. The great concern about energy is not about diminishing supplies. It is rather than our current models of harnessing energy that are unsustainable because of environmental, economic, geographical and equity issues. One of the important and obvious way of redesigning system for harnessing energy is to develop and shift to clean and nonconv entional energy resources which are either non exhaustible or renewable as solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric power, geo -thermal energy, energy from biomass and biogas, ocean thermal energy, wave energy and energy from other emerging technologies. This sub -theme is expected to make children think of various ways and means for making efficient use of available energy resources and also new techniques/methods of using and conserving energy from both conventional and nonconventional sources. Sub The me - 3 Health Our health is continuously under the influence of both endogenous (within) and exogenous (around) environment and therefore a matter of great concern especially in the rapidly growing society to cope up with newer scientific and technological i nventions. Our health is adversely affected due to many environmental hazards that lead to several kinds of infections in our body. With increasing population, demand for food, water, home, transport, energy etc., are increasing day by day causing tremendo us pressure on our natural resources and thereby contributing to pollution of air, water and soil. The lifestyle including food and water we take, tendency for junk/ fast food, rest and exercise, habits and drugs and alcohol abuse is another challenge to o ur health. The present sub -theme were proposed with the objectives: to bring awareness among the youth about health and factors affecting our health, to explore new scientific, technological and biomedical interventions in prevention and cure, to analyze t he role of self and society in keeping our environment healthy in order to maintain good health and promote innovative ideas for better management. Sub The me - 4 Environmental Issues and Concerns The spectacular industrial and economic development over the past few decades has led to the replacement of the communities of nature by man-made communities. Deforestation, overgrazing, indiscriminate mining, and tree-felling, faulty tillage practices etc. have led to severe soil erosion. Over irrigation and river-harvesting of agricultural lands has resulted into 3 salini ty of water, water logging and degradation. Over-use of tube wells has substantially lowered down the underground water table. Major current environmental issues include climate change, species extinction, pollution, environmental degradation, and resource depletion etc. For humans to live sustainably, the Earths resources must be used at a rate at which they can be replenished. The main objective of this sub-theme is to make general public and children in particular aware with the current environmental issues and concerns for achieving sustainability to prevent the effect of environmental issues. Sub Th eme - 5 Mathematics and Everyday life The important segment of mathematics -- the ability to reason and think clearly, is extremely useful in our everyday life. Proofs and deductions are hallmarks of mathematics. The subject also deals with data, measurements and observations from science, mathematical models of natural phenomenon including human behaviour and social systems. Its domain is not molecules or cells but numbers, chance, forms, pattern and order, algorithms and change. As a science of abstract objects, mathematics relies on logic rather than on observation. Mathematics gives exactness in thinking and provides a quantitative approach. The special role of mathematics in education is a consequence of its universal applicability. In general, to solve practical problems we follow a set procedure involving steps related with defining variables; writing equations or inequalities; collecting data and organize into tables; making graphs and illustrations; and calculating probabilities. Sub Th eme - 6 Disaster Management Disasters have significant relationship with natural resource management, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Various disasters can cause damage to human life, environment, infrastructure, lowering the quality of life, loss of different bio organisms, political instability and conflicts, demographic imbalance, unemployment etc. There is chaos and disorganisation in the event of any natural or manmade disaster. The objective of this sub-theme is to increase awareness of the dangers posed by disasters and to help children find measures for effective mitigation of those dangers. The process of registration for participation at regional level exhibition was initiated in the month of April 2012.

Name of the School: Sunbeam School , Lahartara, Varanasi 151 T heme: Eco-Green Farm Write Up: As we know that India is not a very rich country in resources for farming and the poor farmers are starving to death. The main reason for this is improper implication of technologies. We have made a 100% resource efficient form which uses the full potential and gives us fine results. We have designed a system that could deal with various problems of farmers. In a regular pump we added a system that could turn the pump on when the water present in the soil could not fulfill the farms need and also turn it off when requirement is over. We have also placed a water level indicator & implemented all these in a farm with the help of a drip irrigation system. The cost of this set-up is only about Rs. 2000/- and the circuit elements costs nearby about Rs. 50 to Rs. 200. Name of the School: Green View Public School , Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh. 152 EXHIBIT NO . 3 T heme: Backyard Farming Write-Up: Organic farming is basically using in form products for agriculture to take care in all fairness of nature for maintaining health and sustaining ecology in all respects. By proper biotic and non-biotic management all stages of agriculture right from filling of the soil to harvest we can cultivate crops which are nutritious, devoid of chemicals for all ages and could be beneficial specially for people suffering from diseases like cancer. By fulfilling the requirement of nutrients of soil for the crops to be grown, using bio- fungicides, protecting the plants by various bio-products like pheromone trap, encouraging bio-culture for plant propagation, using area produced by making vermin-beds to increase the shine are some of the constructive practices which should be trained by eco-friendly organizations to the farmers. Organic forming may not feed all mouths but after initial alterations, which is one of the drawbacks but could be supplanted by devoting 60% conventional integrated farming and 40% organic. Therefore adoption of organic farming could be possible by knowing history, future objectives and view on the agriculture, m otivations, prompt action , positive attitude towards risk, awareness of the other technical aspects and foremost organic in the own form is possible which we feel starts from Backyard Framing.

Seeing todays youth not realizing the importance of food ; compelled us to take this topic. We felt that \"Food Security & Food Wastage\" is a topic that needs to be discussed on a larger scale. During the process of making this report we found out some problems that a farmer as well as a consumer faces from the production of the grains to the distribution of the grains. We are well aware of the fact that a lot of grains are wasted during the period of transportation. With our solutions to these problems we aim to make the life easier & bring the wastage down to its minimal level. Problems that we have shown are of major concern and through our model we have tried to depict them along with our solutions as suggestions to eradicate these problems. Lack of the grain storage space substituted by constructing grain storage farms; farmer suicides can be reduced if financial institutions start lending loans at lesser rates of interest and farmer should be encouraged to develop alternate sources of income such as livestock . We have also suggested some step to be taken by the government; is to introduce direct foreign investment which if properly implemented will change the bitten face of agricultural sector. To put our thoughts into action we need to take prompt action. The cost of our suggested amendments is easily implementable if there is political willingness.

There chemicals repel insects and preclude them from biting or even destroying them. The project is mainly based on preparation of various naturally effective and economically viable insect repellents like war candles, gel candles, incense sticks, guggal sticks, repellant balls, cloth bags, diffuser, wrist bands, oil infusions and herbal sprays. These natural products are totally user-friendly and cost effective as they can be easily prepared by users from the locally available plants and their extracts. Further Scope: Health problems due to insects can be eradicated in rural areas by using this insect repellents that is made of bio-agricultural resources available in abundance and can be cultivated, collected and stored without much less labour and investment. The suggestions made in present research project can be applied for making variety of products as insect repellents and its production can provide employment to locals through establishing cottage industries in respective areas.

To popularize the nutritional components of dates. How regular consumption of dates prevents the development of many diseases like heart ailments, tumours, asthama, kidney stones, etc. To disclose the statistics of annual date production in the three major producers of date in India which are Gujarat, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. To increase the nations income and wasteland development through tissue culture in date cultivation. Theoretical estimation of future prospects of date palm cultivation using tissue culture technology. Methodology followed: For our research study we visited Plant Tissue Culture Laboratory of Anand Agriculture University, Gujrat, the only laboratory in India which has successfully demonstrated micro tissue technique in India. We collected the data for date palm cultivation of Gujarat from the assistant research scientist in the Department of Agricultural Biology, Dr. Amritpal Singh. We prepared a similar data sheet for Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu based on information and inputs from Dr. R. Raj Bhansali, Principal Scientist, CAZRI, Jodhpur and Mr. K R Muhammad Nassar, an agriculture graduate working for date palm development in South India respectively. Finally we analyzed the whole data and did a theoretical estimation of future profit earned by the farmers by growing tissue culture raised palm trees in their fields. We realized that tissue culture technology can prove to be a boon for farmers if used for mass cultivation of date palms in India. One of the key benefits of this method is that the farmer will get uniform yield in terms of quality and quantity from all the plants grown in their field. This will not only increase the income of farmers to many folds but the surplus production of crop will also boost the foreign exchange. In addition to that this will also help in combating desertification. 157 FUTURE PRO SPECTS Land No. of Pl ants Yield Price Present (in h a) Fut ure (in h a) Present Fut ure Present (in Tons ) Fut ure (in Tons ) Present Fut ure School: Airport School, Ahmadabad 158 EXHIBIT NO . 8 T heme: Organic Chemical Capsule Write Up: Concept : Synthetic Fertilizers are concentrated chemical preparation of inorganic or organic Nitrogen salts. The manufacture of which is based on n on-renewable fossil fuel. Bio-fertilizer are made of living micro - organism that can absorb Nitrogen from atmosphere during their growth. Chemicals adversely affect soil texture but Bio-fertilizers improve Soil Texture. Higher doses of chemical fertilizers are tonic whereas Bio-fertilizers have no tenacity. Bio- fertilizers are cheaper than synthetic fertilizers, but increase the production level and enhance the nutritional content of the soil if they are used in controlled doses. Two gelatin capsules (big & small) of different solubility are taken and used in an integrated manner known as \"Double capsule\". The bigger (outer capsule) is filled with bio -fertilizers, e.g. Rhizobium, dried blue-green algae, Azzola etc. The inner capsule is filled with chemical fertilizers, e. g. super phosphate, potash etc. The focal points are that, this product - a) Is very eco-friendly b) Is very cost effective c) Increases productions level d) Never leads to soil and water pollution e) Reduces the use of fertilizers f) Improves the acidic and alkali nature of the soil.

Write-up: Our project primarily focuses on two major issues, what India has and what India needs. According to us what India has is abundance of solar energy and what India needs is green agriculture and food security. We have used solar energy to dry agricultural products. The dryer consist of a metal box fitted with a glass top to allow light transmission. It also has a second compartment in which oiled gravel is spread at the bottom this second compartment is used for prolonged drying even if the amount of sunlight is limited. Its advantages are: Uniform drying of all products kept inside with minimum cost. Colour and flavor is retained to a large extent. Reduces the duration of drying compared to conventional methods. No pollution. More hygienic and no contamination of food items. Food security is taken care of because we make use of used cooking oil to oil the gravel. The neat stored in the gravel is used for prolonged drying even when the intensity of sunlight decreases. Name of the School: Bhawans Vidya Mandir T heme: Soil Moisture Sensor Write-up: We have made a soil moisture sensor with an objective to check the moisture content in soil from time to time. As we all know, it is very important for a farmer to check the moisture levels in soil as under irrigation and over irrigation both can ruin the crops. Working: It is based on the principle of capacitance comparator. If we place sensors (basically probes) in the soil to check the moisture level and it gets switched on automatically if the sensor senses dryness. Further Scope: It can be used as a tool for weather monitoring. Can analyze the moisture requirement of specific genetic variety of seed/crop. Can be used in small urban farms, large farms and even home gardens.

Write-up: Water logging has swallowed large chunks of fertile agricultural and in Punjab: Almost 27 lakh hectares of area is water logged and hence is of no use. Kind of loss it has caused in terms of money, productivity, economic stability is huge to farmers and as well as to the state. The water from the water logged fields is b eing drained out into the Slam nallah which was constructed by government but this process is very slow and also unable to collect subsurface water. In order to enhance the drainage and to collect the subsurface water, we have proposed a strategy to save the land from getting water logged. Our Strategy: We are using sub surface drainage pipes with numerous holes on the top wall placed at a depth of almost 4 feet and interlined gaps of 45 feet. The outlet of these pipes opens into trenches which carry this water to same nallah. Hence, saving the useful cultivation zone from being water logged. Instead of disposing of this saline water, we can make it more productive and valuable for crops. Methods: 1. Chemical 2. Physical 3. Other innovative ideas Chemical methods are expensive and hazardous. Other innovative ideas include growing of halophytic plants like sea kale & sea asparagus or by opting for agriculture. But after going through the recent literature, we found that magnetic treatment of water i s the best to increase water productivity of the crop. Cost: 1. Subsurface drainage pipes would require an average of Rs. 50,000 per acre. 2. The magnetic treatment of water requires powerful magnets which can be installed in the already existing irrigation pipes at a cost of Rs. 1-1.5 lakhs and require no recurring expenses. One such system is enough for 25 acres of land.

So this made us to ponder about new techniques that one can use to obtain high yield and better food production. O ur project Dayitva represents innovative and contemporary techniques of farming. We are displaying modular farming in the form of kitchen farming. The key feature of our basic structure is that it can be placed anywhere in house. Aero panics are type of farming in which plants are able to grow without soil, by just using nutrient rich mist. On the other hand, hydroponics is technique in which we are able to grow plants by using nutrient with water. In drip irrigation, water drips slowly on the roots. The striking feature of project is that water that we are using in hydroponic is ge tting recycled and ultimately we are able to use this recycled water in drip. Next in the line is Aq noponics, this technique is designed as an innovative modem and it does not only serves us as very effective agricultural tool but on the same time it gives designer and artistic look. We would like to conclude by saying that these techniques are not just about today but they are for generations to come, hence the very futuristic approach of this model can benefit the society at large.

To follow an integrated and comprehensive approach to develop a blueprint for futuristic, idealistic, practical and sustainable system of agriculture to preserve the environment. Components of the model: 1. Waste Water Fed Aquaculture System: This ecological process can be adopted by local farmers for mastering resource recovery activities. Certain fish varieties like Niloeica , Brigit, Belay, etc. can feed on organic wastes in waste water and help to purify it to larger extent. These fishes maintain proper balance of plankton population in the sewage fed fisheries and also help in reducing B.O.D. of sewage wastewater. Sewage fed fisheries receives adequate sunlight and hence act as solar reactors. Semi purified water can be used for irrigation in fields. 2. Zero Sludge Discharge Technology Green Sludge Energy Technology These technologies can be used to produce electricity and manner from solid sludge using advanced, digestion, solubleness, and desulphurization and dewatering methods. 3. Hermetic Storage Techniques: Hermetic methods of storing grains, under which polypropylene is used to store grains, creates a modified atmosphere enriched in co- deficient in O 2 due to natural metabolic rates of biological factors present to regulate temperature and moisture conditions prevent the spraying of fumigants, reduce CO 2 emissions and prevent pest attacks.

Organic farming is not only aimed for maintaining the sustainable agriculture production but is expected to drastically change the dynamics of growing the crops, reduces the pollution as well as encourages the mixed farming in step diversion for agriculture. The model is based on the integrated farming system where there is a farm house and rain water has been harvested from the house and water is used in the field for irrigation. The model consists of cattle farm vermin compost fishpond, poultry form. Azolla pond green house and organically prepared pesticides fungicides and insect repellant fermented plant extract using bio-pesticides, bio-fertilizers the pollution can be reduced. Organically produced food is very good for consumption and it is one of the sustainable methods of farming for the preparation of b io-pesticides and bio fertilizers. We have used local plants life and cattle waste products , Organic farming that is one of the cost effective farming. Required efforts and inputs in this method are low and the outcome is very high. We can apply this model even in small villages where the farmers do not have much budget. It is one of the low budgets or zero budget farming methods. Beside these , we can go for Agro tourism or village (Heritage) tourism. This method is successfully being used in most north eastern regions of India. This is a cost effective and sustainable farming model where people with low budget and small area can opt for it and can get benefit out of it. Name of the School: Govt.

A microbial fuel cell is a bio electro chemical device which converts waste water into electricity. As part of its digestive process, bacteria create electrons in an anaerobic environment. This is due to a REDOX reaction. The electrons are pulled out of the solution onto an electrode and are conducted through an external circuit due to existence of a potential difference between the two chambers. The PEM and salt bridge separate anode and cathode yet completing the circuit hence generating electricity. Advantages: 1. Ideal in Indian scenario. 2. No pollution. 3. Use of waste water as a fuel. 4. Almost zero cost requiring low maintenance. 5. Constant increment in voltage due to bacterial reproduction. Name of the School: Bal Bharati Public School, Noida 178 EXHIBIT NO. 4 T heme: The Unique Kundi Bhandara Write Up: This is an innovative water storage and supply system build by Abdul Raheem Khan-E-Khanain 1675 around 400 years back in Mughal Era.The water is brought down to the Kundies by River Tapti in Satpura ranges. There are 103 Kundies all over the city and water moves by the process of aeration from one Kundi to another then it is collected in jail karanj by capillary rise and then supplied to the city by 7inch clay pipes. The system works on the principal of gravity. With the passage of time there is calcium carbonate deposit in the walls which is proving to be quiet harmful and there is a decrease in the water holding capacity. Earlier the water was supplied to 1 million people but now it is only supplied in LalBagh area to 50,000 people. The water in this system gets purified naturally by sedimentation. We are here to make a difference by creating awareness among people about a wonderful site that can be used to save the country from energy crisis as least thermal energy is used in this process. If such systems are implemented elsewhere we would soon be called as developed nation instead if being called a developing nation. Earlier this system was prevalent in Iran but at present it is only functional is Bushanpur, Madhya Pradesh. Name of the School: Macro Vision Academy, Burhanpur 179 EXHIBIT NO. 5 T heme: Energy Conservation at LAHS Write Up: This is an innovative idea towards energy and resources conservation that we have exhibited here. Our main motive is to conserve Wendy and resources. Our project shows the importance of energy and conserves it for our future. 1. Automatic room light controller: When somebody enters the room then the counter is incremented by one and light in the room will be switched on and when any one leaves the room then the counter is decremented by one. The lights will be only switched off until all the persons in the room go out. The total number of persons inside the room is also displayed in the seven segment displays. The micro controller does the above job. 2. Solar Panels: We have used solar panels on the roof of our school to maximize the usage of storage of solar energy. We have used light dependent resistor. When it will perceive darkness in the atmosphere it will generate electricity and distribute in the school heading to the conservation of energy. 3. Water Cooler: Infrared sensors are installed near the taps. The wall in front of sensors is it's in normal state. When a person obstructs this state by bringing his hands near to the taps, the sensor gets activated and allows water to flow out. As the obstruction is removed, the sensor returns to the normal state and flow of water is stopped. 4. School Garden: When sensors sense the dry condition in the garden then the micro controller will switch on the motors and it will be switched off when all the sensors are wet. Therefore we are saving 12000 units in a year excluding holidays and an amount of Rs 72,000 is saved in a year. We have saved around 50% of water in a day. Scope of our project: 1. It can extend the life time of non -renewable energy resources. 2. It can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants emitted and needs less human resources. Name of the School: Little Angels High School 180 EXHIBIT NO. 6 T heme: Magenn Air Rotor System Write Up: In this project we have shown the generation of electricity with the help of wind. We have used a balloon made of composite fabrics in which Helium gas is filled. We have used only Helium gas because it is an inert, non-inflammable and a light gas. The inert gas creates a lighting force due to which the balloon moves in upward direction. When balloon reaches to a sufficient height, it gets sufficient wind due to which the turbine begins to rotate which is attached to the balloon. Due to rotation of turbine, the spinning shaft attached to it also begins to spin due to which electricity is produced. The electricity produced is sent through conducting wires to transformers from where it is sent to power grid or is stored in batteries. The transformer we have used is a step down transformer because the electricity produced at high altitudes is of variable potential, therefore to use the electricity we need to lower down its potential. This system is cheaper than windmill as it uses less land. It also removes all placement limitations and it can be stored anywhere.

Public School 182 EXHIBIT NO. 8 T heme: Conversion of Mechanical Energy into Electrical (Electro Breakers) Write Up: As there is crisis of resources, we came up with a unique idea of generating electricity from speed breakers through electromagnetic induction. As we know changes in magnetic flux result in electricity production. Therefore, we have utilized the same principle. We have utilized movable bars of speed breakers (movable due to application of springs) attached with magnets underneath them. Another bar within this bar has coils of insulated copper wire. When a vehicle passes over the speed breakers, the magnets come in relative motion with the coils, which generates current. The current generated according to our calculations is about 12.4W/ coil per second, resulting in huge amounts of current each day. This current can be used to light lamp posts and street lights. The advantages are: Current Generation in huge. Eco-friendly, as no natural resources or organic substances are used. Better than roller system of electricity generation of speed breakers because of its velocity dependency. Can be easily implemented on existing systems.

Our research began with an observation. The noise- be it discotheques, transportation and travelling vehicles or airport runways; some or the other way noise pollution is there, hampering our eardrums and giving all of us various health hazards. Jet planes while landing and taking off create lot of noise pollution which has significant ill- effects on our eardrums. We decided to convert this sound energy and the wind energy produced by the air planes in a useful manner so that they wont be harmful for us and we would be able to help us in using the renewable resources effectively. We decided to place some high sensitive tribunes underground in the in the grass fields at the side of the runways, so whenever the wings of the plans containing engines came over these grass fields during takeoffs or landings, due to high speed air release the wind mills would rotate producing electricity that would be sent to a power house for conversion and may be supplied to the airport. We used sound magnets just at the border of the runways which will absorb the high frequency sound created by planes while landing, these sound waves are again sent to the power house, generating the power hence making a small but important move towards creating a self-reliant airport .

In this project, we use an extremely efficient engine, called the stilling engine, to convert the heat directly into mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is then converted to electricity, which is supplied back to the CPU, for use. DUDE can be thought of as an alternate UPS which runs purely on waste heat from the computer, and uses up no other form of energy. We thus succeed in accomplishing two major entries: a) We remove waste heat, which can do nothing but bring down the computers efficiency b) We use this waste heat to generate electric power, for the computer to use, in times of need.

Name of the School: Summer Fields School 197 EXHIBIT NO. 2 3 Theme : Power Generation E - Novation Write Up: The exhibit features some non-convention methods of electricity generation. The first method is \"piezoelectricity\". In this piezoelectric transducers are used to harness mechanical energy. When someone walks over these tiles equipped with transducers, the crystals of quartz produced a potential difference which will be harmless. This technique can be used on floors, footpath etc. The second method is salt solar power plant.

Moreover molten salt can store heat up to 6-8 days thus electricity can be produced even in the absence of sunlight. This set up may be planted in deserts. The third method is vertical- axis - wind which is specially a designed turbine that can take wind from all direction and its design also eliminates the need of grass. Moreover we have attached it to electrolysis setup instead of battery because the minimum voltage required to charge the battery is very high but not in the case of electrolysis. Then hydrogen fuel cell is used to get electricity from H 2andO 2 obtained in the process. Name of the School: Sumermal Jain Public School 198 EXHIBIT NO. 2 4 Theme: Solar Up Draft Tower Write Up: Principal: Solar tower / Solar Chimney is based on the simple concept of electricity being produced from solar energy.

Whenever, brakes or horns are applied, energy is almost wasted but in this model, electricity is being generated by these wasteful activities with the help of science and its principles. Situation: 1. Applying Brakes:- Whenever brakes are applied on the wheel, a hard form of dynamo (used here) touches the wheel to stop it and dynamo converts its mechanical energy into electrical energy and passes it to battery for storage. Situation: 2. Blowing Horns anytime:- whenever sound occurs (like horn) near the Nikes (speakers) they act as dynamo due to thin coil and magnet inside it and generate electricity which is passed to battery for storage. Situation: 3. Coming closer of two vehicles anywhere. Whenever a vehicle come closer to another vehicle, An IC (that is programmed in such a way that it produces electricity where it is sensed by a magnetic sensor) and enters in vehicles and produces electricity which automatically gets passed to battery for storage. The battery which is charged by these situations can be connected to the various parts of vehicle for different purposes like glowing light. It can also be used in hybrid cars which runs with the help of battery only. It is cheap as it costs below 1000 if it is used in any vehicle.

This system provides a solution for every city in the wor ld that has a deep water body around it. 70%of electricity can be regenerated which was earlier getting wasted as such. Low cost structure low environmental impact Heat produced during compression can be utilized in the thermal power to produce additional electricity. This system is under construction in lake Ontario, Canada, with a generation capacity of 1 MW and storage capacity of 4MWH so a country like ours, where there was recently a major crisis like Northern Grid Failure, resulting into a complete blackout, definitely needs such a solution.

Material delayed bamboo wallow brick Name of the School: Delhi Public School, Kamas 212 EXHIBIT NO. 3 8 Theme: Production of Biodiesel from Waste Vegetable Oil & Production of Bio-Methanol for this production Write Up: In this project we have discussed the production of bio-diesel (a fuel for a cleaner tomorrow) obtained from waste vegetable oil. In our project we have used waste oil, which not only helps in production of bio-diesel but it also helps in maintaining optimum health by eliminating transfers (which are toxic for the body). In this process, we take used oil, heat it to a normal temperature of 37.2\u00b0C. Meanwhile we mix NaOH and methanol. When oil is heated, we combine all the three ingredients and blend them for 30 minutes. We allow it to settle down for 12 hours. After this 12 hour settlement, two layers can be clearly seen. It is further filtered and we get final product (BIODIESEL) and by product (glycerol). It works on the basic principle of transestification. The main twist is, we are using BI O-METAHNOL, which we have synthesized on our own, in our school laboratory. Interesting thing is that the BIODIESEL is very cheap and can be used in any kind of engine. We would also like to add that out of one litre of oil (WVO) we get 750 ml of BIODIESEL and 280 ml of glycerol. This shows that BIODIESEL yields better results than petro diesel. It is available as B100, B20, and B80 etc. We can say that there is a huge difference between Rs. 11/ltr and Rs. 47.15/ ltr and this is what makes it economical too. Use biodiesel, save future and moreover, save a little just by paying Rs. 11/ltr. Shivang Abrol, Sana Fatima Name of the School: Jodhamal Public School 213 EXHIBIT NO. 3 9 Theme: Production of Low Cost Bio - Candle Write Up: Castor oil Plant ( Riccinuscommunis ) belongs to the family euphorbiacae and sub-division dicotyladonae. The caster bean has a high calorific value. We began with collecting the seeds of the caster plant and sundried for a couple of weeks. Then, it is crushed and grinded in the mortar and pestle to obtain the seed dust. The seed dust is sieved repeatedly to obtain a more fine dust. Once the dust is ready it is mixed with molten candle wax in different proportions by mass and then poured into the bamboo mould with a thread on it. After few minutes, candles get its desired shape. We have prepared three different types of candles by their proportions. One with 25% seed dust and 75% wax, second one by 50% seed dust and 50% wax and third by 75% seed dust and 25% wax. Then we have compared the blended candle with ordinary 100% wax candle. The approximate cost of an ordinary candle of 50 gm is Rs. 8, the second one is Rs. 6, the third one is Rs. 4 and the best one we have made (75% seed dust and 25% wax) is for Rs. 3. In this modern world, when we are having energy crisis, petroleum will finish after 40 years and coal after 200 years. So the need of the hour is a renewable source of energy to mitigate energy crisis, use of plant produce rather than petrochemicals, and low cost energie s. Name of the School: Maharishi Vidya Mandir 214 EXHIBIT NO. 4 0 Theme: Conversion of Sound Energy into Electrical Energy Write Up: In the model, the sound produced by vehicles, vibrate a diaphragm placed beside the roads. When the diaphragm vibrates, it makes a solenoid coil move, which is attached to it. When the solenoid coil vibrates it changes the magnetic flux around it, due to which induced current is produced by the process of electro- magnetic induction (Faradays law of induction). The two ends of the solenoid coil are connected to a galvanometer, which shows deflection due to the production of the induced current in the coil. This small induced current is amplified using an amplifier and the amplified low voltage current is converted into high voltage current by a step-up transformer. In India, there are 80,000 villages where electricity is still a dream! India is called a developing country, and a major part of our country has no access to electricity. So if we want our nation to progress, the most important aspect we have to focus on is the production of electricity. In India, the noise produced on the roads in the metropolitan cities is considered a curse; but if this curse can be changed into a boon .i.e. by changing the noise pollution into electrical energy, our country can become the most prosperous and developed nation. This project is suitable for India because of its ever increasing population which results in ever increasing noise pollution. \"ENERGY CONVERTED IS ENERGY CONSERVED\" !! Name of the School: Delhi Public School, Digboi, Assam 215 EXHIBIT NO. 4 1 Theme: Energy from Reed Grass Write Up: The core motive of this project is to produce electrical energy using non-conventional and renewable sources of fuel. As most of us are aware that due to the overuse of fossil fuels, natural resources are depleting day by day and its vital to find the alternative source of energy. Keeping this in mind, we have come up with the idea of producing energy from reed grass; which is an efficient green and non-conventional source of energy. Reed grasses in particular releases a large amount of excess organic acids and sugar in the soil and when it gets reacted with micro organisms present in the soil to form electrons it produces electronic force. By using two electrodes (ANODE- graphite, CATHODE - zinc), we have drawn out the free electrons formed in this reaction. Although the amount of electricity is less, but the critical thing is that electricity can be produced from living plants without harming them. The energy produced is pollution free and is far more efficient than other sources of electricity production. In this process, electricity is generated both day as well as night, unlike solar energy which only produces energy during day time. In case of production of electricity from conventional source of fuel, there is involvement of recurring fuel cost. In this specific case of producing energy from reed grass, there is only one time investment, which is the cost of instruments (electrodes). We found that a single large reed in field conditions can produce energy upto 350 mV of electricity. This has led to the estimation that one hectare of reed grass can produce14, 000 W of electricity, enough to supply electricity to 28 households. As the climatic condition of Assam is very suitable for the growth of reed grass and it is easily available everywhere; it seems to have a good potential to act as an alternative source of fossil fuel for generation of electricity on commercial basis particularly in rural areas where conventional grid connected power is not available. Name of the School: Maharishi Vidya Mandir Sr. Sec. School, Silpukhuri, Guwahati 216 EXHIBIT NO. 4 2 Theme: Low Cost Water Lifting Device Write Up: As we all know that most of the villages in north eastern part of India are located in hilly terrain and water gathering is a perennial problem here. In this project an attempt has been made to lift the water uphill using the hydraulic ram. A hydraulic ram is a simple motor less cyclic pump run by hydropower (water pressure). First a diversion is made from a nearby river located downhill to a reservoir and the water is let flown though a drill pipe. The water comes with a pressure through the drill pipe. When the water comes it raises the pressure valve and the spring pushes it down causing the delivery valve to rise and water fills up the air chamber up to a certain level leaving some space for air. When all this is completed the pressure valve rises up absorbing the water from the pipe and when the spring pushes the valve down forcing the water to move uphill through the delivery pipe. The water can be stored in a tank or can be used for irrigation. This cycle will continue as long as supply of water is undisrupted. Some of the advantages are: It will pump water as long as water pressure is there. It is cost-effective and very efficient. Easy to install and has user friendly features. Name of the School: Sainik School, Imphal 217 EXHIBIT NO. 4 3 Theme: Can Earth be Earth? Making the world - Green, Efficient and Safe Write Up: This project is the convergence of various techniques and technologies in order to make a dwelling place - \"green, efficient and safe\". In the \"green buildings\", on the green roof, terrace farming by drip irrigation is done and rooftop rainwater harvesting system is installed. The \"dome\" structure of Ethylene Tetrafluro ethylene (ETFE) lets in more light and heat the water such as in Beijing Swimming Stadium than conventional glasses. A solar water heater cut off the usage of high power electricity. The walls of the adobe are made of adobe which increases the thermal mass. Solar panels and wind turbines are installed at every possible place in the building. \"Automatic Street Lights\" automatically glows during dark time and prevents the wastage of electrical energy during daytime. Turbine power is utilized in form of wind mills and river turbines. \"sea -side generator\" works on the principle of sea and land breeze for the production of electricity. The total electricity energy produced is stored in the power house. All the organic wastes from building are treated in biogas plant to produce methane for fire involved purpose. The waste water is transferred to Waste Water Treatment Plant where it undergoes various processes- screening> grit removed> aeration> chlorination> Filtration. For safety, there is \"fire alarm system\" through phone which informs the owner of the house through a phone call if his house is stuck with fire, even if the owner is not present there. This model also has heat, light and smoke sensors to detect the fire. Any electrical appliance connected to \"appliance Guidance System\" can be triggered (on/off) from any part of the world using a simple mobile as remote. This could prevent wastage of electricity when we forget to switch off electrical appliances before leaving the house.

Name of the School: Amity International School, Gurgaon 244 EXHIBIT NO. 2 0 Theme: Allopathy Vs. Homeopathy Vs. Ayurveda Write-up: As we all know that in todays hectic lifestyle people are forced to live with certain traits e.g. .intake of junk food, lack of proper sleep, occupational hazards and diseases and in turn take a lot of medicines. In resent scenario, there is a great trend of allopathic medicines but earlier it was not so. Earlier there was Ayurvedic, homeopathic and homemade remedies. So to study their positive and negative points, we have prepared an investigatory report. For this we went to many families for survey and took their views and collected some data based on our survey. We also went to various doctors and took their views related to our project. So the main conclusion which we got from our whole research is that the three kinds of medicines i.e. Allopathic, Homeopathic and Ayurvedic are best at their own levels. They have both the positive and negative points like in case of Allopathy the results are fast but they have some side effects also which ultimately leads to the emergence of some new kind of diseases in future time and in case of homeopathic and Ayurvedic remedies the disease is rooted out from its depth, but this needs a long duration of time. So we thought why shouldnt we combine these medicines in proper amounts and form a new kind of medicine which will avoid the side effects of Allopathic medicines, will give a fast relief and also treat the disease from its root. We have also prepared a medicine on our own with the combination of Allopathy and Ayurveda and named it as \"Alayhopathy\". This medicine is really effective for the treatment of cough and avoids the drowsiness also. Name of the School: OSDAV Public School, Haryana 245 EXHIBIT NO. 2 1 Theme: Malaria - Effect and Prevention with Emphasis on Biological Control of Mosquitoes. Write-up: Assam is an endemic region for malaria and according to a study it was found that less than 50% of the total cases of malaria reported form NE India are from Assam. Hence we decided to work on this project under which, secondary data from various field surveys that involved collection of secondary data from various organizations like NIMR and NVBDCP. Along with it we interviewed various doctors, pathology labs and common people to understand the menace of malaria efficacy of various measures being taken by the government organization in order to control malaria and we found that the major measures being taken by them are: 1. Distribution of impregnated bed nets 2. Spraying of DDT 3. Distribution of free medicine As these measures were not found to be effective enough hence we have suggested the measures for the Biological Control of Mosquito Population believing in the motto that Prevention is better than Cure. The methods suggested by us are: a) Use of Marigold flowers and extracts. b) Preparation of Natural Mosquito repellent using Marigold flowers c) Introduction of Larvivorous fishes in Paddy Fields and small ponds and drains d) Preservation and conservation of Wetlands Conclusion: 1. As chemicals have a bad effect on the environment. Therefore bio-control should always be the alternative preferred method. 2. Our methods are not only cost effective but can also be used by the common man easily without any professional help. 3. These measures are not harmful to the environment. 4. Also we can not only rely on government organization for controlling malaria in a region, it's a social responsibility of each and every citizen to make some effort at his own leve l.

Name of the School: DAV Bhubaneswar, Odisha. 259 EXHIBIT NO. 1 2 Theme: Wonder Polymers -from trash to ties and rags to bridges Write-up: The project is about giving plastic recycling a new dimension. It involves disposal of toxic and pollutants by combining them to make composites out of plastics which can be of multi utility and would be having varying usage and applications. Previous attempts were made to make railroad ties out of plastic composites. We are introducing the concept of using absolutely new billers i.e. fly Ashand ceramic dust along with clay and ground-nut skin of different compositions. By doing so,the new composite railroad ties obtained shall not only be stronger, better and last longer, but would also lead to conservation of wood. The again wooden bridges are vulnerable to natural calamities, termite infestations, rotting, acid rain damage etc. So replacing them with plastic composites, little or no maintenance and longer liberties lastly using the composites to make bricks and houses would give much more structural strength to the building then a normal clay or fly ask brick can give. This way we are disposing of toxic land pollutants i.e. plastics, fly ask and ceramic dust as well as using them to make absolutely commercially viable products of multi-utility. The plastic composites made out of trash are incredibly cheap to manufacture and when a comparative cost study is made between then and their conventional counter parts, they seem to be immensely inexpensive. The trash materials used in the concept have no market value and are considered of tero-commercial viability. By combining them and making plastic composites out of the same, increases their commercial viability and imparts some value to them. Thus the project is a multi dimensional breakthrough which not only tackles the issues of environmental pollution across land primarily plastics along with increasing the market value of useless junk materials. This project leads to conservation of a particular natural resource (wood) and the composites made in the due process are way better than their conventional effective counterparts. This idea will not only revolutionize the way people thought about plastic but it will also make the disposal of the same easily. Making productive use of toxic, valueless trash serves multiple purposes of economic as well as ecological viability which could immensely benefit making. On a broader perspective, the project opens up new horizons for more tedious and productive research work on the same field which in future shall lead to better results. Name of the School: D.A.V. Public School, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar, Odisha 260 EXHIBIT NO. 1 3 Theme: Removal of Heavy Metals from Waste Water Write-up: Objective: To create awareness among people about the hazards of toxic heavy metal present in water and its removal from natural resource. Abstract: An increase in population initialing rapid industrialization was found to consequently increase the effluents and domestic waste water into the aquatic ecosystem. Heavy metals are major toxicants found in industrial waste water. They may adversely affect the biological treatment of waste water, conventional methods for the removal of heavy metals from waste waters are often cost prohibitive hence, there is a need for cheap methods for effluent treatment. Heavy metals are widely used in textile industries and significant losses occur during the manufacture and processing of textiles, and these lost heavy metals are discharged in the effluent. Adsorption of heavy metal is a new technology for treatment of waste water containing different types of selected heavy metals In this study adsorbents like carbonized rice husk, activated rice husk, tea waste, coconut husk, coconut shell bean leaves, bark or many other organic substance available as agriculture waste are investigated as viable material for treatment of Pb, Cd, Ni, Cr, Zn, etc. present in industrial waste. Experiments revealed a relative ability of all these organic substances in removing these heavy metals. The reason of choosing this topic was to make potable water (devoid of heavy metals) available for the masses. The current technology in the market to remove heavy metals from the water is the RO and UV filters. These filters are cost prohibitive and also have their drawbacks. Our aim is to make the people aware about our self developed cost - effective filter which require materials that are eco-friendly, readily available and in expensive. Lets hope our drive can make every human being free of toxic metals and its hazards. Name of the School: DAV International School Kharghar, Navi Mumbai 261 EXHIBIT NO. 1 4 Theme: Eutrophication & Pollution Write-up: Eutrophication is perhaps the most pertinent problem in India, restricting the nourishment of weeds in a water reservoir. This project has been designed to accomplish the first step towards this problem that is the removal of weeds mechanically and then keeping it aside for drying; secondly we treat the water in a different treatment plate where water purification steps are performed (except chlorination). The treated water is again sent back and is mixed with the weeds formerly collected and put together into a shrug digester which prevails in anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic microbes convert the organic materials into several gases. The main component (Approx 85%) is methane (CH 4). Methane produced is transported through pipes to the thermal power plant, where methane is ignited &allowed to boil the water producing steam and under high pressure & is let out at intervals. The steam thus let out enters the turbine and shaft is rotated to produce electricity via a generator electricity produced here is transmitted thereafter. Electricity can also be produced from the treated water by parsing the treated water through a hydro electric power plant.

Studies show that 33% of greenhouse gases are caused by transportation. Hence, we can tackle this problem through our innovative ideas - the electric car, the hybrid car, the fuel cell car and the water fueled car made by us. The purpose of an electric car is to provide significantly less pollution. Hybrids are hybridizations of bath electricity and gasoline. Fuel cell vehicles are cars running on hydro gas and emitting no tailpipe exhaust - water. Fueled car is more feasible amongst all as it runs on hydrogen gas and uses water -a renewable source of energy fuel, hardly emitting any exhaus t.

Name of the School: Choithram School, North Campus, Indore 284 EXHIBIT NO. 5 T heme: Queuing Theory Write-up: Whenever we move to a shopping mall, at airport checking counter, at bank and at several other places we find long waiting lines where a person spends number of hours waiting in queues which increases the waiting time for the customers. On the other hand, if the service provider increases the numbers of servers it may result in a server sitting idle which will in- turn increase the cost to the company. So, we have devised a theory which will help in utilizing the servers to the maximum extent and hence minimum waiting time and idle time (i.e. the time a customer spends waiting in queue and the time a server spends sitting idle). We have conducted surveys at Bank, railways reservation counters, call centers, shopping malls and have tried to implement the mathematical formulas desired by us which gave us satisfactory results and thus we say that, on applying this theory, we can increase the efficiency. Name of the School: Prestige Public School, Indore 285 EXHIBIT NO. 6 T heme: Mathematically Drained Write -up: This is research based project addressing the practical problem of water logging in the city of Vadodara. After investigation of the citys drainage system, we came across five major flaws for which we have the following suggestions. For storm water drain s, we are suggesting introduction of side drains (at an angle in the range of 15 degree to 40 degree), so as to avoid the problem of overflowing of water and sedimentation of solid wastes at the base. For 90 degrees bends, we are suggesting gradual bends t o avoid chocking. For lying down of pipes, we recommend 1:80 gradients (i.e. fall of unit length with pipe length of 80 units). To minimize frictional losses due to expansion and contraction ratio of cross sectional areas of the two pipes to be fixed shoul d be more than 0.4. The materials used for drains are another aspect of our project. We recommend ductile iron pipes and concrete pipes because of their longevity and strength. All this is essential as the problem may similarly persist in other Indian cit ies and hence we propose to submit our report to the municipal corporation, Vadodara.

Name of the School: Sandipani School, Nagpur 290 EXHIBIT NO. 1 1 Theme: To Minimize the Transportation Cost from Several Areas of City to Three Schools (Linear Programming) Write-up: I) Actual case study for our school: Using data provided by our school bus operator we tried to minimize the number of buses required for commuting children of our school. We used linear programming (Graphical Method) for this and found that 9 buses are sufficient whereas earlier we needed 11 buses. II) Actual case study for 3 nearby schools on either side of the road: There is only 1 approach road from the western side of Nagpur city to these schools. There is a toll booth at the intersection, bypass road being a highway. The road is narrow, without a road divider and there is heavy traffic all throughout the day causing traffic jam during busy hours. 31 school buses are currently plying from these 3 schools, carrying around 1400 children. If the same bus operator is appointed we need around 19 buses thereby reducing cost of petrol, pollution, fuel consumption and traffic congestion. The cost of transportation will also reduce hence the children can be charged less per month reducing economic burden on parents. For this we used linear programming and verified our result using graphical and simplex method.

It is practically impossible to stop a landslide but, if a system could predict a landslide before it occurs it would give us enough time to minimize or avoid the risk and also ensure fast recovery from the adverse impacts of the disaster. Keeping this fact in mind we have come up with the idea of Pulse Pipe an early warning system for landslides. In this idea we have installed coaxial cables into an unstable slope. These cables have some characteristic impedance values in them. This impedance changes whenever the wire will be deformed. Whenever, there will be any disturbance on the slope the wire will get deformed and we will get a reflected signal which will be interpreted as a peak on the graph that would be a voltage depth graph. The amplitude of the peak will depend on the amount of displacement that has taken place. Using the amplitude value and the time interval to reach the velocity of the disturbance will be calculated and an inverse of velocity and time graph will be plotted. From this graph we can calculate the time internal before the impending landslide. Once we get the idea of how much time is left before the landslide we can inform various agencies in the surrounding area to start taking immediate measures to save the people.

School, Satna (M.P) 307 EXHIBIT NO. 4 T heme: Disaster Management through Remote Sensing Write Up: Disaster management is a long -term phenomenon which can best be studied with the help of satellite monitoring of various relevant factors such as changing land use. Remote sensing or earth observation system (EOs) and GIR are among many tools available to disaster management professionals t oday making the effective project planning very much possible and more accurate now than ever before. Remote sensing is the science of acquiring information about the earths surface without actually being in contact with it. This is done by sensing and re cording reflected or emitted energy and processing, analyzing and applying that information. We use remote sensing to observe the Earth with sensors from high above its surface. Sensors use not only visible light but also other bands of electromagnetic spe ctrum such as infrared, radar and ultraviolet. Because they are so high up, these sensors can make images of a very large area. Form the inherent characteristics, namely, uniform accuracy and precision, multi -temporal coverage and complete coverage regardl ess of site location, the remotely sensed data can be used very effectively for quickly assessing severity and impact of damage due to flooding, earthquakes, oil spills and other disasters, planning efficient escape routes from coastal areas during hurricane season, rapidly identifying hardest hit disaster areas etc. Participants: Kritika Shukla, Krathika Panhani Name of Girls' Senior Secondary School, Jabalpur, M.P. 308 EXHIBIT NO. 5 T heme: Combat and Mitigate Disaster Write Up: This exhibit aims to make common man aware about the new disaster preventive technologies. Today common man has a very little knowledge of technology available in market and that is simply because of affordability factor. Thus in our project we have discussed about simple, easily affordable and repairable circuit which works as a boon for a lay man in modern times. In our project we have also discussed about future and ongoing mega disaster global warming mainly caused by CFC emission. So we are bringing forward geothermal technology for cooling and heating purposes. In gas leak detector, sensor SEN1327 is used to detect the gases; those are more than 1000 ppm. This sensor works by computing the circuit by gaseous particle. In vibration sensor, properties of piezo sensor is used that it produces pot differences whenever it senses mechanical or electrical vibration. In temperature monitor alarm, thermistor is placed in it to sense the abnormal increase or decrease in temperature because around that time its resistance is very low. In plastic road binding properties of plastic at high temperature is used. In geothermal heating and cooling, constant temperature of earth and its relative warmth and cooling w.r.t. atmosphere is used.

However, weather changes quickly and the weather report turns out to be outdated, so, our model deals with real - time management to calculate weather conditions within a short period of time especially in case of disasters like floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc. using geo-stationary satellites alone. For quick calculation of weather parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity floats, weather ships and automated weather system (AWS) can be used and the software turbain can be used to process the data on board in the satellite. Further information about the disaster can be sent to the mobile tower, radio tower, and village sarpanchs and on the screens placed on the traffic signals for people to mitigate the disasters themselves. The research done by us with regard to earthquake reveals that prior to an earthquake, electro- magnetic radiations, infra-red radiations and even ozone-gas formation can be detected by the geo-stationery satellites and in future can be used to issue warnings quickly. A talk with the senior scientists of the Regional Remote sensing center and the geological survey of India further enhanced our knowledge on the working of geo-stationary satellites.

Infra-red fog lamps are also being used, but they are expensive. We realized that ultra sound being a longitudinal wave can pass through fog deviated and hence can aid in guiding a vehicle through fog. So we constructed a fog lamp like device, based on the principle - \"Working of SONAR\". We placed on ultrasound transmitter receiver pair in front of the vehicle and converted the ultrasound received after reflection into electricity. This electricity is used to activate a light bulb or a buzzer so that the driver is alerted of the presence of an object in front of him/her. The ultrasound fog lamp is an innovative solution which is efficient and cost effective. This can save lives. Participants: Bharath, Shashank Anand Name of the School: P.S. Sr. Sec.

Also additional strength using some retrofitting techniques such as clamping of furnitures, diagonal and x -bracing, jacketing etc. inspired by still existing pagodas that have faced very high magnitude Earthquake, the technology of independent floors and a central heavy mass damper has also been shown in our model. At the end, some relief measures that must be adopted by the government and some dos and donts are also highligh ted in our model. Vikas Puri 317 EXHIBIT 1 4 Theme: Storm Alarm from Leeches Write up: The project is based on Henrys Law which states that \"The solubility of a gas in liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid.\" Before a storm pressure starts to decrease this causes some oxygen in the water to escape. Therefore some organisms like leeches come out of water to take more amount of oxygen. In the exhibit as soon as they come out, they come in contact with the trigger, thus starting the alarm. This simple model, if employed in areas where alerting system is not good can save many lives as it can be used as an effective storm indicator which predicts bigger storm more accurately. 318 EXHIBIT NO. 1 5 Theme: How Good are Your Earthquake Safety Skills Write Up: India lies in high seismic zone.
