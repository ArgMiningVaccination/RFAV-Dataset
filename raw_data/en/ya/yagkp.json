If the worker was, on the date of injury, receiving any income, including training allowances, social assistance benefits, insurance benefits and employment insurance benefits, that would terminate on the worker's receipt of payments for loss of earnings under the Act, the worker's average earnings shall be determined with reference to the total amount of that income. 2.

(11) A determination under subsection (10) shall be based upon the average industrial wage for the year in which the worker's injury occurred, and upon the worker's level of education and his or her aptitude and skills at the time of the injury. O. Reg. 175/98, s. 16 (11). (12) For the purpose of subsection (11), the average industrial wage for a year is the amount determined under subsection 54 (2) of the Act. O.
