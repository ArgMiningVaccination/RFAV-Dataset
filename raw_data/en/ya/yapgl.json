The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two licensed hepatitis B vaccines, Engerix-B versus Sci-B-Vac, in preventing peripartum HBV transmission. Methods: A prospective multicenter randomized controlled study in 4 delivery centers was performed from 2009 to 2014. HBsAg positive pregnant women and their newborns were recruited at the delivery rooms. All newborns received Hepatitis B Immune Globulin within 10 h after birth, as well as active HBV vaccination at 0, 1 and 6 months of age. Maternal assessment at delivery included transaminases, blood count, international normalized ratio and viral status. Infants were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs at 12 months of age. Results: In the intention to treat (ITT), 171 infant and mother pairs fulfilled the study enrollment criteria and completed follow up, 82 received Engerix-B and 89 Sci-B-Vac. Maternal parameters and viral status were similar in both groups. At 12 months of age, the Sci-B-Vac group had lower HBsAg carriage rates (1/89, 1.1%) than the Engerix-B group (5/82, 6.1%) with (risk difference of -0.05, 95% CI -0.11-0.007, t-test = 0.05), and borderline significance lower vaccine failure rates with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL in the Sci-B-Vac (2/89, 2.2%) than the Engerix-B (8/82, 9.8%, p = 0.05). Higher seroprotection rates were found in the Sci-B-Vac group with all anti-HBs titer stratifications of >10 mIU/mL = 0.05) and >1000 mIU/mL (p = 0.01). Active/passive vaccination was effective in 10/13 cases with maternal HBV DNA levels > 7 log10 IU/mL up to 9.5 log10 IU/mL, but failed in 3 cases for unknown reasons. Conclusion: Sci-B-Vac was superior to Engerix-B in preventing peripartum HBV transmission in neonates from HBsAg+ mothers and induces [NCT01133184](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01133184).
