Truly lifesaving for me. \"Dr. Clemma Nash and her functional medicine expertise is outstanding. I've seen her a few times for exposure to toxic mold and her knowledge has given me my life back. Not only has the functional medicine saved me, but Dr. Nash's compassion, listening skills and gentle way has been such a gift for my health. I'm so glad to be a part of the Western WI Health community. Truly lifesaving for me.\" I am thankful that there are such good care providers so close to home! \"Just brought my daughter in to see Sara Atteberry, NP, and wow!!! She was thorough, kind, gentle, and smart! What a great addition to WWH. I was very comforted in the care and compassion she showed to my daughter. I am thankful that there are such good care providers so close to home!\" My daughter, who lives several hours away, appreciates that she can trust I will be cared for even when she is gone. \"I have recently been somewhat of a 'frequent flyer' at hospitals over the last several years and my experience at Western Wisconsin Health has been incredible. The personal care is wonderful and I love being close to family and friends. My daughter, who lives several hours away, appreciates that she can trust I will be cared for even when she is gone.\" Your staff is incredible and you are truly blessed to have each and every one of them who cared for me. \"I went in to the ER yesterday with severe pain. I was taken right back and the nurse and doctor started trying to solve the problem immediately. I was in the most pain I have even had, and I was treated with so much empathy and concern. I cannot thank the doctor and nurse enough. I ended up with an ovarian torsion and was taken right to surgery. Dr. Verbeek and the OR staff were amazing as well. The anesthesiologist was incredible and listened to my concerns. I woke up from surgery pain free. Your staff is incredible and you are truly blessed to have each and every one of them who cared for me.\" I am forever grateful for you. \"My dad only came to Western Wisconsin Health for a little bit, but Reid Burger was the first provider he'd ever trusted. I am so thankful for the way he treated my dad. He couldn't tell you his birthday or the date, but Reid didn't dwell on things that would have embarrassed him. He treated him with dignity and respect. Reid is relatable, down to earth, and knowledgeable and I was comfortable knowing my loved one was safe with him. I am forever grateful for you.\" The staff were very concerned with my comfort and I absolutely love the way they can put you at ease with a bit of humor and such kindness. \"I can't say enough about the staff. Obviously, the health care is top priority but the human factor is so very important also. The staff were very concerned with my comfort and I absolutely love the way they can put you at ease with a bit of humor and such kindness. The care I have always received there is amazing and I am so grateful. Thank you to all of the wonderful people who always take such good care of me! They will never know how much it means to a person who is going through something, regardless of the circumstances. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!\" The pain and tension just melts away and leaves me so totally relaxed and feeling stress free! \"I was treated for chronic neck and shoulder pain. The massages I received from Emily Jo are so amazing. The pain and tension just melts away and leaves me so totally relaxed and feeling stress free! Emily Jo is a wonderful massage therapist. She is very concerned about doing what she needs to so I leave feeling pain free, relaxed, and refreshed. She is very skilled and knowledgeable about her profession and the techniques she uses. I am so blessed to have found her at Western Wisconsin Health!\" Western Wisconsin Health is the BEST facility ever for giving birth! \"Western Wisconsin Health is the BEST facility ever for giving birth! I came here this summer for the birth/delivery of our first child. I'd run into difficulties at home and both my midwife and I were ready for more help, and she suggested this facility as Dr. Hartung is very willing to work with home-birth clients. My husband and I couldn't be happier with the resulting care I was given here. Both Dr. Hartung and Dr. VerBeek, whom he had to turn my care over to because of prior commitments, were excellent in every way. So kind, calm, attentive, and willing to let me labor naturally but with the utmost care and supervision. Also the nursing staff was incredible....Rachel, Sarah, and all the nurses. My midwife was also allowed to stay in our room as support, which was wonderful. Our daughter was born happy and healthy, and then we were treated so kindly with the extra meals, the birthday cake, the MASSAGE, all the snacks that were available, and more....throughout the night and into the next day. We were also allowed to go home very quickly, per our request, which we totally appreciate. So here's a HUGE thank you to the birth/delivery team!!! I would love to use your facilities and staff again, should we ever have another child. And also, we were VERY happy with the general friendliness of all staff and the cleanliness of the building and rooms. Lastly, what a calming, wonderful addition to have the huge window facing the prairie area! Wow, what a great feature. So, thank you again for helping what I thought was a devastating development (abandoning our home-birth plans and heading to the hospital) turn out to be such a beautiful experience!!!\" We are SO blessed to have Western Wisconsin Health in our community. \"We had a long, tough labor, but we couldn't be happier! The entire staff was so incredibly amazing. They made a very exhausting two days much better with their warm support, encouraging words, and wonderful knowledge. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
