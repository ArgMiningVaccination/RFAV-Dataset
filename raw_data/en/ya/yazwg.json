COVID -1 Disease Outbreak Outlook Arizona State and Pima County Update September 17, 2021 Disclaimer : This information represents my personal views and not those of The University of Arizona, the Zuckerman College of Public Health, or any other government entity. Any opinions, forecasts, or corresponding recommendations should be considered in con junction with other corroborating and conflicting data . Past updates can be accessed at https://publichealth.arizona.edu/news/2021/covid -19- forecast -model . For the week ending September 12th, 17813 Arizonans were diagnosed with COVID -19, a 4% decrease from last week's initial tally of 18565 cases (Figure 1). The current rate, 248 cases per 100K residents per week , is decreasing by 17 cases per 100K residents per week. Case rates remain highest among those 15 - 24 years and lowest among those >65 years, 3 08 versus 133 cases per 100K residents, respectively (Figure 2a following page). Over the past 3 weeks, the largest improvement s have been observed among children with rates declining 41% from their p eak. While Arizona continues to experience a high number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, conditions are slowly improving except for a small number of counties like Greenlee County which is near its all -time high. Because behavioral dynamics are an important driver of community transmission and testing , the Labor Day holid ay has at least temporarily disrupted testing and transmission trends . Arizona 's national ranking has dropped to 33rd out of 50 states with t his week's leaders being West Virginia ( 765), Tennessee (764), Alaska (664), and Wyoming ( 659). According to the CDC , 61% of Arizona's adult population is fully vaccinated and another 10% have received one dose. The ADHS Vaccine Dashboard shows weekly doses delivered are declining with 70K doses per being administered last week . Based on national serology data , the combination of natural and vaccine immunity likely exceeds 80% in most parts of the country and among most age groups . Nevertheless , non-pharmacologic interventions like mask mandates, limited gathering sizes, and targeted business mitigations will help speed resolution and ensure this wave does not reignite. In another major development, the FDA advisory panel on vaccines recommended Pfi zer booster for those 65+ years of age. Figure 1.

Figure 2a shows a sharp decline in transmission among children (dotted) over the past 3 weeks with the smallest gains being observed among the elderly (solid) . While difficult to draw causal conclusions, recent mask mandate s in certain districts , aggressive case identification , and limited classroom closures are likely helping as the steepest declines were among school -age children 5 - 19 years (Figure 2b). Rumor has it that an important outbreak analysis of s chools with and without ma sk mandates is imminently expected in the MMWR . A judge presiding over the challenge to Arizona 's prohibition of school ma sk mandates intends to rule before the September 29th date the law will take effect . Slower declines among working -age and older adults is likely one factor contributing to stubbornly high CO VID-19 hospital occupancy (see following pages). Figure 2a. COVID -19 Cases in Arizona by Age Group March 7 - September 12, 2021. Figure 2b. COVID -19 Cases in Arizona among Children by Age Group March 7 - September 12, 2021. Created by Joe K.

Comparing school reopening this year (in -person) with last year (virtual), levels of community transmission are much higher this year than last , particularly among those <15 years ( Figure 2c ). Higher transmission among those 15 - 24 years associated with university re -openings was first observed about this time last year (orange bars, ages 15 - 24). Transmissi on on ca mpus is not an outl ier this year which is consi stent with the data reported on the UA COVID -19 Dashb oard which indicates fe wer reported cases on campus this year than last. Over t he past mont h, the trajectory of the current outbreak and that of the winter 2020/2021 outbreak have meaningfully diverged (Figure 2d). We are now experiencing a more permanent shift away from last year 's trajectory . Neverth eless, future continued improvements are less certain this week than last. Figure 2c. COVID -19 Cases in Arizona by Age Group Week Ending September 13, 2020 versus September 12, 2021 . Figure 2d. Fall 2020 and Fall 2021 C OVID -19 Waves Superimposed ( 109 days) . Created by Joe K. Gerald, MD, PhD (Associate Professor, Zuckerman College of Public Health, geraldj@email.arizona.edu ) with assistance from Patrick Wightman, PhD from the UA Center for Population Health Scie nces. Test positivity among those undergoing traditional nasopharyngeal testing remain unexpectedly high at 22% (Figure 3). This level of positivity indicates that testing is negligently inadequate for public health practice and that many cases are going u ndiagnosed. Prior troughs in test positivity have preceded increasin g transmission rates , so it is possible improvements could slow or reverse in re sponse to Labor Day . Alternatively, fewer people may have been wil ling to test over the holiday raising the positivity rate but not necessarily transmission . As of September 15th, 2050 (23%) of Arizona's 87 47 general ward beds were occupied by COVID -19 patients, a 1% decrease from last week's 2061 occupied beds (Figure 4 and Figure 5 Panel A). Another 695 (8%) beds remained available for use. The number of available beds is s imilar to last week's 689 beds. As of September 15th, 565 (32%) of Arizona's 17 43 ICU beds were occupied by COVID -19 patient s, a 1% increase from last week's 561 occupied beds (Figure 4 and Figure 5 Panel B). An additional 14 3 (8%) ICU beds remained available for use, the same as last week's 143 beds. As a lagging indicator, hospital occupancy is plateauing but not dec lining as expe cted. This may be attributable to persistently high transmission among high-risk groups and/or longer length of stay among younger patients. Figure 3.

Arizona Daily COVID -19 General Ward and ICU Census April 9, 2020 - September 15, 2021. Created by Joe K. Gerald, MD, PhD (Associate Professor, Zuckerman College of Public Health, geraldj@email.arizona.edu ) with assistance from Patrick Wightman, PhD from the UA Center for Population Health Scie nces. Arizona hospital occupancy remains above seasonal levels . Safety margins, as measured by excess available beds , remain quite low (Figure 6). Available excess capacity is nearly as low as it was at the worst of the winter 2020/2021 surge. Because occupancy is not improving in response to declining community transmission, hospitals should be prepared for >20% ward occupancy and >25% ICU occupancy for several more weeks. Even if you are vaccinated, the tail of th is COVID -19 surge will still impact your access to healthcare services should you become ill . Figure 5.

Gerald, MD, PhD (Associate Professor, Zuckerman College of Public Health, geraldj@email.arizona.edu ) with assistance from Patrick Wightman, PhD from the UA Center for Population Health Scie nces. Arizona continue s to experienc e >100 COVID -19 deaths per week (Figure 7). The week ending September 5th has recorded 1 80 deaths so far with the week ending August 22nd close behind with 178 deaths. Even so , the rise in the number of deaths is more muted than expected given the rise in cases. It now appears unlikely that Arizona will reach 300 deaths per week. Instead, the peak should occur at 200 deaths or a bit more per week. Figure 7. Weekly Arizona COVID -19 Deaths March 16, 2020 - September 12, 2021 . Created by Joe K.

Pima County Outlook For the week ending September 12th, 1712 Pima County residents were diagnosed with COVID -19 a 4% decline from last week 's initial tally (Figure 8). This marks the 3rd week of declining case counts a lthough the decline is more modest than the state trend . New cases are being diagnosed at a rate of 165 cases per 100K residents per week and is declining by 13 cases per 100K re sidents pe r week . Trends across the various age groups appear in Figure 9. A sharp , sustained drop among children , but not others, is readily apparent. Figure 8.

Summary : Arizona continues to experience high levels of community transmission, but case rates are slowly declining. Test p ositivity remains s tubbornly high remind ing us that test capacity, accessibility, and/or uptake is woefully inadequate to meet public health needs. Slow i mprovements , particularly among older groups, serves as a warning that major behavioral shif ts could result in future increases . o As of September 12th, new cases were being diagnosed at a rate of 248 cases per 100K residents per week. The rate was decreasing by 17 cases per 100K residents per week. While most counties are seeing improvement, a few like Greenlee are experiencing worse ning outbreaks. o Transmissi on a mong childre n continu es to decl ine fas ter than transmission among other age groups . Imp ortantly , schools may have to discontinue evidence -based mitigation practice s (e.g., maskin g) on September 29th depending on an impending court ruling . Further evidence that adults making good decisi ons (e.g., getting vaccin ated) benefit children https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036e1.htm also doesn 't work https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591 -021-01488 -2. Vaccination remains the most important public health priority to reduce viral spread and severe illness in the long run; however, mask mandates, restrictions on indoor gatherings, and targeted business mitigations are still needed to reduc e transmission and prevent a reversal in the short -term. o The FDA advisory panel on vaccines recently recommended Pfi zer booster for those 65+ years of age and those at high risk https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/17/health/fda -advisers -booster -five- things/index.html . A recent Lancet article lays out concerns some scienti sts have with widespread approval https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140 -6736(21)02046 -8/fulltext . o A recent MMWR report compares effectiveness against hospitalizations through August https://www.cdc. gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm . Shor t story , Moderna appears to confer a small advantage but Pfizer and J&J work well too. o Two more MMWR articles with similar conclusio ns regarding high vaccine efficacy against ED visits and hospitalizations https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e2.htm https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e1.htm . o A recent NEJM article shows Pfizer vaccine eff icacy to be safe and effective at 6 months https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345 . o A recent NEJM article shows Pfizer vaccine to be safe with a small increase in myocarditis risk, but th e risk of this outcome and others was substantially higher foll owing COVID -19 infection https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110475 . o A recent NEJM article shows higher neutralization titer s following 3rd dose of Pfizer vaccine https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113468 . o Another NEJM articl es shows p otential additional pro tection among those 60+ with a 3rd dose of Pfizer vaccine https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114255 . COVID -19 hospital occupancy is holding steady and is likely to exceed 20% of all beds in the general ward and 25% of beds in the ICU for weeks to come. Access to care will remain restricted even on the backside of waning COVID -19 case rates . Expect delays in elective procedures to persist . Although weekly deaths approaching 300 are now improbable , totals reaching low 200s will persist for the end of August - early September . Created by Joe K.
