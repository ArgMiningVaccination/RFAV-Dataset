We were trained in acu detox by the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) at the addiction program at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, New York. We have over 10 years' experience working with patients in recovery from a variety of substances including opiates, alcohol, and cocaine. We have worked in in-patient treatment centers as well as with individuals doing out-patient treatment. The benefits of acupuncture in addiction treatment include: - reduction in cravings and withdrawal symptoms - less anxiety and stress - improved sleep quality - improved treatment program retention rates If you are in recovery and would like to add acupuncture to your treatment plan, please [contact our office](https://caldwellacupuncture.com/contact/). We also work in consultation with treatment centers to develop acupuncture programs appropriate to their needs. "}
