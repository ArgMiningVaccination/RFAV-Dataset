Physical activity (PA) is a non-pharmacological strategy that can help manage treatment-related side effects, yet many AYAs are not sufficiently active. Better understanding factors that impact PA engagement and experiences is crucial. Of particular interest, body image and social support are two factors that may affect PA during and after treatment. This research program consisted of three interrelated studies to better understand the association between PA, body image, and social support among AYAs. Study 1 utilized a scoping review to summarize the available evidence on body image among AYAs, and to identify the theories, models, measures, and methods used to assess body image. Findings indicated that body image was associated with a number of factors, including social support and PA. Further, the body image measures used with AYAs widely varied. Using a qualitative design (semi-structured interviews) and a purposeful sample of AYAs who were previously active prior to cancer diagnosis (n = 12), Study 2 explored the experiences of PA re-engagement after cancer treatment. Four themes were generated in the analysis, which collectively described facilitators (e.g., supportive others, resuming 'normality') iii and barriers (e.g., body concerns, unwelcoming gyms) to PA re-engagement. In Study 3, a cross-sectional survey design was used to examine the relationships between body image, social support, and PA among AYAs on and off treatment (n = 119). Findings demonstrated that social support and body image were directly associated with PA. Collectively, this work highlighted the unique experiences of AYAs, emphasizing the dedicated attention needed among this population. Findings underscored factors that contribute to PA participation and experiences. These studies provide groundwork for further examining how and in what contexts PA, body image, and social support are related. The results are important given the beneficial role of PA in managing side effects and increasing longevity. Findings from this research program provide researchers and practitioners with foundational knowledge that can be used to inform the development of strategies aimed at supporting AYAs during and after treatment. iv Acknowledgments First and foremost, I would like to dedicate this dissertation to my Grama Jane.

Upwards of 7000 AYAs are diagnosed each year in Canada, with the most common cancer types diagnosed in this age range including breast, Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, testicular, and thyroid (Canadian Cancer Society's Advisory Committee, 2018, 2019; Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). Treatments typically used for AYAs include surgery and adjuvant therapies including chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017). These treatments can have significant acute, long-term, and late effects that can alter AYAs physical, psychological, and social well-being. AYAs are within a life-stage marked by considerable physical, social, cognitive, and emotional development and the cancer experience is likely to disrupt this normal period of growth (Barr, Ferrari et al., 2016; D'Agostino et al., 2011). Aside from the important physical effects that accompany a cancer diagnosis and treatment, psychosocial well-being is often compromised, with a substantial number of AYAs reporting unmet needs in body image and social support (Barakat et al., 2016; Tierney, 2008). Given that AYAs experience greater symptom burden including pain (Devlin et al., 2019) and mood and anxiety disorders (Lang et al., 2017) when compared to older cancer survivors, and the vast majority (80%) of AYAs are living for years after primary treatment (Klika et al., 2018), there is a large population of young people who require attention. Although physical activity yields important benefits to AYAs' physical, psychological, emotional, and social health and well-being, approximately half of AYAs are not sufficiently active with significantly more AYAs reporting no physical activity compared to healthy peers (31% vs. 24%; B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Brunet et al., 2012; Wurz & Brunet, 2016). AYAs' physical activity levels decline significantly from pre-diagnosis to during and post-treatment, with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity remaining lower than pre-diagnosis levels following treatment (Keats et al., 2006; Murnane et al., 2015). For example, 70% of AYAs report meeting guidelines prior to diagnosis, while only 49% report meeting guidelines following treatment (Murnane et al., 2015). Yet, many AYAs want to increase their 2 activity post-treatment (Adams et al. 2021; Barakat et al., 2016; B\u00e9langer et al., 2012; Gupta et al., 2013). Factors that can be targeted to help AYAs start or continue being active have yet to be well understood (Brunet et al., 2018). And so, it is important to determine factors related to activity levels to help increase physical activity and improve overall health and well-being. AYAs that hold negative perceptions of their body reported that they were unlikely to participate in activities where their bodies might be on display including swimming and other physical activities (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006). Likewise, perceptions of low social support for engaging in physical activity and exercise limited AYAs' interest in participating in these activities (Wu et al., 2015). As such, body image and social support can be key barriers to physical activity participation and require further attention. As an initial step, it is necessary to better understand body image within the context of AYAs, as well as how it is defined, theorized, and measured within this population. Body image is a multidimensional construct that involves positive and negative perceptions, cognitions, feelings, and behaviours towards the body's appearance and function (Cash & Smolak, 2011). A useful model developed to understand body image within the context of cancer is the heuristic cognitive behavioural model by White (2000) that describes how objective or perceived body changes influence body image. These changes influence the body image perceptions, affect, cognitions, and behaviours of cancer survivors (White, 2000). AYAs are likely to experience temporary or permanent changes to their body's appearance and function such as scarring, hair loss, and weight change (Barakat et al., 2016; Albritton, et 2013). These cancer-related changes can negatively influence body image, which may persist and contribute to higher levels of distress and lower quality of life (Fan & Eiser, 2009; Hedstrom et al., 2005; Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006; Quinn et al., 2015; Rosenberg et al., 2013). The negative effects are further emphasized for AYAs given that they are in a stage of life where appearance and social status are highly valued (Abrams et al., 2007). Indeed, AYAs report their bodies have dramatically changed, experience frequent worrying about their appearance, and describe their bodies as \"ugly\" or \"not normal\" (Epelman, 2013; Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006; Williamson et al., 2010). And so, it is not surprising that over half of survivors describe a need for strategies to help them cope with these body changes and a desire for programming to help them improve their body image (Tierney, 2008). Although unique findings exist related to body image among AYAs, the evidence has not been 3 summarized, which limits our understanding of the predictors and outcomes of body image on health and well-being. A comprehensive summary and integration of existing empirical evidence would be useful to identify the theories, models, measures, and methods used to study body image among AYAs. Getting AYAs active again after treatment for cancer is highly relevant to their overall health and well-being. AYAs have reported a particular desire to increase their strength and endurance and reintegrate into sports (Adams et al., 2021; Barakat et al., 2016). Easing the transition back into greater physical activity engagement following treatment is important to achieve increased post-treatment activity levels among AYAs. This transition refers to any time following treatment when AYAs tried to or began getting active again. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the factors that hinder or facilitate the transition back into physical activity following cancer treatment is essential. Of particular interest, social support is a key factor that may influence physical activity. AYAs are in a developmental period that is often marked by refining social and interpersonal skills and developing social relationships, however many social aspects of life are halted with cancer treatment leaving AYAs feeling conflicted and isolated (Abrams et al., 2007; Barakat et al., 2016). Feeling disconnected from others and perceiving low levels of social support may undermine AYAs' perceptions of their physical skills and abilities and can limit interest in engaging in activity (Feeney & Collins, 2015; Wu et al., 2015). Yet, perceiving high levels of social support can increase physical activity initiation and maintenance (Schwartz, 2004). Secondly, body image may also impact physical activity engagement. Negative body image perceptions and feelings have been implicated as a barrier to physical activity engagement among AYAs (Brunet, Taran, et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2015). In addition, literature demonstrates that AYAs who have body image concerns report using avoidance coping wherein they avoid change rooms and physical activities that may display their bodies (e.g., swimming; Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006; Nozawa et al., 2015). And so, given that low perceptions of social support and negative body image are barriers to participating in physical activity, the exploration of how body image and social support may impact the physical activity transition among AYAs is of particular interest. 4 Furthermore, body image may indirectly affect the relationship between social support and physical activity. Negative body image perceptions are associated with the avoidance of social situations, peers, and the development of close and intimate relationships (Abrams et al., 2007; Larouche & 2017). However, AYAs have reported that supportive others are key to facilitating more positive and less negative body image, as well as offer protection against harmful body commentary received from others (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006; Rosenberg et al., 2014; Williamson et a., 2010). Although the direction of effects between social support and body image is unclear, sociocultural perspectives (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012) provide a useful guide for hypothesizing direction. These perspectives posit that social influences (e.g., peers, parents) impact the development of thoughts and feelings about the body, as well as exercise behaviours. And so, it would be reasonable to expect that social support may impact body image, which can in turn influence physical activity. Testing these relationships would be a novel and worthwhile aim with the ultimate goal of increasing physical activity and improving the health and well-being of AYAs. 1.1 Dissertation Objectives The main purpose of this body of work is to better understand the experience of AYAs as it pertains to body image and the relationship between body image, social support, and physical activity. Using quantitative and qualitative methodologies in three studies, this program of research aimed to: i) Explore and summarize the available evidence on body image among AYAs, examine how body image is defined, and identify the theories, models, measures, and methods used to assess body image (Study 1). ii) Qualitatively explore AYAs' experiences transitioning back into physical activity after cancer treatment (Study 2). iii) Examine the direct and indirect associations between social support, body-related self-conscious emotions, and physical activity among AYAs (Study 3). 5 1.2 Significance and Implications of the Dissertation Research AYAs experience greater symptom burden than older adults diagnosed with the same cancer (Devlin et al., 2019; Lang et al., 2017). Strategies to address the symptom burden, while also promoting positive outcomes, are needed. Physical activity is one strategy that can influence physical, psychological, social, and cognitive outcomes, yet the majority of research conducted on physical activity and cancer is with middle and older aged adult cancer survivors (Brunet et al., 2018; Fuller et al., 2018; McTiernan et al., 2019; Neil-Sztamko et al., 2019). AYAs have unique physical activity preferences and experiences, yet the majority of AYAs are not meeting physical activity guidelines (Adams et al., 2021; B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Brunet et al., 2018; Murnane et al., 2015). As such, the current research program was designed to explore factors that affect physical activity engagement and experiences. The collective findings from this research have utility in advancing research and intervention strategies aimed at improving the health and well-being of AYAs during and after treatment. 1.3 Overview of the Dissertation The current section, Chapter 1, provides a brief introduction to the background and empirical context of this program of work, as well as the primary purpose and study objectives. Chapter 2 offers a comprehensive overview of the literature regarding AYA cancer, physical activity, body image, and social support. In addition, an overview of the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings is provided, as well as a robust rationale for the program of research. Chapters 3-5 are presented in manuscript form and display the scholarly contributions of this research program. In particular, Chapter 3 presents a scoping review of the available evidence related to body image (Vani, Lucibello, Trinh, Santa Mina, & Sabiston, 2021). Chapter 4 describes a qualitative examination of AYAs' physical activity experiences after cancer treatment and pays particular attention to the role of body image and social support in physical activity re-engagement (Vani, Sabiston, Santa Mina, & Trinh, under review). Chapter 5 presents a cross-sectional survey study examining the relationships between social support, body image, and physical activity (Vani, Sabiston, Trinh, & Santa Mina, in press). Finally, Chapter 6 provides an integrated discussion of the three studies and highlights the theoretical, conceptual, methodological, and practical implications stemming from the current research program. 6 Chapter 2 Review of the Literature Review of the Literature 2.1 Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer It is estimated that approximately one in two Canadians will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime (Canadian Cancer Society's Advisory Committee, 2019). Advancements in detection and treatment for cancer have contributed to the reduction in cancer deaths. As a result, there is a growing population of Canadians who are living in the aftermath of cancer, with a 63% five-year survival rate for all cancers combined (Canadian Cancer Society's Advisory Committee, 2019). Among these survivors are adolescents and young adults (AYAs), defined in Canada as those who are diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 15 and 39 years (Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). There is some debate about the age range for this population, however 15-39 is the most agreed upon range and therefore will be used for the purpose of this program of research (Aubin et al., 2011; National Cancer Institute, 2006; Sender, 2013). A cancer survivor is anyone who has been diagnosed with cancer until the end of life (National Cancer Institute, n.d.). Given that AYAs are in a distinct phase of development, their cancer biology, care needs, and barriers are unique from younger and older cancer survivors (Barakat et al., 2016). Yet, AYA-specific oncology settings are uncommon worldwide, leaving many AYAs to receive care in pediatric or adult oncology sites. As a result, many AYAs report dissatisfaction with their oncology setting as patients in pediatric settings are on average four or five years of age while adult patients are on average 60 years of age (D'Agostino et al., 2011). 2.1.1 Prevalence Upwards of 7000 AYAs will be diagnosed with cancer each year in Canada (Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). The most common cancers for AYAs include breast, Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, testicular, and thyroid (Canadian Cancer Society's Advisory Committee, 2018, 2019; Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). In addition, the following cancer types are characterized as predominantly AYA cancers: testicular, Hodgkin lymphoma, bone sarcomas, and cervical cancer (Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). The incidence rate of cancer in AYAs is slowly increasing, yet varies widely by cancer type (Barr, Ries, et al., 7 2016; Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). In fact, thyroid cancer mostly accounts for the increase in cancer incidence among this age group mainly due to over diagnosis, while other cancer types such as lung and melanoma have decreased among AYAs (Barr, Ries, et al., 2016). 2.1.2 Detection and Diagnosis Cancer may be detected through routine medical checkups, self-examinations, or a screening test. Diagnostic tests, including lab tests (e.g., blood, urine), imaging tests (e.g., CT scans, MRIs), and biopsies (i.e., remove sample of tissue or tumour to see if it contains cancer cells), are used to help diagnose cancer depending on the specific site of concern (Vogel, 2016). There are two common classification systems for cancer, the International Classification of Disease for Oncology (ICD-O) and the International Classification of Childhood Cancers (ICCC; Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017). It is recommended that for AYAs, classifying tumours should take a histological approach (using ICCC) since most tumours in this age range are not carcinomas and the histological approach focuses on the biology of the cancer, which is imperative to survival among AYAs (Barr, 2018; Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017). AYAs often experience delayed diagnosis when compared to younger and older individuals. This may be because many AYAs and physicians are not cognizant of the likelihood of AYAs getting cancer, AYAs may feel invincible or embarrassed so they do not report symptoms, and/or physicians have difficulties deciding where to refer patients for the best oncology care to fit their unique needs (Barakat et al., 2016; Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017; Haase & Philips, 2004; Ramphal et al., 2016). Interestingly, female AYAs have significantly longer delays from symptom onset to cancer diagnosis when compared to males, yet whether this finding is a result of cancer type remains unclear (Barr, 2018). Delay in diagnosis is especially concerning since cancer progresses more quickly in this population and the cancer types are more diverse and rare when compared to younger or older cancer patients (Bleyer, 2002; Bleyer, Ferrari, et al., 2017). 2.1.3 Treatments and Acute, Long-Term, and Late Effects Treatments most used for types of cancers diagnosed among AYAs are surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy, although other available treatment options include immunotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and hormone therapy. The type of treatment provided depends on cancer type, stage, and the patients' preferences (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017). Since AYAs are sent to 8 either pediatric or adult oncology sites that both lack expertise in AYAs, treatment intensity can widely vary between care sites (Baxter et al., 2014; Bleyer, 2005). Alike the increase in survival rates across all Canadians, the five-year survival rate for AYAs is above 80% across all cancer types (Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). Among AYAs, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer all have greater than 80% five-year relative survival rates. In comparison, brain cancer, bone cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, colorectal cancer, and soft tissue sarcomas have the lowest five-year survival rates among AYAs. Given the survival rates in AYAs, the population of AYAs is growing and the distinct challenges they face require further attention (Canadian Cancer Society's Advisory Committee, 2018, 2019; Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). Although current treatment plans yield promising survival outcomes, the cancer treatments used are often accompanied by numerous side effects that have a significant impact on survivors' social, cognitive, physical, and psychological functioning well into survivorship (Gupta et al., 2016; Klika et al., 2018; Sanft & Irwin, 2012; Tai et al., 2012). It is estimated that two out of three AYAs will experience at least one late effect and approximately one out of four will experience a severe or life-threatening late effect (Bhatia et al., 2017). There are several acute, chronic, and late effects that impact AYAs (Klika et al., 2018). Specifically, AYAs may experience changes to their cardiovascular health (Chao et al., 2016; Tai et al., 2012), musculoskeletal, endocrine, reproductive, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary health (Bhatia et al., 2017), impaired cognition (Jim et al., 2018), secondary cancer (Bright et al., 2019), cancer-specific mortality (Chao et al., 2016), and diminished physical functioning (Miller et al., 2013). Furthermore, fatigue (Spathis et al., 2017), sleep disturbances (Walker et al., 2010), vocational difficulties (Nathan et al., 2011), increased feelings of isolation, distress (Kwak et al., 2013), anxiety and depression (Seitz et al., 2010), and negative body image (Brierley et al., 2019) may be experienced. In general, these changes to their physical heath, vocational aspects of life, social relationships, and psychological and emotional well-being can have a negative impact on survivors' quality of life following treatment (short-term) and well into adulthood (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017; Klika et al., 2018). In addition, researchers note that AYAs experience greater symptom burden including increased pain (Devlin et al., 2019) and mood and 9 anxiety disorders (Lang et al., 2017) when compared to older cancer survivors with similar cancers. As such, it is imperative that AYAs receive long-term supportive care following treatment for cancer (Ramphal et al., 2016). 2.2 Health and Well-being after Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Treatment Recent calls have been made to broaden and intensify the supportive care for AYAs (Barakat et al., 2016). AYA survivorship care is essential given that treatment side effects can be chronic and long-term and AYAs are living on average 50 to 60 years after their diagnosis and treatment for cancer (Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). AYAs are within a period of achieving developmental milestones that are key to their well-being for the rest of their lives (Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). Milestones include forming social relationships, becoming financially independent, establishing a role in education and employment, and developing one's identity and values (Barr, Ferrari, et al., 2016). Coupling the life-stage with a cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment is especially burdensome on these individuals and is likely to disrupt their development and affect their physical, social, and psychological health as a result (Barr, Ferrari, et al., 2016). AYAs report numerous age-appropriate psychosocial needs that remain unmet, with 50% of AYAs who express a need report not having that need met (Barakat et al., 2016; Ramphal et al., 2016). These unmet needs are commonly related to social support and mental health services and negatively affect AYAs' quality of life (Barakat et al., 2016). 2.2.1 Social Well-being In terms of social relationships, AYAs are refining their social and interpersonal skills at this stage of life, yet with cancer treatment, many social aspects of life are halted (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017). AYAs often feel isolated and different from their healthy peers. Treatments that are longer in duration also tend to be associated with greater problems with peer and colleague relationships as they often have difficulties maintaining these connections (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017; Zebrack, Chesler, et al., 2017). In addition, survivors and their romantic partners may face challenges within their relationship (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017). Fears regarding relapse or infertility post-treatment could impact plans for marriage and family planning (Eiser & Kuperberg, 2017). Furthermore, AYAs may be forced into dependence on their parents throughout recovery and they are likely to withhold treatment effect information from their 10 parents to protect them, which may further isolate them from previous social ties (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017). These issues with social well-being are especially pronounced for AYAs when compared to their younger or older cancer survivor counterparts (Woodward et al., 2011). 2.2.2 Psychological Well-being Cancer survivors report greater distress than the general population (Phillips-Salimi & Andrykowski, 2013). In fact, researchers suggest that 15-30% of AYAs experience psychological distress and cancer treatments are associated with symptoms of anxiety among AYAs (Dahl et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2016; Zebrack, Chesler, et al., 2017). AYAs express higher rates of emotional distress when compared to healthy siblings (Viale, 2016). When compared with healthy controls, AYAs report more frequent experiences of poor mental health (10% vs. 20% for 14 out of 30 days; Tai et al., 2012), yet more than half of AYAs requiring mental health services do not receive such care (Keegan et al., 2012). In addition, AYAs' feelings of autonomy and control may be threatened by cancer treatment because of having to prematurely face one's mortality and having to stall or abandon previous goals (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., al., 2017). AYAs often have issues coping due to underdeveloped coping mechanisms (Clark & Fasciano, 2015). Furthermore, fertility, sexual functioning, and sexual pleasure may be impacted by cancer treatment and these changes contribute considerably to levels of distress (Eiser & Kuperberg, 2017). Treatment may also cause appearance-related changes such as scarring, weight change, hair loss, skin discoloration, delayed sexual maturity, among others, which are likely to negatively affect AYAs' body image (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017; Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006; Epelman, 2013). Poor body image may persist long-term and contribute to reductions in quality of life extending into survivorship (Quinn et al., 2015). 2.2.3 Physical Health Treatments contribute to an increased risk of cancer recurrence and cancer-specific mortality, as well as changes to AYAs' cardiovascular health, physical functioning, and cancer-related fatigue, among others. These changes may lead to secondary morbidity, commonly including, heart disorders, secondary cancer, and obesity (Bhatia et al., 2017; Mertens et al., 2001; Klika et al., 2018). Symptoms of cardiovascular disease can arise during treatment, shortly after, or many years post-treatment (Bhatia et al., 2017; Christensen et al., 2015; Sanft 11 al., 2012; Wright, 2017). AYAs are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to non-cancer comparisons, and AYAs who develop cardiovascular disease are at a significantly greater risk of dying compared to AYAs who do not develop cardiovascular disease (Chao et al., 2016). In addition, cancer survivors are likely to experience a loss in physical fitness and endurance due to treatment (Wright, 2017). For example, surgery often results in reductions in muscular strength and range of motion (Schmitz, 2011). Furthermore, fatigue is often caused by treatment and significantly impacts quality of life, especially among those who are not physically active (Lowe, 2011; Wright, 2017). Survivors commonly report fatigue during various points along the cancer continuum as it often persists years after treatment (Mustian et al., 2017). 2.3 Physical Activity Physical activity is a valuable behaviour that can influence AYA's cancer-related treatment effects and quality of life (Bleyer, 2005; Murnane et al., 2015; Wright, 2017). Physical activity is \"any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure\" (p. 126; Caspersen et al., 1985) and is an umbrella term to capture exercise and sport. Exercise is \"a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive and has as a final or an intermediate objective the improvement or maintenance of physical fitness\" (p. 126; Caspersen et al., 1985), while sport is a \"competitive and/or recreational activity involving skill and physical exertion\" (p. 49; Sabiston et al., 2019). Physical activity is a non-pharmacological strategy that is safe for most cancer survivors and is used to mitigate the effects of treatment (Schmitz et al., 2010; Segal et al., 2017). As such, the newly revised physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors are to participate in 90 minutes of at least moderate aerobic activity and engage in at least two sessions of resistance exercise per week, meanwhile those 15 to 18 are advised to participate in 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day (Campbell et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2016). Specific to cancer, modifications to the guidelines should be considered based on the individual's cancer treatment side effects (Campbell et al., 2019; Schmitz et al., 2010). In addition to the physical benefits that physical activity affords (e.g., reduced pain, fatigue, increased aerobic capacity, muscle strength), AYAs also may experience improved body image via increased confidence and social relationships (Gill et al., 2016; Paxton et al., 2010), decreased symptoms of anxiety and depression (B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Wright et al., 2017), lower stress (B\u00e9langer et al., 2011), and 12 increased feelings of control over the body and health (Brunet et al., 2018; Paxton et al., 2010; Wright, 2017). These improvements are suggested to be a result of physical activity increasing social interactions, distracting individuals from unwanted thoughts, and improving perceptions of one's body (B\u00e9langer et al., 2011). Despite the benefits and published guidelines, about half of AYAs are inactive or insufficiently active (B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Murnane et al., 2015). There is a significant decline in physical activity from pre-diagnosis to during and post-treatment, with levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity remaining low after treatment (Keats et al., 2006; Murnane et al., 2015). Yet, the majority of AYAs report an ability and desire to increase their physical activity levels and indicate a need for more exercise information post-diagnosis (Adams et al., 2021; B\u00e9langer et al., 2012; Gupta et al., 2013; Zebrack, 2008). Young adult cancer survivors have also expressed an unmet need for age-appropriate exercise programming (Smith-Turchyn et al., 2020). Interventions designed for AYAs have targeted physical activity through self-efficacy, self-monitoring, and basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness (Mendoza et al., 2017; Valle et al., 2013). In addition, these interventions have specifically aimed to utilize social support as a mechanism to increase physical activity engagement. However, due to inconsistent findings across AYA-specific physical activity interventions, Brunet and colleagues (2018) suggests that the factors that should be targeted in physical activity programs used to help AYAs begin or continue physical activity remain to be elucidated. And so, it is critical to better understand factors that relate to physical activity levels after cancer treatment and how these factors may contribute to improving the transition into increased activity post-treatment. Two factors that may contribute to physical activity among AYAs are body image and social support. 2.4 Body Image Body image is a multidimensional construct that involves the positive and negative perceptions, cognitions, feelings, and behaviours towards the body's appearance and function (Cash & Smolak, 2011). Perceptions involve one's description and views of their body appearance and function, while cognitions are focused on one's thoughts about their body appearance and function. Feelings and emotions about one's body appearance and function describe the affective dimension and the behaviours towards the body appearance and function result from one's perceptions, cognitions, and feelings (Cash & Smolak, 2011). 13 Specific to AYAs, body image is greatly affected by the cancer itself and associated treatment(s) and may be related to both the appearance and function of the body (Barakat et al., 2016). Physical side effects of cancer that can be temporary or permanent include physical functioning issues, hair loss, weight changes, and sexual maturity delays. These side effects can contribute to negative body perceptions and several of them are physical reminders that cause AYAs to feel self-conscious and vulnerable (Barakat al., 2016; Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017; Tierney, 2008; Williamson et al., 2010). Men and women AYAs report significant concerns regarding their body changes and experience reduced self-esteem as a result of negative perceptions that often persist even when the physical changes are no longer obvious (Abrams et al., 2007; Barakat et al., 2016; Barnett et al., 2016). However, AYA women do experience more severe fears around their appearance and have more negative body image perceptions when compared to men (Zucchetti et al., 2017). Negative body image perceptions occur among AYAs with varying cancer types and treatments received, indicating that these perceptions are likely individualized rather than specific to these cancer variables (Zucchetti et al., 2017). 2.4.1 Body Image Model To better understand body image within oncology, White (2000) developed a heuristic cognitive behavioural model that explains how perceived or actual cancer-related appearance changes influence the four dimensions of body image. The model contends that these real or perceived changes in appearance affect the individual's body image schemas, which in turn influence the person's investment in body ideals and their self-evaluations. These components then determine perceptions (appearance assumptions), cognitions (automatic thoughts and images), emotions (body image emotions), and behaviours (compensatory behaviours; White, 2000). Of interest, these behaviours can include avoidance of social interactions, which demonstrates the probable connection between body image and social support among cancer survivors (White, 2000). In contrast to White's (2000) model, the majority of body image literature in oncology is not theoretically rooted or it focuses on only one dimension of body image (White & Hood, 2011). As such, this narrowed view of body image contrasts White's (2000) model as this improved model provides a comprehensive understanding of body-related experiences among cancer survivors by endorsing a multidimensional definition of body image. In fact, researchers recommend the use of this multidimensional theory-based approach to body image in oncology 14 using White's (2000) model (Brunet, Sabiston, et al., 2013). As such, this model has been supported in body image studies with cancer populations demonstrating that appearance-related changes due to cancer affect body image perceptions (Moreira & Canavarro, 2010), body image affect (Brunet, Sabiston, et al., 2013), and compensatory behaviours (White, 2000). For these reasons, it is advantageous to use White's (2000) model to advance our understanding of body image in AYA oncology. 2.4.2 Body Image within the Adolescent and Young Adult Context Adolescents are in a life-stage where there is an emphasis on appearance and being 'attractive' greatly affects one's perceptions of their body (Abrams et al., 2007). Therefore, experiencing cancer during this formative period is especially harmful (Zucchetti et al., 2017). Indeed, AYAs have greater body image concerns when compared to children and feel less attractive in comparison to the general population (Fan & Eiser, 2009; Sundberg et al., 2011). At a time when self-image and peer-group involvement is so highly valued, AYAs frequently worry about appearing different and not having their appearance return to its previous state (Epelman, 2013; Zebrack & Isaacson, 2012). Although the majority of AYAs' spouses reported that their significant others' attractiveness did not decrease after treatment, over half of survivors felt their bodies changed dramatically and one third felt less attractive (Hannah et al., 1992; Incrocci et al., 2002). What is also troubling is that AYAs are describing their bodies as \"not normal\", \"sick\", and \"ugly\" (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006, p. 203), yet cancer survivors do range in their degree of self-consciousness as noted by labels they ascribe to themselves (e.g., \"less attractive\" versus \"totally ugly\", p. 204). AYAs with greater body image concerns report higher levels of distress (Hedstrom et al., 2005; Vani et al., 2020), anxiety and depression (Rosenberg et al., 2013), and lower quality of life (Fan & Eiser, 2009). In addition, survivors have reported that changes to their appearance after treatment are more severe than chemotherapy-related side effects including nausea (DeFrank et al., 2007). The body changes that AYAs are unable to conceal leave them feeling vulnerable and exposed leading them to engage in avoidance behaviours (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006). In fact, those who have scars from cancer tend to avoid cancer disclosure when asked about their scars by using sarcasm or providing minimal information (Barnett et al., 2014). Further, AYAs desire skills to manage negative reactions from others such as ridicule or avoidance by peers 15 (Williamson et al., 2010). Over half of cancer survivors describe requiring help in coping with body image changes and 30% of AYAs report a preference for programs focusing on improving body image (Tierney, 2008). While there are several unique findings related to body image among AYAs, the evidence has not been summarized or integrated to help make sense of the factors related to body image. Nor have the commonly used theories, measures, and methods been defined among this population. Given the prevalent body image issues among AYAs and the importance of understanding body image within this population, the first aim of this research plan is to conduct a scoping review to comprehensively examine the current literature within body image among AYAs. A scoping review will allow for a broad summary of knowledge of this research area (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005; Colquhoun et al., 2014). This scoping review will be useful to identify definitions used to describe body image, as well as the theories, models, measures, and methods used to study body image among AYAs. Better understanding body image and identifying how it is studied among AYAs would be useful to uncover current research gaps and inspire new research areas to advance this field of research (Colquhoun et al., 2014; Peterson et al., 2017). In addition, the results will help to inform the choice of theory and measures used for the following studies in this program of research. Furthermore, findings may help to support the development of programs and guidelines aimed at improving body image. 2.5 Social Support Although AYAs are in a developmental period recognized for making social connections and relationships, their diagnosis of cancer hinders their ability to make and keep these social relationships and develop interpersonal skills (Abrams et al., 2007; Barakat et al., 2016). This is partly due to the time spent away from peers during treatment and recovery, the trouble they may have discussing their cancer experience with others, and feeling like they can no longer relate to their peers leaving AYAs feeling conflicted and isolated (Barakat et al., 2016; Bleyer, 2005; Epelman, 2013; Kent et al., 2013). Social support can provide a buffer to cancer-related stress, comfort or protect an individual, and promote strength and recovery (Feeney & Collins, 2015). Further, social support can influence immediate changes to AYAs' emotional state, self-perceptions, and lifestyle behaviours (Feeney & Collins, 2015). 16 Social support is a multidimensional construct that refers to the \"supportive aspects of a social environment\" (Krahn, 1993, p. 235) and includes structural (i.e., social support networks), functional (i.e., exchange of resources), and perceptual (i.e., perceptions of quality and quantity of support) dimensions (Holt & Hoar, 2006). Structural social support involves the social support networks that include all social relationships available to an individual (e.g., friends, family) and is often measured by a self-report of the size of the network (Cohen, 1988). However, understanding the quality of an individual's social support network is more important than the simple number of social support providers (Love & Sabiston, 2011). Functional social support denotes an individual's perceptions of the support that they receive from their social support networks (Barrera, 1986; Gottlieb & Bergen, 2010). Various types of support have been defined including listening (e.g., people who listen without giving advice or being judgmental), task challenge (e.g., people who challenge your way of thinking), informational, (e.g., people who provide advice and guidance), emotional (e.g., people who comfort and care for you), esteem (e.g., people who support your competence and encourage you), reality confirmation (e.g., people who are similar to you and hold compatible views) and tangible or instrumental (e.g., people who provide you with materials, good, and services) support (Rees et al., 2000; Richman et al., 1993; Zebrack et al., 2010). The perception of social support involves an individual's appraisal of the structural and functional dimensions of social support and predicts overall well-being (Holt & Hoar, 2006; Thoitis, 1995). AYAs may require more informational support compared to older cancer survivors, as younger adults reported significantly greater health system and information needs compared to older adults (Hall et al., 2012). Informational needs are heightened post-diagnosis and during treatment as AYAs often lack the education and experience of navigating health systems and require help with decision-making (McNeil et al., 2019). Informational needs are often met by the social support received through parents (McNeil et al., 2019). AYAs may therefore require greater informational support from their parents compared to healthy peers (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017), and may need more informational support during treatment when decision-making and health system navigation are heightened. In addition to informational support, reality confirmation, or feeling support from people who are similar, helps to reduce isolated feelings for AYAs during treatment (Kent et al., 2012). Former peer relationships are often replaced or supplemented by other cancer survivors of a similar age who understand what they are going 17 through (Zebrack et al., 2006). Leveraging cancer peer relationships during treatment is important and often requires informal introductions by healthcare providers (Kent et al., 2012; McNeil et al., 2019). Meanwhile, non-cancer peers are described as helpful sources of support post-treatment when AYAs are attempting to reintegrate into 'normal life' (Kent et al., 2012). Overall, AYAs may require different types and sources of social support throughout the cancer continuum. 2.6 Factors Influencing Physical Activity Engagement and Experiences Body image and social support are two key factors that can greatly affect physical activity and their role in influencing physical activity participation and experiences among AYAs requires greater attention. 2.6.1 Social Support and Physical Activity Of particular interest, social support may be a central factor influencing AYAs' physical activity engagement and experiences. Social disconnect may pose as a challenge to a survivor's perceptions of their skills and abilities (Feeney & Collins, 2015). For example, perceptions of low social support for engaging in physical activity limited AYAs' interest in participating in activity (Wu et al., 2015). Alternatively, group-based physical activity such as adventure camps, promotes peer support and social connectedness, improves physical activity confidence, and increases physical activity behaviour (Gill et al., 2016; Pugh, Petrella, Fisher, et al., 2021; Rosenberg et al., 2014; Zebrack, Kwak, et al., 2017). Social support is also instrumental to survivors' continued participation in activity (Schwartz, 2004). 2.6.2 Body Image and Physical Activity Body image may also influence physical activity engagement and experiences. Positive body image is related to greater levels of physical activity among AYAs (Barrett-Bernstein et al., 2020). In addition, AYAs that have engaged in a group exercise program have reported increased body acceptance following the program (Adamsen et al., 2009). Meanwhile, AYAs' negative perceptions and feelings about changes to their body's functioning are a noted barrier to participation in physical activity after treatment (Wu et al., 2015). Long-term and late effects of cancer treatment that affect the body's appearance and function make engaging in physical 18 activity difficult for some survivors (Brunet, Taran, et al., 2013). For instance, AYAs who felt unattractive due to their cancer-related scars were more likely to engage in lower levels of physical activity or be inactive altogether (Olsson et al., 2018). AYAs who held a negative body-related perception were unlikely to participate in activities where their bodies might be on display, including swimming and other physical activities (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006). Furthermore, AYAs with body image concerns tend to avoid communal changing rooms, which are commonly found in fitness facilities (Nozawa et al., 2015). 2.6.3 Transition into Physical Activity Post-Treatment As discussed previously, the unique experience of transitioning from treatment to post-treatment is challenging for many AYAs and they report numerous unmet needs during this time (Barnett et al., 2016). Specifically, AYAs describe that their most preferred survivorship program would increase strength and endurance and/or would reintegrate them into sports (Adams et al., 2021; Barakat et al., 2016). Therefore, transitioning into physical activity post-treatment is important for AYAs and a focus on this post-treatment transition is timely since many AYAs report a preference to start physical activity after cancer treatment (B\u00e9langer et al., 2012). Given the number of potential years AYAs have post-treatment, preventative medicine, such as physical activity, is critical to improving long-term physical and psychological outcomes. As such, easing the transition into a more active lifestyle after primary treatment for cancer is key to overall well-being. This transition becomes more difficult with the end of intensive support from healthcare providers as the AYA moves into post-treatment (Patterson et al., 2015). Since beginning physical activity post-treatment is desired and important for health and well-being, better understanding the obstacles that prevent a smooth transition or facilitators that ease this transition is central to increasing AYAs physical activity levels post-treatment. As outlined, negative body image and low levels of social support may be notable barriers to participating in physical activity, while greater levels of social support may facilitate physical activity engagement (e.g., Brunet, Taran, et al., 2013; Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006; Rosenberg et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2015). As such, body image and social support can be key factors impacting the transition into increased physical activity post-cancer treatment and therefore require further attention. The second aim of this program of research is to gain a thorough understanding of AYAs' physical activity experiences post-treatment. In addition, the exploration of how body 19 image and social support may impact AYAs' experiences transitioning back into physical activity after treatment is of particular interest. 2.7 Social Support, Body Image, and Physical Activity Body image may indirectly impact the relationship between social support and physical activity. Exploring this relationship would be beneficial to expand our understandings of the antecedents of physical activity among AYAs. 2.7.1 Social Support and Body Image Changes to one's body due to cancer treatment, especially changes that cannot be concealed, often leave AYAs feeling unattractive, vulnerable, and different. As a result, they often report negative body image perceptions (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006). These feelings impact their interest in forming close and romantic relationships with others and contribute to the development of behaviours that are socially isolating such as avoidance of social engagements and interactions with friends and significant others (Abrams et al., 2007; Adamsen et al., 2009; Brunet, Sabiston et al., 2013; Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006). Intimate relationships, in particular, are difficult for AYAs, as survivors have suggested that their appearance is an obstacle to meeting prospective romantic partners (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006). Evidence demonstrates that being single when diagnosed with cancer is related to increased distress around the body (Carpentier & Fortenberry, 2010). In addition, avoidance of school or work is reported where cancer survivors don't want to transition back into school and work until their appearance change is less drastic, such as having their hair grow back (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006). AYAs' feelings of self-consciousness could contribute to their difficulties with peer relationships and at times survivors report stigma from peers as a result of appearance changes in the form of laughing or negative comments and teasing (Barakat et al., 2016; Warner et al., 2016; Zebrack et al., 2010). This in turn may negatively influence AYAs' body image. Social support can be particularly influential in decreasing avoidance and feelings of isolation (Bleyer, Albritton, et al., 2017; Kyngas et al., al., 2014; Zebrack, Chesler, et al., 2017). Close friends can act a \"peer shield\" or \"safety blanket\" by shielding AYAs from unwanted comments or attention (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006). As such, although body image is associated with avoidance and withdrawal, it is important to note that social support is 20 highly relevant for dealing with negative body image perceptions among AYAs. Promisingly, social support from peers improves body image among AYAs (Bleyer et al., 2005; Zucchetti et al., 2017). For example, engaging in AYA-specific peer support programs such as outdoor adventure camps is associated with improvements in body image when compared to waitlist controls (Rosenberg et al., 2014). Meanwhile, lower perception of social support is related to greater body image concerns (Vani et al., 2020), suggesting that social support is central to body image. Understanding the tumultuous relationship between body image and social support among AYAs is a valuable avenue of research as perceptions of social support are likely to reduce negative isolating feelings following cancer treatment. 2.7.2 Sociocultural Perspectives Although the direction of relationship between social support and body image is unclear, sociocultural perspectives (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012) provide a useful guide for hypothesizing direction. Petrie and Greenleaf (2012) provide a conceptual model that posits that social influences (e.g., peers, parents, other cancer survivors, healthcare providers) transmit societal body ideals, which are internalized by individuals and impact the development of thoughts and feelings about the body. Individuals experience negative body image to a greater degree when their bodies do not meet the ideals as conveyed by social influences (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012). For AYAs who have experienced body changes from cancer treatment are more likely to be discordant from societal ideals, leading to more negative body perceptions, thoughts, and feelings. Based on this model, body image is then related to several affective and behavioural consequences, including physical activity behaviours (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012). 2.7.3 Indirect Relationships Given that body image and social support are associated with numerous outcomes including increases in current and maintained physical activity behaviour (e.g., Brunet, Taran, et al., 2013; Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006; Schwartz, 2004) and physical activity has a multitude of health benefits for AYAs (e.g., B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Brunet et al., 2018; Wright, 2017), it is important to better understand the relationships among social support, body image, and physical activity within this unique population. Based on the literature and sociocultural model, the third aim of this research program is to test the relationships between social support, body image, and physical activity among AYAs. Furthermore, the third study will examine whether body image 21 may indirectly influence the relationship between social support and physical activity. Testing this relationship would be a novel and worthwhile aim with the ultimate goal of increasing physical activity and improving the health and well-being of AYAs. 2.8 Theoretical Summary The proposed program of research draws from the heuristic cognitive behavioural model of body image in oncology (White, 2000) and sociocultural perspectives (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012) to support the understanding of the relationships between body image, social support, and physical activity. After a life adversity occurs (i.e., cancer), White's model (2000) suggests that perceived or actual changes in appearance will predict changes in one's body schema, appearance investment, body ideals, and body perceptions, emotions, cognitions, and behaviours. Concurrently, sociocultural perspectives (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012) suggest that social influences can impact body perceptions, cognitions, and affect, which can in turn lead to changes in health behaviours (e.g., physical activity). Drawing from these theoretical and conceptual underpinnings, a figure of the proposed associations between social support, body image, and physical activity is depicted in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1.

The main purpose of this program of research is to better understand AYAs' body image, social support, and physical activity, with the main goal of improving physical activity engagement and experiences among AYAs. To achieve this purpose, three interrelated studies using quantitative and qualitative methodologies will be used. Study 1 is a scoping review study that will comprehensively review the current body image literature among AYAs and explore how body image is defined within these studies, as well as identify the theories, models, measures, and methods used to assess body image (Vani, Lucibello, Trinh, Santa Mina, & Sabiston, 2021). Study 2 will qualitatively explore AYAs' experiences transitioning back into physical activity after treatment, with a particular interest in how body image and social support impact this transition (Vani, Sabiston, Santa Mina, & Trinh, under review). Finally, Study 3 will examine the direct and indirect associations between social support, body image, and physical activity among AYAs (Vani, Sabiston, Trinh, & Santa Mina, in press). Taken together, the insights gained through the three interrelated studies may be used to inform future research and the development of strategies to improve physical activity experiences and increase physical activity engagement among AYAs.

CMS currently holds a Canada Research Chair in Physical Activity and Mental Health. Funding sources were not involved in the study design, data collection, analysis or interpretation, or the preparation of the manuscript for publication. 24 3.1 Published, Pre-Formatted Abstract Objective: Cancer and treatment can produce temporary or permanent body changes, which may affect the body image (BI) of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with cancer (AYAs). This evidence has not been comprehensively summarized. A scoping review was conducted to explore the available evidence on BI among AYAs and identify the definitions, theories, models, frameworks, measures, and methods used to assess BI. Methods: Databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO (via Ovid) and CINAHL and Gender Studies (via EBSCO) were searched to identify published studies from January 1, 2000 to November 25, 2019. Inclusion criteria were: qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methodology; at least one BI-related measure or theme; published in English; and majority of the sample between 13-39 years at diagnosis and a mean age at diagnosis between 13-39 years. Two authors screened the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles and data were extracted and summarized. Results: The search yielded 11,347 articles and 82 met inclusion criteria. Articles included 45 quantitative, 33 qualitative, and 4 mixed-methods studies. The majority of studies used cross-sectional designs, while BI definitions, theories, models, frameworks, and measures were varied. Studies explored descriptive, psychological, physical, coping, and social factors, with BI being described most often as an outcome rather than a predictor. Conclusions: Theory-based research that employs a holistic BI definition and uses longitudinal or intervention study designs or a qualitative methodology is needed to better understand the BI experience of AYAs and inform the development of strategies and programs to reduce BI concerns and increase positive body experiences.

Previous reviews within body image and oncology have concentrated on those diagnosed with breast cancer15,16 or were not focused on AYAs specifically.17,18 Further, prior reviews have included only one aspect of body image such as assessment,18 have not used a methodological search strategy,15,19 or were systematic reviews.16,17 Unlike the more restrictive literature syntheses using systematic reviews and meta-analyses, a scoping review methodology enables a broad knowledge synthesis because studies that have different methodological designs are included.20,21 Scoping reviews also provide insight into the predominant theories, models, measures, and methods used to study a given concept, and captures key concepts and types of evidence in a field of research.20,21 Conducting a scoping review on body image among AYAs would be useful to inspire new research areas to advance this field.20,22 Given the prevalent and ongoing body image concerns among AYAs, establishing a thorough understanding of body image among AYAs through a synthesis of the evidence is necessary to 26 inform research and practice. As such, the purpose of this scoping review was to explore and summarize the available evidence on body image among AYAs. Secondary aims were to examine how body image is defined and identify the theories, models, measures, and methods that are used to assess body image. Methods The protocol for this scoping review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P23) framework and was registered prospectively with the Open Science Framework on November 24, 2019 (https://osf.io/xp5fm/). This scoping review is reported in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews (Appendix A). Arksey and O'Malley's20 methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews as refined by Levac and colleagues24 and Peters and colleagues25 was followed. This framework organizes the review process into six stages: (1) identifying the research questions, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) study selection, (4) charting the data, (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results, and (6) consultation with stakeholders. Identifying the Research Questions The primary research question was: What evidence is available on body image among AYAs? The secondary research questions were: (a) How is body image defined? (b) What theories, models, and frameworks are used? (c) What methodologies are used? (d) Which measures are used to assess body image? Body image was operationalized as a multidimensional construct that includes positive and negative perceptions, cognitions, affect, and behaviors related to the body's appearance and function.2 Identifying Relevant Studies The following electronic databases were searched between January 1, 2000 (when the cancer-specific body image model was published1) and November 25, 2019: MEDLINE, Embase, and 27 PsycInfo accessed via Ovid and CINAHL and Gender Studies accessed via EBSCO. The first author (MFV) identified search terms through an iterative process whereby initial terms related to cancer and body image were used in two databases to identify additional key words and index terms.24,25 Experts in AYA cancer research (n = 4) were consulted on the search terms and subsequent modifications were made. Lastly, in consultation with an academic librarian, controlled vocabulary (i.e., MeSH in MEDLINE and PsycInfo, EMTREE in EMBASE, CINAHL Headings in CINAHL, Gender Studies Headings in Gender Studies) and key free-text terms were finalized and modifications for the search strategy were developed for each database.25 Relevant keywords included terms related to cancer (e.g., neoplasm, tumor) and body image (e.g., appearance, body concern). The search terms used for each database are in Appendix B. Reference lists of included studies were also manually searched. The inclusion criteria were: (a) qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methodology; (b) at least one body image measure (for quantitative studies) or theme relating to body image (for qualitative studies); (c) published in English; and (d) the majority (>50%) of the sample between 13-39 years at diagnosis and a mean age at diagnosis between 13-39 years.a This selected age range encompasses international definitions of AYAs.4,26-28 Theses and dissertations published in the selected databases could also be included. Exclusion criteria include: (a) non peer-reviewed (e.g., meeting/conference abstracts, editorials, commentaries) or review articles (e.g., systematic or literature reviews); (b) reporting findings not directly relevant to body image (i.e., studies that only examine objective body measures [e.g., weight, size], without examining body perceptions, thoughts, feelings, or behaviors); (c) exclusively studied similar constructs (e.g., physical self-concept, self-esteem) to body image without an assessment of body image; and (d) only reporting body image as inferred by others (e.g., nurses) without a self-report measure or qualitative method of body image completed by AYAs. Study Selection a Time since diagnosis was not restricted - studies that recruited individuals who were diagnosed as an AYA but were currently a survivor older than 39 years remained eligible. 28 The first author (MFV) performed the finalized search and the retrieved articles were imported into EndNote X829 where duplicates were removed. Two levels of study selection were used for the remaining articles using Covidence.24,30 For the first level of study selection screening, two reviewers (MFV, KML) independently screened titles and abstracts using the eligibility criteria. The reviewers met throughout the abstract review process to discuss issues that arose.24 Next, the same reviewers conducted a full-text review of the potential studies to screen for eligibility.20,24 Consistent with the scoping review framework,24 methodological quality was not evaluated when excluding articles. A third reviewer (CMS) helped resolve disagreements regarding article inclusion. Charting the Data The extracted data was charted to provide a descriptive summary of the results.20,24,25 MFV and KML extracted the data from each article, which included author(s), publication year, journal, country where data collection occurred, main study purpose, study design and methodology, population and sample size, body image definition, theory, framework, or model, body image measure(s) (if applicable), and a summary of the main findings. Study design was coded as cross-sectional, longitudinal, quasi-experimental, or randomized controlled trial. Qualitative articles were coded as qualitative with the data generation tool and mixed methods articles were coded with the data collection and generation tools. Collating, Summarizing, and Reporting the Results A descriptive numerical summary analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis were used to summarize the studies,20,24 including frequency of study designs, and study population characteristics.20,24 The thematic analysis provided an overview of studies, body image definitions, study designs and methods, samples, theories, models, and frameworks, body image measures, results from quantitative studies, results from qualitative studies, and results from mixed methods studies. Consultation with Stakeholders Finally, we conducted one-time stakeholder consultations to gain insight beyond what was reported in the literature. Consulting stakeholders is an important step in scoping reviews as it 29 involves collaboration through understanding the target audiences' perspectives and priorities, which is necessary to advance research and practice.20,24 Potential expert and organization stakeholders were identified through previous connections and web searches, while AYAs were identified through a list of those who had consented to be contacted for future research. Convenience sampling was used to recruit stakeholders via email. Stakeholders were eligible if they were an expert in body image and AYA cancer research, a community organization dedicated to AYAs, or AYAs diagnosed with cancer. Given our stakeholder purpose, method, and analysis, we aimed to have a final sample of at least six stakeholders.31 To account for potential non-response, we contacted 20 stakeholders. Of the 20 stakeholders contacted, seven participated. Preliminary findings presented as summaries within the results section headings were sent via email (see Appendix C for summary sheets). Participants were asked to comment on the findings by writing comments on the summary sheets. Prompts (e.g., \"please provide suggestions for future research and practice\") were also included to help guide this process. Stakeholder responses were analyzed using a content analysis32 whereby comments were grouped under the existing results section categories. This informal consultation allowed stakeholders to build on the findings, identify how the findings could inform research and practice, and provide greater meaning and perspective to the results.24 Results The database search identified 17,561 records. Following the removal of duplicates, 11,347 title and abstracts were screened for eligibility. After title and abstract screening, 1,661 papers were full-text screened. Initially, confirmation of inclusion criteria was not possible for 43 articles due to inaccessible full-texts (n = 36) or a lack of required information to determine eligibility (n = 7). Corresponding authors were contacted by email in an attempt to obtain the full-text article or missing information. MFV also submitted inter-library loan requests for the inaccessible full-texts. Author responses or successful inter-library loan requests resulted in 32 articles to screen, of which five were included. The other 27 articles and the eleven articles (no full text: n = 7; lack of information: n = 4) for which we did not receive a response or library loan were excluded.b Overall, 82 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in this scoping review (see Figure b A list of the 38 articles is available upon request from the corresponding author. 30 3.1 for the PRISMA flow diagram). Interrater reliability between the screening authors was assessed at the title and abstract (92%) and full-text (98%) stages. Overview of Studies A summary of the included articles' study characteristics is available in Appendix D. The articles were published between 2001 and 2019 and the majority were published from 2010 onward (80.5%; n = 66). Approximately half (52.4%) were conducted in Europe (n = 43), 43.9% in North America (n = 36), 12.2% in Asia (n = 10), 3.7% in Australia (n = 3), and 2.4% in Africa (n = 2).c Study Design or Qualitative Method Most of the articles described quantitative studies (54.9%, n = 45), which used a cross-sectional (66.7%), longitudinal (17.8%, follow-up duration between 48 hours and three years), quasi-experimental (11.1%), or randomized controlled trial (4.4%, follow-up duration between three and six months) design. Thirty-three articles described qualitative studies (40.2%), which utilized interviews (78.8%), focus groups remaining articles described a mixed-methods study design (4.9%; n = 4) using interviews (individual or group) and surveys. Across study designs, 12 articles reported intervention or program studies with body image as a primary (n = 8) or secondary (n = 4) outcome.33-44 These studies described 11 unique interventions or programs focused on mindfulness and self-compassion (n = 3), body image and self-esteem (n = 3), exercise/physical activity (n = 2), social support (n = 2), psychosexual development (n = 1), resilience in stress management (n = 1), and general AYA-specific education and resources (n = 1), with two studies having multiple aims (e.g., mindfulness and c Of note, four articles were multi-country collaborations, and therefore, with each country (n = 13) from the collaborations included, the total percentage exceeds 100%. d Three studies used a combination of qualitative methods and therefore, with each data collection method (n = 4) included, the total percentage exceeds 100%. 31 social support). The interventions were delivered within single (n = 3) or multiple sessions (n = 8), with programs lasting a maximum of eight weeks (n = 5). They were mainly delivered in groups (n = 7) and in-person (n = 9) to participants during treatment (n = 4), post-treatment (n = 1), or a combination of the two (n = 6). Sample Altogether, 10,042 participants were included in the articles, with sample sizes ranging from one to 896.e Most articles included both males/men and females/women (56.1%; n = 46).f Of the remaining articles, more studies focused on females/women (35.4%; n = 29) compared to males/men (8.5%; n = 7). Many articles described sex and gender as binary constructs and few distinguished between sex and gender. The majority of articles (63.4%, n = 52) did not report race or ethnicity. Of the 30 articles that did report race/ethnicity, 22 (73.3%) reported that participants were mainly White, whereas 15 articles (50%) used an 'other' category to group races together. The participants' mean age at diagnosis ranged from 13.0 to 38.6 years (n = 51 articles did not report age at diagnosis). The participants' mean age at study recruitment ranged from 13.1 to 45.8 years (n = 7 articles did not report age at study recruitment). About half of the articles (48.8%; n = 40) used a sample comprised only of AYAs. In addition, the articles described samples that were diagnosed with cancer one week to 19.8 years prior to study recruitment or had completed treatment between five months and ten years prior to study recruitment (n = 33 articles did not report time since diagnosis or treatment). Most articles described samples with mixed diagnoses (52.4%; n = 43), while others included breast cancer (20.7%; n = 17), testicular cancer (7.3%; n = 6), sarcoma (6.1%; n = 5), blood e One study that used a textual analysis of blog posts did not have a sample size and therefore, was not included in this calculation. f For the purposes of this review, the terms sex (e.g., male, female) and gender (e.g., man, woman) are used in accordance with the original article cited to ensure accurate reporting. 32 cancer (6.1%; n = 5)g, gynecological cancer (4.9%; n = 4)h, thyroid cancer (1.2%; n = 1), and melanoma (1.2%; n = 1). In addition, the articles included participants who were off treatment (36.6%; n = 30), a mix of off and on treatment (30.5%; n = 25), on treatment (11.0%; n = 9), or did not report treatment status (22.0%; n = 18). Body Image Definition Only thirteen articles (15.9%) provided a definition of body image. Eight articles described body image as multi-dimensional, multi-faceted, complex, or dynamic. Numerous components of body image were provided in the definitions, such as cognitive (n = 13), affective (n = 8), perceptual (n = 5), and behavioral (n = 1) components. Various aspects of the body were commonly mentioned including, appearance (n = 11), function (n = 9), size (n = 2), sensations (n = 2), and the body in general (n = 3). Theories, Models, and Frameworks Most studies did not report a theory, model, or framework (n = 69). The remaining 13 studies identified 13 unique theories, models, or frameworks. Three articles used explicit body image theories including objectification theory,45 social comparison theory,46 and the theory of stigma and social identity.47 The other ten articles reported theories, models, or frameworks that are not specific to body image (e.g., posttraumatic growth,48 resilience in illness model,49,50 integrative biopsychosocial model51). Body Image Measures Sixty-four body image measures were used across the 49 quantitative and mixed method studies. The most commonly used measures were the Body Image Scale52 (n = 9), the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire53,54 (n = 4), and the Body Image Instrument55 (n = 3). Body image was also assessed using subscales or items from quality of life measures (n = 10), including the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory-Cancer Module56 (n = 3) and the Minneapolis- g Blood cancer diagnoses included lymphoma and leukemia. h Gynecological cancer diagnoses included ovarian, cervical, vulvar, and uterine cancer. 33 Manchester Quality of Life Instrument57 (n = 2). Other questionnaires used to assess body image (n = 12) included symptom assessment tools (e.g., Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool58) and scales assessing psychosocial impact (e.g., Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System - psychosocial scale59) and scars (e.g., Impact of Scars and Cosmesis60). Finally, study-specific measures (n = 13) included questionnaires that assessed areas such as body image anxiety and concerns toward physical appearance changes. Six articles used modified scales with three making cancer-specific modifications (e.g., tailoring questions to cancer survivors), and five articles used single-item measures. Within qualitative and mixed method articles, body image was mainly investigated using semi-structured interview guides (n = 25; 67.6%). Questions often centered on AYAs' general experiences post-treatment or asked participants about their body changes, body image, and appearance. Results from Quantitative Studies Among the 45 quantitative studies,12,34,35,37-39,41-44,61-95 body image was an outcome in 32 studies (71.1%), a predictor in eight studies (17.8%), and was included only descriptively in three studies (6.8%). The remaining two studies (6.7%) did not identify the type of variable body image was. In nine articles (20.0%), the percentage of respondents reporting body image concerns or body changes ranged from 17% to 63%.63,66,68,75-78,86,92 One article noted that body image was the second highest unmet need in testicular cancer survivors (27.6% of survivors reporting an unmet need).64 Seventeen (37.8%) articles explored the relationships between body image and descriptive (e.g., age, cancer type), psychological (e.g., quality of life, depression symptoms), physical (e.g., physical activity, fatigue), and social (e.g., social activity engagement) factors. An overview of relationships is presented in Table 3.1. Among the studies that reported effect sizes (n = 14), adjusted odds ratios ranged from 0.47-15.5368,74,82,86,92 and correlation coefficients ranged from 0.20-0.8265,75,77,79,85 for the associations with negative body image and correlation coefficients ranged from 0.26-0.95 for the associations with positive body image.61,62,81,104 Twenty-seven (60%) articles examined group differences in body image (see Table 3.2). Notably, among the articles that presented significant body image improvements from pre-post intervention/program,34,35,37,39,42 interventions were delivered within single (n = 1)39 or multiple sessions (n = 4),34,35,37,42 individually (n = 2)35,39 or in groups (n = 3),34,37,42 and in-person (n = 4)35,37,39,42 or online (n = 1).34 Of the three studies that reported effect sizes, one 34 reported Cohen's d = 1.3934, one reported unadjusted odds ratio = 2.0-2.193, and the third study reported adjusted odds ratio = 1.9582. Results from Qualitative Studies Among the 33 qualitative studies,33,96-127 all findings were expressed as themes or categories. The number of themes ranged from two to twelve, and at least one theme focused on body image. Within the five studies that quantified body image changes, 23.5 to 88.4% of AYAs reported changes to their bodies.97,99,103,115,120 Appearance changes included hair loss, weight change, scars, body part removal, prosthetics, motor functioning change, and stretch marks, among others. The body changes that AYAs most commonly reported were hair loss, scars, and weight change. In one article hair loss was described as worse for women when compared to men.110 AYAs that reported appearance changes described themselves as less attractive and confident, more self-conscious, ugly, disfigured, like a creature, foreign, sick, and not normal. Of note, some AYAs expressed that appearance changes were more concerning and damaging than any other aspect of cancer and cancer treatment.123,125 Participants in four studies reported an improvement in body image over time (i.e., several months to over five years post-treatment),33,111,124,125 while AYAs in one study noted the persistence of body image issues over time (i.e., five years post-treatment).123 AYAs from two studies described exercise and sport helped to facilitate improvements in body image by helping them feel increased body acceptance, physical control, and connected to their body.33,124 In contrast, body image problems persisted for some even when coping strategies were used.123 Body changes contributed to numerous negative experiences pertaining to psychological, social, and coping factors. Within 26 articles, participants described psychological body image outcomes.96,97,99-103,105-112,116-126 Studies reported that AYAs who experienced body changes worried about what others would think or say about them if they saw their body changes (n = 12), felt that they lost their identity or experienced a change in identity (n = 10), expressed that body changes were distressing (n = 7), made them feel less feminine/masculine (n = 5), were constant reminders of their cancer (n = 5), and reduced their sexual attractiveness (n = 3). Further, studies reported that changes to AYAs' bodies led them to become preoccupied with their appearance (n = 2), feel a loss of control (n = 3), guilt for caring about their bodies when they had survived cancer (n = 1), and led them to make upward social comparisons (n = 1). 35 When hair began growing back and weight stabilized, AYAs described that these were signs that they were 'returning to normal' (n = 2). Eleven articles reported social outcomes related to body changes.96,99,100,110,112,118,122-126 AYAs described receiving negative attention and comments from others that made them feel shocked, hurt, self-conscious, and distraught (n = 6). Body changes also had a negative impact on social interactions as the changes made AYAs feel unsure and insecure about relationships and social interactions (n = 4). Furthermore, some studies described that AYAs reported feeling different from others (n = 5) and alienated or isolated (n = 2). Appearance management (n = 11) and avoidance (n = 5) coping strategies that AYAs used to cope with cancer and treatment-related changes to their body were also noted.100,106,108,110,112,114,118,120,122-126 Appearance management strategies included concealing the body, face, and hair using clothing, makeup, wigs, scarves, hats, and hair extensions. AYAs also cut their hair short or shaved their head to take control of their inevitable hair loss. Further, AYAs reported avoiding events or social situations where others may see their body, such as school, social events, leisure and physical activities, and the beach. Although negative experiences related to body changes were described among most participants in the qualitative studies, some studies reported that AYAs expressed neutral (n = 5)103,108,110,111,113 or positive (n = 15)33,38,106,108,109,111,112,115,118,120,121,123-126 experiences and outcomes. A few AYAs reported being unbothered by body changes or described that they did not experience visible signs of treatment. Other AYAs expressed an appreciation, confidence, satisfaction, and pride for their body changes, partly facilitated by supportive others, including family members, friends, and romantic partners. AYAs described their body image needs within five articles.114,122,123,125,126 AYAs noted the need for age-specific information at diagnosis and prior to treatment to prepare them for the body changes that would occur. They also described the importance of being treated with similar aged peers so they could see similar others and speak to them about their body image concerns. Further, AYAs desired tips on how to manage a changing appearance and support to deal with negative consequences. They preferred that doctors begin the conversation around body image and provide a safe space for discussions, with a distanced option using technology. Results from Mixed-Method Studies 36 Among the four mixed-method studies,36,40,128,129 two aimed to obtain information from participants regarding topics such as emotions, body image, and sexual difficulties,128,129 while the others examined AYA programs.36,40 Integration was used at the study design level whereby exploratory,36 explanatory,40,129 and convergent parallel128 designs were used. Additionally, at the methods level, integration was achieved through building36 or merging40,128,129 the data. Overall, the authors reported limited significant quantitative results, however qualitatively, body image was a theme in two studies40,129 and was described within two themes in the other two studies.36,128 Descriptively, 70% of testicular cancer survivors reported body image problems. The qualitative findings added context whereby testicular cancer survivors reported feeling self-conscious and anxious about whether others would notice their missing testicle and explained how they felt different from others.129 Comparably, 88% of AYA patients reported that cancer affected their body image, yet within interviews, AYAs revealed that body image was not typically addressed by their providers.128 Group differences were examined in one study that reported no significant changes in body image from baseline to after a mindfulness and social support program.36 Yet qualitatively, AYAs who completed the program described feeling excited about being able to discuss body image changes with other AYAs. Further, after a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program that demonstrated significant quantitative changes in psychosocial outcomes, young adults qualitatively described finding a new appreciation for their body and saw themselves as beautiful again.40 Stakeholders Seven stakeholders (i.e., body image researchers [n = 2], AYA organization personnel [n = 2], and AYAs [n = 3]) provided virtual feedback about the findings. A concern expressed by stakeholders was that body image is defined mainly from the researcher's perspective and not the AYAs themselves. Stakeholders commented that a broad multi-dimensional body image definition was necessary and that AYAs should be included in defining body image. Notably, when discussing body change findings from the articles, an AYA stakeholder reported, \"It's bad enough that my body is trying to kill me but now it needs to look significantly different too?\" This quote highlights the significance of body change to AYAs. This AYA also reported that their strong social support network was key during this time. Meanwhile, another AYA described the need for greater support and tailored programming for men. Furthermore, while 37 AYAs acknowledged the importance of physical activity for their health and body perceptions, they expressed that being active was difficult as it highlighted their loss of body function and physical side effects. AYA stakeholders acknowledged the inadequate support for body image changes and associated concerns, and expressed that more information on body change management and peer support opportunities was needed for AYAs. Relatedly, AYA organization personnel reported not having the tools to properly support AYAs' body image concerns and communicated a need for body image coping strategies to disseminate to AYAs. They felt that the development and distribution of these strategies should be considered in future work. Finally, body image researchers described a need for greater experimental and longitudinal research to quantify experiences expressed in qualitative interviews and demonstrate causal relationships between various factors and body image within AYAs. Discussion This scoping review summarized the available evidence across 82 articles on body image among AYAs. The way body image was defined across the studies was identified, and theories, models, frameworks, measures, and methods used to study body image among AYAs were examined. This synthesis emphasizes the importance of providing AYAs with tools and strategies to navigate their body and body image changes. Furthermore, there is a need for future research and practice changes for optimizing AYAs' survivorship experience. Overview of Findings Within the studies included in this scoping review, body image was related to and discussed with descriptive, psychological, physical, coping, and social factors. Overall, body image findings were consistent with previous research, with negative body image being associated with or described in relation to negative factors (e.g., depression, pain, avoidance of social activities) and positive body image associated with or described in relation to positive factors (e.g., quality of life, sex life satisfaction, physical activity).11,14,130 When group differences in body image were examined, mixed findings were reported. Notably, significant body image improvements were demonstrated for interventions and programs that varied in delivery length (i.e., one session to eight weeks) and method (i.e., groups/one-on-one and in-person/online). Individual-level interventions and programs were mainly delivered in-person, aside from one online-based intervention that did not produce significant changes in body image.36 Thus, further examination 38 of the combinations of delivery lengths and methods for optimal body image improvements is needed, indicating an opportunity for conducting a future systematic review on body image interventions among AYAs. Although most studies reported that AYAs experienced body image concerns following treatment, it is worth noting that some AYAs described positive body experiences. Supportive others were described as instrumental in helping AYAs experience body confidence, pride, and appreciation. This was echoed by some stakeholders wherein having a strong social support network was influential in navigating body changes. In addition, some interventions and programs that were group-based helped increase body acceptance and appreciation,33,38,40 suggesting the usefulness of providing group-based AYA programs designed to foster positive body image. Clinical Implications and Future Research Directions The scoping review and stakeholder consultations provide implications for research and practice, and offer several avenues for future research (see Table 3.3 for a summary of the key implications and future directions). Most of the examined articles did not provide a body image definition and were atheoretical. This is concerning given that theory-based interventions are typically more effective than non-theory based interventions.131 Within the limited studies that reported a definition and/or theory, these definitions and theories were heterogeneous. We recommend that future researchers use or develop body image definitions and theories that incorporate positive and negative body image, the multiple body image dimensions, and appearance and functional features. Furthermore, the chosen body image definition and theory help to inform how the study operationalizes and measures body image by identifying important factors associated with body image and potential mechanisms for change. Thus, it is important for future researchers examining body image among AYAs to design theory-based studies that provide a holistic body image definition. When considering measurement, there was great variability in the self-report measures used. This is as to be expected given the varied sample (e.g., age, cancer type) across the included studies. However, future researchers are encouraged to use validated body image measurement tools that align with their research question(s), body image definition and theory, and intended sample characteristics. In addition, although there were numerous reported relationships between 39 variables and body image, these findings were limited and inconsistent across studies, demonstrating the research gaps concerning factors associated with body image. The majority of the quantitative studies were cross-sectional, demonstrating a need for longitudinal, quasi-experimental, and randomized controlled trials examining body image among AYAs to test causal associations between body image and associated factors. Furthermore, the current findings and stakeholder recommendations suggest that formative qualitative work (e.g., interviews, body mapping, arts-based inquiry) is needed with AYAs to develop and tailor body image interventions and programs. Only a few studies specifically explored men's body image, suggesting a need for more studies in this subpopulation of AYAs. The stakeholders identified that men would benefit from greater research and program opportunities, yet they are more difficult to involve in research and programs compared to women and therefore, it may be worthwhile to explore how to best involve men in men-specific interventions or programs. Importantly, it is necessary that researchers move beyond the binary operationalization of gender and use a two-step approach (i.e., ask participants about their current gender identity and their sex assigned at birth).132,133 Gender minority cancer populations tend to experience significant health disparities (e.g., later stage at diagnosis, quality of care),134 yet there is a large gap in our understanding of body image among gender minorities,135 with an even greater void among AYAs. A greater consideration of race is also needed. Studies included in this scoping review reveal that those identifying as non-White experience greater body image concerns compared to those that identify as White.93 In addition, Black breast cancer survivors, but not White survivors, reported difficulty looking at their undressed body in the mirror.98 These findings combined with stakeholders' recommendations, support the need for more body image research with Black, Indigenous, and People of Color. Although widely overlooked among the present studies, understanding the body image experiences of AYAs who identify as different sexual orientations is yet another necessary research aim. Furthermore, the intersectionality of race, gender, sexual orientation, and other demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status) and clinical (e.g., time since treatment) variables should also be considered. Our review highlights that hair loss, weight change, and scars are among the most commonly reported body changes for AYAs. Additionally, age-specific information at diagnosis and before treatment is desired by AYAs to prepare them for the body changes that would likely 40 occur.114,122,126 Stakeholders extended these findings by describing a need for information beyond listing potential changes and providing actionable information about how to manage these body changes (e.g., listing options to manage hair loss such as, shaving one's head prior to losing hair or wearing a wig/hat). This is aligned with our results wherein AYAs report a need for tips to manage an altered appearance.126 Thus, developing and testing a list of body changes as well as ideas for managing such changes in consultation with stakeholder groups (e.g., AYAs, healthcare providers) would be a worthwhile future research aim. AYAs also reported a preference for doctors to open a dialogue around body image,126 yet our findings revealed that healthcare providers did not typically address body image with their patients.128 Indeed, survivor stakeholders revealed that none of their providers spoke to them about body image. This lack of communication is concerning and highlights an important area for future research wherein researchers connect with AYAs to better understand which healthcare providers they would like to hear from, and speak with healthcare providers to uncover which providers feel equipped to integrate body image into their conversations with AYAs. Aside from healthcare professionals, peer support was described in the findings36,123,125 and in stakeholder consultations as a valuable resource for discussing body image concerns. It is important that AYAs are treated with peers of a similar age and life-stage, and that programs and interventions are designed with age and life-stage in mind. Additionally, peer-based programs (i.e., where peers deliver the program/intervention) might be especially useful in future program development for this age group. This will provide a safe space for AYAs to speak with others dealing with similar experiences about body changes and their associated thoughts and feelings. AYA organizations assist in creating safe spaces for body image focused discussions, however organization stakeholders wish to better understand how else they can support the AYA community. In particular, stakeholders reported a desire for coping strategies that can be shared with AYAs. Mindfulness interventions improved body image among AYAs,34,38,40 thus the further development and testing of mindfulness-based interventions and programs would be a useful direction for future research. Another potential avenue of future research is the interrelationship between physical activity and body image among AYAs. The findings provided evidence of this relationship, whereby greater physical activity is related to less negative and more positive body image,62,82 as well as reports of increased body acceptance following a group-based exercise intervention during 41 chemotherapy.33 Less is known about the effects of a group physical activity intervention on body image for AYAs who have completed treatment. Survivor stakeholders added complexity to the current findings, as they were aware of the importance of physical activity and its influence in changing body appearance perceptions. However, they also emphasized that being active is difficult given body function limitations associated with cancer and related treatment (e.g., pain, fatigue) as it makes their new physical limitations more apparent. Thus, the role of physical activity as it relates to and influences body appearance and function is in need of further elucidation among AYAs during and after treatment. Study Limitations Despite the contribution this scoping review provides to the study of AYAs' experiences, limitations to our study warrant consideration. First, given that the aim of scoping reviews are to provide a broad summary of the evidence, a quality assessment of the studies is not customary and was not conducted within this review. The absence of a quality assessment may be perceived as a limitation of scoping reviews. Secondly, given the authors' language competences, only articles written in English were included in the review. From our full-text review, 90 articles were excluded for not having an English version, suggesting the review may be limited in its breadth of understanding AYA body image across countries, cultures, and ethnicities. Thirdly, our review also excluded articles that only reported on similar constructs to body image (e.g., physical self-concept, self-esteem). This provided an intentional focus on body image, yet important and related work may have been excluded. Fourth, the heterogeneous treatment types and statuses across the sample precluded meaningful comparisons of on- vs. off-treatment body image experiences. Research study designs that take into account time-varying associations would be valuable for future research considerations. Fifth, although there are no established guidelines for stakeholder group sample sizes, our stakeholder section reflects seven of the many possible perspectives. Findings should be considered in light of this. Finally, given our broad inclusion criteria of sample, design, and factors related to body image, definitive conclusions are limited. Body image may differ across subgroups within the AYA age range. Thus, future research could consider assessing body image differences based on age or developmental groups. Conclusions 42 This is the first scoping review to focus on body image among AYAs using a broad inclusion of samples and study designs. The findings from this scoping review support the importance of better understanding body image among AYAs, which can be facilitated with more homogeneous and theory-derived approaches, and reinforce the need for age and life-stage specific strategies, interventions, and programs across the survivorship continuum for this unique population of survivors. Research priorities include developing and testing peer-based AYA programs designed to foster positive and functional body image, identifying the strategies most useful for improving body image, recruiting AYAs with intersectional identities, with a particular focus on minority groups, developing and testing a list of appearance and function changes and management tips, and identifying healthcare providers that feel equipped to initiate body image discussions with AYAs. When addressing these research and practice gaps and developing or tailoring interventions and programs, we recommend that researchers collaborate with AYAs and organization stakeholders to include numerous perspectives. Overall, this scoping review highlights the importance of supporting and deepening our understandings of body image among AYAs living with and beyond cancer.

Of the 82 studies that met inclusion criteria, most studies used cross-sectional designs and measures varied widely across studies. 2. Few studies defined body image and provided a theory, model, or framework to inform their study. Across the studies, body image was conceptualized as positive and negative, related to appearance and function, and covered the four dimensions. 3. Body image was related to and discussed with descriptive, psychological, physical, coping, and social factors. a. Negative body image was associated with or described in relation to negative factors (e.g., avoidance of social activities) b. Positive body image was associated with or described in relation to positive factors (e.g., physical activity) 4. Mixed findings were reported for group differences in body image and interventions and programs that produced significant changes in body image varied in delivery length and method. Based on the findings from this scoping review, there was a call for more formative qualitative work and to explore the relationships between physical activity and body image. In addition, AYA stakeholders acknowledged the importance of physical activity, yet they also expressed that treatment-related changes to their body's function were barriers to engagement in activity. As such, Chapter 4 presents a qualitative interview study that explores previously active AYAs' experiences transitioning back into increased activity after a period of lower activity during treatment. Further informed by Study 1, Study 2 explores how body image and social support impact activity after treatment. Finally, the interview guide includes questions that explored AYAs' appearance and body function and probed the multiple dimensions. 65 Chapter 4 Study 2 \"Your body is not at all where you left it\": Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors' experiences transitioning back into physical activity after treatment Study 2 is under review at Qualitative Health Research: Vani, M.

The purpose of this study was to explore adolescents and young adults (AYAs) experiences transitioning back into PA after a period of inactivity due to cancer treatment. Twelve previously active AYAs (Mage = 30 \u00b1 5.8 years) were purposefully sampled and engaged in a semi-structured interview. The following four themes were generated through a reflexive thematic analysis: (i) PA is described as important and valuable; (ii) \"your body is not at all where you left it\": navigating one's appearance and fitness changes after cancer treatment within the PA context, (iii) supportive care is essential to successful PA transitions, and (iv) juxtaposed environments: fitness facilities, cities, and green spaces. Developing strategies aimed at gradually transitioning into PA should be a priority to improve AYAs' well-being through survivorship. Keywords: adolescents; physical activity; oncology; qualitative interviews; young adults 67 4.2 Introduction Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) diagnosed with cancer are defined as those who receive a cancer diagnosis between the ages of 15 and 39 years (Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017). Physical activity (PA) is valuable during the survivorship trajectory wherein re-engaging in activity after treatment can be key to managing side effects, improving quality of life, and reducing recurrence and mortality risk (Adams et al., 2018; B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Brunet et 2017; al., 2019; Pugh et al., 2020). However, AYAs describe difficulties navigating the transition from a more sedentary lifestyle during cancer treatment to an active lifestyle after treatment (Wu et al., 2015), with approximately half of AYAs being insufficiently active after treatment (Adams et al., 2021; Barnett et al., 2016; B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Murnane et al., 2015). It is therefore important to understand AYAs' PA experiences post-treatment to help increase PA re-engagement. Since AYAs are in a life-stage where appearance is highly valued and social relationships are developing (Abrams et al., 2007; Epelman, 2013), body image and social support may be two especially important factors that impact this transition. Of particular interest, reported barriers to PA re-engagement after treatment among AYAs include body appearance and function changes and perceptions of low social support for PA (Brunet et al., 2013; Larouche & 2018; Smith-Turchyn et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2015). Meanwhile, high perception of social support is cited as facilitating AYAs' PA participation (Pugh et al., 2018; Rosenberg et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2015). Previous studies have used a quantitative design to explore social support (Brunet et al., 2013) or body image (Rosenberg et al., 2014), did not have a sole focus on PA (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006; Pugh et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2015), and did not explore body image and social support in detail (Pugh et al., 2018; Smith-Turchyn et al., 2020), limiting an in-depth understanding of how body image and social support influence PA re-engagement among AYAs. Given the complexity of the decision to re-engage in activity, a qualitative methodology may foster exploration of the nuances of the PA transition and better elucidate the role of body image and social support within AYAs' re-engagement efforts. Initiating PA after cancer treatment may be different between those who were previously active compared to those who were not. Previously active AYAs likely had an established exercise routine, may have differing expectations or goals for re-engagement, and may find treatment-68 related changes to their physical functioning especially troubling. In fact, one study qualitatively explored the effects of an exercise program during treatment using interviews with young adults' who described themselves as pre-cancer athletes (Adamsen et al., 2009). Findings demonstrated that pre-cancer athletes had distinct challenges with identity and body appearance and function changes that were improved by participating in the exercise program. However, less is known about the post-treatment experiences of AYAs who are navigating re-engagement into PA in the absence of a structured exercise program. To our knowledge, researchers have not explored how AYAs who were meeting activity guidelines (i.e., 90 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA per week; Campbell et al., 2019) prior to treatment navigate the transition of re-engagement in PA post-treatment. 4.2.1 The Present Study This qualitative interview study aimed to advance the existing literature by focusing on a subset of the AYA population who were active prior to their cancer diagnosis and to explore their PA transition experiences during the post-treatment trajectory. The primary research questions of this study were: (a) what are the experiences of previously active AYAs in their transition back into PA following cancer treatment?; and (b) do body image and social support play a role within the transition period? Understanding the experiences of this unique group of cancer survivors can provide valuable insight into the range of experiences that can influence the initiation and maintenance of PA after treatment. 4.3 Method 4.3.1 Philosophical Position A constructivist paradigmatic position was adopted, suggesting that AYAs each hold subjective perceptions of their experiences. We therefore focus on understanding the meanings that AYAs have created and attributed to their experiences (Guba & Lincoln, 1994; Lincoln et al., 2011). Aligned with constructivism, a relativist ontological position was held wherein we assumed that multiple realities exist, which are shaped by an individual's interpretation of their experiences within various social contexts (Lincoln et al., 2011). Further, ascribing to a subjectivist and transactional epistemology, we assumed that knowledge is created through researcher-participant transactions and understood that our own realities, views, and experiences cannot be detached 69 from the research process (Lincoln et al., 2011; Tamminen & Poucher, 2020). The researcher interacts with the participant in an attempt to understand their experiences from their point of view, lending to a co-construction of meaning (Davidsen, 2013). Consistent with constructivism, qualitative description was used as the strategy of inquiry and semi-structured interviews as the data generation tool to describe and interpret previously active AYAs' subjective experiences transitioning back into PA after treatment (Sandelowski, 2000). Qualitative description is well suited to address this research question as this approach can be used to provide a focused and rich description of AYAs' perceptions and experiences of a particular phenomenon, the post-treatment PA transition. Furthermore, given the clinical and practical relevance of this topic, qualitative description is fitting to inform practice and intervention development (Neergaard et al., 2009). 4.3.2 Participants Ethics approval from the appropriate research board ethics committee (#39245) was obtained. To recruit AYAs, the primary author (MFV) contacted general and AYA-focused organizations and survivorship programs across Canada via email. Supporting organizations distributed study information to AYAs using email and/or social media. The research team also shared the recruitment poster on their social media accounts. Interested participants who contacted MFV via email were provided with a screening questionnaire and a digital copy of informed consent. Eligibility criteria included: (a) a diagnosis of cancer between the ages of 15-39 years regardless of cancer type, stage, time since diagnosis, and treatments received, (b) ability to understand and speak English, (c) self-reported engagement in approximately 90 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA per week before cancer treatment, and (d) access to a computer and internet. 4.3.3 Data Collection All eligible participants were above 18 years of age, provided consent, and were scheduled for an interview and sent a self-report questionnaire. The brief pre-interview self-report questionnaire was used to collect information about the AYAs' demographics (e.g., age, relationship status), medical information (e.g., cancer type, treatments received), and PA information. Interviews were conducted by MFV, who at the time of the interviews was a doctoral candidate in exercise psychology, identifying as a White woman in her late-20s with no previous diagnosis of cancer 70 and had experience in qualitative, body image, PA, and cancer research. MFV reflected upon her positioning throughout the data collection and analysis phases. Virtual interviews (using Zoom) were conducted to abide by COVID-19 restrictions. Participants had the option of turning their video on. Interviews were conducted between September 1 and October 30 2020. Interviews were semi-structured and AYAs were first asked general questions about their PA history (e.g., \"Can you describe your PA behavior during treatment for cancer?\"). The PA transition period was defined for participants as any time following treatment when AYAs tried to or resumed activity. Next, the main questions explored (i) experiences transitioning back into PA (e.g., \"What, if anything, made it easy [difficult] for you to transition back into PA?\"), (ii) body-related experiences during their transition (e.g., \"How did your body's function, if at all, influence your PA transition?\"), and (iii) support from others during their transition (e.g., \"Tell me about the support you received from others during this PA transition\"). Finally, AYAs were also asked questions related to their opinions regarding the PA transition for cancer survivors in general (e.g., \"Based on your experiences, do you have any recommendations for smoothing this transition back into PA after cancer treatment?\"). The interview guide was pilot tested with one AYA (27 years old, White, leukemia diagnosis) for relevance, clarity, length, and comprehension. Revisions were not made to the interview guide based on the pilot interview and this interview was not included in the analysis. The semi-structured flexible interview guide provided researchers the opportunity to better understand the experiences of AYAs, while also allowing the responses of AYAs to shape the interview. Elaboration on participant's accounts was encouraged using prompts (e.g., \"How did that limit your willingness to be active?\"; \"Could you share an example of...?\"). Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim and then reviewed for accuracy. Immediately following the interview, MFV wrote notes on her thoughts and impressions to stimulate further consideration and organization of the interview data (Hermanowicz, 2002). Journaling was also used for self-reflexivity to challenge preconceived assumptions and acknowledge how her personal interpretations or characteristics may have affected the co-construction of meaning during the interview (Finlay & Gough, 2003). Participants were provided with compensation in the form of a $20 CAD gift card. 71 4.3.4 Data Analysis A reflexive inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview data, allowing for a flexible, iterative, and exploratory approach (Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2013, 2019). This approach is compatible with a constructivist paradigm and qualitative description, wherein AYAs' PA transition experiences are described in detail, staying close to the data, yet also providing low-inference interpretations (Sandelowski, 2000, 2010). The analysis followed the six-phases outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006). Following transcription, MFV read and re-read each transcript and listened to the associated audio recording to become fully immersed in the interview and atmosphere. This process facilitated a deeper familiarization of the meaning co-created in each interview. MFV noted her preliminary reflections and interpretations that were closely tied to the data. Next, the transcripts were reviewed and initial codes (latent and semantic) were generated by identifying interesting bits of data and repeated patterns. As novel codes were generated, prior transcripts were reviewed, and the list of codes was reorganized. NVivo 12 software was used to aid in the coding process (QSR International Pty Ltd, 2018). Following the generation of a comprehensive set of initial codes, similar meaning units were clustered to generate themes and subthemes. Each theme was then reviewed in conjunction with the transcripts and codes to ensure that the generated themes provided a detailed and rich understanding of AYAs' experiences and addressed the research questions. Specifically, each theme in conjunction with its associated codes and the transcripts were reviewed for consistency within themes and for uniqueness across themes (Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2013). A 'critical friend' who was distanced from the interview process then reviewed the first author's themes and interpretations (Smith & McGannon, 2018). The 'critical friend' provided feedback and alternate interpretations, which were discussed among the pair. Based on the discussions, themes were re-ordered and refined yielding a final set of themes and subthemes, which were named and defined. The themes were richly described using everyday language and illustrative quotes. Pseudonyms were assigned to participants to maintain anonymity. 4.3.5 Methodological Rigor Aligned with a relativist approach, quality criteria (i.e., worthiness of the topic, contribution of the work, and rigor) were applied throughout the research process (Smith & McGannon, 2018; Sparkes & Smith, 2014). First, MFV displayed quiet concern and used probes during the 72 interviews to encourage the opportunity for AYAs to provide detailed accounts of their experiences (Sparkes & Smith, 2009). Further, MFV continuously engaged in reflexivity throughout the research process through self-reflections and discussions with a critical friend (Smith & McGannon, 2018). This encouraged her to recognize and challenge her preconceptions so as to not limit her interpretations of AYAs' experiences and the meanings they ascribe to them (Sparkes & Smith, 2014). Finally, detailed descriptions of the themes and direct quotes from the transcripts were used for a rich and transparent illustration of the data (Smith & Sparkes, 2016). 4.4 Results Demographics for the 12 AYAs are presented in Table 4.1. AYAs were diagnosed with a range of cancer types (n = 8), with the most common diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4). The participants' self-identified gender was woman (n = 7) or man (n = 5). At the time of the interview, AYAs ranged from 20-39 years and time since treatment ranged from 2 months to 9 years. The interviews lasted 41 to 95 minutes in length (M = 55.96 minutes). Seven interviews were conducted with audio only. AYAs discussed a variety of experiences related to their post-treatment PA transition. Four themes were generated that demonstrate AYAs' experiences navigating this transition: (a) PA is described as important and valuable, (b) \"your body is not at all where you left it\": navigating one's appearance and fitness changes after cancer treatment within the PA context, (c) supportive care is essential to successful PA transitions, and (d) juxtaposed environments: fitness facilities, cities, and green spaces. The themes are presented in detail with illustrative quotes. 4.4.1 PA is described as important and valuable PA was described as essential for previously active AYAs, as exemplified through two subthemes: \"I would still workout on my last day - it's part of my identity\": The underlying value of PA through comparisons and \"I wanted that normalcy back into my life\": The use of PA to regain control and feel 'normal'. 4.4.1.1 \"I would still workout on my last day - it's part of my identity\": The underlying value of PA through comparisons Many AYAs felt that being active and athletic was part of their pre-cancer identity. Khalid (24, Hodgkin lymphoma), contemplated this athletic identity during treatment: 73 ...while I was on treatment I was talking to someone, like professionally and we kind of discussed it and we were kind of on the topic of if it was my last day, to live what would I do. And I realized I would still work out on my last day. That was sort of the joke - because it feels good...thinking about that too it's just reinforced like active lifestyle, it's part of my identity. After treatment, AYAs' body changes and associated reduction in abilities challenged their identity. PA was integrated into many AYAs' previously active life and being active was a way to feel closer to their former sense of self. For instance, John (39, testicular cancer) expressed: Being physically active, it's so much apart of my routines that I can't go without it, so I make time everyday to be physically active in whatever capacity that is and it's like brushing my teeth. Like I don't have to think about it, it's that worked in. John was a participant who described high commitment to PA, whereas many of the AYAs in the sample described some degree of identity loss or change. AYAs compared their current physical function abilities to their pre-cancer abilities, where they made upward comparisons that emphasized their reduced capabilities in terms of how intensely and how long they were able to be active. For Gabi (27, thyroid cancer), who was a former competitive rower and swimmer, working out at a higher intensity was part of her normal routine and identity. Gabi reflected on the contrast between her PA intensity pre- and post-cancer treatment, \"When you're just working out casually, it's a different kind of adrenaline feeling than when you're actually working out the way I used to. So I think I just miss that feeling.\" Similarly, Leah (24, Hodgkin lymphoma), who was a former competitive kayaker that trained for an average of 20 hours a week prior to her diagnosis, shared: I struggled a lot with it and I think mainly because since I was so active prior to being diagnosed and then went the complete opposite direction to not doing anything at all - I found the motivation really difficult and the fact that I couldn't just go out and do like a 6km run easily was very discouraging. So I think it's that, it's like 'well I know I'm capable of doing this and I used to be able to do this quite easily and now I can't'... 74 As emphasized in her account, Leah felt discouraged and demotivated when she compared her previous abilities to her current ones. These feelings were intensified because of her expectations for post-treatment PA, \"I think I expected to just hop right back into things and pretend life was OK again [laughs].\" The comparisons, in conjunction with PA expectations and a need to reconcile one's identity, impacted AYAs' motivation. As Nathan (24, brain cancer) describes: ...I felt more motivated to kind of get back to my high school self, where I actually had strength, I felt more proud of my body. And so, coming out of chemo, I wanted that again. And I had realized how weak I had become from chemo. So that was a big motivator to try to get my strength back. However, when AYAs engaged in activity, their physical shortcomings resulting from cancer became more apparent, which triggered lower motivation for some of them. This contrast was portrayed by Nathan, who further shared, \"...it was hard when I went to the gym at first, because I didn't have any strength left. So, I was doing such a little amount of weights [...] So, it was a little unmotivating seeing how weak I had become.\" Alternatively, Gavin's (27, testicular cancer) motivation was rooted in the pressure to surpass his previous strength given his belief that he was a better version of his previous self: \"...I have this whole kind of idea that I'm stronger because of this and like I'm a better person and a different person. So, for me personally I would like to surpass where I once was.\" Although rare, a couple of AYAs who were further out from treatment reflected on the progress they made in changing their expectations and reconciling their athletic identity issues. For Leah (24, Hodgkin lymphoma), a diagnosis of cancer was what caused retirement from her sport seven years ago and it took her awhile to come to terms with her new way of being active: I think not as much to keep up with what I used to be able to do. But um - just to have a routine and have that lifestyle where I do exercise regularly and feel good since it does, it can affect so many other aspects of life. But I don't have to go, I don't have to train like an athlete anymore and I know that now. [...] I think it took a year or so before I clued into that [pause] later after treatment. 75 Relatedly, Erin (36, breast cancer), who's treatment ended over two years ago, shared: ...I can't workout as hard. Or I don't want to push myself as hard as I used to before treatment. [...] [cancer] kind of made me re-shift like my thoughts on, you know what was good exercise and what was a healthy balance in life. The shift in expectations and views on PA helped AYAs have a more adaptable relationship with PA. Another way that AYAs adapted their relationship with PA was through engaging in activities that they previously enjoyed. For instance, April (32, Hodgkin lymphoma) shared that a main benefit of being active was \"getting to enjoy the same things after treatment that I loved before treatment, like long bike rides, you know. That's number one because it just makes you feel normal again. So that's really great.\" 4.4.1.2 \"I wanted that normalcy back into my life\": The use of PA to regain control and feel 'normal' A diagnosis of cancer and cancer treatment prompted AYAs to feel a loss of control and a drastic change in routine. The importance of PA was highlighted by participants' reports of using PA as a means of resuming normality, creating routine, and regaining control. For example, Erin (36, breast cancer) described why she felt engaging in PA immediately after treatment was crucial, \"...I think that physical activity is really important, like ongoingly and so, in the stages right after treatment, then you can start to build like a bit of a pattern for yourself, so that it stays a priority.\" Creating a routine through PA was a main way that participants regained control and felt closer to normal: I would say [PA]'s fairly important [...] It's a good way to feel good about yourself and also to feel like you're moving on more in life. Because you can finish treatment and then still take time off, but you will still feel like you're stuck in time, like when you were going through treatment. So, it was a good way to help show that you're doing something. It makes you feel good, because you're working towards something [emphasis]. It may be small, but it's something [emphasis]. And it's one great way to help you feel like you're moving on in life finally, after being stuck in time for so long. (Nathan, 20, brain cancer) Nathan touched on the importance of engaging in PA as a way to help him move on and engage in meaningful activities that made him feel good after treatment. This was especially important 76 for AYAs who were taking time off work or school as PA provided structure to their days and gave them purpose. For instance, Ryan (29, Hodgkin lymphoma) felt that having a PA schedule facilitated a bridge to his prior routine: But I think in terms of getting back to any sense of normalcy, that was the most important thing. And being able to get back physically feeling good and feeling energised. And feeling ready to take on a day and being able to get up at a normal hour, not sleeping 11 hours a day. [...] Those all come hand in hand with the activity. [...] You've got to get back with how the rest of the world is living. And that was the one thing I think it helped me get back to that routine. (Ryan, 29, Hodgkin lymphoma) Notably, in contrast to Nathan's language use of \"moving on\", Ryan, gave voice to the AYAs who felt that being active was a signal of hope indicating they were getting \"back to normal\" or back to \"life as it was before\". The need to regain control and normalcy was also exemplified when discussing mental health, as AYAs described using PA to ease their anxiety and fear of recurrence. For instance, April (32, Hodgkin lymphoma) shared, \"...for me, if I'm starting to feel really anxious I just know I have to go for a walk [...] it's my number one quick fix.\" Later in the interview, April went on to discuss the use of PA for managing fear of recurrence, \"You can kind of forget about your troubles and try and not be afraid that it's going to come back, you know, try and forget about those fears...\" Other AYAs underscored the importance of PA when they shared how they used PA to prevent the severity/occurrence of acute and late effects, recurrence, and secondary cancer. For instance, Khalid (24, Hodgkin lymphoma) shared: ...the goal is to do 30 minutes of [aerobic PA] so I can get blood flow going to my brain. I read this study when I was on treatment that people who exercise, cardio exercise for half an hour a day are able to, over a year increase their hippocampal volume by 1%. And the hippocampus is the thing responsible for memory and since my memory was taking a hit during the chemo I thought this would be perfect opportunity for me to exploit this. Meanwhile, Ryan (29, Hodgkin lymphoma) expressed that he exercised in an attempt to avoid future sickness, \"...so now I'm working on trying to get in better shape [...] to do everything I 77 can to minimize my chance of getting sick again. So I feel like that's an opportunity - it's at least some control I can have.\" Taken together, AYAs alluded to activity as a strategy to control or manage their routines and mental and physical health, and PA contributed to feeling like they were resuming normality. 4.4.2 \"Your body is not at all where you left it\": Navigating one's appearance and fitness changes after cancer treatment within the PA context AYAs experienced body appearance (e.g., scars, hair loss, body part removal, stretch marks, bloating), physical function (e.g., muscle atrophy, fatigue, diminished cardiovascular functioning, pain), and weight (i.e., weight loss, gain, cycling) changes resultant from cancer and associated treatments. Overwhelmingly, AYAs described feeling unrecognizable, displeased, and disconnected from how they thought their body should look and feel, which impacted their PA experiences and behaviour. Within this broader theme, two sub-themes were generated: \"I held back or I didn't participate\": Body appearance and function changes impacted PA behaviour and experiences and \"I could admire my muscles and take my mind off the scars\": Being physically active as a means to change one's body. 4.4.2.1 \"I held back or I didn't participate\": Body appearance and function changes impacted PA behaviour and experiences Changes to AYAs' appearance and physical function impacted their ability or willingness to initiate and maintain a transition back into PA after treatment. Especially in the short-term, AYAs found that their physical limitations posed as a barrier to engagement. Discussing post-surgery recovery, Gavin (27, testicular cancer) stated, \"From a physical standpoint it was pretty tough, because you're all sore and your muscles are all tight and you've been lying in bed for a while...mechanically it's tough to get back into running or any physical activity right away.\" Khalid (24, Hodgkin lymphoma) also had difficulty re-engaging: \"I was pretty much inactive for a while. Like a while [emphasis], like a long time. I couldn't even move without getting nauseous actually. So that must have been for weeks...\" As illustrated by Gavin and Khalid, changes to physical function and capacity acted as obstacles when contemplating or attempting re-engagement. 78 The reduction in functional capacity also decreased AYAs' confidence to perform PA. April (32, Hodgkin lymphoma) shared, \"...I joined the gym, sometimes it was hard to go - because it was like, 'OK, I'm going to go the gym and not be able' - you know, for a person my age, I'm going to feel completely incompetent and helpless...\" Elaborating on this, Mika (34, colon cancer) who was treated with chemotherapy, provided an example of when she felt less confident in her abilities, \"I feel that my stability, it's not the same. I'm not feeling comfortable with...if it's hiking on the trail, I'm not comfortable with going down or going up or going on a narrow path like I was before.\" While April highlighted that her age did not match perceptions of her physical competence, Mika compared her current abilities to her previous ones in activity. Both descriptions underscore the unique experiences for previously active AYAs. Many AYAs described how they responded to their physical function limitations. Erin (36, breast cancer) recognized her physical limitations and reframed the expectations she held for herself, \"I couldn't push myself but it doesn't mean I couldn't do the activity. That I can still do the same activities, but just have to reshape how far I can push myself in them.\" Ryan (29, Hodgkin lymphoma) also found that he couldn't exercise as intensely as he previously had, but had a harder time managing the inability of engaging in higher intensity PA, \"In terms of endurance, the asthma and the lung problems that I've developed have definitely been frustrating. That's the one annoyance. I used to like to play tennis in the summers and I can't really do that anymore.\" While Erin and Ryan discussed reductions in intensity, Nathan (20, brain cancer) found that he couldn't workout for as long and had to change how he structured his workout, \"...if I were to do my hour workouts - I'd have to space it out, take rests, drink a lot more water. And yeah, I find I breathe a bit heavier.\" And so, some AYAs had to change the type, intensity, and duration of their activities due to their physical side effects. Changes in physical function caused some AYAs to feel embarrassed to engage in PA in public settings. For some, they went so far as to hide their physical limitations, as exemplified by Lauren (36, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma): So you know, it was hard because people don't see you for what you've been through sometimes so they have no idea what you're having a hard time with and think \"Oh can't you come do this or why?\" You know? And then you have to explain \"No, I'm not capable of that or that's too much for me.\" So sometimes because of those situations I think I held 79 back or I didn't participate whether it was a really big hike or volleyball, stuff like that. Anything that I really had to put my body forward for, I kind of tried not to do. Emily (32, leukemia, skin cancer) further highlighted the unease AYAs had with displaying their physical limitations in front of others: I just felt puffy and uncomfortable in my clothes and it was hard to move and keep up with people, because I was always winded. So...if I'm always winded, it's not something I want people to see, it's embarrassing. So...I would tend to shy away from things... When Emily engaged in PA, such as walking with her friends at school, she hid her limitations: ...technically I wasn't supposed to use the stairs, I still did. Because I didn't want people to know that I was limited. [...] but I'd be tired by the time we got there. I'd be sweaty and gross. But I'd hide it, because I didn't want people to know. Appearance changes also impacted AYAs' PA experiences, with some avoiding or disengaging from public activities. Gavin (27, testicular cancer) considered whether he would have attended the gym after surgery if it were not closed due to the COVID-19 lockdown: ...if the gym was open, I wouldn't feel ready going...I wouldn't feel comfortable. Because I lost a lot of weight after the surgery...and I was still dealing with the newness of the scar. So, I'd feel a little insecure going to a gym right away. Meanwhile, Lauren (36, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma) discussed how her appearance changes impacted her avoidance of certain activities where her body would be on display: ...friends you know going and playing beach volleyball and they want me to play...But I can't play because I would have to be running around and they could see my body jiggling and if my scar doesn't look nice then I don't want them to look at it [...] it just stops you...you want to kind of do some of these things, but then you can't [choking up] because your brain gets in the way...it's definitely stopped me from doing all sorts of fun things because I haven't been confident enough or too insecure or self-conscious. 80 In addition, Lauren's self-consciousness also impacted her disengagement from swimming at an aquatic center, \"being in a bathing suit and just feeling really gross [emphasis] in my body is probably what stopped me from going back.\" In contrast, some AYAs described that due to the nature of the activities they engaged in, their appearance changes (e.g., scars, weight gain) were hidden, which made them more willing to participate in PA in public. For instance, Erin (36, breast cancer) stated, \"...if I was wearing a bathing suit, then it might have impacted my return to activity. But most activities that you do, you're just in random clothes, so it doesn't matter.\" Nathan (20, brain cancer) described a similar stance, \"I'm not walking around shirtless at the gym. So [various PA] don't bother me.\" These comments underscore that participating in activities where the body is not on display yields greater comfort and engagement among AYAs. Overall, physical function and appearance changes were barriers to participating in PA after treatment, and when AYAs did participate, many worried about how their bodies looked and performed in front of others. 4.4.2.2 \"I could admire my muscles and take my mind off the scars\": Being physically active as a means to change one's body PA was used to \"offset the damage to what the cancer did\" (Gavin, 27, testicular cancer). AYAs revealed that they engaged in activity for body function or appearance reasons, with most participants describing appearance as the key motivator for initiating activity. For instance, Mika (34, colon cancer) shared: How to accept myself again...how to know my body again, because it's changed, it's different now. So I feel that through sport and through physical activity, I have more chances to reach my previous body again...I was never a sportswoman or a professional athlete, but...I was active...So I believe that physical activity will help me to reach my old self again or even improve me better. [...] I am willing to participate in physical activity because of the weight gain, because I'm trying to stop gaining kilos. When discussing appearance, many AYAs described engaging in PA to control or change their weight. Specifically, participants used PA to lose weight (\"I gained a little bit of weight. So, just to, you know, trim down and look at yourself in the mirror and kind of be proud\"; Gavin, 27, testicular cancer), avoid weight gain (\"...noticing the continuous weight gain so to try to keep 81 that off\"; Leah, 24, Hodgkin lymphoma), maintain weight (\"I'd like to maintain being at the weight I'm at now\"; John, 39, testicular cancer), and/or increase muscle mass (\"I'm working on muscles [...] try to get my strength back up\"; Nathan, 20, brain cancer). Adding complexity, a treatment-induced weight change was a motivating factor for participation, yet weight changes also made it more difficult to engage in PA, \"...you know [weight gain] encourages you to be more active, but also weighing more means you can't do some of the things that you used to do in the same way\" (Erin, 36, breast cancer). Some AYAs described a desire to use PA to change their bodies as a means to get \"in shape\" and be attractive and desirable to others. Mika (34, colon cancer) stated, \"I'm a woman and I would like to look great, so [laughs] I need to be in shape.\" John (39, testicular cancer) shared, \"Being a guy, there was a part of me that was thinking, I'd like to get back to the gym, because I want to get back in shape, because I'd like to meet somebody new.\" John went on to say, \"I like how things look when I look in the mirror. I like getting compliments from women.\" Gavin (27, testicular cancer) also discussed appearance and attractiveness: ...to attract women, it's important for me to I guess be in good shape. It's just one of those things, like it's good...for my romantic potential [...] it just shows that someone can take care of themselves or put effort into taking care of themselves. Success in the transition back to PA was often defined as changes in appearance (e.g., growing observable muscle) and function (e.g., feeling stronger). During treatment, April (32, Hodgkin lymphoma) noticed changes in her muscle mass, which left her feeling uncomfortable: I did notice that a lot of my muscle kind of melted away when I was on treatment. And so...I felt uncomfortable after because there was just so much fat and not a lot of muscle. And...I don't know if you've ever had that experience but your body parts rub together and you just feel uncomfortable all the time, right? As a result of April's discomfort, feeling successful in PA was in part defined as increasing her muscle mass and losing fat, \"...feeling that fat change back into muscle was a great feeling. I just started to feel much more comfortable as time went by...and then you can do more things, you feel happier too.\" Other participants echoed this feeling of success through weight loss, including Ryan (29, Hodgkin lymphoma) who expressed: 82 ...I didn't like that I couldn't wear my old clothes...that I was using a different belt than I was using before. [...] I didn't like feeling bloated...I just felt uncomfortable in my skin and I felt physically uncomfortable all the time. And so it was nice to get rid of that feeling...I think that's both a vanity standpoint and...getting your body back to kind of the shape it was before. [...] I can fully appreciate how silly it sounds, when you have a life threatening illness or whatever and you just went through that. But it's kind of like once you're done with that, then you kind of want things back to how it was. AYAs assessed their body changes by the physical feeling of their body, assessing how their clothing fit, viewing their body in a mirror, and taking pictures to measure observable change over time. For instance, Nathan (20, brain cancer) took pictures once a week and described his reasoning for doing this, \"...without [progress pictures], then I wouldn't be able to look back on it. I wouldn't see the progress change from where it was at initially to where I'm at...it helped my mind know that what I'm doing is actually changing stuff.\" For Nathan, and many other AYAs, observing and feeling the difference in their bodies was crucial to feeling accomplished in their PA efforts. AYAs also felt that seeing changes in their body's appearance and composition helped them cope with other observable body changes: I guess I didn't like that I was all scarred up and missing a testicle and that's also kind of why I liked working out afterwards, because I could get into good shape and I could really like - [laughs] it sounds a bit vain - but I could admire my muscles...and take my mind off of the scars. (Gavin, 27, testicular cancer) AYAs shared that activity-related body changes triggered positive thoughts and emotions. Emily (32, leukemia, skin cancer) described her feelings regarding her weight loss: ...because of the walking, I've recently lost about 50 pounds, so it's actually making me feel more confident, more energetic. I feel lighter, just both mentally and physically and I just, it makes me feel better about just what the future could hold, when I do physical activity. Because I'm not out of energy when I do it now. Although AYAs reported appearance and weight change goals extensively throughout the interviews, it is important to note that other functional changes were also valued (e.g., activity-induced improvements in energy and cognitive functioning). Khalid (24, Hodgkin lymphoma) 83 stated, \"...it wasn't really about looking good, it was about the exercise, 30 minutes a day, the cardio, to get that memory to ward off the cognitive stuff. That was the kind of priority for me.\" 4.4.3 Supportive care is essential to successful PA transitions AYAs expressed a need for supportive care in facilitating their transition back into PA, as illustrated through the subthemes: Do it yourself: Personal advocacy is needed to receive advice and Active connections: The critical role of others in supporting the PA transition. 4.4.3.1 Do it yourself: Personal advocacy is needed to receive advice AYAs described feeling too depleted to initiate PA alone, expressing a need for greater PA support. They explained feeling emotionally and physically tired after treatment, which contributed to a lack of motivation: So, it's kind of like getting back that independence and having to do things yourself and you're no longer a patient, if you will, but you're still tired and exhausted. [...] I was just exhausted from it. I was exhausted from the doctors' appointments...from being sick...from testing, I was exhausted - I was just burnt out from the whole experience. And so I found it was hard to want to get motivated. (Ryan, 29, Hodgkin lymphoma). Likewise, Lauren (36, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma) extended these sentiments and spoke how she was not prepared to create or enact a PA transition plan alone: ...my body was destroyed essentially, so to try and bring it back is so much work, but I didn't have the mental capacity or the motivation. [...] I had to do it myself. So I didn't do anything for years and years and years. Lauren further underscored the paucity of healthcare provider support, which compounded the barrier of motivation, \"So, I feel like not getting guidance from the doctors [...] was part of what was challenging because I really just felt like I was alone by myself in trying to figure it out.\" This feeling of lonesomeness in navigating the transition was shared among many AYAs, whereby participants discussed a lack of support and advice from healthcare providers. For instance, Gabi (27, thyroid cancer) acknowledged the termination of support and expressed confusion around the lack of PA support from her healthcare providers: 84 ...my oncologist, my radiation oncologist, it was almost like after they had done their jobs that was pretty much it [...] I think it's important that the doctors actually say something...going back to my oncologist and he's a bad ass. [...] he's such a good doctor. And he never ever mentioned physical activity and I'm just like - I just don't know why. AYAs were surprised that their healthcare providers did not discuss PA with them. The lack of support around PA forced many AYAs to take the initiative to seek out resources and advice from healthcare providers. When AYAs sought advice, the information received was inconsistent and oversimplified leading to confusion. For instance, Mika (34, colon cancer) was eager to get active after surgery, yet she was concerned about her limitations so she asked for advice from her healthcare team and received ambiguous and non-specific answers: I was trying to speak with my family doctor but their best advice was to do whatever feels good for me [...] The oncology team, they told me that there's no limitation. [...] The surgeon [laughs] was the most specific. He said that because of the surgeries, I shouldn't lift weight, I shouldn't do too much, not to push my muscles too much. So I was trying to read articles online, to search on social media. Due to the varied and one-off advice, Mika turned to social media, and over two years later she remained unsure about her limitations and was afraid to engage in PA that may be unsafe for her. In addition, some AYAs felt that the advice they received was incompatible with their age and views of the self. As Ryan (29, Hodgkin lymphoma) described: ...I was maybe hoping for a bit more resources from [hospital]. [...] just everything in the occupational therapy and returning to work felt aimed at people 20 years older than me. And I felt it wasn't really aimed for people that were coming from a good place. Not a good place, but like a good state of physical being and just wanting to get back to where they were and want to do things a little faster. A lack of consistent and ongoing age- and ability-specific information heightened AYAs' feelings of isolation. 85 On the rare occasions where healthcare providers initiated PA conversations, it was focused on the medicalization of exercise (e.g., to manage physical side effects) and did not cover the psychosocial benefits of engaging in PA after treatment. For example, April (32, Hodgkin lymphoma) experienced blood clots as a rare post-treatment complication, which led her doctor to recommend PA: ...one of the doctors...basically came and sat down and...you know when they look at you and they're like you better listen, right? And he said to me 'OK, [name] I need you to know if you don't want this to happen again you need to stay active your whole life, you can't be a couch potato ever.' So I was 'OK [cautious voice]', you take that really seriously, so that was the biggest advice I got was stay active no matter what. April, and Khalid who recounted receiving direction on PA for combatting potential treatment side effects, described that it encouraged ongoing participation motivated by concerns around future sickness. Healthcare providers also provided unsolicited advice on PA based on AYAs' weight. For instance, Khalid (24, Hodgkin lymphoma) shared, \"[nurses and physicians] were like 'if you don't want to do it [PA], it's fine'. Very kind of, complacent on that aspect. [...] They didn't want me losing weight...\" Khalid's doctors were concerned about weight loss, and therefore did not encourage PA. In contrast, Emily (32, squamous cell carcinoma) received recurrent unwelcomed instruction from healthcare providers: Doctors never give you advice about physical activity, they just literally say you need to lose weight. And I'm like no shit ... I know that, this is not news to me [...] ...my weight 100% had a factor in them telling me to work out. Emily's experience was unique among the AYAs we spoke to and highlights the pervasiveness of weight stigma in medicine. Without the provision of proper assistance or resources, Emily was left feeling badly about herself, bitter towards healthcare providers, and isolated in her PA transition. Overall, the isolation of re-engaging in PA was prominent through AYAs' narratives. For those that did receive advice, information, or direction, they found it to be inadequate or caused them to feel negatively, uncertain, and lonesome. 86 4.4.3.2 Active connections: The critical role of others in supporting the PA transition AYAs who were able to access the support of exercise professionals (e.g., trainers, physiotherapists, physiatrists, kinesiologists) described them as helping them feel comfortable and capable of re-engaging and maintaining PA after treatment, \"...I don't think I could have done [transition back into PA] without having the trainer\" (Ryan, 29, Hodgkin lymphoma). AYAs expressed a desire to be educated on their limitations and abilities by professionals who were equipped to support cancer survivors. Exercise professionals filled this role by providing informational support, which was useful after treatment (Table 4.2). However, the AYAs had varied opportunities to connect with professionals and emphasized the importance of having access to exercise professionals (Table 4.3). Family, partners, and non-cancer peers provided esteem support through encouragement to engage in PA and/or engaged in PA with the AYA, emotional support through unconditional acceptance regardless of performance changes, and tangible support by helping AYAs schedule their PA, set up virtual fitness applications for their use, and offered financial (e.g., buy them exercise equipment, training sessions) and childcare support (Table 4.2). However, a few AYAs felt that their families were overprotective in regards to their PA. Gabi (27, thyroid cancer) felt that her family was \"so, so overbearing and overprotective\", which hindered her resumption of PA as they encouraged her to rest, \"It's like, 'Oh, let [Gabi] not do this, let [Gabi] not do that. Don't walk, don't move too much. Don't lift anything heavy, don't'. It was a lot of 'don'ts', because they were trying to, I guess, protect me.\" As well, not all AYAs felt that they were accepted or understood by their non-cancer peers, \"...I find peers my own age who didn't have that experience [cancer] just don't get it as much.\" (Leah, 24, Hodgkin lymphoma). Emily (32, leukemia and skin cancer) described her experience with friends from college: ...just the embarrassment factor about even though I was sick, and I had the cancer diagnosis...it's just people don't understand that you can get tired from walking. They're like 'but we just walked, we didn't walk very far, we just walked across school, and we didn't walk that fast.' And it's like well, my body just doesn't work like that anymore. 87 Meanwhile, other cancer survivors helped AYAs to feel comforted and understood, and provided them advice or shared their own PA experiences. Gavin (27, testicular cancer) shared how he felt supported by cancer survivor peers: I'm part of this kind of community for men with testicular cancer. [...] a few of us have talked about running after surgery because you can't weight lift. [...] if someone else has run, in two or three weeks it's going to tell me that it is possible so that I can go and do it myself. A few AYAs also discussed how they connected with cancer survivors who were further out from treatment (Table 4.2). Leah (24, Hodgkin lymphoma) was introduced to another AYA through her former coach and described the importance of their role in her PA re-engagement, \"...being able to talk to somebody who gets it and who's also young and is now well. I think she was almost 10 years out and very healthy. So it was very inspirational almost, I guess.\" The connections with survivors further out from treatment provided an example of someone who was able to thrive after cancer. However, a couple of AYAs did not find connecting with other cancer survivors helpful and avoided these types of connections: I found any of the stuff where it was other people's stories, I actually found it a bit kind of depressing a bit. It just didn't work for me. [...] sometimes people would say things like 'oh I was upset about this', or 'this happened to me' and it would be stuff I hadn't even thought about. And I'd be like, 'oh well now that you mention it, I'm kind of upset by that too', or 'this didn't work for me either'. So I didn't find that that motivating. Exercising in a group setting was described as an enjoyable and preferred activity for a few AYAs. Regardless of whether the groups consisted of peers, strangers, or other survivors, they were perceived as supportive, made AYAs feel connected and motivated, boosted morale, and fostered a sense of camaraderie (Table 4.2). While group-based aspects helped to improve AYAs' perceptions of support, not all were financially accessible or age-appropriate (Table 4.3). Overall, there were commonalities among the ways in which people provided support to AYAs. Yet, the accounts also illustrate the distinct support roles that others had in AYAs' PA transition. 88 4.4.4 Juxtaposed environments: Fitness facilities, cities, and green spaces The ease at which AYAs transitioned back into PA post-treatment was greatly influenced by the environment. They were concerned of receiving negative attention in fitness facilities and did not want to be considered beginners. Ryan (29, Hodgkin lymphoma) highlighted these concerns when he shared: I just felt silly. It just...sounds terrible to say it out loud, but it's the weights too of that weight [two pounds], they're often pink weights...it's kind of emasculating and it's not very manly, if you will. I mean the guys that are at the gym during the daytime are typically more bodybuilder types. So it's just - you know, everyone's got to start somewhere, but it's - you don't want to be that person starting there. Similarly, Emily (32, leukemia, skin cancer) articulated her discomfort with attending co-ed gyms: I find it very difficult to be a female and go into gyms. Because I don't like being stared at and I always feel like I'm going to be stared at by people and it's not comfortable. Especially if you're a little bit overweight or you want to do weights and you can't because the dudes are hogging all the weights. Because of the anticipation of negative attention, AYAs had a difficult time attending the gym or exercising in public spaces. Among AYAs who were active in fitness facilities post-treatment, some recalled receiving unwanted comments from others that were focused on their appearance and intensified their self-consciousness. For example, Lauren (36, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma) shared: ...I would take myself to the aquatic centre and try and stretch my limbs, I would try and move my body, I would try and help myself. And then...you have somebody who, well in this case was an older male who stopped me while I was swimming to ask me why I looked the way that I looked. 'How come, you seem to have - you know' [actions to breasts] and I'm like explaining to this gentleman at the edge of the pool, while everyone's listening. 'Yes, the reason I do look like a woman is because I am a woman. I'm on cancer treatment and I'm bald' right. Like fuck [Crying]. As if this isn't hard enough for me that I 89 have to try and explain myself while I'm there...it was just not something I wanted to do. So I just hid. Relatedly, Ryan (29, Hodgkin lymphoma) revealed his experience with an owner of a private gym: I tried to find a private gym, because I felt less people, a little more focus might be better for what I need. So I go in and the manager sits down and he goes, 'Let me guess, you just moved into the area, you walked past, see yourself as out of shape, you think we can help you out?' And I was like, 'Not exactly'. [...] And I felt like OK that's how people might see me...it was a little disappointing [...] I feel OK enough with myself that I'm like whatever...But it's still frustrating...I'm trying to do something, but this is where you're assuming I'm at versus what I've actually been through, what I'm trying to get to. Some gym trainers also made uninformed comments regarding AYAs' physical limitations. Emily (32, leukemia, skin cancer) spoke about her experiences going back to the gym after treatment: [trainers] didn't know how to deal with those joint issues...it became difficult for me to explain I can't do lunges, because my knees hurt and they're like, 'Yeah but you're in your 20's, why do your knees hurt? Just keep going'...they just didn't understand. Trainers perceived AYAs as young and therefore made assumptions on their capabilities. Similar to gyms, varying outdoor environments were contrasted, wherein urban areas were disliked and avoided, while rural areas and green spaces were highly valued and described as therapeutic. Cities were viewed as busy and unsafe due to the traffic and volume of people for AYAs who were immunocompromised following treatment. In contrast, participating in activity in rural areas, parks, and green spaces were enjoyed by AYAs. Aspects of these environments that made them so enjoyable included, \"the fresh air, the nature...It's rare that you pass somebody else on a trail most days.\" (Leah, 24, Hodgkin lymphoma). AYAs described that when engaging in activity in outdoor quiet environments, they felt better, were more relaxed, and found it difficult to worry. Living near green spaces and trails was beneficial for AYAs' re-engagement in activity, as discussed by Mika (34, colon cancer): 90 So it's definitely something really positive and great just to be able to walk around and concentrate on nice things around, nature...it definitely makes me feel good [...] It's a huge bonus and it...makes me to get out more because I know it's nice trails and hiking...with no huge crowds around. Markedly, Erin (36, breast cancer) expressed, \"I think that [exercising in nature] would be my top choice if I was exercising. If I can do something outside, that's always going to be the better choice.\" Overall, participating in PA in rural and green spaces was met with positive thoughts and emotions, whilst attending fitness facilities and engaging in activity in urban areas caused a range of mainly negative feelings for AYAs, and at times triggered behavioural avoidance. 4.5 Discussion This study explored previously active AYAs' experiences transitioning back into PA following cancer treatment. AYAs were motivated to be active for physical appearance and function reasons, and to regain control of their life and health. Factors that undermined a transition back to PA included experiencing identity issues, a lack of specific and ongoing support from healthcare professionals, negative PA experiences in fitness facilities and busy cities, low confidence in one's physical abilities, and concerns around the body's appearance and function. However, aspects that helped to facilitate this transition included access to exercise equipment and supports (e.g., exercise professionals and programs), access to natural settings for activity, and supportive others (e.g., family, partners, peers, other cancer survivors). Overall, PA re-engagement necessitated continuous attention and management at the individual level, and would have benefited from greater system-level supports. Self-regulatory capacities are depleted through cancer and cancer treatment, increasing difficulties for re-engagement in meaningful activities, like PA (Arndt et al., 2014; Cummins et al., 2016). As such, greater supports at interpersonal and structural levels are needed for AYAs post-treatment. Similar to previous work (Chisholm, 2020; Petrella et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2015), AYAs described being motivated to engage in PA to manage changes in body appearance and function, physical and mental health, and one's routine, independence, and sense of normalcy. Notably, the previously active AYAs were highly invested in their body's appearance and weight, which 91 was integral to their decision to be active after treatment. Yet, it is well known that exercising for appearance related reasons is not a sustainable source of PA motivation (Chisholm, 2020; Ingledew & Markland, 2008). A preoccupation with managing one's weight through PA engagement was common and reinforced by healthcare providers and society. The focus on weight, and appearance more broadly, highlights the pervasiveness of societal idealizations of slim, toned, and muscular bodies that are prominent for AYAs even after cancer treatment. Encouraging a functional body focus and compassion towards one's appearance and weight changes may be useful individual-level strategies to improve PA maintenance and experiences (Alleva & Tylka, 2021). Alike previous reports (e.g., Petrella et al., 2020; Pugh, Petrella, Fisher, et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2015), AYAs in the current study recounted worries around physical limitations and safety, dissatisfaction with fitness facilities, lack of support from healthcare providers, and body image concerns and anticipated negative body-related evaluations. The commonality in these reported barriers underscores the critical importance of addressing these issues in order to facilitate a smoother transition back to PA for AYAs. On this note, there are a number of modifiable factors that can be targeted through strategies and interventions (e.g., self-efficacy; body image). For instance, altering one's capabilities through a PA intervention may help to improve confidence and competence in PA, which can improve body image (Sonstroem & Morgan, 1989). As well, AYAs that report significant body concerns and worries around exercising in public settings may benefit from the development of age-specific, private, and supportive PA programs to improve comfort and ultimately ease the re-initiation of PA. There was also an unmet need for PA support from healthcare providers that is life-stage and age-appropriate, specific to the AYAs' goals and needs, and continuously provided. In addition, there is a need for increased supports in the form of referrals to exercise professionals immediately after treatment and provisions of ongoing exercise plans and resources. Consultations with healthcare providers working with AYAs have revealed that they do not feel capable of providing PA advice due to a lack of knowledge and confidence (Pugh, Petrella, Pabary, et al., 2021). Further, healthcare providers have described limited referral pathways as a barrier to recommending PA to cancer survivors (Alderman et al., 2020). There are dedicated guidelines and supports that healthcare providers can consult (e.g., American College of Sports Medicine, 2019; American Council on Exercise, 2021; Schmitz et al., 2019); however, the 92 development of AYA-specific guidelines is needed to appropriately support this unique group of cancer survivors (Adams et al., 2021). In addition, it may be worthwhile to strengthen available resource pathways and explore the benefits of integrating kinesiologists in AYA multidisciplinary cancer care teams (Santa Mina et al., 2018). In the present study, some AYAs reported feeling uncomfortable when lifting lighter weights and being the target of appearance commentary from gym goers, trainers, and gym owners. These issues are not unique (Coen et al., 2020), however, the ubiquitous gym culture challenges participation, even for AYAs that had extensive previous gym experience. These accounts suggest that changes to the wider gym industry is needed, for example, weights should be gender neutral in colour, body commentary should be banned, and front-facing staff including owners and trainers need sensitivity and inclusivity training. Although challenging gym culture will be beneficial for AYAs and beyond, AYAs may need additional support navigating these contexts and situations. For the previously active AYAs in the current study, PA was important not only as a strategy to regain control and normalcy, but as part of their athletic identity as well. Similar results have been reported with previously active AYAs on treatment (Adamsen et al., 2009). AYAs had extensive prior PA experiences and often expected to seamlessly re-engage in previously enjoyed activities and intensities. Managing PA expectations for post-treatment PA during treatment and promoting a more holistic view of activity may help with adaptability post-treatment and in turn, reconciling athletic identity issues. Further, supportive others (e.g., exercise professionals) should encourage AYAs to engage in previously enjoyed activities if possible, even if at a lower intensity. Focusing on enjoyable activities and holistic views of health may tap into intrinsic motivation for PA (Ryan & Deci, 2002), improving re-engagement and maintenance. Aligned with previous literature with AYAs (Petrella et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2015), social support for PA was particularly useful for previously active AYAs to help streamline this transition. Based on this finding, it would be useful to leverage social connections by fostering a sense of community in interventions and programming. First, AYAs noted the usefulness of connecting with other cancer survivors, especially those who were further out from treatment and were role models for PA. And so, future AYA program development should focus on group exercise programming (e.g., DeNysschen et al., 2020) or use a peer support model utilizing peer 93 mentorship, as these types of programs may be especially useful for previously active AYAs. In addition, designing accessible age- and life-stage group PA programs and facilitating awareness of and participation in the programs would be worthwhile. One-day PA events for AYAs have shown to help increase confidence in engaging in further PA programs and may be great gateway to sustained group participation (Pugh, Petrella, Fisher, et al., 2021). In addition, physical activity interventions designed for AYAs that have targeted social support using social media demonstrate feasibility and acceptability (Mendoza et al., 2017; Valle et al., 2013). And so, programs for AYAs may benefit from utilizing social media as a tool for facilitating social support. Further, given the crucial role of supportive others, targeting the support people directly to provide them with education on the safety and benefits of PA for cancer survivors, as well as the ways in which they could support AYAs could be a helpful approach (Price et al., 2020). 4.5.1 Limitations The findings should be considered in light of the following limitations. Although we attempted to recruit a heterogeneous group of AYAs, we had difficulties recruiting those with varying socioeconomic statuses and ethnicities. Given the additional barriers to PA for those who identify with minority ethnicities and lower socioeconomic statuses (Powell et al., 2004; Stalsberg & Pedersen, 2010), more work is needed to explore the PA transition experiences among diverse ethnicities and income statuses. The sample included AYAs who formerly engaged in competitive and/or recreational PA, as well as varied in the previous type, frequency, and intensity of PA. Whilst this provided variability in the accounts and experiences, it may be valuable to explore the differences in experiences based on former PA characteristics in future research. Further, although beyond the scope of this study, future efforts should be made to explore the PA transition experiences of AYAs' who were inactive prior to diagnosis as this subgroup could be at increased risk for negative outcomes. Although some participants who were further out from treatment (maximum = 9 years) provided rich accounts of their experiences, they may have described their experiences differently had they been closer to treatment. Thus, future research should consider limiting time since treatment. Finally, the interviews were conducted with audio-only or audio and video, which may have impacted rapport building and level of comfort and disclosure (Jowett et al., 2011). All participants shared in-depth accounts of their experiences, yet the extent of impact that the mode of interview had on the information disclosed is unknown. 94 4.5.2 Conclusion Limitations notwithstanding, the present study contributes to the limited literature on AYAs' experiences transitioning back into PA after treatment, and describes the unique accounts of previously active AYAs. Deepening knowledge on this subset of AYAs is essential to informing tailored strategies and programming aimed at well-being. 95 Table 4.1. Participant demographics.

Physical activity support providers and support types with illustrative quotes. Support provider Support type Participant Quote Exercise professionals Informational I had some swelling that was remaining and bothering me. And so, the physio was helpful to answer questions around, \"Is this normal? Is this what I should do? What about these movements? Should I be doing these things yet?\" And just being able to run ideas by - with someone that actually knows what they're talking about... (Erin, 36, breast cancer) Parents Esteem And so you know my dad would be the one...trying to get me to go outside to go for a little walk and it was always things like 'just try and go around the block once'. And then sure enough I'd get to the end of the block and I'm like I can go a little bit further [...] just [chokes up] little pushes like that. (Lauren, 36, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma) Tangible I put in a grand myself, they [parents] put in a grand [trainer fees] [...] that was helpful to get myself going, so I wasn't as concerned about do I have money left over to do other stuff? Am I spending all my spare money trying to get back into shape? So that was definitely helpful. (Ryan, 29, Hodgkin lymphoma) Partners Esteem ...so I'd get home from the gym and I'd tell [partner] the exciting new thing that I did and he'd say 'oh, that's great!' [...] when I'd have a bad day at the gym I'd get home and go 'oh [partner's name], I'm never going to get better' and he'd say 'you just had a bad day, you'll be fine' [laughs]. (April, 32, Hodgkin lymphoma) Tangible So [husband]'s willing to let me leave everything and just to do something for myself. And from time to time, he's happy to go with me. (Mika, 34, colon cancer) Non-cancer peers Emotional ...I mean nobody knows what it's going to be like to have treatment and come out of it and how that's going to feel. And if you're going to be able to play again. Or, if you're going to be able to be as good...if you're going to be as fit. And just being supportive so that [soccer team] would just take me back no matter if it was different... (Erin, 36, breast cancer) Tangible I had a gym partner over the summer. [...] Because we set plans, we were more committed to going, because we didn't want to let the other person down. (Nathan, 20, brain cancer) Other cancer survivors Emotional I did get linked up with [breast cancer dragon boating team] [...] its got good support and lovely group of ladies and that's kind of nice to be a part of something like that. [...] It's just emotional and mental support, when everyone that you're with has been through what you've been through. So, that's kind of nice. [...] it's nice to kind of have examples of other people that are thriving that are ahead of you. So, you kind of can use that to sort of have a goal as well. (Erin, 36, breast cancer) Group exercise class members Esteem And it's not just the social aspect, it's the motivation that you're pushing each other for the best and supporting each other and cheering each other on. [...] Usually you're all striving together towards the same thing...the teamwork and having a supportive group, people that also get it, similar to the people you're, if you're friends with other people who had cancer, they get it. I think it's the same thing, exercising with people in the same activities. (Leah, 24, Hodgkin lymphoma) It was a bunch of guys just lifting weights and playing basketball, essentially, was a morale booster. It got me out of the house and it got me out with others. [...] there was a lot of encouragement [...] The camaraderie was a good motivator; it made you not think about anything negative. So, the guys were a good support system. (John, 36, testicular cancer) 97 Table 4.3. Social support needs with illustrative quotes. Support Need Participant Quote Access to exercise professionals I would love if there were programs available where people could go and participate in physical activity that was set up and monitored by professionals. (Erin, 36, breast cancer) I could check in with my physiatrist and my kinesiologist [...] those were my point people for transitioning. [...] ...I was so happy to see that there were professionals that I could go to... (John, 36, testicular cancer) Access to age-appropriate group programming A fitness person in the clinics to [...] refer you to resources or groups for my age group. I don't want to be exercising with 60 year olds. I mean it's great and all, but we're not going to be wanting to talk about the same things, or we're not going to be able to move the same way. So even just finding people in my local community who might be kind of facing, not even the cancer diagnosis, but some sort of illness where it limits their physical activity. So we can kind of get together and just be able to work on our physical activity together... (Emily, 32, leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma) Access to low-cost or free programming Well I mean I feel like living in [city] is already an extremely expensive life decision. So I'm on the lower spectrum of the income so for sure, financially I was somebody that struggled through that time and then afterwards so that's part of the reason I wouldn't have gone to sign up for a yoga class or a gym membership, I can't afford that. (Lauren, 36, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma) ...when you look at success in cancer recovery, feeling good, [...] finance is the biggest impact in that if [...] you don't have access to a gym, you don't have access to the equipment [...] I just feel like that's the biggest barrier that needs to be broken down. [...] the one thing that no one tells you about cancer is it's really [emphasis] expensive. (Ryan, 29, Hodgkin lymphoma) I don't think I would have been [as active without free programs]. If I did, I would either have to save for it and then feel really guilty if I didn't make it out for surgeries or if I was studying for an exam or what not. But having the accessible programs definitely helps and continues to. (Leah, 24, Hodgkin lymphoma). 98 4.6 References Abrams, A. N., Hazen, E. P., & Penson, R. T. (2007).

Journal of Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology. 4(4), 184-191. 105 Chapter 5: Bridging Text The main findings from Chapter 4 can be summarized as: 1. AYAs described being motivated to engage in activity to change their physical appearance and body function, and to regain control of their life and health. 2. Barriers to a transition back into physical activity after treatment included experiencing difficulties with reconciling the change in athletic identity, a paucity of detailed and ongoing support from healthcare providers, unpleasant experiences in fitness facilities, decreased confidence in physical abilities, and body appearance and function concerns. 3. Aspects that were described as facilitating a physical activity transition included access to exercise equipment, exercise professionals, and natural settings for activities, and the support received from others, including family and peers. 4. Re-engagement in physical activity after treatment required ongoing attention and management at the individual level. Greater supports for AYAs are needed at the interpersonal and structural levels. Drawing on the findings from Study 2, it is important to quantify the relationships between social support, body image, and physical activity. Specifically, Chapter 5 presents a cross-sectional study that examines the direct and indirect associations between social support, body image, and physical activity. Study 2 outlined social and environmental influences impacting physical activity engagement, which were used to inform the use of the sociocultural model (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012) to inform the direction of relationships explored in Study 3. Further informed by the results of Study 2, Study 3 measured cancer-specific social support, the appearance and function of the body, mild aerobic physical activity, and resistance exercise. 106 Chapter 5 Study 3 Body image, social support, and physical activity among adolescents and young adults diagnosed with cancer Study 3 is in press at Frontiers in Psychology: Vani, M.

Social support and body image are two factors that can influence PA behaviour and require further attention in this population. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between social support, body image, and PA among AYAs. An online cross-sectional survey administered through Research Electronic Data Capture platform was used to assess self-reported social support (general and cancer-specific), body image (body- related self-conscious emotions of appearance and fitness shame, guilt, authentic pride, and hubristic pride), and PA (mild, moderate-to-vigorous, and resistance exercise) in AYAs' (N = 119; Mage = 34.5 \u00b1 5.5). Based on findings from path analyses, social support and body image were directly associated with PA (R2 = .09 to .33). Social support was also directly associated with body image. However, there were no indirect effects. These findings provide preliminary support for the influential role of cancer-specific social support and appearance and fitness body-related emotions on PA. The results have important implications for the development of targeted strategies aimed at improving social support (e.g., facilitating the provision of cancer-specific support) and body image (e.g., cognitive dissonance and compassion-focused interventions), with the overall goal of increasing AYAs' PA. adolescence; body image; physical activity; social support; oncology; quantitative; young adults 108 5.2 Introduction Cancer in adolescents and young adults (AYAs; diagnosed between 15-39 years) accounts for approximately 5% of all new cases of cancer diagnosed each year in North America (American Cancer Society, 2020; Canadian Cancer Statistics Advisory Committee, 2019). With improvements in early screening and treatment, many AYAs are living 50 to 60 years after diagnosis (Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2017; Lewis et al., 2014). However, cancer treatment can have significant acute and long-term effects on AYAs' physical, psychological, and social health and well-being (Patterson et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2012). Identifying strategies to help offset these detrimental outcomes of cancer is needed. Physical activity (PA) during and after cancer treatment is associated with many benefits including reduced adverse effects, mortality, secondary cancers, and cancer recurrence (Baumann et al., 2013; B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Brunet 2018; Cormie et al., 2017). The consistent well-documented benefits of PA are reflected in PA guidelines for cancer survivors, with the most recent recommendations described as at least 90 minutes of aerobic activity and two sessions of resistance exercise per week (Campbell et al., 2019). Yet, about half of AYAs are inactive or insufficiently active, with PA levels declining from pre-diagnosis to during and post-treatment (B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Murnane et al., 2015). Therefore, it is important to identify potential intervening factors that may help to improve AYAs' PA levels and overall health and well-being. Social support is likely an important factor that can affect PA. Social support can be conceptualized as a multidimensional construct that involves interpersonal interactions from support networks (Bianco & Eklund, 2001). Even though AYAs are in a developmental stage marked by fostering social connections and relationships, a cancer diagnosis impedes their ability to create and maintain social relationships (Patterson et al., 2015). Social disconnect may undermine AYAs' perceptions of their physical skills and abilities (Feeney & Collins, 2015). AYAs report that perceptions of low social support for PA limit their interest in participating in activity (Wu et al., 2015). Further, AYAs describe that holding discordant PA goals when compared to others challenges their willingness to engage in activity (Wu et al., 2015). Meanwhile, group-based PA increases AYAs' PA engagement and maintenance (Gill et al., 2016). As such, social support may be an important factor related to PA among AYAs. 109 Body image is another key factor that can impact PA behaviour. Body image is a multidimensional construct that involves positive and negative perceptions, cognitions, feelings, and behaviours towards the body's appearance and function (Cash & Smolak, 2011). Although appearance has been widely studied in previous research with AYAs, there is a paucity of studies examining functional body image (Vani et al., 2021). Up to 88% of AYAs report changes to their body's appearance and physical function as a consequence of cancer and related treatment (Vani et al., 2021). Body image theories within oncology (White, 2000) posit that cancer-related body changes (e.g., scarring, hair loss, weight change, physical functioning issues) can negatively impact body image perceptions, cognitions, affect, and behaviours. Particularly related to body image affect, AYAs have described feelings of self-consciousness, shame, and guilt associated with body changes resulting from cancer (Pounders et al., 2017; Williamson et al., 2010). Self-consciousness is often measured via body-related shame and guilt (Castonguay et al., 2014; Castonguay et al., 2016). Body-related shame occurs when an individual feels they have a flaw related to their sense of self, while body-related guilt occurs when an individual has a negative evaluation of their behaviour (Tracy & Robins, 2007). Moreover, some AYAs have reported body-related pride, a positive self-conscious emotion (Grogan & Mechan, 2017; Wallace et al., 2007). Pride is experienced when an individual evaluates their engagement in socially valued behaviours or their social presentation of their body in a positive manner (Tracy & Robins, 2007). Pride can be further divided into two facets: authentic (i.e., positively evaluating one's appearance- or fitness-related achievements) and hubristic (i.e., evaluating body appearance or function as superior to others) pride (Castonguay et al., 2013, 2014, 2016; Tracy & Robins, 2007). Positive and negative appearance- and fitness-related self-conscious emotions have been associated with PA among adolescents and young adults who have not been diagnosed with cancer (Castonguay et al., 2015; Gilchrist et al., 2018; Pila et al., 2020; Sabiston et al., 2010), yet these relationships have not been tested among AYAs. In addition to the plausible direct association between body-related self-conscious emotions and PA, body image may indirectly influence the relationship between social support and PA. Although these associations are likely to be similar to the general population, the relationships may be more pronounced among AYAs due to the unique social disconnect, body-related changes, and difficulties with PA engagement that AYAs may experience (Murnane et al., 2015; Patterson et al., 2015; Vani et al., 2021). Supportive others are central to helping AYAs feel 110 more positively and less negatively about their bodies and provide protection against negative body commentary from others (Larouche & Chin-Peukert, 2006; Williamson et al., 2010; Vani et al., 2020). As such, social support may be positively associated with body-related pride experiences and negatively associated with body-related shame and guilt emotions. These associations are consistent with sociocultural perspectives (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012), wherein social influences (e.g., peers, parents) are often implicated in the development of thoughts and feelings about the body and exercise behaviours. The perceptions and feelings that AYAs hold about their body have been reported as a barrier to PA engagement after treatment (Wu et al., 2015). Further, AYAs who hold negative body perceptions avoid physical activities that emphasize the body's appearance (e.g., swimming) and communal changing spaces that are common in fitness facilities (Larouche & Chin-Peuckert, 2006; Vani et al., 2021). Interpreting this evidence, positive body-related emotions may enhance PA participation whereas negative body-related emotions may impede PA participation (Gilchrist et al., 2018; Pila et al., 2020; Sabiston et al., 2010). However, body-related guilt can also be reparative and increase PA engagement (Castonguay et al., 2017; Sabiston et al., 2010). Furthermore, these emotions may be uniquely associated with different PA intensities and types. To promote PA among AYAs, it is important to better understand the associations among social support, body image, and PA after a cancer diagnosis. 5.2.1 The Present Study Drawing on sociocultural perspectives (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012) and White's (2000) body image model in oncology, social support and body image may be factors associated with PA and body image may indirectly influence the relationship between social support and PA. The aim of this study was to test the pathways of social support, appearance- and fitness-related self-conscious emotions of shame, guilt, authentic pride, and hubristic pride, and PA. Given the PA recommendations for participation in both aerobic and resistance-based exercise, both types of PA were examined. Based on existing literature (Vani et al., 2021) and conceptual underpinnings (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012), it was expected that social support would be negatively associated with shame and guilt and positively associated with authentic and hubristic pride. Shame was expected to demonstrate a negative relationship with PA. The reparative nature of guilt (Tangney & Dearing, 2002) suggested that guilt would be positively tied to PA. Authentic and hubristic pride and social support were also expected to demonstrate a positive relationship with PA. 111 Finally, it was hypothesized that self-conscious emotions would demonstrate an indirect effect on the relationship between social support and PA. 5.3 Method 5.3.1 Participants and Procedure Following university research ethics board approval (#39245), AYAs were recruited by emailing cancer organizations and survivorship programs located in Canada and the United States. Supporting organizations and programs contacted the AYAs via email and/or social media. A recruitment poster was also shared on the research team's social media accounts. AYAs were eligible to participate if they (i) were diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 15 and 39 years, regardless of cancer type, stage, time since diagnosis, treatment status, and treatments received; and (ii) were able to read and respond to questions in English. The selected age range is aligned with the standard for cancer organizations in Canada and the United States (American Cancer Society, 2020; Canadian Cancer Statistics Advisory Committee, 2019). Interested eligible AYAs used the provided link or QR code to directly access the electronic consent form. Once consent was complete, participants were redirected to the secure online survey using the Research Electronic Data Capture platform. Upon completion, participants were entered into a draw to win one of twenty $25 gift cards. Surveys were completed between January and June 2021. Based on the timing of this study, data collection mainly occurred during public health restrictions pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. Standard sample size estimate protocols for path analyses suggest 10-20 participants per main parameter (Kline, 1998; Nunnally, 1967; Stevens, 2012). Based on these recommendations, and our models having nine main parameters, the target sample size was 120 AYAs. 5.3.2 Measures 5.3.2.1 Demographics Participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire containing personal (e.g., age, self-identified gender, sexuality, and ethnicity) and cancer-related (e.g., cancer type, treatment status, time since diagnosis) questions. 112 5.3.2.2 Social Support Social support was measured using the Social Support Survey (Richman et al., 1993), which was modified to include a cancer-specific support type. Participants were provided with the definition of each of the following support types: listening, task challenge, emotional, reality confirmation, tangible assistance, and based on previous literature, a cancer-specific support type (i.e., \"people who support you by letting you know that they understand what it is like to have gone through cancer\"; McDonough et al., 2014). For each support type, participants completed two items assessing the (i) quantity (i.e., \"how many individuals provided you with this type of support\") on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 0 (none) to 4 (8 or more), and (ii) quality (i.e., \"in general, how satisfied are you with the overall quality of support you receive?\") on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 4 (very satisfied). A total general social support score was calculated by averaging the quantity and quality items across the five general support types. Aligning with research practice (McDonough et al., 2014), a total cancer-specific social support score was calculated by averaging the quantity and quality items. Evidence of content and construct validity was previously reported with non-cancer AYAs (Rees et al., 2007; Richman et al., 1993) and reliability with adult breast cancer survivors (McDonough et al., 2014). 5.3.2.3 Body Image Body image was operationalized as appearance- and fitness-related self-conscious emotions (Castonguay et al., 2016). 5.3.2.3.1 Appearance-Related Self-Conscious Emotions Participants completed the 16-item Body and Appearance Self-Conscious Emotions Scale (BASES; Castonguay et al., 2014) to assess appearance-related shame, guilt, authentic pride, and hubristic pride (4-items per emotion). Participants were asked to indicate how often, on average, they experienced appearance-related shame (e.g., \"ashamed of the way I look\"), guilt (e.g., \"guilty that I do not do enough to improve the way I look\"), authentic pride (e.g., \"proud of the effort I place on maintaining my appearance\"), and hubristic pride (e.g., \"proud that I am an attractive person\") on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Subscales were computed by averaging responses across the four items for each emotion, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of the emotion. Evidence of validity and reliability has been 113 reported previously with non-cancer AYAs (e.g., Castonguay et al., 2014; Chiminazzo et Fitness-Related Self-Conscious Emotions Participants the 16-item Body-Related Emotions in Fitness Instrument (BSE-FIT; Castonguay et al., 2016) to assess fitness-related shame, guilt, authentic pride, and hubristic pride. Participants were asked to indicate how often, on average, they experienced appearance-related shame (e.g., \"ashamed that I am a person who is unfit\"), guilt (e.g., \"guilty that I do not do enough for my fitness\"), authentic pride (e.g., \"proud of my fitness efforts\"), and hubristic pride (e.g., \"proud of myself when I compare my fitness to others\") on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Subscales were computed by averaging responses across the four items for each emotion, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of the emotion. Evidence of validity and reliability has been reported previously with non-cancer AYAs (e.g., Castonguay et al., 2016; Pila et al., 2020). 5.3.2.4 Physical Activity Self-reported PA was assessed using a modified version of the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ; Godin & Shephard, 1985). Participants indicated how many times on average they engaged in mild (e.g., yoga, golf), moderate (e.g., fast walking, baseball, volleyball), and vigorous (e.g., running, hockey, soccer) exercise for more than 15 minutes in a typical week. Aligned with the PA guidelines for cancer survivors (i.e., 90 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA [MVPA] per week; Campbell et al., 2019), we included the common modification of assessing the average duration (in hours and minutes) per session of each intensity category of PA. Aligning with previous research among non-cancer AYAs (Murray et al., 2021), respondents were asked to report the frequency and average duration of resistance exercise (e.g., free weights, weight machines, bodyweight training). Resistance training was important since AYAs report a preference for resistance exercise (Adams et al., 2021) and qualitative evidence suggests AYAs may have unique experiences engaging in resistance training compared to aerobic PA (Vani et al., under review). Total scores for mild, moderate, and vigorous activity and resistance exercise were calculated by multiplying self-reported times per week by average duration of sessions for each type. In addition, moderate and vigorous scores were summed to yield a total MVPA score. This scale has been used in studies with AYAs 114 (Brunet et al., 2018), has shown convergent validity with accelerometer measures in samples of cancer survivors (Amireault et al., 2015), and has demonstrated test-retest reliability (i.e., -coefficients ranges from 0.46 to 0.96 and adult Godin & Shephard, 1997; Sallis et al., 1993). 5.3.3 Data Analysis Data were screened for outliers, missing data, and regression analysis assumptions prior to analyses (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). Preliminary analyses included descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviations, frequencies) to characterize the sample and the main study variables. Bivariate Pearson r and Spearman rho correlations were computed to test the relationships between variables using SPSS (Version 21). To test the hypothesized associations among social support, body image, and PA, path analysis with maximum likelihood estimation was conducted using MPlus (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998-2011). Two models were computed to examine appearance- and fitness-related emotions separately. The models were tested separately to examine the distinct influence of appearance and fitness contextualized emotions and to avoid measurement overlap and furthering model complexity. The two models tested the direct path coefficients of: (i) social support (general and cancer-specific), appearance-related self-conscious emotions (shame, guilt, authentic pride, and hubristic pride), and PA (mild PA, MVPA, and resistance exercise); and (ii) social support, fitness-related self-conscious emotions, and PA. MVPA and resistance exercise were explored as separate outcomes rather than using one outcome to reflect combined guidelines (Campbell et al., 2019). This was intentional to understand their unique associations with body image and social support as engaging in resistance exercise and MVPA are qualitatively described as different experiences in relation to one's body and social environment (Vani et al., under review). Indirect path coefficients of each model were computed for the effects of social support on PA through body-related emotions in both models. The following variables were set to correlate: (i) general and cancer-specific social support; (ii) shame, guilt, authentic pride, and hubristic pride; and (iii) mild PA, MVPA, and resistance exercise. Age, gender, and time since diagnosis were included as covariates in the models. Model goodness of fit was established using non-significant chi-square, and the accepted fit indices (Hu & Bentler, 1999) of: (i) Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR; values .08); (ii) Root Mean Square Error of 115 Approximation (RMSEA; values close to 0.06); and (iii) Comparative Fit Index (CFI; values 0.90). Statistical significance was set to p < 0.05. 5.4 Results Data cleaning led to the removal of 85 records; some individuals opened the link but did not complete the consent form (n = 23), completed informed consent but did not begin the survey (n = 34), were identified as Botsi (n = 20), began the survey multiple times (n = 4), or were not diagnosed with cancer between 15 and 39 years (n = 4). The remaining sample (n = 119) completed the electronic consent and survey, and was screened for missing data. Data were missing at the item level, and no item was missing greater than 5% of responses. Missing data were determined to be missing completely at random (MCAR 2 = 703.42, df = 661, p > .05). Incomplete data were imputed using an Expectation Maximization algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). Outliers were classified as values that deviated beyond \u00b13 standard deviations from the mean and detected univariate outliers were winsorized (Osborne et al., 2010). 5.4.1 Descriptive Results Descriptive statistics for the analytical sample (N = 119) are presented in Table 5.1. AYAs were an average of 34.5 \u00b1 5.5 years of age (range = 21-47), predominantly identified as White (n = 98, 82.4%), women (n = 100, 84.0%), married or living with a life partner (n = 67, 56.3%), diagnosed with stage II or III cancer (n = 57, 48.9%), and had completed cancer treatment (n = 93, 78.2%). Based on PA guidelines for cancer survivors (Campbell et al., 2019), 27.7% (n = 33) of AYAs reported meeting guidelines of both MVPA and resistance training. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and internal consistency for the main study variables and covariates are presented in Table 5.2. In general, participants reported social support and body-related emotion scores around the mid-point of the respective scales. Overall, higher scores for shame and guilt were reported compared to authentic and hubristic pride, and fitness emotion scores were generally higher than appearance emotions. General and cancer-specific social i Bots were identified in consultation with the Information Technology department at the authors' university. Identification occurred using a combination of email address, time to complete the survey, and responses provided. Using the same approach, the remaining participants were deemed genuine. 116 support were significantly correlated (r = .37, p < .001). All of the emotions were significantly correlated (r = -.26 to .82, p < .001), and the PA variables were significantly correlated (r = .25 to .28, p < .001), except for mild PA and resistance exercise (r = .10, p > .05). Of note, age was positively correlated with cancer-specific social support (r = .26, p < .001), time since diagnosis was negatively correlated with fitness guilt (r = -.19, p < .05) and general social support (r = -.19, p < .05), and gender was positively correlated with appearance and fitness shame and guilt (rs = .19 to .30, p < .05) and negatively correlated with appearance hubristic pride (rs = -.23, p < .05). Given the coding, these associations suggest women reported higher negative shame and guilt and lower appearance hubristic pride. 5.4.2 Main Results Preliminary models produced spurious relationships involving appearance- and fitness-related shame and guilt, and the correlations between shame and guilt were significant (r = .76-.82, p < .001). To address a potential model misfit, revised models using guilt-free shame and shame-free guilt were tested. Based on previous research (Sabiston et al., 2010), guilt-free shame was assessed as the standardized residual associated with predicting shame from guilt (operationalized as maladaptive negative emotion focused on the self; Tangney & Dearing, 2002), while shame-free guilt was assessed as the standardized residual associated with predicting guilt from shame (operationalized as a behaviour-focused and often adaptive negative emotion without conflating the negative value of the self; Tangney & Dearing, 2002). Significant (p < .05) bivariate correlations for guilt-free shame, shame-free guilt, and the remaining model variables are presented under Table 5.2. 5.4.2.1 Appearance-Related Emotions Model The results of the path analysis are presented in Figure 5.1. Goodness-of-fit statistics were: 2(21) = 30.28, p = .09, RMSEA = 0.06 (90% CI = .00 to .11), CFI = 0.97, SRMR = 0.06. Significant (p < .05) direct path coefficients included: general social support to appearance shame, authentic pride, and hubristic pride, appearance guilt to MVPA and resistance exercise, and appearance authentic pride to MVPA and resistance exercise (direction of relationships and standardized coefficients presented in Figure 5.1). In addition, cancer-specific social support was positively associated with mild PA ( = .19, p < .05) and MVPA ( = .29, p < .001). Indirect 117 relationships were not significant (p > .05). Overall, the model predicted 10% of the variance in mild PA, 25% in MVPA, and 28% in resistance exercise. 5.4.2.2 Fitness-Related Emotions Model The results of the path analysis are presented in Figure 5.2. Goodness-of-fit statistics were: 2(21) = 28.89, p = .12, RMSEA = 0.06 CI = .00 to .10), CFI = 0.98, SRMR = 0.05. Significant (p < .05) direct path coefficients included: general social support to fitness shame and guilt, cancer-specific social support to fitness guilt, fitness shame and authentic pride to MVPA, and fitness guilt and hubristic pride to resistance exercise (direction of relationships and standardized coefficients presented in Figure 5.2). In addition, cancer-specific social support was positively associated with mild PA ( = .18, p < .05) and MVPA ( = .22, p < .05). Indirect relationships were not significant (p > .05). Overall, the model predicted 9% of the variance in mild PA, 23% in MVPA, and 33% in resistance exercise. 5.5 Discussion The aim of this study was to test the relationships between social support, appearance- and fitness-related self-conscious emotions, and PA. Findings demonstrate that social support is associated with mild PA and MVPA, body-related emotions are associated with MVPA and resistance exercise, and social support is directly related to body-related emotions. However, there were no indirect effects of body-related emotions and the relationship between social support and PA. To further provide context to the findings, just over one quarter of the sample were meeting PA guidelines (Campbell et al., 2019) of 90 or more minutes of MVPA and at least two resistance-training sessions per week. The results have implications for further testing these relationships over time and provide preliminary support for developing strategies aimed at increasing social support and improving body image for AYAs during and after treatment for cancer. In partial support of the hypothesis, greater perception of cancer-specific social support was associated with increased levels of mild PA and MVPA. Although AYAs reported similar levels of general and cancer-specific social support, general social support was not associated with PA. Previous literature with AYAs found that support group involvement, but not general social support, moderated the association between stress and PA (Brunet et al., 2014). Given that group 118 PA with other cancer survivors has shown to be useful in increasing PA confidence (Pugh et al., 2021; Zebrack et al., 2017) and behaviour (Gill et al., 2016), it may be important to further examine the aspects of cancer-specific support that may be most beneficial for increasing PA levels among AYAs. It may be valuable to explore the (i) types of cancer-specific support (e.g., emotional, informational), (ii) characteristics of individual(s) involved (e.g., similar-aged/-life stage peer(s), mentor(s) further out from treatment), (iii) methods of connecting (e.g., virtual, in-person), and (iv) contexts (e.g., conversations, exercising together). Further, age was positively associated with cancer-specific social support, indicating that those who are older have higher perceptions that others understand what they are going through. And so, particular attention towards adolescents and the provision of cancer-specific support may be needed. Aligned with sociocultural perspectives (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012) and previous literature (Larouche & Chin-Peukert, 2006; Williamson et al., 2010) and consistent with hypotheses, social support was associated with numerous body-related emotions. The current findings suggest that those who perceive high general support from others report experiencing higher appearance-related authentic and hubristic pride, and lower appearance and fitness guilt-free shame, yet higher fitness shame-free guilt. Given that literature demonstrates that shame thwarts PA, while guilt can encourage individuals to initiate PA (Castonguay et al., 2015, 2017; Sabiston et al., 2010), these latter findings are not entirely troubling. However, it is important to understand the aspects of general social support (e.g., types, individuals providing support) that increase feelings of fitness-related guilt. Furthermore, greater perception of cancer-specific social support was associated with lower fitness-related shame-free guilt, indicating that receiving support from those who validate one's cancer experience may make AYAs feel less alone in their challenges with fitness, and therefore, reduces one's guilt towards their fitness. Taken together, these results suggest that a positive perception of a supportive social network can help AYAs to feel more positive and less negative body-related self-conscious emotions. Therefore, it may be important to ensure AYAs feel socially supported during and after treatment. Given that time since diagnosis was negatively associated with general social support, those who are further out from diagnosis may require additional ongoing supportive care. In support of hypotheses, appearance- and fitness- related emotions were associated with PA. These findings are generally consistent with other cross-sectional studies among women (Castonguay et al., 2017; Pila et al., 2020; Sabiston et al., 2010) and men (Castonguay et al., 119 2015; Gilchrist et al., 2018). Overall, the fitness-related emotions were more consistently related to MVPA and resistance exercise, while only appearance-related guilt and authentic pride were related to PA. Intervening on fitness-related emotions may be ideal for enhancing PA among AYA. More attention on fitness-related emotions in research, theory, and practice is needed. Notably however, the body-related emotions were not related to mild PA, which may indicate that feelings towards one's body may not play a role in engagement in light and lifestyle activities (e.g., walking, yoga). Previous work in this area does not tease out PA into different intensities, yet some qualitative evidence suggests that different types of PA may be important outcomes of body image (Vani et al., under review) and should be further explored in future research. Based on the current study, mild PA appears to be an accessible form of PA regardless of how AYAs feel about their bodies. And so, to maintain PA, AYAs should be encouraged to participate in mild PA on days when they experience greater body image concerns. Higher reports of body appearance and fitness-related guilt and shame were related to lower levels of MVPA and resistance exercise. These findings are consistent with theoretical tenets (e.g., self-objectification theory; Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) and general body image literature among AYAs (Vani et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2015) wherein negative body image can be a barrier for PA engagement. The results extend previous findings by exploring appearance and functional facets of affective body image among AYAs. Although prior research with adult breast cancer survivors found appearance-related shame was related to MVPA (Castonguay et al., 2017), the current study's findings demonstrated that fitness-related, but not appearance-related, guilt-free shame was related to MVPA. Therefore, AYAs who blame themselves for their fitness may have an especially difficult time engaging in activity after a cancer diagnosis. Given that shame is a particularly painful self-conscious emotion (Tracy & Robins, 2007), strategies to reduce fitness-related shame are needed. Cognitive dissonance-based psychoeducation related to challenging societal expectations for fitness and body ideals may help to minimize fitness-related shame (Smith & Petrie, 2008). In contrast to previous work that demonstrates guilt as a reparative emotion with positive effects on PA (Castonguay et al., 2017; Sabiston et al., 2010), appearance-related shame-free guilt was negatively associated with MVPA and resistance exercise, and fitness-related shame-free guilt was negatively associated with resistance exercise. These results are aligned with descriptions of the maladaptive aspects of this emotion (Tangney & Tracy, 2012). AYAs who express guilt over 120 their appearance and fitness efforts are less likely to engage in intentional aerobic and resistance activities, indicating a need for the use of guilt-reducing strategies. Self-compassion approaches, such as journal prompts or expressing gratitude to the self and body-related efforts, may be useful to express emotions and alleviate feelings of body shame and guilt (Mosewich & Kowalski, 2011). Future research is needed to examine these relationships over time. Experiencing positive body-related emotions was related to engagement in greater levels of aerobic activity and resistance exercise. Overall, these findings support the important role of positive body image in facilitating health-promoting behaviour (Gilchrist et al., 2018; Tylka & Wood-Barcalow, 2015). In particular and aligned with previous literature (Castonguay et al., 2015; Sabiston et al., 2010), appearance- and fitness-related authentic pride were associated with MVPA, while appearance-related authentic pride was also related to resistance exercise. AYAs may use PA as a way of achieving their appearance- and fitness-related goals (Castonguay et al., 2013). Given these findings, it would be advantageous to enhance AYAs' appearance- and fitness-related authentic pride. Strategies to achieve this may include facilitated interventions wherein AYAs are prompted to connect their effort, competence, and manageable goal setting to their PA achievements (Castonguay et al., 2015). Furthermore, aligned with previous research (Gilchrist et al., 2018), fitness-related, but not appearance-related, hubristic pride (related to feeling superior to others' fitness), translated to higher engagement in resistance exercise. AYAs may use resistance exercise to display their superior fitness to others (Castonguay et al., 2013). Although fitness-related hubristic pride is associated with health-enhancing behaviour, it should be noted that hubristic pride has been related to worsened mental health (Tracy et al., 2009), and therefore should not be promoted to foster PA maintenance with AYAs. It would be worthwhile to explore these relationships over time and uncover the mechanisms through which the facets of pride facilitate increased aerobic and resistance activity. Contrary to our hypotheses, there were no indirect effects of body-related emotions and the relationship between social support and PA. The tested direction of effects is supported by conceptual and theoretical notions and prior research (Castonguay et al., 2015; Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012; Sabiston et al., 2010), however there are no specific models within the oncology context to link social support, body image, and PA. Based on the current cross-121 sectional findings, future research efforts could focus on a more nuanced understanding of cancer-related support, assess other dimensions of body image (e.g., perceptual, cognitive, and behavioural) and body image affect indicators (e.g., envy, embarrassment), and test the relationships over time. Future research would benefit from refining the current hypothesized model prior to intervention development by exploring 5.5.1 Study Limitations and Future Directions Findings should be interpreted in context with the following limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of this study precludes our understanding of directionality of the associations, and causal inferences cannot be made. Although there is conceptual and empirical evidence for the direction of relationships tested and discussed (Castonguay et al., 2015, 2017; Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012; Sabiston et al., 2010), reverse or bidirectional associations may also be reasonable and should therefore be tested in future research. Based on these preliminary findings, it would be valuable to further refine the proposed framework prior to use for intervention design. Moreover, measurement and structural models were not tested due to sample size, and so future research should examine these relationships using structural equation modeling. Further, appearance and fitness self-conscious emotions were examined separately, and so direct comparisons were not possible. Future work would benefit from comparing appearance and fitness emotions to elucidate if body-related emotions contextualized to appearance or function are more important among AYAs. In addition, due to the homogeneity of the sample (e.g., mainly educated, White women), generalizability is limited. Future research efforts should be aimed at recruiting a larger and more diverse sample of AYAs. Moreover, body image may differ based on demographic considerations. Whilst the current study controlled for age and time since diagnosis in the path models, the range of age and time since diagnosis were broad. Thus, future research should consider assessing body image differences based on age groups, developmental stages, and cancer trajectory. Further, the survey was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, and with widespread restrictions, engagement in PA and social support and body image scores may have been affected. Future research should explore these relationships among AYAs post-pandemic. Finally, PA was assessed using a self-report measure, which can have measurement limitations (Schmidt et al., 2008). Assessing the associations using an objective measure (e.g., accelerometers) of PA warrants future investigation. 122 5.5.2 Conclusion The current study uniquely explored appearance- and fitness-related body image emotions and examined both aerobic activity and resistance exercise among AYAs. The findings underscore the importance of assessing appearance- and fitness-related self-conscious emotions. This study is strengthened by the inclusion of cancer-specific social support, mild PA, and resistance exercise, which are not well understood among AYAs. Further, the results underscore the importance of the development and use of supportive care initiatives and strategies aimed at improving social support (e.g., facilitate the provision of general and cancer-specific social support) and body image (e.g., psychoeducation, compassion-focused, and goal-achievement interventions) for potential increases in PA participation. 123 Table 5.1.

The main goal of this program of work was to better understand factors related to physical activity engagement and experiences among AYAs, with a particular interest in body image and social support. In a series of three studies, the existing literature (Study 1) and participant perspectives (Study 2 and 3) were explored. In Study 1, a scoping review was used to summarize the available evidence on body image among AYAs and to explore the definitions, theories, methods, and measures used to assess body image within this unique population. Findings from this study highlighted the varied predictors and outcomes of body image including descriptive (e.g., time since diagnosis, gender), psychological (e.g., anxiety and depression symptoms), physical (e.g., physical activity, weight change), and social (e.g., social activity engagement) factors. Further, studies rarely defined body image nor used a body image theory to inform their research. Methods were varied, however cross-sectional designs were most commonly used. The included studies provided insights into the types of questions and measures that have been used among AYAs. Collectively, the findings suggested that greater attention to body image related factors was needed. Informed by Study 1, Study 2 used a qualitative interview design to explore previously active AYAs' experiences transitioning back into PA after a period of inactivity due to cancer treatment. Of particular interest, body image and social support were considered as factors related to physical activity engagement and experiences following treatment. This study highlighted the barriers and facilitators to physical activity after treatment for AYAs who were active prior to their cancer diagnosis. In particular, findings underscored the importance of body image and social support in understanding physical activity participation and experiences of AYAs. Concerns around the body's appearance and function and a lack of specific and ongoing support from healthcare providers made it more difficult for AYAs to transition into increased physical activity. Meanwhile, access to support (e.g., exercise professionals) and supportive others were integral to easing the transition. Overall, previously active AYAs require greater 136 system-level supports and the development of strategies to support their physical activity efforts after treatment. Building on findings from the first two studies, Study 3 utilized a cross-sectional design to test the direct and indirect relationships between social support, body image, and physical activity among AYAs during and after treatment. Within this study body image was operationalized as positive and negative appearance- and fitness-related self-conscious emotions (shame, guilt, authentic pride, hubristic pride). Based on self-reports from AYAs, the majority of AYAs were not meeting physical activity guidelines (aerobic and resistance), however the majority of AYAs were meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines only. Findings from this survey study demonstrate that social support and body image were directly associated with physical activity. Social support was also directly related to body image. However, body image did not indirectly affect the social support to physical activity relationship. Taken together, the results from this study have important implications for the development of strategies aimed at improving physical activity among AYAs. The present chapter critically reflects on the findings of this doctoral research program considering relevant existing literature and provides future directions for research and practice. The discussion is divided into four overarching sections: Theoretical, Conceptual, Methodological, and Practical implications. 6.1 Theoretical Implications The current program of work offers valuable insights and advancements for White's (2000) multidimensional body image model in oncology and the sociocultural model as proposed by Petrie and Greenleaf (2012). The body image in oncology model (White, 2000) helped to explain why body image was experienced among AYAs, meanwhile the sociocultural model described how social support, body image, and physical activity were related. The integration of the constructs from these models provided a useful explanation for the descriptions and associations explored in the present program of work. 6.1.1 Multidimensional Body Image Model in Oncology In the current program of research, the multidimensional body image model in oncology was used as a framework for understanding the body image experiences following a cancer diagnosis. 137 White's (2000) model posits that cancer survivors who perceive that they have cancer-related appearance changes (e.g., hair loss, weight change) experience a change in their body image. In particular, the appearance changes lead to negative body image if AYAs perceive a discrepancy between the actual and ideal physical self and are strongly invested in their appearance. Notably, body image incorporates the four dimensions of perceptions, cognitions, emotions, and behaviours (White, 2000). AYAs may engage in compensatory behaviours (e.g., over-exercising; avoidance of social interactions) if they hold negative body perceptions, thoughts, or feelings. This model therefore informed the conceptualization of body image throughout the studies, wherein a multidimensional focus was used. In support and extension of this model, all studies utilized a multidimensional definition of body image that aligned with the four dimensions as indicated by White (2000). Although the model focuses on appearance, body function is also worthy of study given the body functioning changes that occur through treatment (e.g., reduced physical function, sexual maturity delays; Barakat et al., 2016; Eiser & Kuperberg, 2017, Tierney, 2008). And so, as an extension to the model, body function was also explored throughout the three studies. In addition, White's (2000) model mainly focuses on how negative body image can develop, which widely ignores the possibility that AYAs also experience positive body image following treatment. To move beyond a pathological focus, positive body image was also considered in Studies 1-3. Study 1 utilized search terms that encompassed positive and negative appearance- and function-related body image terms that spanned the four dimensions. This approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of body image among AYAs. Included studies assessed all four dimensions, with cognitive (mainly dissatisfaction) being the most widely studied body image dimension. Study 2 encouraged AYAs to speak to their positive and negative perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and behaviours regarding their body's appearance and function. Aligned with the model's inclusion of appearance investment as a precursor to negative body image, conversations with previously active AYAs (Study 2) revealed the degree of importance they placed on their changed bodies. Changes to their bodies were especially troublesome given their investment in appearance and function, which ultimately impacted their physical activity participation levels and experiences. 138 Interestingly, in Study 1, the majority of included studies did not report a theory, model, or framework, and none of the studies were informed by White's (2000) model. And so, Study 3 was the first study among AYAs to be informed by White's (2000) model. Study 3 took a particular focus on body image affect. Previous literature with breast cancer survivors encourages the exploration of body-related self-conscious emotions and have demonstrated that appearance- and weight-related changes impact body emotions (Brunet, Sabiston, et al., 2013; Pila et al., 2018). However, Study 3 was the first to examine body-related self-conscious emotions among AYAs. Findings helped to advance our understandings of body image affect and its correlates among this unique population. This collective set of findings highlights the importance of examining body image investment and positive and negative appearance- and function-related body image across the four dimensions. A promising avenue of future research would be to test the entirety of White's (2000) model among AYAs. 6.1.2 Sociocultural Model The sociocultural model as described by Petrie and Greenleaf (2012) outlines the connection between social influences, body image, and compensatory behaviours. This framework was especially useful in outlining the probable direction of relationships between social support and physical activity (Study 3). The conceptual model describes that social and environment influences (e.g., peers, family, medical practices) convey societal body ideals to others. These views can then be internalized by AYAs and cause social comparisons, which collectively impact body-related perceptions, thoughts, and feelings. For AYAs, who experience changes to their body's appearance and function that likely distance them from societal ideals, experiences of negative body image are likely to occur. Further, the model also suggests that body image is then related to affective and behavioural consequences, which can include changes in physical activity behaviour (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012). In Study 2, social and environmental influences including comments from others, comparisons to others, and the support of others impacted body-related thoughts and feelings, as well as comfort and overall experiences in physical activity. Informed by these findings, Study 3 used the sociocultural model (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012) as a framework to inform the direction of relationships between social support, body image, and physical activity. Although body image 139 did not indirectly affect the relationship between social support and physical activity, direct associations between social support and body image, and body image and physical activity were found. Testing the entire sociocultural model with AYAs by including internalization and/or social comparisons would be a worthwhile avenue of future research. In addition, the original conceptualization defines body image from a cognitive perspective (i.e., body dissatisfaction), however within Study 3, body-related self-conscious emotions were used to assess body image. Therefore, future research would benefit from testing the model with multiple dimensions of body image (including cognitive body image) to better elucidate its utility with a population of AYAs. 6.1.3 Integration of Frameworks Taken together, the current program of research contributed to a novel understanding and comprehensive integration of theoretical frameworks of body image in oncology (White, 2000) and sociocultural perspectives (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012) among AYAs. In particular, aspects of the body image model in oncology (White, 2000) were beneficial in explaining how treatment-related perceived or actual body changes influence body image investment, perceptions, cognitions, affect, and behaviours. In addition, the sociocultural model as proposed by Petrie and Greenleaf (2012) highlight how social and environmental aspects can affect appearance- and fitness-related body image, which consequently impacts physical activity and exercise. Both models aid in our understanding of the development of body image among AYAs (Petrie & Greenleaf, 2012; White, 2000). Integrating these theories offers a valuable approach to understand social and body-related experiences and physical activity outcomes among AYAs during and after treatment. Future research is warranted to measure all constructs postulated by the models, test the associations with multiple body image dimensions, and examine the relationships over time. Collectively, this research program advances our understandings of the relationships between social support, body image, and physical activity. 6.2 Conceptual Implications This doctoral research program offers useful insights regarding the conceptualization of social support and body image that require consideration. 140 6.2.1 Conceptualization of Social Support An important implication of this program of work is the conceptualization of social support as the quantity and quality of general and cancer-specific support. Prior research and measurement have broadly assessed general social support within cancer populations (Decker, 2007), yet cancer-specific social support may be especially useful to examine. Recent literature has advocated for and incorporated a cancer-specific social support item to assess support received from those who understand what it's like to go through cancer (Fong et al., 2017; McDonough et al., 2014). Informed by these studies, as well as Study 2 findings wherein AYAs described other cancer survivors as facilitators of emotional support, which impacted their physical activity engagement and experiences, Study 3 measured cancer-specific social support. The inclusion of this item was advantageous given the unique relationships it shared with fitness-related guilt, mild physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Notably, general social support was not directly associated with physical activity, underscoring the uniqueness and importance of assessing cancer-specific support. It may be worthwhile in future research to expand the measurement of cancer-specific social support to explore other types of cancer-specific support that may be associated with body image and physical activity among AYAs. Furthermore, given the promising findings in previous literature regarding support group involvement with young adult cancer survivors (Brunet et al., 2014), it may be useful to explore the contexts through which AYAs receive social support (e.g., support groups). 6.2.2 Conceptualization of Body Image The studies within this research program defined body image as the positive and negative body appearance- and function-related perceptions, cognitions, feelings, and behaviours (Cash & Smolak, 2011). This conceptualization provided important implications that can inform future research and practice. 6.2.2.1 Appearance and Function Facets Body image was contextualized to both the appearance (i.e., what the body looks like) and function (i.e., what the body can do) of the body. While body image research has predominantly focused on appearance, body function has increasingly received greater attention and both are related to physical activity (Vani et al., 2021). Findings from the three studies in this research program support the investigation of body appearance and function. First, functional terms were 141 used in Study 1 and nine studies defined body image from a functional perspective. These studies and their contributions to our understanding of body image among AYAs may have been otherwise missed had body function been overlooked. In Study 2, previously active AYAs reported body appearance, weight, and function changes that impacted their engagement and experiences in physical activity. Central to their experiences, AYAs made body function comparisons with their previous self that influenced their confidence, willingness, and enjoyment in activity. Finally, in Study 3 separate models for appearance and function were tested and demonstrated unique findings. For example, appearance shame and hubristic pride were not significantly associated with physical activity, yet fitness shame and hubristic pride were significantly associated with resistance exercise. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of understanding and investigating the body's appearance and function facets among AYAs. 6.2.2.2 Positive and Negative Valence Across the three studies, positive and negative body image were explored. It is important to note that positive body image is not the absence of negative body image, as they exist on separate continuums (Vani et al., 2021). Therefore, AYAs may similarly hold negative and positive perceptions, thoughts, or feelings towards their bodies. The included studies in Study 1 mainly focused on negative body image, yet positive body image was explored among a few studies and presented unique results through relationships and qualitatively described experiences. Within Study 2, AYAs were provided with the space to discuss positive and negative body experiences in relation to their physical activity after treatment. Interestingly, results revealed that activity-induced body changes triggered positive body-related thoughts and feelings. Meanwhile in Study 3, negative (shame and guilt) and positive (authentic and hubristic pride) body-related emotions were explored. Positive body-related emotions were positively associated with physical activity, whilst negative body-related emotions were negatively associated with physical activity. Having a purely pathological focus would have led to the oversight of important results that were demonstrated with positive body image among AYAs in the three studies. It is recommended that future research with AYAs explore negative and positive body image. 142 6.2.2.3 Multiple Dimensions As partly described within the theoretical implications, this program of work studied the multidimensionality of body image (Cash & Smolak, 2011; White, 2000). Evidence of body perceptions, cognitions, feelings, and behaviours were demonstrated in Studies 1 and 2. Cognitions operationalized as body dissatisfaction were the most widely described in Study 1, meanwhile in Study 2 AYAs described body perceptions (e.g., descriptions of weight change), cognitions (e.g., dissatisfaction with loss of physical functioning), feelings (e.g., insecurity and self-consciousness), and behaviours (e.g., exercising to change appearance). Study 3 however focused on body image affect and provided greater insight into this understudied dimension of body image among AYAs. Although previous literature has explored body-related emotions with breast cancer survivors (Brunet, Sabiston, et al., 2013; Pila et al., 2018), Study 3 was the first study to examine appearance- and fitness-related self-conscious emotions within an AYA population. Results from Study 3 suggest that despite some conceptual descriptions of guilt as a reparative emotion that is tied to adaptive behaviours (Dearing & Tangney, 2011), guilt among AYAs was related to lower physical activity levels, supporting a complex conceptualization (Calogero & Pina, 2011). These findings advance our understanding of body image affect and its relationships with social support and physical activity among AYAs. Since body-related emotions fluctuate over time among adolescents (Sabiston et al., 2020), it would be worthwhile to explore the relationships between body-related emotions and physical activity over time. Finally, given that AYAs in Study 2 described upward social comparisons with others and body embarrassment in fitness contexts, it would be advantageous to examine body-related embarrassment and envy in future research. 6.3 Methodological Implications This program of research utilized three different methodologies to explore body image, social support, and physical activity among AYAs. This section aims to explore the implications of the methodologies, sample, and measurement utilized within the three studies. Overall, this work has multiple methodological strengths and can contribute to the advancement of body image, social support, and physical activity literature in AYA populations. 143 6.3.1 Sample Considerations Purposive sampling was used in Study 2 to recruit AYAs who self-reported meeting physical activity guidelines prior to their cancer diagnosis. This approach was highly valuable for understanding the complex experiences of AYAs who were previously active and had attempted to re-engage in activity after minimal or no participation during treatment. Further, Studies 2 and 3 used flexible inclusion criteria wherein AYAs were eligible regardless of the type and stage of cancer diagnosed, treatments received, and time since diagnosis and treatment. Participants in both studies varied across these aspects; notably AYAs in Study 3 collectively reported 23 diverse cancer diagnoses. These studies provide results that are generalizable to a range of AYAs and can be used to inform future research and practice across cancer-related variables. 6.3.2 Methodology Considerations Study 1 employed a scoping review, which allowed for a broad synthesis of the available evidence pertaining to body image among AYAs. This approach permitted the inclusion of studies with various methodological designs (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005; Colquhoun et al., 2014). Due to the broad inclusion criteria, 82 studies were included, which provided important insights into the factors related to body image, as well as the theories, models, measures, and methods used to study body image among this distinct group of cancer survivors. Drawing on recommendations for the use of qualitative and quantitative methods (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007), Study 2 and 3 provide a comprehensive understanding of social support, body image, and physical activity among AYAs. The qualitative methodology used in Study 2 provided a flexible and in-depth exploration of AYAs' physical activity experiences and how social support and body image affect their physical activity transition. This approach provided nuanced details that helped to provide a more complete understanding of physical activity experiences among AYAs. Meanwhile, the quantitative methodology utilized in Study 3 added complexity by testing the associations between social support (general and cancer-specific), positive and negative appearance- and fitness-related self-conscious emotions, and physical activity (mild, moderate-to-vigorous, resistance). However, future research is encouraged to utilize longitudinal and experimental designs to explore these relationships over time and ascertain the mediators and moderators of these relationships. Examining the mechanisms will 144 facilitate a better understanding of when and for whom body image and social support may related to physical activity within an AYA population. 6.3.3 Measurement Considerations Considerations of the measures used in Study 3 require attention. There is considerable interest in assessing social support, body image, and physical activity among AYAs, however a notable consideration is that many of the utilized questionnaires were not developed with this population. However, Study 3 demonstrated adequate internal consistency for the social support (Richman et al., 1993) and appearance- and fitness-related emotion (Castonguay et al., 2014, 2016) measures. As well, validity and reliability evidence are available for these measures and the physical activity assessment (Godin & Shephard, 1985) among adolescents, young adults, and cancer survivors (see Study 3 for detailed information). A strength of Study 3 was the use of positive and negative contextualized (appearance and function) body image measures. Given the tumultuous cancer experience and findings from Study 3, future research should measure both valences, facets, and all dimensions of body image. Finally, Study 2 interviews suggested that AYAs commonly engage in mild activities (e.g., walking) and strength-based exercise, which are often not captured in studies with AYAs. Therefore, Study 3 provided a broad measurement of physical activity that went beyond simply including moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity, but also included mild aerobic activity and resistance exercise. Although the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin & Shephard, 1985) has shown convergent validity with accelerometers in samples of cancer survivors (Amireault et al., 2015), future research should consider assessing objectively measured physical activity to use as a comparison with Study 3 findings. Using objective assessments may help to limit any potential limitations that accompany self-report physical activity measures (Prince et al., 2008). 6.3.4 Stakeholder Perspectives Study 1 of this program of research integrated stakeholder voices into the data collection and analysis processes. Stakeholders included body image researchers, community organizations, and AYAs. Their perspectives were integral to understanding their priorities, identifying particularly important findings emanating from the scoping review, and providing additional insight into the experiences of AYAs that informed practical implications. Including stakeholder perspectives in research is valuable as their involvement can provide greater meaning to the results and can 145 inform the development of strategies that will have utility in the target population (Levac et al., 2010). Drawing on these experiences, it is recommended that future research with AYAs involve AYA stakeholders, as this will improve the translation of research into practice. 6.4 Practical Implications The present program of work provides important implications for practice settings. Specifically, the results inform considerations of current practices involving social support and body image interventions, the identification of high-risk sub-groups, and strategies to alter health services. 6.4.1 Social Support and Body Image Strategies and Interventions Since physical activity is central to improving physical, mental, social, and emotional health during and after treatment (B\u00e9langer et al., 2011; Brunet et al., 2018), altering factors that influence physical activity among AYAs would be a valuable aim. Previous interventions developed for AYAs have targeted physical activity through common antecedents of self-efficacy, self-monitoring, and basic psychological needs (e.g., Mendoza et al., 2017; Valle et al., 2013). Within this research program, physical activity engagement and experiences demonstrated relationships with social support and body image. As such, it would be worthwhile to explore how the studies' findings inform the development of strategies and interventions aimed at improving social support and body image. 6.4.1.1 Social Support Findings from Study 2 and 3 suggest that social support facilitates greater engagement in physical activity. In Study 2, AYAs expressed how connecting with other cancer survivors was beneficial for their own physical activity engagement. In particular, a few AYAs noted connecting with cancer survivors who were further out from treatment as these individuals provided a model of how to thrive in physical activity after cancer. In support of these shared experiences, findings from Study 3 demonstrated a significant positive association between cancer-specific support (i.e., understanding of what it is like to have gone through cancer) and aerobic physical activity. AYAs that perceived higher support from other cancer survivors engaged in higher levels of mild and moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity. Based on these collective results, leveraging peer support from other cancer survivors may be an especially useful strategy to improve physical activity behaviour. 146 Among the limited research involving peer support interventions with other cancer survivors, findings demonstrate the beneficial impact of peer support on physical activity levels (Pinto et al., 2016; Ungar et al., 2016; Valle et al., 2013). However, to date, few peer support interventions with the unique population of AYAs have been developed and tested. These AYA-specific interventions have used online social spaces (e.g., Facebook) to connect AYAs (Mendoza et al., 2017; Valle et al., 2013). Based on this preliminary work and the findings from this program of research, it would be worthwhile to develop peer-support programming aimed at improving physical activity in concert with AYAs as involving AYAs will improve the acceptability of the program. Better understandings of the aspects of peer support that will be most desirable to AYAs warrant elucidation. Specifically, it is important to explore the following factors to optimally design a peer support physical activity intervention: the demographics of the support person (age, time since treatment), the method of peer support (peer-to-peer vs. peer mentor), the mode of connecting with a peer (virtual, in-person, combination), and the role of the peer (informational, esteem, emotional, tangible support). Future research is needed to develop and test peer support physical activity programming for AYAs. 6.4.1.2 Body Image Drawing on the descriptions and relationships between negative body image and lower physical activity and positive body image and higher physical activity demonstrated in Studies 1-3, it is necessary to reduce negative body image concerns and increase positive body image among AYAs. Two approaches that may be especially useful are strategies that focus on self-compassion and the body's functionality. First, self-compassion is an internal coping tool that can be used by AYAs to recognize their suffering with loving kindness, understand their shortfalls and failures, and acknowledging the common suffering of others (Neff, 2003). Practicing self-compassion helps individuals to identify their body-related cognitions and emotions with empathy and kindness rather than being self-critical. The use of self-compassion can help AYAs to acknowledge that body changes are part of the treatment process and is a common experience shared among survivors. Among AYAs, self-compassion interventions have demonstrated promising results in improving body image. AYAs that participated in a self-compassion intervention demonstrated reductions in negative body image (Campo et al., 2017) and greater acceptance of treatment-induced body 147 changes (Lathren et al., 2018). However, these studies have involved mainly women and therefore, less is known about if self-compassion would demonstrate similar findings with individuals who identify with other genders. Future interventions that employ self-compassion strategies for AYAs could include experiential exercises (e.g., self-directed writing exercises) meditations, and group-based discussions (Campo et al., 2017; Lathren et al, 2018). Secondly, taking a non-appearance focus by considering and discussing an individual's body functionality may be a fruitful strategy for improving body image. Focusing on the body's functionality can be achieved by describing the body's functions and their importance and meaning to the individual (Alleva & Tylka, 2021). It is important to note that body functionality is not limited to physical capabilities, but also involves health and internal processes (e.g., digestion), senses (e.g., sight), creative endeavors (e.g., dancing), self-care (e.g., showering), and communication with others (e.g., hugs; Alleva et al., 2015). Therefore, although AYAs may have physical limitations, considering their body functionality can still be relevant and useful. Interventions that target or focus on body functionality may employ writing activities, yoga, and exposure to natural environments. Functionality interventions have shown utility in increasing positive body image (Alleva & Tylka, 2021). However, less is known about their effectiveness with AYAs, yet there is a call for utilizing functionality interventions with cancer survivors (Alleva & Tylka, 2021), indicating an important area for future research. 6.4.2 Identifying High-Risk Sub-Groups Based on the cumulative results described in this program of work, greater research and attention is needed to identify vulnerable sub-groups of AYAs. Within Study 2, participants ranged in their severity of body image concerns, with those who described more debilitating body experiences have more difficult times with physical activity re-engagement. Similarly, in Study 3, participants who reported greater levels of shame and guilt also reported lower levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and resistance exercise. As such, it may be useful to incorporate screening tools in clinical care settings that can identify and consequently target AYAs with greater body image concerns to facilitate their involvement in body image interventions. Identifying higher-risk AYAs should be a clinical priority to prevent physical activity disengagement and improve overall health and well-being. 148 6.4.3 Health Service Provision Drawing on the collective findings from this research program, there is a need to optimize health services for AYAs. In particular, Study 1 demonstrated that there is an unmet need for healthcare providers to initiate conversations around body image and provide resources to address treatment-related body changes. In addition, findings from Study 2 suggest that AYAs desire individualized and ongoing physical activity support from healthcare providers and exercise professionals. It is unclear whether healthcare providers feel equipped to have body image conversations with AYAs, however literature suggests that healthcare providers feel ill equipped to provide physical activity advice (Pugh, Petrella, Pabary, et al., 2021). In addition, AYAs in Study 2 described experiences that highlighted the medicalization of exercise and preoccupation of weight among conversations with healthcare providers. Taken together, it would be worthwhile to explore the utility of having a multidisciplinary cancer care team that includes psychologists and kinesiologists and strengthening the awareness and use of existing resources. In addition, the development of body image resources would be a useful future research direction. Finally, it would be beneficial to incorporate weight-inclusive practices in healthcare settings (e.g., recognizing weight-related biases; promoting health improvement over weight loss) as these approaches show promise for increasing physical activity and body image (Bacon & Aphramor, 2011; Tylka et al., 2014). 6.5 Limitations and Future Directions Despite the strength of the contributions of this research program, there are broader limitations that require consideration. To note, specific study limitations are presented in Chapters 3-5. First, although efforts were made to recruit a large heterogeneous sample, as is the case with most studies conducted with AYAs, Studies 2 and 3 are limited by their sample size, convenience samples, and homogeneity in demographics. As such, socio-demographic differences in AYAs' experiences may have gone unnoticed. Future research is needed to examine differences across social and demographic variables. In addition, participants were eligible regardless of their time since diagnosis and treatment, which for Study 2, requires some retrospective recall of their experiences. Future research is encouraged to explore social support, body image, and physical activity after diagnosis through and beyond treatment to reduce potential recall bias. Furthermore, data were cross-sectional, which limits the ability to provide 149 temporal conclusions between social support, body image, and physical activity. It is likely that there may be bidirectional relationships between these variables. Longitudinal research is needed to examine directionality and explore mechanisms of these relationships. Moreover, although outside the scope of the present work, future research should examine AYAs who were inactive prior to diagnosis as this subgroup may be at increased risk for negative outcomes. Finally, efforts should be made to explore additional factors known to be associated with physical activity (e.g., self-efficacy, goal setting) and test whether these factors relate to social support and body image among this population. 6.6 Conclusion In conclusion, this doctoral program of research provides important contributions to the literature in theoretical, conceptual, methodological, and practical ways. Broadly, this work advances knowledge on the relationships between social support, body image, and physical activity among AYAs. Study 1 provided insight into the theories, methods, and measures used to assess body image, as well as the factors related to body image, including social support and physical activity, among AYAs. To move research forward, Study 2 used qualitative interviews, which highlighted the nuanced experiences of transitioning back into regular physical activity after treatment. Social support (or lack thereof) and body image were complex factors described in relation to physical activity re-engagement efforts. Finally, the cross-sectional research design drawing on White's (2000) body image and Petrie and Greenleaf's (2012) sociocultural models, helped to expand the current knowledge on the associations between social support, body image, and physical activity. The collection of research provides utility in directing future research and the development of strategies aimed at improving physical activity experiences and increasing physical activity engagement among this unique and underserved population of cancer survivors. Specifically, strategies targeting social support and body image may be especially useful in altering physical activity participation and experiences among AYAs. These efforts will ultimately contribute to a field dedicated to using physical activity to mitigate the negative effects of cancer, and importantly to improving the overall health and well-being of AYAs. 150 References Abrams, A.

Adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors experience changes to their bodies as a result of cancer and cancer treatment. These changes occur during an important life stage when appearance is highly valued. And so, the present scoping review explores and summarizes the available evidence on body image among AYA cancer survivors. The tables presented below include the results of this scoping review. Please use track changes to provide feedback on each section with comments describing whether the reported results are consistent/similar or inconsistent/dissimilar to your experiences and expertise. Please also respond to the final question at the bottom of the document. This task should take approximately 30 minutes to complete. When completed, please rename the document to add your initials and email it back to me at madison.vani@mail.utoronto.ca. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out via email. Your time and effort is greatly appreciated. Overview of the Participants in the Studies Only a handful of articles used a male/men only sample Most articles included survivors with mixed cancer diagnoses or breast cancer survivors only Most survivors in the articles were off treatment or included a mix of survivors on and off treatment. Research Questions for the Current Study (1) How is body image defined in studies examining body image among AYA cancer survivors? Among the small number of articles that defined body image, the definitions widely varied o The most common aspects included were body appearance and body function (2) What evidence is available on body image among AYA cancer survivors? The most distressing body changes were hair loss, scars, and weight change Exercise and sport and social support helped facilitate body image improvements Some AYAs expressed neutral or positive experiences (e.g., unbothered by changes; non-visible changes; expressed an appreciation or satisfaction for their body changes) Reported needs: Age-specific information at diagnosis and prior to treatment to prepare them for body changes that would occur Important to be treated with peers of a similar age Tips on how to manage changing appearance Support to deal with negative consequences Preferred doctors that began the body image conversation and provided a safe space for discussions, with a virtual option (e.g., computer) See Tables 1-5 for findings by study design 177 Table 1. The relationships between body image and other factors. Direction of relationships with body image Significant No significant relationship Descriptive factors Lower body image concerns were related to: Survivors diagnosed with genital cancer Males Greater time since diagnosis Greater body image concerns were related to: Survivors diagnosed with melanoma Females Less time since diagnosis Those with higher education Age (5 studies) Cancer diagnosis type (2 studies) Treatment type Sex Time since diagnosis Surgery type Ethnicity Time since treatment Personal/Psychological factors Greater body image concerns were related to: Lower quality of life Lower sex life satisfaction Lower post-traumatic growth Worse psychological well-being Less optimism More reproductive concerns Greater depression symptoms Greater anxiety symptoms Higher fear of recurrence Worse body image coping behaviour Reproductive concerns Coping Physical factors Greater body image concerns were related to: Lower physical activity/exercise Less physical functioning Reduced sexual functioning Greater pain More fatigue Weight gain Weight loss Larger sized scars Sexual function (2 studies) Social factors Greater body image concerns were related to: Avoidance of social activities Note.

Overview of the Participants in the Studies Only a handful of articles used a male/men only sample Most articles included survivors with mixed cancer diagnoses or breast cancer survivors only Most survivors in the articles were off treatment or included a mix of survivors on and off treatment Research Questions for the Current Study (1) How is body image defined in studies examining body image among AYA cancer survivors? Among the small number of articles that defined body image, the definitions varied widely o The most common aspects included were body appearance and body function (2) What theories are used to study body image among AYA cancer survivors? Most research wasn't theoretically based (3) Which measures are used to assess body image among AYA cancer survivors? Body image was measured in a variety of ways using a number of different scales (4) What study designs are used to examine body image among AYA cancer survivors? Most of the studies used surveys and only measured at one point in time About one fourth of studies interviewed AYAs A small number of studies used both surveys and interviews and a handful were systematic reviews (5) What evidence is available on body image among AYA cancer survivors? The most distressing body changes were hair loss, scars, and weight change Exercise and sport and social support helped facilitate body image improvements Some AYAs expressed neutral or positive experiences (e.g., unbothered by changes; non-visible changes; expressed an appreciation or satisfaction for their body changes) Reported needs: Age-specific information at diagnosis and prior to treatment to prepare them for body changes that would occur Important to be treated with peers of a similar age 182 Tips on how to manage changing appearance Support to deal with negative consequences Preferred doctors that began the body image conversation and provided a safe space for discussions, with a virtual option (e.g., computer) See Tables 1-5 for findings by study design Table 1.

M(SD) age at diagnosis = n.d. Median (range) age at study = 28 (18-40) years. Body image is the interaction of different physiological, psychological and social mechanisms that are complex and not well understood (Van Manen, 1998). The term ''body image'' encompasses several and obscurely differentiated aspects including body experience, body perception, body concept, body satisfaction or body identity, all of which often are used interchangeably (Hopwood, 1993). Goffmann (1986) theory of stigma and social identity N/A Three themes. 1) Pre-illness: the young athletes were enthusiastic and proud of their strong and sculpted bodies- their sport defined their identity. 2) At baseline: cancer and chemotherapy overpower the body and one's identity. 3) Six weeks following the intervention program: partially winning over the sick body, increased body acceptance and physical control - reformulating one's identity.

N/A One of five themes: 'struggled with adjusting to altered physical appearance'. Reconstruction did not meet expectations, and difficulties adjusting to altered appearance were noted. Overall, how women coped with physical changes associated with cancer varied. Dissatisfaction with reconstruction was noted in both white and survivors of color; only survivors of color complained about scarring and residual pain, and discussed their difficulty with looking at their undressed body in the mirror. Despite acceptance of the new physical appearance for many, the breasts that were lost couldn't be 'replaced'. Those who did not receive reconstruction seemed to be more comfortable with their altered physical appearance. Brierley, M. E., E., Sansom-Daly, U.

Themes: avoiding social situations (friends, romance, school, leisure), maintaining normality (minimized changes and used enhancers, e.g., makeup), peer-shield (friends protected them from what others were saying), and testing the waters (gradual return to 'normal' social environment).

The intervention prompted participants to use self-kindness with respect to self-care needs/ body limitations due to cancer. It also promoted body appreciation. Participants were encouraged to notice body 211 sensations and associated feelings without judgement, gradually leading to greater acceptance, self-compassion and relief. Although the intervention practices also brought awareness to difficult and negative emotions, it prepared the participants with coping and self-care strategies. Ljungman, L., Eriksson, L.

Findings suggest that the body is an important site for identity-related processing after completion of cancer treatment. Participants experienced reconnected with their bodies and found a way to align their post-cancer needs and desires with their bodies (engaging in exercise and sport helped improve body image over time).

Adolescents felt anxious and self-conscious and were reluctant to reveal appearance changes in public, which was compounded by negative reactions of others (e.g., teasing) and sometimes led to avoidance. Adolescents wanted support to develop the practical and social skills necessary to maintain a 'normal' appearance and manage the negative responses of others.

The questions I would like to talk about deal with your experiences with physical activity after treatment. Some of the things I will discuss ask you to reflect upon yourself and may involve making personal judgments. The interview should take approximately 45 minutes and your participation is strictly confidential. Interviews are normally tape-recorded, and this simply provides for accurately keeping track of information. The audio recording will only be shared with the research team. Your participation in this interview is important. However, should you at any time wish to stop or take a break, you may do so without consequence to you, and at anytime you should feel free to ask me questions concerning the interview or the study. Do you have any questions before we begin? [Turn on tape recorder] Warm-up 1. To begin, can you please tell me what being physically active means to you? This can include kind of PA, intensity, amount of times per week, etc. 2a. Can you describe your physical activity behaviour before you were diagnosed with cancer? This can include: childhood, adolescence, young adulthood 2b. Can you describe your physical activity behaviour during treatment for cancer? This can include: during surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, etc. 237 2c. Can you describe your physical activity behaviour after cancer treatment to currently? Defined as post-primary treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation Can you tell me about the type of PA that you currently participate in? 2d. Overall, how do you feel your PA has changed (if at all) from before cancer to now? Main Questions We are now going to focus on the transition back into physical activity after cancer treatment. This is not limited to the first time you were active, but can include anytime following treatment when you tried to or began getting active again. Do you have any questions about what I mean by transitioning back into physical activity after treatment? 1. What was your experience like transitioning back into physical activity post-treatment? How does taking part in PA impact you/how does it make you feel? 2. What made it difficult for you to transition back into physical activity after treatment? Rephrase: What stops you from engaging in physical activity? What challenges have you experienced when transitioning into physical activity? 3. What made it easy about transitioning back into physical activity after treatment? Rephrase: What helps you take part in physical activity? Body Image 4a. Did you experience any physical changes to your body from cancer and cancer treatment? Did these changes make you more willing to participate in physical activity or did they limit or hinder you from engaging in physical activity? 4b. How does your body's function (if at all) influence your physical activity transition? This includes: what your body can do (e.g., physical functioning, mobility, lung capacity) 4c. How does your body's appearance (if at all) influence your physical activity transition? This can include: what your body looks like (head to toes) Support 5. Tell me about the support you received from others [family, peers, partner, health care professionals, other cancer survivors] during this physical activity transition? Did you receive any advice about physical activity? 238 How have you felt about talking with others (family, peers, romantic partners, health professionals) about physical activity after your treatment? Describe a person who influenced this transition? How did they do so? Background/Identity 6. How (if at all) has your background (previous experiences), gender, sexual orientation, or race influenced your physical activity transition? / Do you feel that your background etc. enhanced or limited your PA in any way? 7. How (if at all) has the education you received, your financial situation, or the neighbourhood you live in influenced your transition back into physical activity? Cool-down/Conclusion How important is physical activity for someone who has finished treatment? Based on your experiences, do you have any recommendations or suggestions for smoothing this transition back into physical activity after cancer treatment? Is there anything else that we didn't cover but that you feel would be helpful for me to know? Compensation: For your participation in this study, you have a choice of receiving a $20 gift card from Amazon, Indigo, or Starbucks. Same email? Future Research: Would you be open to be contacted for future research? (Study 3) Closing: You've been so helpful; I really appreciate the time you've taken to talk with me.
