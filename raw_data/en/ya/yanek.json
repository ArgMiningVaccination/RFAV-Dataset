Sound Healing for Health & Harmony Crystal bowl sounds are an ancient healing art and are a form of vibrational medicine. Everything around us vibrates and is organized by waveforms and frequencies. Every cell and molecule of our body takes part in the symphony of our health and wellbeing. When an organ or system becomes stressed, it loses its original harmony. With total relaxation and support, the correct frequency can remind our energy field of its original blueprint, bringing it back to harmony, helping the healing process. In this workshop, in addition to learning the science, Marian blends her voice with the crystal bowls creating an atmosphere of calmness and serenity for a remarkable experience. Includes PowerPoint presentations, with the history of sound and how it works, meditation with crystal bowl demonstration, followed by group discussion. 90 minute keynote or up to a 2-hour workshop DREAM BIG!
