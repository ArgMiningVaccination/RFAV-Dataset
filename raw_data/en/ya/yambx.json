We'll help you know which ones, how much is safe, and when to use them.", "sitename": "Preventive Vet", "date": "2021-11-15", "cleaned_text": "happiness is variety, but the secret of variety, like the secret of all spices, is knowing when to use it.\" - Daniel Gilbert The last part of this quote is so important when it comes to our dogs. We pick and choose how we season our foods based on our preferences for sweet and sour or hot and spicy. While many herbs and spices can provide our dogs with benefits, there are some that can be harmful. So it is important to know what and when to use them and how much of each of these herbs and spices are safe. If you are a culinary genius or just way more into cooking than me, you may already know the difference between herbs and spices. But for those of us who just naively grab bottles from the pantry or follow recipes exactly as written, here is the difference between herbs and spices. Herbs come from the leaves of plants. Spices, on the other hand, come from the other parts of the plants, such as the roots, flowers, stems, fruits, bark, and seeds. You can now impress your friends at parties with this amazing bit of trivia! The Science About Herbs and Spices and Dog Supplements It is critical to remember that there are very limited studies when it comes to the use of herbs and spices with pets. There are many of these items that come in the form of supplements as well. In the United States, the FDA does not diligently regulate supplements as they do drugs. Instead, they are regulated similar to how food is. The FDA does not take action on things until the dietary supplement presents as a significant cause of illness or injury. Therefore, the manufacturers do not have to prove the safety or guarantee the accuracy of the ingredients. Many supplements can have hidden ingredients that have powerful biological effects that can react with medicine being taken or with certain medical conditions. When researching supplements, make sure to see if the product was checked by 'third-party testing.\" This tells you that a company other than the manufacturer has evaluated the supplement for quality assurance. It also means that they have checked the ingredients for contaminants. Typically, products from Canada are evaluated for [safety, quality, and effectiveness]. They will have a license number if they have been checked by Health Canada. In Canada, these items are called \"Natural Health Products\" and they are evaluated as non-prescription drugs. This means they are better regulated than supplements from the U.S. Skip to: Before Using Herbs and Spices for Your Dog It is always recommended to consult with your veterinarian before ever adding any herbs or spices to your dog's diet. It is very important to follow all precautions and directions given to you by your veterinarian, especially if you are using herbs and/or spices in the form of a manufactured supplement instead of their natural form. Remember, manufactured supplements can have hidden ingredients that may harm your pet. There is always a bad and good list with anything we use with our dogs. The same applies to herbs and spices. I tend to prefer to get to the bad or unsafe news before the good, so I will list those herbs and spices that are unsafe for your dog first. Then, we will follow with the wonderful list of good herbs and spices. Herbs and Spices to Avoid for Dogs Because medical measurements are typically calculated in kilograms, for easy reference 1 kilogram (kg) = 2.2 pounds (lbs). Allspice - Since it contains eugenols, it should be avoided. Small quantities will likely cause no issue, such as in baked goods. Eugenols can cause a slight decrease in body temperature and an increase in pulse rate. When a dosage level of about 2.5 grams per 10 kg of body weight is ingested, vomiting can occur. Note: more toxic to cats! Bay Leaf - It contains eugenols and other essential oils that make it toxic to dogs. Ingestion can cause vomiting and diarrhea. If dogs consume large numbers of large leaves, intestinal obstruction is possible. Cayenne - Even though it is not toxic, it can cause significant irritation to your dog's nose, eyes, and throat. If swallowed, it can cause burning, irritation, and pain to the gastrointestinal tract and cause vomiting and diarrhea. Cocoa or cocoa powder - Highly toxic to dogs. It contains up to 26mg of theobromine per gram. Mild to moderate toxic effects can appear with ingestions as little as 20mg per kg of body weight or 9mg per pound of body weight. In powdered form, which is most toxic, effects can occur at as little as 0.14 ounces (4 grams) for a ten-pound dog. For more help, use this [chocolate calculator](https://www.vetcalculators.com/chocolate.html). Toxicity results in vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, rapid heart rate, seizures, and even death. Chives - Japanese breeds - Akita, Shiba Inu, etc. - are more sensitive than others. It causes red blood cell damage by causing them to rupture, which can lead to anemia. Some pets also suffer gastrointestinal signs such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or drooling. Cloves - They are relatively safe for dogs unless consumed in high quantities as either a powder or oil. The result could be liver toxicity from the eugenols that cloves contain. Note: Cats are significantly more sensitive to cloves than dogs. Curry - Different curries range in their levels of spiciness. While not directly toxic, it should be avoided since it can cause significant gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and/or explosive diarrhea. Garlic (dried or powdered is the most toxic form) - It contains thiosulfate, which is toxic to dogs. Dogs develop Heinz body hemolytic anemia because thiosulfates cause oxidative damage to red blood cells, causing them to malfunction or die. Oddly enough, even though garlic is toxic, it is in some dog foods and treats. With most toxins, it is the amount consumed that makes them poisonous. Some things that are toxic, eaten in small quantities can be OK. It's important to check with your veterinarian, an emergency hospital, or a [pet poison hotline]if you suspect your dog has eaten any one of these toxic ingredients. Hops - These can be very dangerous if ingested by dogs. Following ingestion, they can cause a potentially life-threatening increase in body temperature called malignant hyperthermia. Other symptoms include panting, vomiting, diarrhea, agitation, and rapid heart rate. Symptoms can be as quick as 30 minutes after ingestion or delayed up to 8 hours, though, a delayed reaction is not common. A positive thing is that hops toxicity is treatable as long as veterinary care is sought immediately. Marjoram - It is toxic to dogs. It contains gastrointestinal irritants that cause salivation, vomiting, and diarrhea. It has also been found to slow the heart rate and lower blood sugar. Mustard Seed or powder - It is toxic to dogs, and consumption can cause vomiting and diarrhea. Nutmeg - It contains the toxin myristicin. Consumption of small amounts is not likely to cause more than some gastrointestinal upset (vomiting and/or diarrhea). But consumption of large amounts can result in hallucinations, disorientation, increased heart rate, dehydration, high blood pressure, dry mouth, abdominal pain, and possibly seizures. Onion (dried or powdered is the most toxic form) - It contains thiosulfate, which is toxic to dogs. Dogs develop Heinz body hemolytic anemia because thiosulfates cause oxidative damage to red blood cells, causing them to malfunction or die. Oregano - Toxic to dogs and causes gastrointestinal issues such as vomiting and diarrhea when used improperly. Oregano is also listed below in the safe list. Paprika - While it is not toxic, it is recommended to avoid since it can cause stomach upset. Pumpkin Pie Spice - Since it contains allspice, cloves, and nutmeg, avoid them for the same reasons we don't recommend them. Salt - The lethal amount for dogs is 1.5 grams per pound of body weight or 4 g/kg. Poisoning with salt results in vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, lethargy, incoordination, excessive thirst, or urination. In severe cases, tremors, seizures, coma, and even death are possible. Besides table salt, other sources include [homemade playdough](/dogs/dough-is-toxic-to-dogs), rock salt, seawater, and paintballs. Since salt and pepper often go together: Ingesting small quantities of black pepper will not harm a dog. If your dog ingests large quantities it can cause stomach upset. If inhaled, it can aggravate their nasal passages and cause uncontrolled sneezing Spanish Thyme - Toxic to dogs and cats. It contains the plant chemical called diterpene as well as other toxic oils. The symptoms of toxicity can include anorexia, diarrhea (possibly bloody), excessive drinking and urinating, depression, difficulty breathing, and vomiting. Safe Herbs and Spices for Dogs Remember, follow your veterinarian's directions and precautions carefully when adding herbs and spices to your dog's diet.
