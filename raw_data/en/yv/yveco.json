In the recent decade, these vi ruses have emerged beyond their historical geographical b oundaries , causing outbreaks and posing a threat to public health system s. Despite the ir medical importance, licensed, effective drugs and/or vaccines against these viruses are lacking, with the exception of the YFV. The live attenuated vaccine for YFV, strain 17D, is among the most effective viral vaccines ever developed . While this vaccine is relatively avirul ent and highly immunogenic, its attenuated phenotype was derived by blind passage of a virulent strain , leaving the mechanisms of attenu ation unknown. Moreover, 17D has been engineered as a delivery v ector for heterologous antigens. Importantly , the successful and safe use of 17D as a vaccine vector and the development of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) to related flaviviruses requires an understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to 17D attenuation. Using subcutaneous infection of interferon signaling-deficient mouse models of wild type yellow fever virus (WT YFV) pathogenesis and 17D -mediated immunity, we have investigate the role of type II interferon ( IFN-) in attenuation of 17D in vivo. We found that in the absence of type I IFN ( IFN-/), IFN- restricted replication of 17D but not WT YFV by 2 days post - infection. In this context, IFN- responses protected 17D -infected animals from mortality, largely restricted the virus to lymphoid organs, and eliminated viscerotropic disease signs such as steatosis in the liver and inflammatory cell infiltration into the spleen.

We also uncovered a mechanism by which IFN- can restrict 17D in human vacinees .

Overall, our results indicate that an important mechanism of 17D attenuation in vivo is enhanced sensitivity to IFN--stimulated responses elicited early after infection. vi TABLE OF CONTENTS PREFACE ................................

Members of Flavivirus have a wide range of vertebrate host s including rodents (2), birds (3), primates (4, 5), bats (6-8), and ungulates (9). The Flavivirus genus includes many impor tant pathogenic viruses that have shaped our history and offered valuable tools to study biology. Many flaviviruses are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by specific arthropod vectors such as mosquito es or ticks, which likely limits the geographical distribution of individual viruses. Ecology of the vector, such as feeding preference s for specific vertebrate hosts, and constraints of the vertebrate - arthropod transmission cycle limits the propensity of these viruses for mutation and altered virulence (10-12). Historically, flaviviruses have been classified based on their vector competency, vertebrate host, antigenicity, disease inflicted on host, an d nucleotide sequence. Flaviviruses can 2 be broadly classified into mosquito-borne, tick -borne, zoonotic without known vector, and insect-specific viruses with no known vertebrate host based on their host and vector specificities . In support of this, a comp rehensive phylogenetic analysis of the nonstructural protein 5 virus replicase ) sequences from 73 flaviviruses has been used to construct a tree that clusters the viruses according to vector competence (1). However, classification based on vector -competency is inadequate because mosquito -borne viruses can be isolated from ticks (13), and vice versa (14-16). A more functional approach to classification is cross-reactivity to neutralizing antibodies, which is able to predict relatedness of flaviviruses similar to genetic phylogeny (17). However, antibody escape mutants, lack of cross -reactivity, and low resolu tion of the assay may complicate the analysis (18). Flaviviruses can also be separated into two groups by the disease they cause in the vertebrate host . Hemorrhagic flaviviruses include yellow fever vi and dengue virus (DENV), which cause viscerotropic disea se (tissue damage in visceral organs such as the liver and the spleen) and potentially hemorrhagic fever in primates . The encephalitic flavivirus es, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Murray Valley encephalitis virus (M VEV) cause encephalitic disease in humans . Interestingly, among these mosquito-borne flaviviruses, disease manifestation s are also reflective of the virus' natural transmission cycle . For example, t he hemorrhagic YFV and DENV have a forest cycle that involves non-human primates as vertebrate host s and Aedes mosquitoes as a principle vector whereas the encephalitic JEV, WNV, and MVEV are transmitted between birds and Culex mosquitoes. While both YFV and DENV are transmitted in an urban cycle between human s and Aedes aegypti , it should be noted that DENV is adapted to human s and does not require a forest cycle for maintenance. 3 1.1.2 Virion Structure and genome organization The flavivirus virion is a 50nm-diameter particle with icosahedral (T=p3) symmetry and composed of nucleocapsid encased in a lipid membrane studded with envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins. The nucleocapsid consists of capsid (C) proteins and one copy of the RNA genome. The lipid envelope, derived from the ER of the host cell, is embedded with 180 copies of E and M protein (19, 20). In immature particle s, E and precursor -membrane ( PrM) proteins form heterodimer s. As the virus particle matures in the secretory pathway, the PrM protein is cleaved and E proteins form homodimers, which lie approximately parallel to the virus membrane. It should be noted that expression of PrM and E proteins result s in production of 31.5nm-diameter su b-viral particles with T=1 symmetry (21). The flavivirus genome consists of a single positive -sense RNA molec ule of ~11kb in length tha t has a type I cap at the 5' terminus that is immediately followed by a conserved stem - loop structure (22). Most flavivirus genomes lack a poly -A tail at the 3' genome terminus except several variants of tick single polyprotein ORF consisting of 3 structural proteins followed by 7 major non-structural (NS) proteins arranged in C -PrM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 sequential order . The polyprotein is cleaved by host and viral proteases during of the viral replication cycle. 1.1.3 Virus replication cycle The replication cycle of flaviviruses begins with attachment of viral particles to susceptible host cells. The entry receptor(s) for flaviviruses is /are currently unknown; however, integrins, C -type 4 lectins, and heparan sulfate have been implicated as attachment factors for various flaviviruses (25-27). After attachment, virus particles enter the cell through clathrin -mediated endocytosis and undergo membrane fusion as the pH of the endosome drops. Membrane fusion delivers the viral genome into the cytoplasm where the flavivirus polyprotein is translated by host ribosome s and then is processed by host a nd viral proteases in an ordered manner . The NS5 v iral polymerase synthesizes negativ e-strand RNA, which is used as a template to synthesize positive - sense genome progeny. The capsid-bound viral genome buds into E and PrM-studded ER membrane s to generate an immature virus particle, which goes through the secretory pathway. PrM proteins on immature particles are cleaved by host furin as they mature and are secreted outside the cells, which completes the replication cycle. 1.1.3.1 Attachment and Entry Flaviviruses, as with most arboviruses, have a wide host range and are capable of infecting a wide range of cells from different species in vitro; thus the surface glycoprotein E use s multiple receptors for different cell types and species , receptors common to many cell types, or a combination of both. The glycoprotein E is responsible for receptor bind ing and entry into target cells. C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN (25, 26) and CLEC5A (28, 29), and phosatidylserine (PtdSer) receptors such as TIM/TAM (30, 31) and human Axl (32) have been implicated as mammalian entry factor s for flaviviruses . Upon binding to the receptor, f laviviruses are endocytos ed into clathrin-coated pits, followed by m embrane fusion in pre-lysosomal endosomes that release the nucleocapsid into the host cytoplas m. In the endosome, pH reduction triggers conformational changes in the dimeric E protein that re -configures them into monomers and then trimer s. Changes in E protein conformation exp ose a fusion loop and provide energy for membrane fusion. In contrast to other 5 enveloped virus genera such as Alphavirus (33), the pH threshold of membrane fusion by flavivirus occurs at a relatively high pH of 6.6-6.8 (34, 35), suggesting fusion at the early endosome. Furthermore, m embrane fusion does not require cholesterol or sphingomyelin but its efficiency is enhanced by cholesterol (35-37). In addition to using the conventional entry pathway involving direct binding of virion to the receptor, a ntibody-bound flaviviruses can enter susceptible host cells using the Fc receptor in vitro through antibody -mediated enhancement (ADE); however, in vivo, ADE does not appear to be a major pathway involved in flavivirus infection or pathogenesis with the exception of DENV (38, 39). After membrane fusion, the nucleocapsid is released to the cytoplasm and translation of the viral polyprotein is initiated. 1.1.3.2 Expression and functions of viral proteins In this section, the function of flavivirus proteins will be discussed. The flavivirus genome mimics host messenger RNA in that, upon release of the nucleocapsid to cytoplasm , it is translated. The viral genome contains a si ngle ORF encoding a polyprotein that is co- and post- translationally processed into more than 10 proteins. The three structural proteins are capsid (C), precursor membrane (PrM), and envelope (E), which are necessary for packaging viral genome s and forming infectious particles. The nonstructural (NS) proteins are ordered de is inserted into the ER and cleaved by signal peptidase at the junctions between C/PrM, PrM/E, E/NS1, and The enzyme that cleaves NS1/NS2A is unknown. Genome architecture and the topology of the viral polyprotein are presented in figure 1 . 6 Figure 1: Topology of flavivirus polyprotein organization and processing. Image adapted fro m (40). Capsid The capsid protein forms the viral nucleocapsid , which consists of multiple copies of capsid and one copy of viral genomic RNA . The capsid is a dimeric protein in solution that has a basic interface formed by the N- and C-termini and an internal hydrophobic domain (41, 42). The basic interface interacts with the 3'untranslated region (U TR) of the viral RNA and hence is responsible for packaging the genome whereas t he hydrophobic interface interacts with the viral lipid membrane . Nascent, immature capsid peptide also contains a hydrophobic anchor sequence at the C-terminus that is necessary for peptide translocation of PrM into the ER. This anchor peptide is cleaved from capsid by NS2B3 at the late stage of the replication cycle to release capsid into the cytoplasm. The nucleotide sequence of capsid contains a conserved hairpin structure that directs ribosome s to the correct start codon. The capsid suppresses RNA interference in mosquito cells (43); however, its role in virulence in mammalian host remains unclear. Precursor Membrane/Membrane 7 The M protein is translated as a precursor protein t hat functions as a chaperone to protect the E protein from undergoing conformational changes to the fusogenic form in the secretory pathway during virion egress. PrM is cleaved by a furin-like protease to M protein during migration through the secretory pa thway. The C -terminus of M also mediates apoptosis in vitro (44). Envelope The E protein of flavivirus es is the major surface protein responsible for binding to target cells and fusing with endosomal membrane s. Crystal structure and biochemical studies reveal that E protein is dimeric on the mature virion surface and contains three domains. Domain III has an immunoglobulin -like fold and protrudes from the virion surface, properties that corroborate its functio n as the receptor-binding domain (45-47). Domain II has an elongated structure that lies parallel to virus membrane and contains the fusion loop (nt 98-110) (48). Domain I is situated between domain II and III and has a -barrel structure stabilized by disulfide bonds (48). In many flaviviruses, N -linked glycosylation in domain I masks the fusion peptide (49-51). Many neutral izing antibodies against flavivirus es are mapped to domain III; however, antibodies against other domains can be neutr alizing, especially those that bind near or at the fusion peptide (52-54). Multiple virulence determinants are located in the E prote in. Mutations in domain III (E - 303 and E -326) are associated with enhanced neurovirulence for YFV (55, 56). Residue 380 at domain III is relatively conserved among virulent flaviviruses. It forms the RGD motif that is implicated in binding to integrin s (57). A synthetic peptide of residues 380-389 in DENV E protein blocked virus entry into mosquito cells (C6/36) but not mammalian baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (58). Despite conservation of the RGD motif among many flaviviruses, mutagenesis 8 or blocking peptide fails to inhibit entry of other flaviviruses (57, 59). There are eight amino acid changes between Asibi and 17D substrains in the YFV E protein and the mutation at position 380 is implicated in virus attenuation . Detailed discussion of these amino acid changes and their implication s for attenuation is presented in section 1.2 . Nevertheless, these findings suggest E protein is a n important virulence determinant of flavivirus es. NS1 The first nonstruct ural protein, NS1, is a ~46kDa protein that is retained within , secreted from, and surface -associated with mammalian cells . Intracellular NS1 resides in vesicle packets that are thought to be site of virus replication and is necessary for synthesis of nega tive strand RNA in a virus NS1-deficient YFV replicon with DENV NS1 did not rescue virus replication. Interestingly, a single mutation in NS4A permits YFV to use NS1 from both DENV and YFV, suggesting a genetic linkage NS1 and (61). Two conserved N -linked glycosylation sites in NS1 have been shown to be important for RNA replication and subsequent virus production (62). Secretion of NS1 is regulated by the short peptide immediately after the signal peptide at residue 10 -11 (63). Secreted NS1 activates C1s and C4, resulting in degradation of C4 and suppression of complement -mediated neutralization of virus (64). In addition, secre ted NS1 from WNV also binds factor H, a regulatory factor for complement, and inhibits complement fixation (65). Association of NS1 with the endothelial cell surface and its ability to alter endothelial barrier integrity through modification of glycoca lyx suggest that cell -associated NS1 is a virulence factor (66). In fact, flavivirus-infected human s and laboratory animals generate antibody against NS1, and some of the se antibodies are protective (67-69). 9 NS2A NS2A is a hy drophobic integral membrane protein that interacts with NS3 and is critical for packagin g the nucleocapsid and forming the replicative complex (70). NS2A can be cleaved at the C-terminus, forming the NS2 A protein with no known function. However, a basic residue at the cleavage site is necessary for packaging nucleocapsid in YFV particles (71). NS2A is also implicated in inhibition of interferon (IFN) responses (72, 73). NS2B NS2B is a cofactor for protease activity of the NS3. Ectopic expression of NS2B in E. coli enhanced penetration of impermeable antibiotics (74), and trimeric NS2B lysed red blood cells (75). These data suggest that NS2B can alter membrane permeability, but whether such a function occurs in more physiological ly-relevant systems remain s to be investigated. NS2B from DENV interacts with the innate DNA sensor cGAS, leading to its degradation and inhibition of apoptosis (76). NS3 The NS3 act ivity that is activated by NS2B and is necessary for cleaving the viral polyprotein. Similar to other serine proteases, NS3 contains a catalytic triad and possess es strong substrate preference for consec utive basic residues (77). The protease complex NS2B3 also cleaves the host innate sensor STING to suppress interferon induction (78). The C-terminus of NS3 contains helicase and nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activities important for replication. NS3 is also implicated in caspase recruitment and induction of apoptosis (79). NS4A -2K-NS4B 10 and NS4B are small hydrophobic proteins (16 and 27kDa, respectively) connected by the short peptide 2K . NS4A is located in vesicl e packets and convoluted membrane s important for viral replication and polyprot ein process ing (80). NS4A also forms a stable complex with NS3 (81) and stimulates the helicase activity of NS3 (82). NS4B is an integral membrane protein that may play a role in vir al replication as it co -localizes with dsRNA and NS3 (83). Both NS4A and NS4B can inhibit interferon signaling (72, 84) and induce autophagy (85-87). The connector peptide 2K is necessary for generating functional NS4B. Abolishing the 2K/NS4B cleavage site renders NS4B using avivirus- specific inhibitor revealed that the 2K peptide may play an important role in virus replication (88). NS5 NS5 is the largest protein encoded by the flavivirus ORF . NS5 can be detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus of infected cells . The N-terminus of NS5 has S -adenosyl methyltransferase (MTase) and GTP binding activity important for capping the viral genome (89). The C-terminus of NS5 contains the RNA -dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), which replicates the viral RNA genome and contains the conserved Gly-Asp-Asp active site motif (90). This protein is also a vir ulence factor by targeting STAT2 for degradation via a ubiquitin - proteasome pathway (91, 92). Interestingly, NS5 from DENV can degrade the human STAT2 but not the murine homolog (91), suggesting host -specific subversion of antiviral mechanism s. 5' and 3' untranslated regions The UTR of flavivirus es are important for regulating virus replication, virion packaging, and suppression of host IFN responses. The 5' end of the positive -sense RNA is capped, 11 allowing host translation machinery to recognize the RNA for translation. During replication, the virus genome circularizes due to complementary sequences in the UTR , which is described in more detail in the next section. The 3'UTR interacts with NS3 in the replicative complex (93). Despite only possessing one putative transcriptional promoter, flaviviruses generate subgenomic RNA in ho st cells. The h ost exonuclease XRN1 participates in recycling nucleotides and control ling gene expression by degrading de -capped cellular mRNA (94). During replication, so me copies of flavivirus genome are not capped and hence are susceptible to XRN1 degradation. However, two stem loop structures at the 3'UTR prevent complete degradation of the genome by stalling XRN1 (95, 96), forming a ~500nt subgenomic flavivirus (sfRNA ), which antagonizes IFN responses. Expression of sfRNA from JEV has been shown to suppress phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. While sfRNA-deficient YFV and WNV replicate poorly in IFN -competent cells, they are able to replicate in cells deficient in IFN induction or response and when IFN and ZIKV sfRNA s suppress IFN responses by antagonizing RIG -I and to some degree MDA5 (100). Studies with DENV reveal that sfRNA binds to and interferes with deubiquitination of TRIM25 and subsequent RIG -I activation, leading to suppression of IFN induction (101). In addition, dengue virus serotype or modulate ISG the stress granule proteins G3BP1, G3BP2, and CAPRIN1 (102), indicative of virus-specific functions of sfRNA. 1.1.3.3 Genome Synthesis Upon translation and accumulation of nonstructural proteins, virus replication occurs. The negative strand is synthesized first , followed by the positive strand. RNA synthesis is performed by the replicative complex (RC) located in the invagination of ER membrane, composed of the 12 nonstructural proteins. NS2A, 2B, 4A, and 4B are involved in modification of ER membrane. Both NS3 and NS5 la ck membrane -association region s (103). NS3 is likely anchored to the RC through interaction with NS4B via its helicase domain (104), whereas NS3 -NS5 interaction aid s retention of NS5 within the RC (105, 106) . NS5 synthesize s and NS3 modifies the nascent strand. The current model for RNA synthesis by flavivirus es is that upon recognition of the positive strand by the RC, RDRP activity of (RI). The RI is th en re-used to synthesize the positive- or negative -strand RNA. During replication, the amount of po sitive strand is between 10- to 100-fold higher than negative strand (107). The mechanism controlling this ratio is unknown, but inhibition of genome cir cularization and sequestration of NS5 by sfRNA have been postulated as possible explanations (108). Circularization of the flavivirus genome is important for efficient replication. The 5'UAR (upstream ATG region) and 5'CS (circularization sequence) base pair with the 3'UAR and 3 'CS, respectively. These two pairs of complementary sequence elements are required for circularization and replication as mutations that abolish sequence complementarity in either one pair are lethal to virus replication (109). Circularization of the genome brings the conserved 5' stem loop , which binds to NS5, in close proximity to the 3' end, allowing genome synthesis to occur (110, 111) . RNA synthesis by flavivirus NS5 is i nitiated by de novo priming (110). A conserved histidine residue in the priming loop near the protein active site has been implicated in selecting ATP as the first nucleotide , as deletion of the priming loop led to incorporation of GTP instead (110). In the absence of an RNA template, NS5 only synthesizes the dinucleotide AG when Mg2+ is present , whereas NS5 coordinating with Mn2+ can synthesize other dinucleotide s with a 13 preference for AG. These observations explain conservation of the end nucleotides 5' -AG...CU - 3' for flaviviruses. After priming, the the to elongation confor synthesis of nascent RNA. The MTase domain is important for this conformational change (89). Following synthesis of the RNA, the 5' end of the positive strand is capped. Capping of flaviviruses follows the convent ional capping mechanism si milar to host mRNA, which begins with removal of a phosphate group from 5' triphosphate of the RNA by NTPase activity of NS3, followed by ligation of GMP by guanylyl transferase NS5. Finally, MTase methylates the guanosine cap at N7 position and th e 2'OH of the first nucleotide (106, 111) . No evidence for capping the negative strand exists. 1.1.3.4 Virion Assembly and Egress Accumulation of viral genome s from replication eventually le ads to packaging and egress of virions. Translation of the polyprotein results in ER-embedded PrM and E proteins. Capsid in the cytoplasm interacts with virus genome through its positively charged surface, forming nucleocapsid (42). No evidence for direc t interaction of capsid with either PrM o r E exists, and the mechanism by which nucleocapsid buds through the PrM and E coated membrane is unknown. NS2A may play a role in packing nucleocapsid in virio ns (112). Upon budding into the ER, immature virions are trafficked through the secretory pathways, where glycosylation of E and cleavage of PrM to M occur , resulting in mature infectious virions. It should be noted that cleavage of the chaperone protein PrM and protection of E protein by PrM is not uniform across a newly made virion, often resulting in mosaic virus particles that still retain some PrM protein s and/or contain copies of E proteins that adopt the acid-exposed conformation (113). These 14 difference s in structure and composition of the virions have potentially important impacts on humoral immunity against flaviviruses (39). 1.1.4 Innate immunity against flaviviruses The innate immune response is a relatively non -specific antimicrobial system that works with the adaptive immune response to restrain and resolve acute infection or protect vertebrate hosts from repeated infection. Flaviviruses are controlled by various innate pathogen sensors, inflammatory and cytokine response s, and immune cells. In particular, t he interferon (IFN) system is important for resistance , control, and clearance of flaviviruses from infected vertebrate host . Defects in IFN induction and/or signaling can alter the outcomes of flavivirus infection. In addition to IFN and its downstream genes, NK cells are also important in controlling virus infection before the more specific and robust adaptive immunity is activated. 1.1.4.1 Interferon induction by flaviviruses The TLR) family pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) are implicated in detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs) associated with flaviviruses. In cell culture and animal studies, d eficiency in PRRs leads to reduction in IFN and antiviral gene expression in a virus species-dependent manner. The RLR family member s such as RIG -I and MDA 5 detect dsRNA in the cytoplasm. Upo n binding to the dsRNA substrate, ATP hydrolysis and oligomerization (114) of these sensor s occur, allowing the sensors to interact with the adaptor protein MAVS on mitocho ndria or peroxisomes are dsRNA bearing 5' -triphosphate or the absence of type I cap on dsRNA (116) whereas MDA5 detects long dsRNA (>300 bp) (117-119). Activation of RLR s leads to 15 activation of TBK 1 and initiates a signaling cascade that phosphorylates and activates transcription factor IRF3, which activates transcri ption antiviral genes including type IFN s (subtypes IFN-4 and -). Alternatively, PRR -mediated activation of IRF7, which is constitutively expressed in myeloid cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages , can also lead to rapid production of IFN-/ (120). Upon secretion, IFN-/ acts in an autocr ine and paracrine manner to induce expression of various antivi ral genes, PRRs, and transcription factors that lead to production of additional IFN. Both RIG -I and MDA5 are impl icated in sensing flaviviruses. WNV and DENV have been reported to replicate more efficiently in RIG-I-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast s (MEFs). Correspondingly, t hese ISG upregulation (121-123). Similarly, MDA5 -deficient MEF s have support greater WNV replication than WT MEF s; however, a delay in ISG induction is not observed. In addition, mic e lacking either RIG -I or MDA5 a re more susceptible to WNV infection (124). These result s suggest that RIG -I and MDA5 are important for sensing WNV and DENV. In contrast, while JEV is more virulent in RIG -I-deficient mice and resulted in less IFN production, MDA5 - deficient mice do not display enhanced susceptibility to the virus (117). RIG-I has also been shown to detect YFV in p lasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). Interestingly, depending on th e route of entry into pDC, RIG -I or TLR we re differentially involved (125). Members of the TLR family are transmembrane mole cules expressed on the cell surface and in endosomal compartments in a cell type -dependent manner. The leucine rich repeats located in the ectodomain of TLRs mediate sensing of PAMPs. Binding of ligands to TLR s initiates a signaling cascade through the ada ptor protein MyD88 for all TLRs except TLR3, which activates TRIF instead (126). Similar to RLR s, activation of TLRs results in activation of 16 transcription factors such as IRF3, IRF7, and NF -B, leading to expressio n molecules including IFNs. Various TLRs are impli cated in detection of flavivirus RNA. In human monocytes and fibroblast s, TLR3-mediated sensing of DENV are important for secretion of type I IFN and the proinflammatory cytokine IL -8 (127), whereas p DCs suppresses IFN s (MoDCs) infected with YFV addition, pDCs secretes IFN-/ upon ligation with YFV - infected cells i n TLR7-dependent manner (125). In WNV infection, the role of TLR -3 and -7 remains controversial (130, 131) . However, MyD88 -deficiency renders mice more susceptible to WNV infection, suggesting a protective role for TLR signaling in WNV infection (132). On the contrary, MyD88 -deficient mice do not display enhanced sensitivity to JEV (117). Since RLR - and TLR -mediated sensing of viruses le ads to robust antiviral responses, pathogenic flaviviruses have evolved to evade host recognition. While RNA fragments from WNV activate RIG -I and trigger the IFN response, WNV genome s and anti-genomes are poor activators for RIG -I (133), suggesting that potential secondary structure s or genome modification may aid evasion of innate sensing. In addition, DENV also inhibits RIG-I activation by preventing its interaction with MAVS (134) and deubiquitination by TRIM25 (101), which is necessary for RIG -I activation. Overall, detection of flaviviruses by RLR s and TLRs is virus species- and cell type -dependent, and pathogenic flaviviruses deploy various means to suppress host virus sensing mechanisms. 17 1.1.4.2 Interferon antiviral activities against flaviviruses IFNs are a group of broadly antiviral cytokine s important for restricting pathog ens and modulating other immune response s. Cells or animals l acking components of IFN induction or signaling are often defective in viral control and highly susceptible to infection with many different viruses including flaviviruses . There are three types of IFNs, and they have a similar overall signaling scheme (Fig . 2). Upon IFN ligation to its receptor, type I and III IFN utilize JAK1 and Tyk2 to phosphory late uti lizes JAK1 and JAK2 to activate STAT1. These events lead formation of STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer s or STAT1 homodimers , which translocate to the nucleus and transcriptionally activate target genes. In addition, type I and type II IFN activat e NF-B and p38 MAPK, further regulating antiviral gene induction and f ine-tuning the immune response (135). Type I IFN (IFN-/) are broadly antiviral against flaviviruses in vitro and in vivo. IFN prophylaxis and treatment has been reported to supp ress replication and delay death of mice infected with Modoc virus (a flavivirus) (136). This cytokine is also important in the pathogenesis of many fl aviviruses, as animals lacking components of the IFN response, either pharmacologically (137, 138) or genetically (139-141), are more susceptible to flaviviru s infection and disease than their immunocompetent counterpart s. Many of the antiviral roles for IFN-/ can be attributed to its direct antiviral effects due to induction of a large ensemble of antiviral gene products. While IFN-/ serves as a major innate barrier for flaviviruses, it is also important for activation of T cells in WNV -infected mice (142). Type II IFN (IFN-) also possesses moderate innate antiviral activities through induction of antiviral genes regulated by the gamma -activated sequence (GAS) promoter element s. Cells treated with IFN- are resistant to flavivirus infections in vitro (143-146); concomitantly, 18 prophylactic treat ment of non -human primates with IFN- suppressed YFV load and diseas e (147). In addition, IFN- is a signature cytokine involved in di fferentiation of T cells to a TH 1 phenotype . Details of IFN- induction and s ignaling of IFN- will be discussed in section 1.3. Figure 2: General i nterferon signaling pathways. Similar to type I IFN, Type III IFN ( IFN-) signals through STAT1 and STAT2, leading to a similar profile of antivir al gene induction . Despite activating similar transcription factors, direct antivi ral activities of IFN- tend to be less robust than IFN-/ (148, 149) ; however, IFN- has unique antiviral activities at the epithelial barrier. Neutralizing IFN- in place ntal organoids, 19 which produce IFN- constitutively , have been reported to enhance ZIKV replication (150). While IFN- does not inhibit WNV replication in vitro, mice lacking its receptor , IFNLR1, have enhanced vascular leakage and virus tit er in the brain, suggesting IFN- is critical for restricting viral access through the blood -brain barrier (149). Similar barrier function is also observed in an encephalitic model for YFV (151). 1.1.4.3 Other innate immunity against flavivirus es In addition to the IFN system, several other innate immune mechanisms play important roles in restricting flavivirus for anti-flavivirus immunity. Mice have eight isoforms of OAS, which are involved in sensing dsRNA. Upon detection of dsRNA, OAS synthesizes 2' -5' oligoadenylate, activates resulting in substrates for RIG-I and/or MDA5 activation (152). Genetic studies of mouse strains that are differentia lly resistant to flaviviruses but not other RNA and DNA viruses have revealed that a non sense mutation leading to truncation of OAS1b is responsib le for enhanced flavivirus susceptibility (153). One potential antiviral function of OAS1b is to inhibit viral replication as escape mutants insensitive to OAS1b frequently have mutations in the helicase domain of NS3 (154). However, the mechan ism for OAS1b-mediated resistance remains elusive. In contrast to other OAS gene products, OAS1b does not have any apparent enzymatic activity. Overexpression of functional OAS1b or OAS1a only slightly restore s anti-flavivirus activities. Thus, OAS1b is postulated t o be a regulator for other OAS1 molecules and the trunca ted OAS1b is believed to work as a dominant negative inhibitor. It should be noted that humans have five OAS1 isoform s that are catalytically active and may be important f or innate immune response against flaviviruses (155). 20 Natural killer (NK) cell s are innate lymphoid cells that play crucial defense roles against many intracellular pathogens, including flaviviruses. NK cells can lyse virus-infected cells (156) and promote inflammation by producing cytokines such as IFN -/ and -, TNF, and RANTES (157, 158) . Early activation of NK cells has been reported after YFV , DENV, and TBEV infection proinflammatory ligation cells lacking MHC -I, and antibody -bound cells (det ails discussed in section 1.3). To suppress NK cell activation and subsequent lysis of infected cells, surface MHC -I is upregulated in flavivirus - infected cells in NF-B-dependent and IFN -/-independent manner (163, expressing only nonstructural pr oteins also induced MHC-I expression (166), suggesting that flaviviruses may employ multiple mechanisms to enhance MHC -I expression and/or it is a virus - dependent process. Nevertheless, NK cell activation and d ifferentiation are still observed in vivo. In addition to potential cytokine -mediated activation, di rect ligation of domain III of E protein from WNV and DENV with the NK cell surface receptor NKp44 has been shown to trigger NK cell degranulation , lysis of infected cells, and induction of IFN - in vitro (167). In secondary infection, where anti -flavivirus antibody is present, antibody -mediated cellular cytotoxicity has been proposed to be a mechanism for NK cell -mediated control of DENV (156, 168) . 21 1.2 YELLOW FEVER VIRUS 1.2.1 Transmission and Epidemiology Transmission of YFV from its enzootic habitat to human s can be described in three mai n cycles - sylvatic, intermediate, and urban cycles . In the sylvatic cycle , YFV is circulated in the jungle between mosquito es and non-human primates . In South America, the sylvatic cycle is primarily maintained by mosquitoes in the genus Haemagogus and Sabethes, whereas i n Africa, the sylvatic cycle is primarily maintained by Aedes africanus. YFV seeds serum viremia primate (NHP) host, allowing the subsequent blood-feeding mosquitoes to pick up the virus (169, 170) . In the intermediate cycle, YF V transmission to hu mans occur s when various tree -hole dwelling Aedes mosquitoes indiscriminately feed on human s rather than NHPs. T he intermediate cycle primarily occurs in Africa where human activities and settlement tends to be proximal to jungles in contrast with South Am erica. Human activities in forest s such as logging and tourism, encroachment of human habitats into jungles (169), and environmental factors boosting mosquito population s such as rain or flood (171, 172) can enhance the risk of YFV spillover to human s. Human infections in the intermediate cycle can lead to outbreak s in urban area s when Ae. aegypti, an urban-dwelling mosquito that bites human s aggressively (173), feeds on YFV- infected individuals. This can occur when infected humans travel to urban area s to seek hospitalization. In this urban cycle , Ae. aegypti propagates YFV to a human host and subsequently to other Ae. aegypti , potentially leading to la rge-scale outbreak s. Historically, the geographical range of YFV spanned North and South America, Euro pe, and sub-Saharan Africa, with outbreaks occurring in these regions during the 17th-19th centuries. 22 Due to active vaccination and mosquito abatement programs in the 19th century, YFV is currently only found in South America and sub -Saharan Africa; however, in recent decades, YFV has been re -emerging (169, 174 -178). One promine nt example is an outbreak in Uganda in 2011, which led to at least 58 deaths. This is the largest recorded YF outbreak in Uganda, and the last documented outbreak was in 1972 (175). The upsurge of YF cases has led the World Health Organization ( WHO) to expand the definition of geographical regions tha t are considered to be at risk for YFV (178). The reason for YFV re -emergence is unknown. However, human encroachment to the sylvatic regions (175, 177) and lack of vaccination (179) are the likely contributing factors . In addition, an increase in traveler -associated ca ses has raised concern for potential expansion of YFV beyond its current boundary (180). Interestingly, local transmission of YFV h as never been documented in Asia. This phenomenon may be explained by factors of vector competency and /or pre-existing cross-protective immunity from endemic circulation of DENV and JEV (181). 1.2.2 Pathogenesis and pathophysiology in human infection Most YFV infections in human s are abortive or subclinical (182, 183) ; however, in symptomatic cases, the disease ranges from mild disea se to fulminant pan -systemic disease. Disease severity and pathogenesis are influenced by the virus strain, host development and genetics, and environmental factors. After a three to six day of incubation period, patients generally develop abrupt fever and chills. Three phases of disease have been described in human YF. In the initial phase, known as the \"period of infection ,\" patients experience general malaise, headache, and nausea . Viremia peaks 2-3 days after the onset of illness. More severe signs including liver tenderness, 23 leukopenia, hyperemia of skin, and Faget's sign (fever with low pulse) are also commonly reported. The \"period of infection\" is followed by the \"period of remission ,\" where patients recover and symptoms disappear, lasting for up to 48hr. Mo st patients recover from YF at this point; however, 1 in 7 patients will progress to the severe disease phase known as the \"period of intoxication\" (169, 182, 184) . In the \"period of intoxication ,\" which occurs in three to six days after the onset of illness, patients experience moderate to severe hemorrhagic fever and multi -organ failure. Typical signs include high fever, black vomit, jaundice, enlarged liver, and re nal dysfunction. Serum antibodies appears while viremia declines at this stage. In addition, both serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are elevated, with AS T surpassing ALT, indicative of muscle and liver damage. Serum transaminase and bilirubin levels directly correlate to disease severity. Prote inuria (excess protein in urine) and metabolic acidosis can be detected from patients' urine. Perivascular hemorrhage and e dema in the brain indicates involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). In rare case s, neuroinvasion of virus and immune infiltration is possible. Jaundice d patients have an approximately 20% mortality rate. Survivors of YF have ne utralizing anti bodies against YFV and are considered to be protected from future infections. 1.2.3 Live attenuated vaccines for yellow f ever 1.2.3.1 History of yellow fever v accine s Historically, there have been two live attenuated vaccines used for YF, known as 17D and the French neurotropic vaccine (FNV) . Both were developed independently during the late 1920s when researchers from the west were investigati ng YF outbreaks in West Africa. In the summer 24 of 1927, while studying YF in Ghana, Adrian Stokes and colleagues inoculated the blood from a 28-year-old patient , named Asibi, experiencing mild febrile illnes s, into rhesus macaques. Some of the infected animals showed signs of illness and histology similar to human yellow fever . Furthermore, blood from the sick monkey s was infectious and the infectious agent could be propagated in mosquito es and/or monkeys. Importantly, Stokes also discovered that the infectious agent was filterable, suggesting bacteria were not involved. The virus, which was maintained by passaging in rhesus monkeys, was named Asibi (185). Tragically, Stokes contracted Y F and passed away soon after the discovery. At the same time in Senegal, Sellards, Mathis, and Laigret isolated another YFV strain using a similar approach and named it Mayali, now known as French viscerotropic virus (FVV). In addition, the Sellards team found that the virus survive d freezing in tissues (186), allowing storage and transport of the virus when monkeys were not available. Vaccine development started when the Asibi virus eventually ar rived at the Rockefeller Institute. I nterest in vaccine development stemmed from the need to protect researchers and field workers from con tracting yellow fever, which had led to at least 32 laborator y-acquired cases and 5 deaths between 1927-1931 (187). When Max Theiler and his colleagues attempted to culture the Asibi virus in small animal models via various route s of infection, o nly intracerebral inoculation led to disease and death of infected mice. After passage in mouse brain , the resulting virus lost viscerotropic virulence in rhesus monkeys but became more neurovirulent. , intrahepatic inoculation of rhesus macaques restored viscerotropism. The ability to alter virus virulence and tropism found ed the basis for developing a vaccine fo r YFV. To attenuate YFV, the researchers serially passaged the Asibi virus 18 times in mouse embryo s and 50 times in chicken embryo s. To eliminate concern about enhanced neurovirulence, the virus was further 25 passaged 108 times in chicken embryo s with neurologic tissues removed (188). Eventually, by passage 176, the resulting virus had lost viscerotropism and neurotropism in macaques, and infected macaques developed immun ity against Asibi infection. This resultant attenuated virus strain was designated 17D and became parental material of the present vaccine for YF V. Since its derivation in 1937, new lots of the 17D vaccine have been generated by continued passaging of 17D in chicken embryo s. Subsequent clinical tr ials demonstrated the safety of the vaccine for human use, and 17D was further passaged to generate sub -cultures for vaccine manufacturing. Today, two vaccine substrains exist; the sub -strain 17DD, maintained in Brazil and the 17D-213 line that is maintained by the WHO. The substrain 17D -204, which is commonly used in laboratory research, is the parent stra in of 17D -213. The second independent live -attenuated vaccine, the French neurotropic virus (FNV) , was developed the serially obse rvation, the resultant virus lost the ability to cause viscerotro pic disease in macaques but acquired enhanced neurovirulence in monkeys and mice at passag e 128. Subsequently, the virus wa s named FNV for its neurotropism. At passage 237, the virulence of F NV remained stable and could induce protective immunity in humans upon skin scarification with viral inoculum. It was thus used as a vaccine in French - speaking colonies in Africa between 1939 -1980. However, because FNV was associated with high rates of enc ephalitis, the WHO prohibited its usage i n children less than 14 years of age. With the availability of 17D, the FNV lost popularity and was discontinued in 1980 (189). While 17D is relatively safe and effective , achieving its widespread application was not without complications. In 1943 , vaccination with the sub-strain 17DD, which was passaged more than 300 times, failed to elicit immunity due to the lo ss of infectivity in humans. Protective 26 immunity was restored by using vaccine stocks at lowe r passage. Moreover , hepatitis in vaccinees occurred because human serum was used as a vaccine stabilizer. This was resolved by replacing human serum with egg prot ein. In Brazil, cases of viral encephalitis in children were reported and led to the suspicion of residual neurovirulence in the vaccine. Due to such issues with the 1 7D vaccine, in 1945, the WHO generated guidelines and standards for YF vaccine manufactur ing that employs a seed lot system to control passage level and a monkey neurovirulence test, which stated that i.c. infection with the vaccine stock in monkeys should lead to no more than one case of lesion in the brain and no serum viremia higher than 104 PFU/mL (190). 1.2.3.2 Innate Immunity to Yellow Fever Vaccination 17D vaccination triggers robust innate and adaptive immunity. In the first fe w days after 17D vaccination, local reactions such as redness and swelling often occur at the injection site, and low levels of circulating viral RNA and infectious particles are detectable in the blood. Elevated serum cytokine s, including IFN-, IFN-, IP-10, and MCP -1 be detected early after vaccination (191). Early cytokine induction by 17D is likely due to activation of NK cells and DCs, as ex vivo stimulation of these cells led to activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, the role of these cells and cytokines in controlling 17D remain unclear in vivo. Peripheral NK cells rapidly mature and differentiate in vaccinees as indicated by expression of CD57 and enhanced responsiveness to IL -12 and IL -18 (159). Elevated levels of TLR -3 and - 9 have also been detected, suggestive of enhanced viral sensing capability. Differentiat ion of NK cells is independent of expression of NK cell inhibitory receptors, but the NK cell response is correlated to serum type I and/or type III IFN concentration. Interestingly, 17D infection in mice lacking the receptors for both type I and III IFN le d to elevated number s of NK cells in the 27 spleen and liver (151), whether this phenotype is linked to a failure in NK cell activation remains to be investigated . In vaccinated mice, NK cells in lympho id tissues rapidly produce d IFN- (160). Stimulation of monocyte -derived dendritic cells ( moDC) from human production of IL -6, MCP-1, IL-10, IP-10, and IL -12 (p40 upregulation of activation markers CD80 and CD86 (129). Similarly, in vitro infection of human DCs with 17D leads to upregulation of activation markers such as MHC -II, CD80, and CD83 and results in enhanced capability to present antigens to T cells (192). In mice, 17D-mediated DC activation, cytokine secretion, and enhanced antigen presentation are dependent on TLR and M yD88 signaling (129). Investigation of the transcriptome of PBMCs from human vaccinees has demonstrated the importance of innate immunit y. Signature genes for the IFN response including STAT1, IRF7, OAS1, IFIT1, ISG15, and IP -10 are strongly upregulated and likely shape downstream responses for activating adaptive immunity (193). 1.2.3.3 Adaptive Immunity to Yellow Fever Vaccination The goal of yellow fever vaccination is to induce of long-term protective immunity . The primary immune compone nt involved in protection in human s is believed to be neutralizing antibody. Vaccination triggers a robust humoral response in human s, and >90% of vaccinees seroconvert within two weeks. Neutralizing IgM c an be detected as early as six days post - vaccination, and the number of plasmablast s in circulation also increases and peaks at 14 days post vaccination (194). Persistent levels of serum IgM lasting for at least four years have been documented (195). Convalescent sera from human patients or vaccinees protect mice and monkeys from lethal YFV infection. Thus, s erum antibody has been used as a correlate for protection. Detection of c irculatory IgG, which can last more than 35 years (196-198), and increases in antibody titer upon booster doses (199), suggest the presence of a long-lived 28 memory response . In fact, vaccinees receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation s for leukemia treatment have been reported to remain seropositive for YFV for at least one ye ar after transplantation (200, 201) , indicating that memory cells persist and remain functional in non - hematopoietic compartment . The mechanism s leading to a long-lived adaptive immune response are currently unknown. Antibody response to vaccination is correlated to expression of TNFRSF17, a receptor for B cell growth factor, in PBMC s, while detection of viral RNA up to 6 months post -vaccination suggests viral antigens may persist in vaccinees, potentially contributing to long -term protection (202). In addition to neutralizing antibody, 17D vaccination elicits robust, polyfunctional, and long-term T cells responses. Activation of CD8+ T cells can be observed as early as three days post-vaccination (193). Peak CD4+ T cell responses occur between 7-14 days, whereas the CD8+ responses peak between 14 -28 days (194, 203, 204) . Activation of CD8+ cells appears to be antigen-driven (204). Around 5% of virus -specific CD8+ T cells differentiate into either central memory (T CM) or effecto r memory (T EM or TEMRA) T cells that persist for years (198). At the peak response, 17D-specific CD8+ T cells express granzyme B and cytokines cytolytic polyfunctional For CD4+ cells, both TH1 and TH2 T cells are presen t, as are signature cytokines (IL-2, IL-12 for IL -13 for TH2) in the serum of vaccinees (194, 206 -209). However, one study suggested the response is po larized towards a TH1 phenotype as indicated by the typical CXCR3+ IFN-+ phenotype of CD4+ T cells (208). After the peak response, YF V- specific CD4+ T cells gradually gain expression of CCR7, indicative of a shift to T CM phenotype. Since human experimentation is not feasible, t he role of T cells in human s is unclear, but CD4+ T 29 cells and antibodies protect mice from viscerotropic infection by WT virus (210) whereas CD8+ T cells and antibodies protect mice from i.c. challenge (211). 1.2.4 Attenuation of Yellow Fever Vaccine strai ns Despite a long history of 17D vaccination and numerous potential applications of 17D as a vector for other vaccine s, very little is known about its attenuation mechanisms. Between 17D substrains and their parent Asibi strain , there are an average of 48 nucleic acid changes leading to 20 amino acid changes and 4 mutations in the 3'UTR (summarized in T able 1). The roles of these mutations in attenuation or pathogenesis of 17D have remain ed largely uncharacterized ; however, two conserved mutations , M-L36F and NS4B-I95M, consistently different between YFV and and their (17D substrains and FNV) (212). For M-L36F, substitution of the analogous amino acid in JEV leads to a mutant virus defective in virion maturation. This residue is located at the perimembrane heli x that interacts with the E protein. Of note, WT strain s of JEV, DENV, WNV, and YFV hav e a nonaromatic aliphatic residue at M36 and ala nine substitution does not alter virion production (213). It is possible that the aromatic property of phenylalanine or its bulky side chain can interfere with E protein interaction, resulting in altered kinetics of virus maturation and/or sensitivity to the antiviral response. NS4B is important for formation of the virus replication machinery and resistance to host immunity. I95M is located at the end of the helix 2 where IFN antagonis m and interaction with NS1 occurs (214). Attenuation of Asibi can also be achieved by serial passage of Asibi in HeLa cells six times. This strain, HeLa -p6, is attenuated in mice and has three amino acid changes, I95M, V98I, and E155K in NS4B (215), suggesting I95M is likely involved in attenuation in vivo. Interestingly, the V98I mutation wa s also observed in ha mster- 30 adapted Asibi, which gained virulence in hamster s (216). While V98I is not likely to be inv olved in attenuation, development of mutations in NS4B during passaging or adaptati on suggests mutations in NS4B are important for viral fitness in different host s. It should be mentioned that the mutation NS5-P901L, which is observed in 17D substrain s and HeLa-p6, might also contribute to attenuation (212, 215) ; however, little is currently known about this residue at this point. There are eight amino acid dif ferences in the E protein. E -M299I, E-S305F, E-T380R, and E-A407V are located in domain III, th e putative receptor-binding domain. A positive -charge mutation, E-T380R is implicated in enhanced binding to glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs). This mutation leads to enhanced virus clearance from circulation and hence attenuation in vivo (27). The role of other mutations has not been well characterized individually; ho wever, one recent study suggested that 17D can enter susceptible mammalian cells through a clathrin -independent pathway whereas entry of Asibi requires clathrin -coated pits. The usage of this alternative entry pathway is mediated b y mutations in the E prote in and the mutation at position 380 alone is insufficient to generate this phenotype. Moreover, this clathrin -independent pathway triggers more robust innate immune response s, which ma y contribute to attenuation (217). E-G52R is located at the hinge region between domain s I and II, which participates in fusion. M utations in the hinge region can have inhibitory effects on virus entry. Cell culture -adapted JEV bearing a mutation at position 52 has reduced peripheral virulence (218) and possesses different antibody - binding activity than its parent strain (219). Substitution of the analogous residue in DENV-2 have no effects on virus growth or fusion activity in vitro (220). E-A170V, E-T173I, and E- K200T are located at the dimerization int erface between M and E proteins. R eversion of position 173 to the WT residue leads to enhanced neurovirulence. In addition, reversion of both E-G52R 31 and E-T173I have been observed in neuroadaptated 1 7D, suggesting their potential role of neurovirulence in vivo (55).

Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity due to 17D infection are not w ell studied. Some cases are linked to patient histories of allergy to known allergens in the vaccine; however, t he absence of gelatin or egg allergy in some patients suggests the antigens and/or other ingredients may serve as allergens (221). Similar negative consequences have also been reported for other vaccines. YEL-AND and YEL -AVD are unique to YF vaccination. Currently, documented or suspected cases of YEL -AND and YEL -AVD number at least 200 and 70, respectively . Most cases have occurred after primary vaccination , and at least four cases have occurred after a booster dose (1 for YEL -AVD; 3 for YEL -AND) (184, 212) . YEL-AND includes seve ral typically self as Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and disseminated myeloencephalitis, followed by complete recovery. However, residual ataxia h as been reported for 11 months in one case (222) and at least one death occurred in an HIV-positive patient with a low CD4 count (223). YEL-AND is more common among inf ants, especially before 1950, when infants younger than 4 months old were commonly vaccinated. Post -vaccination encephalitis has been associated with regain of neurovirulence through manufacturing, leading to the implementation of the seed-lot system and 33 monkey neurovirulence test , described above, to ensure efficacy and safety. Today, despite stricter safety standard s, YEL-AND still occurs, suggesting additional, unknown underlying causes exist. Age-dependence of blood-brain barrier integrity and immune ma turity has been hypothesized for increased risk for neurologic disease in infants (224). The incidence of YEL - AND is higher in males. The overall fatality rate for YEL -AND is 5% (184). In YEL-AVD, patients experience a syndrome resembling WT virus infection - pansystemic di sease with high virus titer in visceral organs and cytokine storms, with 60% lethality (169). Patients who survive YEL -AVD tend to have higher than expected antibody titer s (1:10,240), which are likely due to overwhelming infection and high antigen levels (225-228). Advanced age and history of thymic disorder are considered potential risk factors (229), but no single factor has been identi fied as the cause of these SAEs, although h ost genetics and virus mutations are hypothesized to contribute. In one case, a patient, who had enhanced and prolonged serum viremia and T cell response , was found to possess single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CCR5 and RANTES gene s (230). While virus isolated in another YEL-AVD case had amino acid changes compared to the parent virus from the vaccine stock (231), virus mutation s are not always found in YEL -AVD patients (232). Some YEL -AVD cases have occurred concurrent ly with additional traveler vaccinations (228) and immune interference has been documented (233), raising the p ossibility that multiple vaccinations with 17D may increase the risk for SAEs . Together, the data on 17D -associated SAEs highlight not only the very limited understanding we have of this vaccine and its mechanisms of attenuation and immune response elicitation , but also the critical need to address these gaps in knowledge . Before 1 7D can be used extensively for other applications, such as heterologous vaccine development, the molecular mechanisms conferring its attenuatio n phenotypes must be 34 delineated because these vaccine candidates may retain the ability to cause SAEs. This knowledge will facilitate further studies into the mechanisms underlying SAEs and what can be done to improve the safety profile of 17D -based therapeutics in the future. 1.3 GAMMA -INTERFERON AND ITS ANTI -FLAVIV IRUS ACTIVITIES Type II interferon ( IFN-) is an important cytokine in both innate and adaptive immunity against many pathogens. IFN- is mainly produced by NK, NKT, lymphoid cells dendritic cells (238, 239) , neutrophils (240), and B cells (241) have been implicated to produce IFN- in certain experimental systems. The immune -modulatory functions of IFN- are important for suppressing intracellular pathogens in responsive cells. In addition to inducing antiviral states, similar to other IFNs, IFN- strongly induces nitric oxide, GTPases that modulate intracellular membranes, and proteins involved in antigen presentation (145, 242, 243) . In fact, deficiency in IFN- induction or response enhances susceptibility to intracellular pathogens ranging from bacteria, parasites, and vir uses, highlighting its broad role in antimicrobial immunity (244-247). 1.3.1 Induction and transcription r 1.3.1.1 Transcription regulation of IFN- The Ifng gene is composed of four exons spanning 5.5kb and a 600bp upstream promoter element located on chromosome 12 in human s and chromosome 10 in mice. Gene sequences and regulatory elements at this locus are high ly conserved between human s and mice. The Ifng 35 promoter contains binding site s for various transactivation factors such as STAT4, NF -B, GATA3 (248). Within the intronic regions of Ifng, hotspots of DNA methylation and histone modification sites also regulate its expression. Downstream of Ifng is the non-coding RNA Tmevpg1 that can enhance Ifng transcription (249). In addition, Ifng is flanked by multiple distal conserved noncoding sequences (IfngCNS) containing CpG sites and hot spots for histone modification located at lea st kilobases away from Ifng (248, 250) . These IfngCNS are important for fine-tuning tra nscriptional regulation of Ifng in T cells. Na\u00efve CD4 T cells are capable of differentiating into various lineages of helper T cells to exert specific immune function s, and IFN- is a signature cytokine of differentiation into the TH1 phenotype. In na\u00efve CD4 T cells, the Ifng promoter site is unmethylated; however, methylation at CpG sites of intronic regulatory element s and the absence of histone modifications that favors transcription (H3 -K4Me and AcH4) at the promoter , and intronic regulatory elements suppress Ifng transcription. T H1 signals such as IL -12 trigger epigenetic changes to the Ifng locus, leading to demethylation of intronic re including Chromatin enhances DNase sensitivity of this locus, indicating increased accessibility of the gene and active transcription . In contrast , TH2 stimuli such as IL-4 lead to hypermethylation of the Ifng promoter, suppressing expression of Ifng and differentiation towards the TH1 phenotype (250, 251) ; however, ectopic overexpression of T -bet in terminally differentiated T H2 overrides the repression and results in IFN- expression (252). The NF-B family transcription factors are activated by multiple pa thways and are important in IFN- expression in T and NK cells. The NF -B have been shown to pl ay important roles in T cell differentiation. Active NF -B complexes are composed of heterodimers of RelA/p50 or RelB/p52. Both RelA and RelB contain a transactivation domain and a DNA -binding domain, whereas p50 and p52, which contain only the latter, are implicated in gene repression; however, Bcl-3, which has a transactivation domain, can associate with p50 dimers, resulting in gene induction (253). NF-B in cytoplasm is normally sequestered by the inhibitor IB. Upon stimulation, IKK phosphorylates IB, leading to its degradation and release of the active NF -B complex, which enters the nucleus and activate s transcription of many genes, including proinflammatory cytokines (254). Expression of degradation -resistant IB in na\u00efve T cells suppresses T H1 polarization and IFN- expression (255). In addition, RelB -deficient T cells fail to express STAT4, T -bet, and IFN- upon IL-12 treatment (256, On the contrary, while p50- or Bcl-3-deficiency suppresses TH 2 differentiation upon IL -4 treatment, enhanced proliferation and IFN- secretion is detected in p50-deficient mice (257). Interestingly, deficiency in c -Rel does not affect T cell polarization, but c -Rel knockout mi ce are deficient in IFN- secretion by NK cells, indicating the influence of lym phocyte differentiation and IFN- production by NF-B family members is cell type -dependent (253, 257) . The long non -coding RNA located downstream of Ifng, Tmevpg1, also regulates Ifng expression (249). Tmevpg1 opens up chromatin by recruiting a Ifng i s insufficient for inducing IFN- and T-bet is required to stimulate IFN- transcription in CD4 T cells; concomitantly, e xpression of Tmevpg1 is controlled by STAT4 and T -bet (259). 37 1.3.1.2 Regulation of IFN- in NK cells Constitutive expression of Ifng positions NK cells to produce IFN- rapidly upon activation (235). NK cells can be activated by two major pathways - surface receptors and cytokines. NK cells express multiple surface receptors that regulate their activities. Activation receptors recognize the presence of stress signals such as MICA , specific C-type lectins, and antibodies on the target cells (234). These receptors are associated with ITAM -containing proteins, which upon activation, le ad to src family phosphotyrosine kinases pathways (234). Activation of MAPK kinase and subsequent calcium ion influx are critical for IFN - secretion for both murine and human NK cells, despite possessing different activating receptors. On the contrary, inhibitory receptors, which contain ITIMs, recognize MHC -I and dephospho rylate kinases downstream of src (260). Thus, the balance of activation and inhibitor y signals is an important fulcrum for IFN- production versus inhibition through this pathway. NK cells can also be activated by cytokines. IL -12p70, an active heterodimeric cytokine composed of p40 chains , is a prominent IFN- inducer that signals through STAT4. While the source for IL -12 is debatable and is likely immune context -dependent , macrophage s (261-263), dendritic cells (264, 265) , and PMNs (266, 267) have been implicated as IL -12 secretors. IL-12 also indirectly enhances IFN- expression (268, 269). IL-12 induces T -bet expression, which is the signature transcription factor for TH1 polarization . In murine NK cell s, while T-bet deficiency does not influence the capability to produce IFN-, T- bet is needed for sustained IFN - production; correspon dingly, T-bet binds to Ifng upstream of 38 the promoter site (252). IL-2 primarily signals through STAT3 and STAT5 , but it also activates STAT4 and MAPK in NK cells and lead s to IFN- production (270); it also enhances IFN- production independent of STAT4. Other proinflammatory cytokines cannot induce IFN- secretion alone but augment Ifng transcription in IL -12- and IL-2-responding cells. Type I IFN primarily signals through STAT1 and STAT2 but can also activate STAT4 to e nhance Ifng induction (271). IL-1 (272) and IL-18 (273), which activate NF-B, have also been shown to augment Ifng transcription. IL -15 may work in s ynergy with IL -18 to stimulate IFN- expression; moreover, IL -15 is a proliferation and maintenance signa l for mature NK cells. Deficiency in IL-15 or its receptor led to loss of NK cell s in mice (274, 275). On the other hand , IL-10 and TGF negati vely regulate induction of IFN-. IL-10 has been shown to b oth stimulate and inhibit IFN- production by NK cells through distinct mechanisms. While IL-10 augments IFN- production by activated NK cells (276), it also inhibits IL -12 production by myeloid ce lls, indirectly suppressing IFN- induction (277). tant negative regulator for IFN-. TGF signals through SMAD 3 complexes, which occupy the Ifng promoter, subsequently suppressing transcription (278, 279) . It also inhibits expression of STAT4 , IL-12R2, and T-bet, which are important for IFN- expression, but such inhibition can be count ered by IL -12, IL-15, and IL-18. 1.3.1.3 Regulation of IFN- in T cells Production of IFN- by T cells is contingent upon T cell maturation and differentiation. Thus, Ifng gene expression is tightly regulated in T cells. Activation signals from the TCR and ligation of CD28 to the co-stimulatory molecule s CD80 or CD 86 on antigen -presenting cells drive maturation of na\u00efve T cells. While na\u00efve CD8+ T cells have a strong tendency to mature into cytolyt ic lymphocytes that secrete IFN-, differentiation of CD4+ T cells require s additional 39 cytokine signal s. Similar to NK cells, IL-12 also promotes TH1 development and Ifng expression in T cells; however, STAT4-deficient cells are capable of producing a low level of IFN- in response to TCR ligation, suggesting IL -12/STAT4 signaling is needed for amplification but not initiation of IFN- transcription in CD4+ T cells. Sustained TH1 response and IFN- production requires STAT4 and T -bet (280). Activation signals and costimulation combined with IL -12 drive expression of T -bet and subsequent Hlx and Runx3 transcription. HLX is a homeobox transcript ion factor that increase s chromatin accessibility for Ifng (281). Sustained HLX expression in mature TH1 suggest its role in genetic imprinting and/or maintenance of the TH1 phenotype (282). T-bet and RUNX3 bind to and activa te the Ifng promoter while silencing IL -4 expression , further polarizing immune response to wards the type I phenotype (283). Secretion of IFN- by memory T cells (T MEM) is more rapid and has a lower threshold than na\u00efve T cell s. TMEM, especially CD8+ TMEM, are capable of producing IFN- within hours of stimulation by cytokine or antigen in the absence of costimulation (284). This can be attribute d to the h igher levels of IL -122 and IL-18 receptors in memory cells. 1.3.2 Signaling of IFN- Upon ligation of IFN- to the receptor complex IFNGR1/IFNGR2, JAK1 and JAK2 trans-phosphorylate each other and the receptor , creating docking sites for STAT1 and leading to the nucleus. Active pSTAT1 dimers induce expression of target genes regulated by the g amma- activated sequence (GAS) element. In the nucl eus, acetylation of pSTAT1 by CBP acetyltransferase lead to recruitment of phosphatases and inactivation of STAT1, which is 40 shuttled back to cytoplasm for re -activation (285). Maximum transactivation by STAT1 also requires activation of PI3K by the JAK kinases pho sphorylating and mTOR pathways in type - and stimulus -dependent manner . IFN- treatment results in transient activation and phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705 in a GSK3 - and src kinase- dependent ma nner, resulting in transcription of survival genes (289). MAPK is a signaling pathway that i nvolves cascades of kinases and results in activation of many IFN- activates the MAPKs JNK -1, activates While Erk1/2 is also phosphorylated in IFN--treated cells, modest effects are observed on inflammation and antigen presentation (290). Downstream of PI3K, Akt and mTO R are activated, which regulate mRNA translation. In macrophages, suppression of mTORC1 and translatio n upon IFN- treatment inhibits non- opsonized promotes autophagy (292). In fibroblasts and monocytes, mTORC2 is activated and necessary for induction of antiviral response s (293). Activation of additional signaling molecules such as STAT5 and CrkL/C3G has been reported also (294); however, their effects on immune modulation remain unclear . Termination of IFN- signaling is important as sustained interferon sig naling results in chronic inflammation that could be pathological. IFN- responses can be halted by inactivation of downstream signaling molecules and by abolishing IFN--receptor interaction . The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) molecules SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 (295, are downstream 41 of STAT1, inactivate JAK1/2 and provide negative fee dback to inhibit signaling. Mice lacking SOCS-1 rapidly succumb to autoimmunity and inflammation (297). Conversely, overexpression of SOCS proteins can reverse IFN--mediated chronic inflammation (298). The SOCS family molecules inhibit JAK-STAT signaling b y binding and sequestering JAKs (299-302) and/or targeting them for proteasome degradation (303). Tyrosine phosphatases such as TC-PTP and family phosphatase s inactivate IFN- signaling by dephosphorylating the receptor, JAK, and STAT1. Receptor endocytosis has also been hypothes ized to influence IFN- signaling. Upon ligation to the receptor, IFN-/IFNGR complex es are aggregated on lipid rafts and endocytosed in clathrin -coated pits, leading to degradation of IFN- by fusion with lysosome s. Alternatively, IFNGR has been reported to localize in cav-1-containing caveolae (304). While IFNGR is not endocytosed by caveolae, cav -1 acts like a SOCS protein by interacting with and inhibiting JAK2, and deficiency of cav -1 results in hyperactivation of JAK -STAT signaling and pathology in vivo. 1.3.3 Control of f laviviruses by IFN- Because IFN- signals through STAT1, establishment of innate antiviral state t hrough induction of ISGs is likely one mechanism for IFN- control of flaviviruses. Treatment of various cell types with IFN- inhibits replication of JEV, TBEV, WNV, and DENV in vitro (143-146). In mice lacking IFN- response, defects in viral control as early as one day has been reported (146). IFN--activated macrophages possess en hanced phagocytic activity and capacity to eliminate pathogens (305). One effector downstream to IFN- is induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which generates nitric oxide, a potent radical that can modify macromolecules (306). Inhibition 42 of JEV by IFN- treated on nitric oxide induction, as pharmacological inhibition of iNOS abolished the effects of IFN- (145). IFN- also influences the pathogenesis of various flaviviruses differently. IFN-- deficiency resulted in increased viral load in the spleen and the CNS of mice infected with WNV (146) and DENV (246), whereas in MVEV (140) and JEV (307) infection, only the CNS viral load was increased. Prophylactic treatment of NH Ps with IFN - suppressed WT YFV replication and delayed death (147). In addition, the sources of IFN- are also dependent on the virus and/or the model. IFN-, which regulates T cell differentiation and class switching, is also important in formation of memory response as 17D vaccinated IFN--deficient mice exhibited poor virus control upon intracereb ral challenge (308). 1.4 MAMMALIAN MODELS FOR YELLOW FE VER VIRUS Animal models are valuable for understanding host -pathogen interactions. Historically, YFV has been studied in multiple mammalian models that recapitulate various aspect of YFV biology, each with its own benefits and drawback s. A good animal model should recapitulate important aspects of human -pathogen interactions despite potential genetic and physiological discrepancies . Technical aspects including cost -effectiveness and availability of reagents ar e also critical. To model Y FV, considerations such as route and dose of infection, disease course and pathology, and immune response should be made. One major challenge for developing a small animal model for YFV is resi stance to disease by non -primates. One possible explanation is that, because YFV is transmitted between primates and mosquito es in nature, the virus may have 43 evolved to overcome the primate immune system but not necessaril y the murine immune system. In this section, common animal models for studying YFV will be briefl y discussed. 1.4.1 Non-human primate Genetic and physiological similarities between human and non -human primates (NHPs) ma ke NHPs valuable for studying YFV biology. In NHPs, subcutaneous ( s.c.) infection with virulent wild-type YFV le ads to viscerotropic diseas e similar to human YF, and vaccination with 17D leads to protection from wild -type virus challenge. The NHPs are valuable tool s for studying immunity, pharmaceuticals efficacy, vaccinology, pathogenesis, and ecology with respect to YFV; however, the cost, availability of molecular tools, and genetic variations among individual NHPs hinder the ir extensive use as a model (185, 309) . Furthermore , different species of NHPs, particularly old world versus new world monkeys , respond differently to YFV infection. Specifically, with the exception of rhesus and c ynomologous macaques, old world NHPs such as baboons experience milder disease than new world NHPs such as marmosets , which are highly susceptible to YFV infection (310). This is largely consistent w ith the fact that YFV originated in the old world and spread to other continents through slave trade ; hence, old world NHPs likely co-evolved with YFV and are more resistant to it. In rhesus macaques, infection with WT YFV usually le ads to a more rapid and se vere disease than in human s. Upon s.c. infection, s erum viremia is detectable at 3dpi and continues to increase until the host succumbs to disease, which often occurs within a week. In deceased monkeys, cytokine storm, lymphopenia, and n ecrosis in visceral organs like spleen, liver, and kidney are observed. D ecline in liver and kidney functions are detected within 24hr before death. Interestingly, YF V antigen is only detectable in liver but not spleen or kidney, suggesting soluble 44 mediators rather than vira l replication may contribute to YF V pathogenesis in this model (224, 309). In addition, express ion of zinc-binding proteins is disrupted in WT infection but not 17D vaccination in circulatory monocytes, which may explain the differential pathogenesis between virus strains. 1.4.2 Golden Syrian Hamster The Golden Syrian hamste r (Mesocricetus infection with WT strains of YFV results in viremia without obvious signs of disease in hamster; however, hamster-adapted WT virus strains of Asibi (216) and Jimenez (311, 312) lead to viscerotropic disease similar to human YF in this model. When compared to the parent Asibi strain, the hamster-adapted Asibi strain has 11 nucleotide changes, leading to seven amino acid changes. No nucleotide change occurs in the UTRs. Among these amino acid differences, five occur in the E protein, one in NS2A, and one in NS4A. While the contribution of these mutations to pathogenesis rem ains to be studied, it is likely that changes in E protein aid receptor binding or entry process es because most of these mutations are located at the exposed surface of domain III of E protein, which binds the receptor (216). The need to adapt the virus in hamster and the lack of immunological reagents renders direct comparison of 17D to Asibi difficult in the hamster model; however, this system has been useful in evaluating drug candidates against YFV . Two antiviral compounds, Flavip iravir (an RDRP inhibitor, known as T -705) (313) and BCX-4430 (a nucleoside analog) (314), have been shown to have potent antiviral activities against YFV in hamster s. It remains to be investigated if such results can t ranslate to human s clinically. Prophylactic treatment with IFN delivered by an adenovirus vector also protects hamsters from YFV infection (315). 45 1.4.3 House mouse The house mouse (Mus musculus ) from various backgrounds such as 129, BALB/c, Swiss, and C57BL/6 has bee n used for studying YFV . Immunocompetent a dult mice are highly resistant to peripheral infection with both WT and 17D virus es but are susceptible to i.c. infection t hat leads to encephali tic disease. However, this model does not rea dily distinguish 17D and WT strains. One way to circumvent the need for i.c. infection is neuroadaptation of YFV. Serial passaging of 17D in mouse brain suspension led to enhanced neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence and adult mice were susceptible to i.p. infection of the neuroadapted 17D (55). In contrast to adult mice , suckling mice are susceptible to peripheral infection with YFV through the i .p. route. While 17D and WT strains can be differentiated based on relative virulence, infection still results in lethal encephalitic disease and susceptibility to both viruses is age-dependent . Mice lacking various innate immune components have proven to be extremely valuable in studying YFV. From an evolutionary perspective, YFV circulates between mosqu itoes and NHPs but not rodents; thus, it is rational to reason that YFV has adapted to overcome antiviral mechanisms in primates more efficiently than in rodents. This is corroborated with reports that multiple flaviviruses antagonize human IFN response proteins more effi ciently than the murine Asibi in rhesus macaques is uniformly lethal whereas nude-athymic mice are protected (316), suggesting that murine innate immunity exerts a strong b lockade against YFV infection (317). Mice that lack the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR-/-) are highly susceptible to WT YFV infection and s.c. infection le ads to viscerotrop ic disease similar to human YF, including midzonal necrosis in liver, elevated cytokines, splenomegaly, and death (139). In contrast, while 17D vaccination in IFNAR-/- mice leads to serum viremia and viral replication in various tissues, 17D is avirulent and confers 46 protection to WT virus challenge afterwards, similar to human vaccinatio n. Despite the lack of type I IFN response s, IFNAR-/- mice vaccinated with 17D have robust , functional, and long-term protective immunity (210). Neutralizing antibody is the main protective factor against WT virus infection, and different lineages of T cells likely have differ ent protective roles. In the peripheral challenge model, which leads to viscerotropic disease in IFNAR-/- mice, CD4+ T cells and antibodies are important for protection, and some immune CD4+ T cells are cytolytic (210). However, i n an intracerebral challenge model in immunoco mpetent mice, CD8+ T cells and antibodies are needed instead (211). While the latter model uses a non -physiological route of infection, these data overall suggest that 17D elicits a diverse T cell response that plays distinct roles in protection in different anatomical regions. Interestingly, mice that lack both type I and type II IFN (IFNAGR-/-) are susceptible to 17D infection and disease (139, 318) . Intraperitoneal and s.c. infections with 17D are uniformly lethal in IFNAGR-/- mice. High 17D viral titer can be detected in both visceral and neuronal tissues at late stages of infection. These reports indicate that type II IFN is an attenuation factor for 17D, and IFNAGR-/- mice can serve as a potential model for severe adverse events associated with 17D vaccination. 1.5 HYPOTHESIS Despite the long history of 17D vaccinatio n and current efforts to utilize 17D as a vector for other vaccines or as a template for generation of LAVs for other flaviviruses , our understanding of 17D attenuation and YFV pathogenesis is limited. One major obstacle for understanding attenuation of YF V vaccine strain 17D is the lack of a small animal model that recapitulates 47 important aspects of YFV biology, i.e., differential virulence of WT strains and 17D upon s .c. infection where WT virus infection cau ses viscerotropic disease, and 17D vaccination confers immunity. Most previous mouse studies on YFV were performed by i.c. infection, which led to neurologic disease. These studies have highlighted the importance of envelope glycoprotein and NS1 glycosylation as virulence determinant s. However, the lac k of differential virulence between 17D and Asibi in i .c. infection models suggests the need for a more stringent animal model to study human -YFV interactions. The mechanisms of 17D attenuation remain elusive. As described above, regarding viral attenuatio n factors, Lee et al. reported that enhanced glycosaminoglycan binding of 17 D due to genetic changes in E -380 led to enhanced viral clearance from serum and attenuation; however, reversion of this mutation alone wa s insufficient to restore virulence to WT level, suggesting multiple mutations are involved in attenuation (27). In addition, one report suggested that 17D enters susceptible human cells through a clathrin -independent pathway whereas Asibi uses clathrin-coated pits (217). This phenome non is due to genetic c hanges in the E protein but E -380 alone cannot confer the phenotype. On the host side, we and others have reported that mice that lack both type I and II IFN system s are highly susceptible to 17D infection while mice that lack only the type I IFN receptor are resistant to peripheral infection, indicating that type II IFN is an attenuation factor in vivo (139, 210, 318) . A recent study also suggested the potential neuroprotective role of type III IFN in 17D infection (151); however this study used the intravenous route of infection with a non -physiological high dose (107 PFU) of virus , which renders relevance of the data to human vaccinees questionable. Previous studies from our lab have developed a mouse model that recapitul ates the important aspects of YFV infection in humans (139, 210) . In this model, mice lacking the type I 48 IFN receptor ( IFNAR-/-) are resistant to 17D infection and disease but suscepti ble to WT YFV infection and disease through the s.c. route. WT virus infection le ads to viscerotropic disease signs, including mid -zonal necrosis of liver and loss of l ymphoid follicle s in the spleen, whereas 17D vaccination in IFNAR-/- mice confers protective immunity against WT virus challenge for more than 18 months post -vaccination. Upon challenge, v accinated IFNAR-/- mice has no sign of disease and the virus titer is almost undetectable. In addition, we and other s have reported that additional deletion of the type II IFN receptor renders the ani mal susceptible to 17D disease , indicating IFN- is an important attenuation factor for 17D (139, 318) . Based on these results , I propose the following hypotheses for my studies: 1. IFN- restricts 17D viral replication and dissemination in vivo. 2. IFN- is directly antiviral to 17D but not wild -type YFV. The results of this study w ill advance our understanding of one mechanism of attenuation of YFV vaccine strain 17D and will provide insights on generating live attenuated flaviviruses as vaccine candidates . 49 2.0 PATH OGENESIS OF 17D IN T HE ABSENCE OF GAMMA -INTERFERON SIGNALING 2.1 PREFACE Most of the w ork described in this chapter are adapted from a published study (LK Metthew Lam, Alan M. Watson, Kate D. Ryman, William B. Klimstra, 2018, NPJ Vaccines 3, article number 5). 2.2 INTRODUCTION YFV is the prototypical member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, which includes many important arthropod -borne pathogens such as dengue, Zika, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. YFV is estimated to cause 200,000 c ases of disease and 30,000 mortalities annually (184). Historically, YFV has caused devastating outbreaks in North America, South America, Africa, and Europe but is currently endemic to sub -Saharan Africa and South America. However, a recent Y F outbreak in Angola led to at least 300 deaths (319) and 10 symptomatic traveler -associated cases in China (180). In addition, outbreaks that occurred in Esp\u00edrito Santo in 2017 , which is not considered at risk for YFV historically, and Uganda in 2011, which has not experience YFV outbreak since 1972 , suggest that YFV remains a problem in the 50 modern world and threatens to expand geographically (320, 321) . Mosquito abatement programs and vaccination with the live-attenuated YFV vaccine strain 17D remain the primary strategies for controlling YF outbreaks (169, 322) . The YFV vaccine strain , 17D, is arguably one of the most effective vaccines ever developed. A single dose of 17D results in seroconversion in >90% of vaccinees within a week and can offer essentially life -long immunity against YFV infections (196, 323) . While the saf ety record of 17D is exemplary, potentially lethal severe adverse events occur with low frequency and these can involve both viscerotropic an d neurotropic manifestations of virus disease (221, 227, 230, 324, 325) . Regardless, due to the overall safety and effectiveness of 17D, multiple candidate vaccine vectors have been created using its genetic backbone , and these are currently being tested as a delivery system for antigens of other flavivirus es or other pathogens (326-329). Despite being safe and effective, the mechanisms for attenuation and immunogenicity of 17D remain elusive. The 17D vaccine strain was derived by Max Theiler in 1930s through serial passaging of wild-type YFV st rain Asibi in tissue culture, resulting in loss of viscerotropism and neurovirulence in non-human primates (330). including 17D -204, 17D-213, and 17DD have been generated and used for vaccination (331), with similar efficacy (207, 332) . An average of 48 nucleotide and 20 amino acid changes d istinguish 17D substrains from the parent Asibi strain (333, 334) . The attenuatio n of 17D is attributed to genetic differences in both structural and non -structural proteins, but the role of specific mutations in the attenuation phenotype is not well characterized. Lee et al. suggested that a positive -charge mutation in the 17D E prote in that leads to enhanced glycosaminoglycan binding, contributes to attenuation, but attenuation likely involves multiple 17D loci (27). It was recently demonstrated that E protein mutations allow 17D to enter susceptible cells through clathrin -independen t 51 pathways, leading to an enhanced antiviral response in vitro (217). We recently reported that both neutralizing antibody and CD4+ T cells are important in 17D -mediated protection from lethal wild-type YFV infection in a viscerotropic disease m odel (210). However, questions remain regarding the specific virus -host interactions that are modified by the 17D attenuating mutations and the mechanisms through which 17D induces highly protective immune responses. Understanding of the mechanisms of 17D attenuation will prom ote informed design of live attenuated versions of other flaviviruses and vaccines derived from other virus types. To assess the specific host interactions affected by 17D attenuating mutations, we h ave used a pathophysiologically relevant mouse model to study host -pathogen interactions of YFV. Many WT flaviviruses, including YFV, replicate extremely poorly in mice with a functioning type I IFN system, precluding study of the roles of other host factors in their pathogenesis. Flaviviruses are more effecti ve at antagonism of human type I IFN signaling than the analogous mouse responses (78, 91). Indeed, mice deficien t in the type I interferon ( IFN-/) receptor (AB6) are susceptible to viscerotropic disease and lethality after s.c. infection with wild -type YFV strains Asibi and Angola71 (139). Interestingly, s.c. infection of 17D in AB6 mice, which mimics vaccination, does not cause discernable disease and results in life -long immunity against challenge with a WT virus strain Angola71 (210). However, mice lacking both type I and type II IFN receptor s (AGB6) are susceptible to lethal infection by 17D by either subcutaneous or intraperitoneal route s (27, 139, 318) . The fact that the additional deficiency of the type II IFN (IFN-) receptor renders 17D infection lethal in AB6 mice suggests that the type II IFN system plays a critical role in attenuation of 17D in vivo. To begin t o understand the effects of IFN- on 17D, we have compared infection of AB6 and AGB6 mice. IFN- restricted 17D virus replication and dissemination early during infection 52 and enhanced clearance late r after infection. Antiviral gene induction and cytokine production was also influenced by the presence or absence of type II IFN signaling. Finally, 17D infection resulted in liver stress and histological abnormalities in the spleen and brain of AGB6 but not AB6 mice, demonstrating that both viscerotropic and neurotropic diseases occurred in the absence of IFN- signaling and revealing a possible applicat ion for the AB6 model in understanding vaccine -associated viscerotropic and neurotropic adverse events. 2.3 RESULTS 17D but not virulent YFV in the role of IFN- in attenuation we compared pathogenesis of AB6 and AGB6 mice. Groups of 6 -week-old mice were infected subcutaneously with 104 PFU of YFV strains 17D -204 or Angola71 in both of the hind limb footpads . The virulent WT strain Angola71 was used as control. Similar to our previous reports (139, 210) , Angola71 -infected mice experienced severe weight loss and disease, requiring euthanasia (AST 7.5 +/ - 0.6dpi), whereas 17D -204 was uni in AB6 mice. In contrast, 17D-204-infected AGB6 mice experienced severe weight loss and eventually succumbed to disease (AST 10.75 +/ - 0.5dpi) (Fig. which peaked b etween 7 -8dpi (Fig. 3C). In addition to footpad swelling, 17D -204-infected AGB6 mice displayed signs of brain infection and neurologic disease including hind limb paralysis, paresis, and/or seizures at late stage s of infection , before euthanasia (Fig . 3D). 53 Figure 3: IFN- YFV Groups of 6 -week-old were s.c. with 104 PFU YFV 17D -204 or Angola71. (A) Survival, (B) weight loss, (C) footpad swelling, and (D) symptoms of diseases were measured daily. Data in (A) are analyzed with log -rank test. Data in (B) and (C) are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. (17D -204 infections, n >6; Angola71 infections, n = 4.) 2.3.2 IFN- restricts 17D replication and replication in vivo Because IFN- influenced survival o f mice after 17D -204 infection, we hypothesized that virus replication is reduced and re stricted in its presence . Thus, we compared 17D virus replication kinetics in different tissues of the AB6 and AGB6 mice. In parallel, tissues from 17D -204- infected wil d-type (C57BL/6) mice were harvested , but no infectious virus was recovered from any sampled tissue (Fig 4A-F). 54 The regional lymph node draining the site of infection (DLN) is one of the earliest sites for flavivirus replication and important for seeding v iremia and dissemination (139). At 1dpi, 17D-204 virus was recovered from the DLN in both AB6 and AGB6 mice. In the absence of the IFN- response, 17D -204 virions were more abundant as early as at 1dpi (Fig. 4A). Serum viremia was first observed at 2dpi; however, no significant difference was obs erved in AB6 versus AGB6 at this time point. 17D-204 virions were detectable in bone marrow as pirate and spleen at 2dpi only in the absence of IFN- response. However, by 4dpi, high virus titers were observed in the spleen, bone aspirate, non -draining lymph nodes (mesenteric LN) , and adrenal glands in both types of mice (Fig. 4C-G), although, highe r virus titers were observed in AGB6 mice in most of these tissues. Interestingly, infectious virus particles were recovered from kidney, liver, and brain in AGB6 mice but not with AB6 mice (Fig. 4F, H-I). In the presence of IFN- responses, virus clearanc e was observed from most organs by 8dpi, but virions were still detected in all sampled organs in AGB6 mice at this time. Despite lacking both type I and type II IFN, virus clearance was observed in most the non -CNS tissues of AGB6 mice by 12dpi, before they succumbed to disease. In contrast, virus replication in the brain increased through 12 dpi (up to 106 PFU/g) in the AGB6 mice ( Fig. 4F), through the times when neurological signs were observed (Fig. 3D). Overall, in the presence of IFN-, 17D-204 replication was controlled as early as 1dpi. Some dissemination of virus still occurred in AB6 mice, but the peak viral load was significantly lower than that of AGB6 mice. Virus tro pism was also restricted by IFN-, most notably absent from liver and brain , and virus clearance was obse rved in most tissues by 8dpi. In the absence of IFN- response s, virus clearance occurred lat er and replication in the CNS tissues was poorly controlled. 55 Figure 4: IFN- restricts 17D -204 replication and dissemination in vivo. Tissues from 17D -204-infected mice were harvested at various days post -infection (B6 = C56BL/6) . Tissues were homogenized, and virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay on Huh7 cells.

(* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0 .005; **** p < 0.001; multiple t -test, corrected by Holm -Sidak viscerotropic and neurotropic Because 17D is known to cause viscerotropic and neurotropic infection in vaccine-associated SAE cases, we sought to determine if tissue pathology could be detected after 17D inf ection in the absence of an IFN- response. We investigated tissue pathology at 4dpi, which is the peak of viral replication in most visceral organs in both AB6 and AGB6 mice and 11dpi, when AGB6 animals displayed neurologic signs before succumb ing to disease. At 4dpi, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained 17D -204-infected AB6 and AGB6 mice were indistinguishable mock -infected animals. In contrast, spleens of Angola71 -infected mice displayed loss of splenic architecture and increase in inflammatory infiltrates , similar to our previous findings (139). Despite the lack of titerable virus in the spleen at 11dpi (Fig . 4C), spleens of 17D -204-infected AGB6 had increased numbers of inflammatory infiltrates and exhibited a loss of splenic architecture (Fig . 5A). Immunostaining of spleen sectio ns from infected AB6 and AGB6 mice demonstrated the presence of YFV antigens in F4/80+ cells (red pulp macrophages) and cells in the outer marginal zone (Fig . 5B) at 4dpi at similar level s. H&E- stained liver sections revealed microsteatosis occurring only in the liver of 17D -204-infected AGB6 mice at 4dpi (Fig . 6A), a time at which virions were detectable in the liver (Fig . 4E), and thus, indicative of a viscerotropic phase of 17D infection in the absence of IFN- responses. Moreover, YFV antigen could be d etected in some F4/80+ cells in the liver of infected AGB6 mice, suggesting that Kupffer cells were infected in these animals (Fig . 6B). Corresponding to the time of neurological signs in 17D -204-infected AGB6 mice (11dpi, Fig. 3 D), we observed an increase in immune infiltration to the cerebral cortex (Fig. 7A) and virus -infected cells in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of the brain (Fig. 7B), indicative of neurotropic d isease. No such phenomena were detectable in 17D -204 infected AB6 animals. Overall, t he histology data 57 Figure 5: 17D infection led to splenic damage in the absence of IFN-.

In (A) H&E stained brain sections, -204-infected AGB6 mice but not AB6 or mock -infected animals had increased cellular infiltration into the cerebral cortex at 11dpi. Concomitantly, YFV antigens can be detected demonstrate that IFN- restricts 17D-204 dissemination and pro mice from viscerotropic and neurotropic diseases. 2.3.4 Cytokine induction is impaired in the absence of IFN- IFN- is central to activation of T cells and macrophages, and induces production of other proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we hypot hesized that the absence of IFN- would impact cytokine production during 17D infection. To this end, serum cytokine levels in infected mice were measured at various times post -infection using t he Cytokine 20 -plex Mouse Panel (Fig. 8). In AB6 mice, serum levels of IFN-, IL-12p40, MIG, MCP -1, and IP -10 were elevated transiently versus uninfected controls on day 4pi, corresponding to the peak spleen virus titer (Fig. 4D). While AGB6 mice also exhibited a slight increase in serum IL -12 and MCP -1 levels on day 4pi, se rum IFN- levels were highly elevated in comparison with control or AB6 mice on this day and at days 8 and 12pi. Wild -type YFV -infected 17D- infected AB6 or AGB6 mice ( Fig. 8), possibly associated with the severe viscerotropic disease and rapid death of the WT virus -infected animals (139). The cytokines that were more significantly upregulated in 17D-204-infected AB6 but not AGB6 mice, i.e. IL -12, MCP-1, MIG, and IP-10, are al l IFN--inducible, sugge stive of a central role for IFN- in protecting AB6 mice from 17D -204 infection is through cytokine induction. Similar to our observations, in adult male vaccinees YFV vaccine substrain MIG, IP-10, and IFN- were reported to be elevated (191). 61 Figure 8: Cytokine response of 17D -infected animal. Groups of 6 -week-old B6, AB6, or AGB6 mic e were infected PFU of YFV 17D -204 or Angola71. Sera were harvested at the indicated time points post -infection by the bleeding at submandibular vein.

To confirm the role of NK cells in IFN- production in vivo, we performed antibody - mediated depletion of NK1.1+, CD4+, or CD8+ T cells in 17D -infected mice. In both AB6 and AGB6 mice, NK1.1+ cell depletion led to a reduction in serum IFN- levels at 4dpi (Fig. 11B), supporting the flow cytometry data identifying NK1.1+ cells as a primary source of IFN-. Depletion of CD8+ T cells in AGB6, but not AB6, animals also led to reduction in serum IFN- levels. NK1.1+ cell depletion also resulted in enhanced 17D replication in AB6 mice ( Fig. 11C), likely due to less IFN- production. However, depletion of NK1.1+ cells resulted in re duced virus titer in AGB6 mice, which may be due to the recently documented replication of 17D in NK1.1+ cells in the absence of IFN-/ and IFN- signaling (335). 65 Figure 11: NK cells are important for IFN- production.

One major restriction on understanding YF pathogenesis has been the lack of pathophysiologically relevant and cost - effective small animal models for studying YFV pathogenesis and attenuation. Previously, we reported that mice lacking type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-/-) are susceptible to subcutaneous (s.c.) infection of wild -type YFV and display signs of viscerotropic disea se similar to human YF, whereas 17D is avirulent in this model system (139). In addition, 17D -infection leads to protective immunity against wild -type YFV challenge for the life of the mouse (210). However, we and othe rs have reported that 17D is virulent in mice lacking both type I and type II IFN receptors (IFNAGR-/-), suggesting that type II IFN is a critical attenuation factor for 17D in vivo. In this study, we investigated the role of IFN- in controlling replication of 17D in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that type II IFN restricts 17D replication and spread in vivo. By comparing 17D -204 pathogenesis in AB6 and AGB6 mice, we found that 17D-204 replication was largely restrict ed to lymphoid compartments by IFN -. In the absence of IFN- response, 17D -204 infection in AGB6 mice rapidly disseminated to tissues beyond DLN, spleen, and bone marrow. In addition to higher viral titers, we observed signs of liver stress and recovered infe ctious virus particles in the liver on 4dpi, indicative for a viscerotropic phase of 17D infection with the additional abse nce of IFN- responses. Despite viral clearance in the peripheral tissues, virus accumulated to high titer in the brain and was associated with signs of neurological disease including immune cell recruitment to brain and paralysis. Taking together our data and those of other reports (139, 318) , we propose that 17D -infected AGB6 mice could be used to model neurotropic SAEs associated with 17D vaccination. Despite the presence of a 67 brief viscerotropic phase of 17D -204 infection in AGB6 mice, we did no t observe cytokine storm comparable to Angola71 -infected AB6 mice or extensive damage to the visceral organs (which can be found in viscerotropic SAE patients (227)), with the exception the spleen late during infection. These data indicate involvement of additional or alternative factors, such as host genetics (230, 336) and/or 17D genetic variants, both of which have been proposed as sources of SAE (231). Consistent with other studies of 17D vaccination in mice (160) and non-human primates (NHP) (337), we observed an early induction of IFN- after 17D -204 vaccination in our mouse model. Such early induction of IFN- resulted in contemporaneous restriction of 17D -204 AB6 mice. In both AB6 and AGB6 mice, NK1.1+ cells were critical for IFN- production; however, in AGB6, CD8+ T cells (CTL) w ere also involved. Lymphocyte activation is driven by antigen abundance , and the high virus titers in AGB 6 mice may have contributed to more robust CTL activation and IFN- production than in AB6 mice. In addition, a recent report has shown that CTL and NK cells can be infected by 17D in the absence of STAT1 (335). In that report, deletion of STAT1 in the hematopoietic compartment render ed mice susceptible to intravenous 17D infection, and enhanced 17D replication in leukocytes from both myeloid and lymphoid lineages was detected in the spleen and the blood . Thus, we speculate that infection of both CTL and NK cells lead s directly or indirectly to IFN- secretion. Whereas i n AB6 mice, the presence of IFN- response partially protects T cells directly through inducing an antiviral state and/or indirectly through control of virus titer, le aving NK cells as the major IFN- producer. Although deficiency in IFN- receptor led to early virus dissemination and uncontrolled replication, peripheral clearance is also observed in AGB6 mice by 12dpi, which is suggestive of a type II IFN -independent viral clearance mechanism . The nature of this response also needs to 68 be investigated, as it may be important in minimizing pathological consequences of 17D immunization such as SAEs. It should be noted that despite the lack of both type I and type II IFN responses, some antiviral genes were upregulated in our model, especial ly in the DLN and spleen. These genes may be induced directly without type I or type II through RIG -I and MDA5 (124), toll-like receptors (129, 338) , or type III IFN (149, 339) , which may aid eventual viral clearance from the periphery even in AGB6 mice. However, it was recently reported that mice lacking both type I and type III IFN receptors had higher 17D titers in the brain but not other tissues when compared to mice lacking IFNAR 1 alone, suggestive of a neuroprotective role for type III IFN (151). One major criticism of the AB6 model is the lack of a type I IFN response. However, evidence suggests that infection of these mice recapitulates important aspects of YFV infection and vaccination of human , namely, visce rotropic disease during WT virus infection and long - term protective immunity after 17D vaccination (139, 210) . Indeed, robust, protective B and T cell responses to 17D are present in these animals (210). In human vaccinees, the presence of type I IFN does not prevent 17D replication and establishment of serum viremia or mild reactions at the site of vaccination. Whereas in C57 BL/6 mice, the p resence of type I IFN suppressed 17D replication to the point that replicating viruses cannot be detected by conventional assays, and infected mice do not have local reactions such as footpad swelling after infection. This suggests that YFV is more resistant to , or more capable of suppressing, the human type I IFN system than the murine counterpart. In fact, dengue and Zika virus are more effective in antagonizing human innate immune signaling molecules (STAT2 and STING) than murine homologs (78, 91, 92) . Together, these observ ations suggest that the type I IFN receptor - deficient mouse is a pathophysiologically relevant model that is valuable in exploring the 69 immunogenicity , pathogenicity , and attenuation mechanisms of different YFV strains. However, clearly, type I IFN very lik ely has a role in controlling YFV in humans (193, 340) . The cause for the severe adverse events (SAEs) following 17D vaccination is still unknown. Despite the adaptation of monkey neurovirulence test to ensure safety of each vaccine lot, SAEs still occur, suggesting additional factors are contributing to virulence of 17D in SAE patients. In terms of host genetics, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CCR5 and RANTES genes were found in one viscerotropic SAE case (230), while SNPs in OAS1 were found in another (336). These polymorphisms are implicated in aberrant immune response upon 17D vaccination. In terms of virus genetics, mutations were found in some clinical isolates from SAE patients, and some, but not all of the viruses demonstrated enhanced virulence in animal models (341). Our data suggest that IFN- is an attenuating factor against 17D in vivo, leading us to hypothesize that variability of host IFN- signaling is one potential underlying causes for SAEs. In human s, genetic differences that disturb IFN- production or signa ling have been shown to enhance susceptibility to infections. For instances, heritable mutations in the IL -12 receptors, which are critical for IFN- induction, and IFN- receptors that reduce receptor expression or signaling efficacy render individuals su sceptible to Salmonella and disseminated Mycobacterium infections (342-344); importantly, these individuals are also susceptible to the disease cause by the generally s afe M. bovis BCG vaccine strain (343). This evidence indicates that primary immunodeficiency in IFN- signaling efficacy may influence th e ability to control some pathogens . This may explain some 17D SAEs. NK cells are important early producer for IFN - (160), and NK cells are rob ustly activated in vaccines by three days post -vaccination (159). Since flaviviruses upregulate MHC -I early during infection to suppress activation of NK cells 70 (166, 345) , it is tempting to speculate that defects in NK cell activation of the vaccinees due to genetics or environmental factors may delay virus control and increase risk of SAE. These studies have revealed that the murine IFN--mediated response protects IFNAR-/- mice from disease and promotes the eventual development of robust and long -lived protective immunity against wild -type YFV challenge (170) similar to human vaccination. In contrast, the lack of an IFN- response renders 17D virulent and leads to viscerotropic and neurologic disease and eventual death, potentially similar to human SAEs. Enhanced sensitivity to IFN or particular ISGs has been documented in several arbovirus LAVs (346-348). Thus, the deliberate creation of an IFN- sensitive phenotype may be a productive approach to rational design of new live attenuated vaccine ( LAV) candidates against arboviruses. This will require identification of the mutations in 17D that under lie this phenotype. 71 3.0 YELLOW FEVER VIRUS 17 D IS MORE SENSITIVE THAN WT YFV TO ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITIES INDUCED BY GAMMA -IFN IN MYELOID CELLS 3.1 PREFACE Most of the work described in this chapter is adapted from a published study (LK Metthew Lam, Alan M. Watson, Ka te D. Ryman, William B. Klimstra, 2018, NPJ Vaccines 3, article number 5). 3.2 INTRODUCTION Interferons are innate immune cytokines that exert important roles on restriction and clearance of invading pathogens. The three types of IFN are critical for controlli ng various pathogens, including flaviviruses . Sensitivity of pathogen to IFN response s can influence the pathologic outcome of an infected host, and some attenuated pathogens or live attenuated vaccine candidates are more sensitive to IFN s (346-348). Conversely, many pathogenic flaviviruses are equipped with multiple mechanisms to subvert the IFN response, by suppressing IFN induction and signaling and interfering with downstream an tiviral effectors (91, 92, 121, 144) . Different cell types have different responsiveness to IFN due to such factor as their steady -state gene expression , expression of IFN receptor, gene regulation pathways, and local environment, 72 rendering some more susceptible to virus infectio n (149, 349) . Type II IFN has important roles in triggering TH1-biased adaptive immunity, and at the innate level, it has been shown to be directly antiviral to DENV , WNV, and TBEV (143, 144, 146) . In IFN- activates and enhances the antimicrobial response of macrophages by inducing iNOS, pro -inflammatory cytokines, and respiratory burst , which are important for clearance of many intracellular pathogens . Based on our work on characterizing the role of IFN- in the IFNAR-/- mouse model, we observed that IFN- restricts 17D dissemination and replication as early as 2dpi, prior to activation of adaptive immunity. Thus, we hypothesize that 17D is inhibited by the innate antiviral activities of IFN-. In the current studies, w e have compared virus replication of YFV in vitro in various cell types treated with IFN- or IFN-/. We foun d that both interferons inhibit of both 17D -204 and Angola71; however, 17D -204 is more sensitive to the antiviral activities induced by IFN-. In addition, such differential inhibition of YFV by IFN- occurs in myeloid, but not non-myeloid cells, suggestive of cell type -dependent IFN antiviral activities. 3.3 RESULTS 3.3.1 17D-204 is more sensitive to the IFN--induced antiviral state than WT -YFV in myeloid cells but not non -myeloid cells Based on our observations that 1) AGB6 mice succumbed to 17D -204 infection but not AB6 mice (Fig. 3A); 2) 17D -204 replicated to higher titer and disseminated faster in AGB6 mice than AB6 (Fig. 4 ); 3) IFN- induction in infected AB6 and AGB6 mice occurred as as 2dpi 73 (Fig. 9); 4) Angola71 -infected -infected AB6 (Fig . 8), yet infection was not controlled in the Angola71 -infected mice; 5) Angola71 - related mortality was delayed in AB6 versus AGB6 mice ( Fig. 3A); and 6) repo rts that IFN- inhibited flavivirus infection in vitro (143, 144, 146) , we hypothesized that IFN- induces an antiviral state that can generally inhibit YFV replication in vitro and in vivo and that enhanced sensitivity to the IFN - antiviral state is a prominent attenuation mechanism of 17D. To test this hypothesis, we compared virus replication of 17D -204 and Angola71 in various relev ant cell types treated with IFN- or IFN-/. Consistent with the hypothesis, we observed a dose - dependent inhibition of 17D -204 and Angol a71 virus ow- macrophages (BMM) and dendritic cells (BMDC) derived C57BL/6 mice (Fig . 12). In addition, 17D -204 was significantly more inhibited than Angola71 by an equivalent dose of IFN- or IFN-/. Since basal replication, which may be different bet ween the viruses, can potentially induce diffe rent levels of IFN-/ in cultured cells and alter sensitivity measurements, we performed the same experiments using cells that lack the ability to produce (IRF3x5x7-/- cells, Fig. 12B, E, I, L ) or respond to ( AB6 cells) IFN-/ (Fig. 12C, F). Cells derived from AGB6 mice, which cannot respond to either type of IFN, were also included as negative controls (Fig. 12G, J). While 17D -204 and Angola71 multiply still sign ificantly more inhibited by IFN- than Angola71. To determine if IFN - has a broad -spectrum effect on YFV replication, we also measured the IFN - sensitivity of YFVs i n immortalized mouse (MEFs) or a human hepatoma line ( Huh7). We did not observe significant differences between the viruses to either IFN-/ or IFN- treatment (Fig. 13), suggesting that 17D -204 and Angola71 are differentially inhibited by IFN--induced antiviral state in a c ell-specific manner. 74 Figure 12: YFV -17D is more sensitive to IFN--induced antiviral states than wild -type strain Angola71 in myeloid cells . 75 Indicated cells were treated with IFN 12hrs prior to infection.

Thus, we compared antiviral gene expression in 17D-204-infected animals and myeloid cells. Antiviral genes such as Igtp and Ifit2 were selected because they are robustly induced by IFN - (350), and Ifit2 has been shown to protect mice from WNV infection (351). These genes were upregulated similarly in DLN of both AB6 and AGB6 mice; however, in are preferent ially upregulated the presence of IFN - response (Fig. 14A-B). This may be attributed to a combination of viral induction and IFN --mediated induction AB6 mice resulted in induction of Igtp and Ifit2 but not from AGB6 mice (Fig. 14C-F). These results suggest myeloid cell activation by IFN - may contribute to restriction of 17D in vivo. 77 Figure 14: IFN- treatment in vitro induces antiviral ge nes that are upregulated in 17D -infected AB6 mice. with 17D -204.

(*: p<0.05, ** p <0.01 ; multiple t -test, corrected by Holm -Sidak method.) 3.4 DISCUSSION To provide insight into the mechanism for IFN--mediated attenuation of 17D, we compared sensitivity of WT and 17D viruses to IFN-. We found that 17D-204 is more sensitive to the antiviral activities of IFN- than wild-type YFV in myeloid, but not non -myeloid, cells in vitro. While the role that IFN- plays in inducing protective immunity against 17D requires further study, our data sug gest one mechanism by which IFN- controls 17D is through inducing a direct antiviral response, especially in macrophages and DCs. Correspon dingly, antiviral Igtp and are also upregulated in myeloid cells treated with IFN -. This leads us to speculate that myeloid cells act as a gateway for restricting 17D in vivo through an IFN --dependent mechanism. Because IFN - induces a large network of antiviral genes (350), it is very likely that multiple ISGs are participating in inhibition of YFV replication cycle. Since we also observe the lack of viral antigens in the liver of 17D-204-infected AB6 mice, genes differentially upregulated in the presence of IFN - response, such as Igtp, may be important downstream effector s to IFN- in attenuation of 17D and protect ion of visceral organs like the liver . Cell-type specific effects of IFN- have been pr eviously observed. In mice, an IFN-- induced antiviral state in hibits murine cytomegalovirus more robustly in macrophages than in MEF (349). IFN- induces different gene expression profiles in human DCs and macrophages 79 (352). Furthermore, the maturation state of macrophages affe cts the binding of STAT1 to IFN-- activated promoter sites (353). Clearly, further work is n eeded to eluci date the role of specific IFN--induced antiviral effectors in suppression of 17D replication. In addition to ISG induction, specific innate antiviral activities in myeloid cells have been documented for IFN -. IFN-- induced nitric oxide inhibits replication of JEV in macrophage s in vitro (145). The function of nitric oxide in the context of flavivirus inf ection is currently unknown. N itric oxide is a potent radical specie s that modifies biomolecules (306), which may modify viral proteins (354), nucleic acid (355), or host factors (356) and interfere the virus replication cycl e (145). Pathogens th at modify host lipid membranes, such as murine and in macrophages (242). As flaviviruses modify the host membrane extensively for replication and polyprotein processing, YFV is likely also sensitive to these membrane -modulatory GTPases. Myeloid cell s derived from mice lacking iNOS and/or immune - related GTPases can be useful to determine whether these factors attenuate17D. In addition to IFN--dependent antiviral activities in the host, t he specific mutations in 17D responsible for the increased IFN- sensitivity , and how these mutations increase susceptibility to individual antiviral effectors , need to be identified . Other than mutations in E protein that confer increased GAGs binding (27), the effects of mutations in 17D have yet to be characterize d. The mutations M -L36F and NS4B -I95M that differentiate between WT strains and attenuated strains (17D substrains and French neurotropic vaccine strain) are possible candidates for influencing IFN- sensitivity (212). For M-L36F, substitution of the analogous amino acid in JEV resulted in a mutant deficient in virion maturation and virus particl e production (213). NS4B from various flaviviruses is an antagonist of IFN signaling and inhibits STAT1 translocation (84) and is also critical for usurping the host membrane to generate sites for virus 80 replication and polyprotein processing . The mutation E-G52R is also a potential candidate as it is also mutated in cell culture-adapted JEV and contributes to reduction of peripheral virulence and altered entry kinetics (213). E-G52R is located at the hinge region important for conformational changes during fusion; however, substitution of the analogous mutation in DENV2 does not alter fusion kinetics, sugges tive of virus -specific role o f this residue (220). Another potentially important mutation is the poorly characterized NS5 -P901L, which is present in the attenuated strains 17D and HeLa -p6. This mutation is located at the C-terminus tail of NS5 and does not a have known regulatory function in viral replication. It is possible that these mutations, alone or in combination with other 17D mutations, cou ld influence sensitivity to IFN-. 81 4.0 CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE DI RECTIONS The YFV live attenuated vaccine strain 17D is arguably one of the best LAVs available. In addition to offering long -term protection, the genetic backbone of 17D has been used to develop vaccine candidates against other pathogens (326-328). However, o ur understanding of the mechanisms of YFV 17D attenuation remains incomplete. Understanding the factors contributing to a ttenuation and immunogenicity will also be valuable for future rational design of LAV candidates for other flaviviruses or pathogens. In addition, potentially lethal severe ad verse events after 17D vaccination and the concerns of YFV re -emergence beyo nd current geographical boundaries highlight the need to further understand attenuation of 17D. In contrast to primates, WT mice are highly resistant to peripheral infection of YF V, which complicates the studying of YFV pathogenesis and immunology in a pathophysiologically relevant context. To understand YFV -host interaction, we used m ice lacking the type I IFN response (AB6), which are susceptible to s.c. infection of wild-type YFV but resistant to 17D infection. Wild -type virus causes viscerotropic disease in AB6 mice while 17D infection results in long-term immunity. Such similarity to human -YFV interaction s prompted us to investigate host factors important in YFV attenuation. In this study , we have characterized the role of the host type II IFN system as an attenuation factor against 17D in a pathophysiologically relevant mouse model. 82 Our study revealed the importance of IFN- in controlling 17D in vivo (summarized in Fig. 15). By comparing 17D replication kinetics and pathogenesis in AB6 and AGB6 mice, we conclude that IFN - restricts 17D replication and dissemination early during infection. In the absence of the IFN - response, 17D replicated in and caused stress or inflammation in the liver and the brain, indicative of both viscerotropic and neurotropic disease . IFN- may play a role in virus clearance as clearance was observed within eight days in AB6 mice, whereas in AGB6 mice, virus clearance only occurred in the periphery but in a delayed manner. Deficiency in IFN - signaling resulted in poor cytokine responses and less robust induction of antiviral genes when compared to AB6 mice, indicative of a central role for cytokin e upregulation and antiviral function of IFN - against 17D. We also determined that NK cells were a primary source of IFN - early during infection in our model. In vitro, we also demonstrated that , IFN- inhibits replication of both YFV strains 17D and Ang ola71 in a dose -dependent manner; however, 17D was more robustly inhibited by IFN - treatment than the WT strain in myeloid (macrophage and DC) but not fibroblastic cells. This prompt ed us to conclude that one mechanism for 17D attenuation is enhanced sens itivity to innate antiviral activities of IFN - in myeloid cells. One important knowledge gap that should be addressed in future studies is the exact molecular mechanism(s) for enhanced sensitivity of 17D to IFN -. IFN-, like other IFN types, can induce a plethora of immune -modulatory genes. Among these gene products, iNOS and immune-related GTPases have been demonstrated to inhibit viruses from different families in myeloid cells (145, 242) . It would be of interest to determine if these genes are also inhibitory to YFV replication . For instance, myeloid cells derived from mice deficient in iNOS and specific immune-related GTPases can be used to evaluate if these proteins are restricting 17D downstream to IFN-. In addition , comparative analysis on genes induced in myeloid and non - 83 Figure 15. Model of IFN - interaction with 17D in mice . 17D infection results in early IFN - primarily by NK cells. In the presence of IFN - receptor (AB6 mice, left), myeloid cells are at a heightened antiviral state, leading to effective control of 17D replication and dissemination in vivo, and subsequent development of adaptive immunity. In contrast, in the absence of IFN- receptor (AGB6 mice, 84 right), myeloid cells possess limited antiviral activity, leading to unrestricted 17D replication and dissemination. The virus invades visceral tissues such as the liver and neurologic tissues such as the brain, causing stress and damage, eventually leading to deat h. Our study has highlighted some important questions and future direction (blue) on understanding YFV biology, which are discussed in text. myeloid cells upon IFN - treatment can potentially identify factors that restrict 17D in myeloid cells at a global level. Alternatively, shRNA -mediated knockdown of host factors can be used to screen for the attenuating factors. In addition to identifying host factors contributing to restriction of 17D, the specific amino acid and/or nucleotide changes in the 17D genome leading to enhanced sensitivity to IFN - should be characterized. Chimeric viruses containing parts of 17D and parts of WT strains have bee n used in the literature to understand the role of genetic changes in YFV-mosquito interactions (357, 358) . By comparing sensitivity of the chimeras to IFN - in myeloid cells , we can evaluate the contribution of individual or groups of mutation(s) to sensitivity to IFN -. Prior to implementation of the monkey neurovirulence test, enhanced virulence due to post-vaccination mutations in 17D has been proposed to cause encephalitis in vaccinees. 17D mutants bearing unique mutations not prese nt in the parent stock or in Asibi were isolated from a viscerotropic SAE case and w ere suspected to have enhanced virulence (231). It is possible that these unique mutations are compensatory and partially restore virulence of the resulting virus. A thorough understanding of how mutations in 17D alter virulence will aid p rediction of the propensity of an individual vaccine batch to result in SAEs and facilitate informed design of a 17D vacci ne that can accommodate more at -risk populations without sacrificing effectiveness. Moreover, 17D -vectored chimeric vaccines (326-328) retain the majority of the 17D genome (except structural proteins in the ChimeriVax platform (328)). As a result, t hese vaccine 85 candidates may retain the ability to cause SAEs and thus stand to benefit from advances in 17D safety. Understanding the molecular mechanism of IFN--mediated 17D attenuation can provide important insights i nto the host factors that enhance the risk of SAE. Based on our data, we speculate that variation in host IFN - response can be a potential risk factor for SAEs ; however, IFN- signaling efficacy can be influenced by factors such as recent infe ctions and on-going therapy. A better understanding of the factors upstream and downstream of IFN- can provide us direction for screening potential high -risk individuals prior to vaccination or closely monitor them after vaccination, which may reduce inci dence and/or severity of SAEs. Despite the lack of type I and type II IFN responses, virus clearance was also achieved in the periphery of 17D -infected AGB6 mice by 8dpi. This suggests alternative mechanisms are involved in controlling 17D at a later phas e of infection. The role of other innate immunity components , such as TLR signaling and proinflammatory cytokines should be evaluated in our model because these molecules have been implicated in influencing the outcome of flavivirus infection (123, 230, 338) . In addition, due to the timing of virus clearance, components of the adaptive immune system such as T cells and antibodies likely contrib ute to peripheral clearance . In our model, 17D invasion and replication in CNS likely contribute to disease and ultimate death. However, it remains unclear whether v irus and/or host immune response s are responsible for the death of AGB6 mice. Because the brain is an immune privilege d site, virus es that invaded the brain may not be as well controlled when compared to the periphery (359). Characterization of the immune response in the brain after neuroinvas ion of 17D could provide a clearer picture on pathogenesis and aid in development of therapeutic approaches . The role of glial cells and immune inf iltrating cells , such as T cells, need to be investigated. Microglial cells 86 are resident immune cells that ar e susceptible to flavivirus infection in vitro (32, 360) . Interestingly, JEV replicated in prim ary human microglial cells without secreting infectious particles, and infection induced expression of pro -inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (360). It will be of interest to determine if microglial cells are critical mediators of anti -17D activities in the CNS, or potentially, pathological processes, and whether IFN- is important for its these activities and whether or not IFN -/ controls whether microglia are protective or disease - promoting . Lymphocytes, especially CD8+ T cells have been implicated in controlling flavivirus infections in the CNS (211, 246) . In DENV infected AGB6 mice, adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells from AB6 mice resulted in reduction of virus replication, indicating CD8+ T cells restr icts DENV in CNS in an IFN--dependent manner (246). As with microglia, it will be of interest to determine if T cells are protective or disease -promoting in the absence of IFN -/. Our results also suggest that enhanced sensitivity to IFN- can lead to attenuation of virus and that live attenuated vaccine candidates can be gener ated by deliberately enhancing viral sensitivity to IFN- (and reasonably, other host immune mechanisms) . In fact, severa l arbovirus LAV candidates have enhanced sensitivity to IFN or particular ISGs (346-348). With the recent global emergence of arboviruses such as Chikungunya, Zika, and dengue virus (361-363), a rational approach for generating vaccine candidates will likely be beneficial to the public . 87 5.0 MATERIALS AND METHOD S Ethics Statement Animals were maintained and procedures were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council.

Because virulent virus strains are more capable of antagonizing host antiviral activities than attenuated strains (346, 347) , we sought to determine if WT YFV interferes with signaling mole cules downstream of IFN- more efficiently than 17D. Inhibition of the JAK -STAT pathway is a prominent mechanism employed by virulent viruses to dampen IFN signaling. Flavivirus NS5, including that of YFV, suppresses IFN signaling by sequestration and/or degradation STAT2 (91, 92, 366) . NS5 also inhibits phosphorylation of STAT1 (367). To deter mine if YFV also interferes with STAT1 signaling, we evaluated STAT1 protein levels in PH5CH8 human hepatocytes. PH5CH8 cells were used because they retain functional IFN responses, and different antiviral genes were induced when these cells were infected with YFV strains 17D or Asibi (368). Infection in PH5CH8 cells with 17D or Angola71 vir us resulted in a loss of STAT2 staining, as expected. Interestingly, while 17D -infected cells largely remained STAT1 -positive, STAT1 protein levels significantly lower in Angola71 -infected cells (Fig. 16A -B). 95 Flavivirus infection has been shown to res ult in activation of caspases and apoptosis in vitro (44, 369-371). Because of STAT1 has been reported to be cleaved by caspase -3 and -7, leading to its degradation (372), we evaluated if caspase inhibition could rescue STAT1 protein levels. Treatmen t of cells with caspase inhibitors or vehicle did not affect virus replication (Fig. 16C). However, treatment of Angola71 -infected cells with the pan -caspase inhibitor zVAD STAT1 protein levels (Fig. 16D), indicating caspase activati on is involved in degradation of STAT1 by WT YFV. These preliminary studies suggest that one potential mechanism for enhanced IFN- sensitivity by 17D is failure to degrade STAT1. However, more detailed and in -depth studies are required to elucidate the role of caspase activation in STAT1 degradation and the relative impact of differential degradation on 17D and WT YFV replicatio n. Based on our model, IFN- signaling in myeloid cells, but not non -myeloid cells contributes to attenuation of 17D. The effects of caspase inhibition in YFV -infected myeloid cells and the subsequent effects on IFN-- mediated immunity should be evaluated. In addition, the viral factor(s) and the corresponding mechanism(s) contributing to caspase -mediated degradation of STAT1 should be identified, as it can aid development of pharmacological intervention in YF and/or SAE patients. The C - terminus of M protei n of flaviviruses activates caspases, and M protein from Asibi induces apoptosis more robustly than 17D (44). In addition, the E protein, which possesses most of the genetic differences between 17D and Asibi, and the viral protease NS3 has also been reported to activate caspases (369-371). Thus, it will be of interest to determine if these proteins differentially activate caspases to degrade STAT1 and subvert host IFN responses. 96 Figure 16.

One YEL -AVD SAE clinical isolate, strain Brazil75 (B75) contains two mutations (M -I49L and NS4B -Y240F) when compared to its parent strain 17DD (231). These mutations are unique and not reversions to WT residues. Engel et al. reported that B75 and 17DD are similarly virulent in immortalized kidney and hepatocyte cell lines and the hamster infection model (231); however, in this study, the B75 virus was not adapted to hamster prior to infection, which may explain the lack of enhanced virulence. To investigate the contribution of viral genetics to SAEs, we evaluated the virulence of B75 in our mouse model. In AB 6 mice, B75 infection did not result in any discernable disease, including footpad swelling (data not shown). However, in AGB6 mice, B75 -infected mice succumbed to disease significantly earlier 9.17\u00b10.98) than 17D -204-infected animals (11.2\u00b10.45, Fig. 17A). B75 also resulted in more rapid weigh -loss in infected animals (Fig. 17B). Interestingly, in contrast to 17D, no footpad swelling was observed in B75 -infected AGB6 mice (Fig. 17C). We determined virus replication levels at 8dpi, when B75 -infected an imals started to succumb to infection. Virus titers in most sampled tissues were similar between B75 and 17D -204 except in the serum and the brain (Fig. 17D), where viremia remained detectable in B75 -infected mice at 8dpi but not in 17D -204-infected mice, suggesting B75 remained in the circulation longer. Virus titer was also significantly higher in the brains of B75 -infected AGB6 mice (up to 108 PFU/mg), indicative of higher neurovirulence than 17D -204. 98 Figure 17. A YEL -AVD SA E clinical isolate, strain Brazil75 is more virulent than 17D -204 in AGB6 AGB6 with 1x104 PFU of virus . (A) Survival, (B) weight, and (C) footpad swelling were monitored daily. (D) Infected animals were sa crificed on 8dpi. Tissues were harvested and virus titers were quantified as described in materials and methods. (**: p<0.01, Log -rank test in A, *: p<0.05 and ***: p<0.001 in B and D, multiple t -test with Sidak -Holm correction. n 6) 99 Our data suggest that mutation(s) in 17D that occur during replication in vaccinees can contribute to enhanced virulence. However, some important questions and caveats need to be addressed. B75 is derived from the substrain 17DD but not 17D -204 (231). Therefore, 17DD will be a better control for future experiments. The observation that B75 -infected mice showed no footpad swelling is interesting. It remains to be determined if virus mutations are contributing to the lack of swellin g or local reaction at the site of infection or if it is simply due to differences in genetic background of 17DD and 17D -204. A more in -depth analysis of virus replication kinetics and immune response are necessary to determine how those genetic changes in fluence virus pathogenicity. It is also intriguing that B75, a YEL -AVD clinical isolate replicated to high titer in the brain, suggesting a potential for two mutations (M -I49L and NS4B -Y240F) in causing encephalitic disease and/or the AGB6 mice are more pr one to experiencing neurologic disease after 17D infection. Nevertheless, histological studies are needed to determine the likely cause of disease and death. 100 APPENDIX B TABLE OF ABBREVIATION AB6: B6 mice lacking type I interferon receptor AGB6: B6 mice lacking typ e I and type II interferon receptors Axl: AXL Tyrosine Kinase ISG: Interferon -stimulated Murray virus MyD88: Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 NFB: nuclear factor kappa -light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells NHP: Non -human primate NK: transducer and activator of transcription STING: Gene Syk: cell TEM: Effector memory T cell Effector CD45RA YFV: Yellow fever virus APPENDIX B 105 1.
