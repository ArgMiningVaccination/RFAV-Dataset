As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Congress directed AHRQ t o conduct and support research on the comparative outcomes, clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness of pharmaceuticals, devices, and health care services to meet the needs of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). AHRQ has an established network of Evidence -based Practice Centers (EPCs) that produce Evidence Reports/Technology Assessments to assist public - and private -sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health care. The EPCs now lend their expertise to the Effective Health Care Program by conducting comparative effectiveness reviews (CERs) of medications, devices, and other relevant interventions, including strategies for how these items and services can best be organized, managed, and delivere d. Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evidence -based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews are useful because they define the strengths and limits of the evidence, clarifying whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more informa tion about systematic reviews, see www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference/purpose.cfm . AHRQ expects that CERs will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the health care system as a whole. In addition, AHRQ is committed to presenting information in different formats so that consumers who make decisions about their own and their family's health can benefit from the evidence. Transparency and stakeholder input from are essential to the Effective Health Care Program.

This report systematically reviews the comparative benefits and harms of current antiviral treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in treatment -na\u00efve adults. Data s ources. MEDLINE\u00ae (1947 to August 2012) , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through 3rd quarter 2012) , clinical trial registries, and reference lists. Review m ethods . We used predefined criteria to determine study eligibility. We selected randomized trials of dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin or triple therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa or alfa- 2b), ribavirin, and either boceprevir or telaprevir that reported clinical outcomes, sustained virologic response (SVR), or harms. We also selected randomized trials or cohort studies that compared clinical outcomes in patients who experienced an SVR after antiviral therapy with patients who did not experience an SVR. Results. We included 90 randomized trials and observational studies. No study evaluated the comparative effectiveness of current antiviral regimens on long -term clinical outcomes. In trials of treatment- na\u00efve patients , the likelihood of achieving an SVR was slightly lower for dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin than for dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin, with a difference in absolute SVR rates of about 8 percentage points. There were no clear differences in estimates of relative effectiveness in patient subgroups defined by demographic or clinical characteristics, al though absolute response rates were lower in older patients, Black patients, patients with high viral load, patients with more advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and patients with genotype 1 infection. Differences in harms were relatively small, with no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events, al though dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b pl us ribavirin was associated with a lower risk of serious adverse events than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin. In patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection, trials found dual therapy with pegylated interferon for 12 to 16 weeks associated with a lower likelihood of achieving SVR as compared with 24 weeks of therapy. Lower doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2b were less effective than standard doses, and limited evidence showed no clear differential effects of ribavirin dosing. Five trials found triple therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b), ribavirin, and either boceprevir or telaprevir associated with higher likelihood of SVR (66 -80 percent) than dual therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin for genotype 1 infection, with an absolute increase in SVR rate of 22 -31 percentage points. Triple therapy with boceprevir was associated with increased risk of hematological adverse events, and triple therapy with telaprevir was associated with increased risk of anem ia and rash, including severe rash, versus dual therapy. A large cohort study that controlled well for confounders found that patients with an SVR after antiviral therapy had a lower risk of all- cause mortality than patients with no SVR, with adjusted haz ard ratio estimates ranging from 0.51 to 0.71, depending on genotype. Other, smaller cohort studies also found that SVR was associated with reduced risk of all -cause mortality and long- term complications of HCV infection, but had more methodological shortc omings. vii Conclusions . Although there is no direct evidence on the comparative effects of current antiviral regimens on long- term clinical outcomes, SVR rates are substantially higher in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who receive triple the rapy with interferon (alfa -2a or alfa- 2b), ribavirin, boceprevir or telaprevir compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Achieving an SVR following antiviral therapy appears to be associated with decreased risk of all- cause mortality compared with no SVR, al though estimates are susceptible to residual confounding.viii Contents Executive Summary .................................................................................................................ES- 1 Introduction ....................................................................................................................................1 Scope and Key Questions ..........................................................................................................4 Methods ...........................................................................................................................................6 Input From Stakeholders ............................................................................................................6 Search Strategy ..........................................................................................................................6 Study Selection ..........................................................................................................................6 Population and Conditions of Interest ..................................................................................7 Interventions and Comparisons ............................................................................................7 Outcomes .............................................................................................................................8 Timing ..................................................................................................................................8 Setting ..................................................................................................................................8 Types of Studies ...................................................................................................................8 Data Extraction ..........................................................................................................................8 Assessing Quality .......................................................................................................................9 Assessing Research Applicability ............................................................................................10 Data Synthesis ..........................................................................................................................10 Strength of the Body of Evidence ............................................................................................10 Peer Review and P ublic Commentary .....................................................................................11 Results ...........................................................................................................................................12 Overview ..................................................................................................................................12 Key Question 1a.

Evidence Tables and Quality RatingsES-1 Executive Summary Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic bloodborne pathogen in the United States. HCV is primarily acquired by large or repeated percutaneous exposures to blood, with injection drug use being the strongest risk factor. Based on a national survey of households, approximately 1.6 percent of U.S. adults over 20 years of age have antibodies to HCV, indicating prior acute HCV infection. 1 About 78 percent of patients with acute HCV infection develop chronic HCV infection, defined by the presence of per sistent viremia. Chronic HCV infection has a variable course, but it is a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) . Chronic HCV infection is associated with an estimat ed 15,000 deaths each year in the United States,2 and it is the most common indication for liver transplantation among American adults, accounting for more than 30 percent of cases.3 The prevalence of chronic HCV infection is thought to have peaked in 2001 at 3.6 million people, and the yearly incidence has declined from more than 200,000 cases per year in the 1980s to around 16,000 cases in 2009. 4, 5 However, complications related to chronic HCV infection, which frequently occur only after decades of infec tion, are expected to rise for another 10 to 13 years. 4 The goal of antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infection is to prevent the long -term health complications associated with HCV infection, such as cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and liver cancer, b ut it is extremely difficult to design and carry out clinical trials long and large enough to provide direct evidence related to these outcomes. The sustained virologic response (SVR) rate, typically defined as the proportion of patients who experience a decline in HCV- RNA (hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid) to undetectable levels 24 weeks following completion of antiviral treatment, is the standard marker of successful treatment in clinical trials because an SVR is strongly associated with the long- term a bsence of viremia. 6, 7 Recent studies have evaluated the association between achieving an SVR and reductions in mortality, liver failure, and cancer. 8, 9 In the early 2000s, the combination of \"pegylated\" interferon plus ribavirin became the standard antiviral treatment for HCV infection.10-12 Pegylation refers to the cross -linking of polyethylene glycol molecules to the interferon molecule, which delays renal clearance and thereby permits less frequent dosing (once weekly vs. three times a week with standard interferon). 13 Dual therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is associated with higher SVR rates (about 55 -60 percent overall) than either standard interferon plus ribavirin or pegylated interferon monotherapy. Currently, alfa-2a and pegylated interferon alfa -2b. Although previous reviews found insufficient evidence to determine whether combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin is more effective, 14, 15 more head -to-head trials directly comparing these two regimens are now available.16-19 A number of factors affect response to antiviral treatment. The two major pretreatment predictors of SVR are the viral genotype and the pretrea tment viral load.11 In the United States, genotype 1 infection is found in around three -quarters of HCV -infected patients.20 HCV genotype 1 infection is associated with a substantially lower response to antiviral treatment than infection with genotypes 2 a nd 3, which are present in about 20 percent of HCV -infected patients. A pretreatment viral load ( IU/mL ) ES-2 associated with higher likelihood of achieving an SVR.11 Other factors less consistently or less strongly associated with an increased likelihood of achieving an SVR include female sex, age less than 40 years, non-Black race, lower body weight ( 75 kg), absence of insulin resistance, elevated alanine aminotrans ferase levels, and absence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis on liver biopsy.11 Effects of race on the likelihood of achie ving an SVR may be due in part to polymorphisms in the interleukin- 28B (IL28B) gene.21, 22 An issue complicating antiviral treatment is the high rate of adverse effects observed with interferon -based therapy, including flulike symptoms, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric and hematologic adverse effects.23 Such adverse effects can be difficult to tolerate and can lead to premature discontinuat ion of therapy. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first direct acting antiviral agents, boceprevir (trade name Victrelis ) and telaprevir (trade name Incivek\u00ae), for treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection.24, 25 Both drugs are classified as nonstructural 3/4A protease inhibitors, with a potential advantage of shorter duration of therapy (24 to 28 weeks) compared with standard dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or 2b) plus ribavirin for genotype 1 infection (48 weeks).26-28 Either drug is administered in combination with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or 2b) plus ribavirin. Understanding the comparative benefits and harms of the various antiviral regimens is critical for making informed treatment decisions in patients with chronic HCV infection, particularly given the availability of new treatment options. This review assess es the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments in adults with chronic HCV infection who have not received previous antiviral drug treatment. In addition to assessing the comparative effectiveness of different drug regimens, the review evaluate s the effects of different medication doses, durations of therapy, and dosing strategies (such as weight -based or response -guided vs. fixed tr eatment). To help with individualized clinical decisionmaking regarding antiviral therapy for chronic HCV infection, the review also evaluate s how comparative effectiveness varies depending on HCV genotype, viral load, and other demographic and clinical characteristics. Given the need to understand the effects of treatment in people with HCV infection identified by screening in order to assess the potential benefits and harms of screening, this review will be used, together with a separate review on HCV scr eening, 29 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to update its HCV screening recommendations. Objectives The following Key Questions are the focus of our report: Key Question 1 a. What is the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatment in improving health outcomes in patients with HCV infection? b. How does the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatment for health outcomes vary according to patient subgroup characteristics, including but not limited to HCV genotype, age, race, sex, s tage of disease, or genetic markers? Key Question 2 a. What is the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments on intermediate outcomes, such as the rate of SVR or histologic changes in the liver? ES-3 b. How does the comparative effectiveness of antiv iral treatment for intermediate outcomes vary according to patient subgroup characteristics, including but not limited to HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, or genetic markers? Key Question 3 a. What are the comparative harms associated with antiviral treatments? b. Do these harms differ according to patient subgroup characteristics, including HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, or genetic markers? Key Question 4 Have improvements in intermediate outcomes (SVR, histologic change s) been shown to reduce the risk or rates of adverse health outcomes from HCV infection? Analytic Framework The analytic framework that guided this report is sh own in Figure A. The numbers in the analytic framework indicate the Key Question s listed above. The population was patients with chronic HCV infection who were receiving antiviral therapy. The interventions were dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin , or triple therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin plus a protease inhibitor approved by the FDA (either boceprevir or telaprevir). Comparisons were between different regimens, as well as between regimens including the same drugs administered at different doses or for differe nt durations. Intermediate outcomes were sustained virologic response and hepatic histological improvement. Final outcomes were morbidity and mortality from HCV infection (including hepatic cirrhosis, HCC, and liver transplantation rates) and quality of li fe, as well as harms of antiviral therapies (including flulike symptoms, hematologic effects, rash, and psychiatric effects). Figure A. Analytic framework for treatment of hepatitis C infection in adults KQ = Key Question ES-4 Methods Input From Stakeholders The topic of treatment for HCV infection was nominated for a comparative effectiveness review (CER) in a public process. The Key Questions were proposed in the public nomination process and developed by investigators from the Evidence -based Practice Center (EPC) with contributions from expert Key Informants (KI), who helped refine Key Questions, identify important methodological and clinical issues, and define parameters for the review of evidence. The revised Key Question s were then posted to a public Web site for comment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the EPC agreed on the final Key Questions after reviewing the public comments and receiving additional advice from a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) convened for this report. We then drafted a protocol for this CER, which the TEP reviewed . Access it from the AHRQ Web site , where it was posted (www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search- for-guides -reviews- and- reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&productid=855). A multidisciplinary group of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in hepatitis C treatment and research were selected to serve as the TEP members to provide high - level content and methodological expertise throughout the development of the review. Prior to participation in this report, the TEP members disclosed all financial or other conflicts of interest. The AHRQ Task Order Officer and the authors reviewed all of these disclosures and determined the panel members had no significant c onflicts of interest that precluded participation. KIs and TEP members had expertise in hepatology, epidemiology, screening, and primary care. TEP members and other experts were invited to provide external peer review of the draft report. Search Strategy and Study Selection To identify articles relevant to each Key Question , a research librarian searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae from 1947 to April 2011 (see Appendix A for the search strategies) , and a final updated search was conducted in August 2012. The search strategies were peer reviewed by another research librarian and revised prior to finalization. Unpublished trials were sought by searching clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, Clinical Trial Results, WHO Trial Registries) and grants databases (NIHRePORTER, HSRProj, and AHRQ GOLD) . Scientific Information Packets on unpublished and published trials were solicited from manu facturers of included antiviral drugs through the Scientific Resource Center. We also hand- searched the reference lists of relevant studies. Searches were updated before the report was finalized to identify relevant new publications. Studies were selected according to criteria developed for inclusion and exclusion. The selection criteria were based on the Key Question s and the populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting (PICOTS) approach. Papers were selected for full review if they were about chronic HCV infection, were relevant to Key Questions in the analytic framework, and met the predefined inclusion criteria. To evaluate the potential effects of publication bias, we included trials published only as conference abstracts of s ensitivity analyses. We restricted inclusion to English language articles. Studies of nonhuman subjects were also excluded, and studies had to include original data. ES-5 Abstracts and full -text articles were dual reviewed for inclusion and exclusion for each Key Question. Full -text articles were obtained for all studies identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria. Two investigators independently reviewed all full -text articles for final inclusion or exclusion, and discrepancies were resolved through di scussion and consensus, with a third investigator making the final decision if necessary. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment We assessed the quality of each study based on predefined criteria (Appendix E). We adapted criteria from methods proposed by D owns and Black (observational studies),30 the USPSTF,31 and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies -2 Group.32 The criteria used are consistent with the approach recommended by AHRQ in the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews (Methods Guide) .33 We used the term \"quality\" rather than the alternate term \"risk of bias.\" Although both refer to internal validity, \"quality\" may be more familiar to most users and has potential advantages in terms of readability. We ra ted the quality of each randomized trial based on the methods used for randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding; the similarity of compared groups at baseline; maintenance of comparable groups; adequate reporting of dropouts, attrition, crossove r, adherence, and contamination; loss to followup; the use of intent -to-treat analysis; and ascertainment of outcomes. 31 We rated the quality of each cohort study based on whether it used nonbiased selection methods to create an inception cohort; whether i t evaluated comparable groups; whether rates of loss to followup were reported and acceptable; whether it used accurate methods for ascertaining exposures, potential confounders, and outcomes; and whether it performed appropriate statistical analyses of po tential confounders. 31 Following assessment of individual quality criteria, individual studies were rated good, fair, or poor quality, as defined below.33 Good- quality studies are considered likely to be valid. Good- quality studies clearly describe the population, setting, interventions, and comparison groups; use a valid method for allocation of patients to interventions; clearly report dropouts and have low dropout rates; use appropriate methods for preventing bias; and appropriately measure outcomes and fully report results. Fair-quality studies have some methodological deficiencies but no flaw or combination of flaws judged likely to cause major bias. The study may be missing information, making it difficult to assess its methods or assess limitations and potential problems. The fair -quality category is broad, and studies with this rating vary in their strengths and weaknesses \u2014the results of some fair -quality studies are likely to be valid, while others are only probably valid. Poor -quality studies have significant flaws that may invalidate the results. They have a serious or fatal flaw in design, analysis, or reporting; large amounts of missing information; or discrepancies in reporting. The results of these studies are judged to be at least as likely to reflect flaws in the study design as true effects of the interventions under investigation. We did not exclude studies rated poor quality a priori, but they were considered to be the least reliable studies when synthesizing the evidence, particularly when discrepancies between studies were present. We recorded factors important for understanding the applicability of studies, such as whether the publication adequately described the study population, how similar patients were to populations likely to be targeted by screening, whether differences in outcomes were clinically (as well as statistically) significant, and whether the interventions and tests evaluated were ES-6 reasonably representative of standard practice.34 We also recorded the funding source and role of the sponsor. We did not assign a rating of applicability (such as high or low) because applicability may differ based on the user of this report. Data Synthesis and Rating the Strength of the Body of Evidence We performed meta- analysis of trials that evaluated similar populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes to estimate pooled relative risks.35 When present, statistical heterogeneity was explored through subgroup and sensitivity analyses, as well as qualitatively. Subgroup analyses were pe rformed in groups stratified by HCV genotype as well as by race, age, body weight, viral load, stage/severity of disease, and IL -28b status when these data were available. We performed sensitivity analysis by excluding poor -quality studies and outlier tria ls, and by including results from studies published only as abstracts to evaluate the stability of estimates and conclusions. We did not perform meta -analyses for Key Question 4 because all studies were observational and had important methodologic shortcom ings. These studies were synthesized qualitatively. We rated the strength of evidence for each Key Question using the four categories recommended in the AHRQ Methods Guide. 33 We synthesized the overall quality of each body of evidence based on the type and quality of studies (graded good, fair, or poor); the precision of the estimate of effect based on the number and size of studies and confidence intervals for the estimates (graded high, moderate, or low); the consistency of results between studies (grade d high, moderate, or low); and the directness of the evidence linking the intervention and health outcomes (graded direct or indirect). We did not downgrade a body of evidence for directness that evaluated an intermediate outcome if the intermediate outcom e was the specific focus of the Key Question . We were not able to formally assess for publication bias due to small numbers of studies, methodological shortcomings, or differences across studies in designs, measured outcomes, and other factors. We graded t he strength of evidence for each comparison and outcome by using the four categories recommended in the AHRQ Methods Guide: 33 A \"high\" grade indicates high confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect and will not change the estimate. A \"moderate\" grade indicates moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and that further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. A \"low\" grade indicates low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and that further research is likely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. An \"insufficient\" grade indicates evidence either is unavailable or is too limited to permit any conclusion. Result s The search and selection of articles are summarized in the study flow diagram (Figure B). Of the 1,096 citations identified at the title and abstract level in the original search , 215 articles met inclusion criteria and were selected for further review of the full text. From updated searches and peer reviewer suggested citations, an additional 2, 352 citations were identified, and 164 of these met inclusion criteria and were selected for full -text review. Of the 379 articles reviewed at the full-text level, a total of 90 studies met inclusion criteria. No study evaluated comparative effectiveness of current antiviral regimens on long -term clinical outcomes such as mortality, complications of chronic HCV infection, or quality of life .

Study flow diagram: Treatment for hepatitis C virus infection in adults ES-8 Dual Therapy Regimens with Pegylated Interferon Plus R ibavirin In trials of treatment- na\u00efve patients, dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin was associated with a slightly lower likelihood of achieving an SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus riba virin, with a difference in absolute SVR rates of about 8 percentage points.16-19, 36- 38 In patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection, dual therapy for 12 to 16 weeks appears to be associated with a lower likelihood of SVR , compared with dual therapy for 24 weeks, with no differences between 24 weeks and longer courses of therapy.39-44 In trials comparing different doses of dual therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, lower doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2b were less effective than standard doses, 41, 45- 49 and limited evidence found no clear differential effects of ribavirin dosing.39, 50 There were no clear differences in estimates of relative effectiveness between dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin in patient subgroups defined by demographic or clinical characteristics, although absolute response rates were lower in older patients, B lack patients, patients with high viral load, patients with more adva nced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and patients with genotype 1 infection.16, 17, 19, 51 Differences in harms between dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa- 2a plus ribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa- 2b plus ribavirin were relatively small, with no differences in withdrawals due to adverse events, al though dual therapy with pegyla ted interferon alfa -2b was associated with a lower risk of serious adverse events.16-19, 38, 52 Triple T herapy Regimens With Pegylated Interferon, Ribavirin, and Either B oceprevir or T elaprevir Trials of antiviral regimens including either boceprevir or t elaprevir have been primarily conducted in patients with genotype 1 infection. Triple antiviral regimens (pegylated interferon alfa-2a or alfa -2b, ribavirin, and boceprevir or telaprevir) were associated with a substantially increased likelihood of achievi ng an SVR than dual therapy with -2a or alfa-2b plus ribavirin). 26-28, 53- 57 Two trials found triple therapy with boceprevir for 48 weeks (dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin for 4 weeks followed by 44 wee ks of triple therapy with the addition of boceprevir) was associated with a higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (pooled relative risk [RR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval [ CI] 1.58 to 2.06, I2=0.0%) with an absolute increase in SVR rate of 31 percentage points (95% CI 23 to 39).26, 28 Three trials found triple therapy with telaprevir for 24 weeks (pegylated interferon alfa -2a, ribavirin, and telaprevir triple therapy for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin without telaprevir) was associated with a higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribav irin for 48 weeks (pooled RR 1.48, 95% CI 1. 26 to 1.75, I 2=0.0%) , with an absolute increase in SVR rate of 22 percentage points (95% CI 13 to 31).27, 53, 55 One trial found response -guided telaprevir triple therapy (8 or 12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa -2a, ribavirin, and telaprevir followed by 12 or 36 weeks of respons e- guided dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin) was associated with a higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.9), with an absolute increase in SVR rate of 25 -31 percentage points.54 ES-9 Relative estimates of the effects of triple therapy with either boceprevir or telaprevir, compared with dual therapy, were similar across subgroups , except in patients with low viral load, in whom triple therapy was no more effective than dual therapy in achieving an SVR. Triple therapy with boceprevir was associated with increased risk of hematological adverse events and triple therapy with telaprevir with increased risk of anemia and rash (including severe rash) tha n dual therapy; adverse events were generally self -limited with discontinuation of therapy. 26, 28 All antiviral regimens were associated with a high incidence of flulike symptoms, with small or no clear differences in risk. Sustained Virologic R esponse After Antiviral T herapy and Clinical O utcomes A large cohort study that was well controlled for confounders found that patients with an SVR after antiviral therapy had a lower risk of all- cause mortality than patients with no SVR (adjusted hazard ratio estim ates 0.51 to 0.71).8 Eighteen other cohort studies also found SVR associated with reduced risk of all -cause mortality, liver- related mortality, and other hepatic complications rather than no SVR, but had more methodological shortcomings.9, 58- 74 Ten of the studies were conducted in Asian countries and might not be directly applicable to U.S. populations. Discussion Key Findings and Strength of Evidence The evidence reviewed in this study is summarized in Table A. The specific domain scores used to determine the overall strength of evidence for each body of evidence are shown in Appendix G. We identified no studies that evaluated comparative effectiveness of current antiviral regimens on long -term clinical outcomes such as mortality, complications of chronic HCV infection, or quality of life. Such trials would be difficult to design and carry out due to the long time required for complications of chronic HCV infection to develop in most patients. Dual Therapy Regimens With Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin In lieu of direct evidence on long- term clinical outcomes, SVR rates are the primary outcome to assess comparative benefits of different antiviral regimens. In trials of treatment- na\u00efve patients, the likelihood of achieving an SVR was slightly lower with dua l therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin (pooled RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; I2=27.4 %), with a difference in absolute SVR rates of about 8 percentage points. Al though the largest study, the Individualized Dosing Efficacy vs. Flat Dosing to Assess Optimal Pegylated Interferon Therapy ( IDEAL ) trial, found no difference in SVR rates for dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin, excluding the IDEAL trial from pooled analyses , resulted in similar effect estimates.18 Although there was no difference between types of dual therapy regimens in risk of withdrawals due to adverse events, dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin was associated with a lower risk of serious adverse events than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin (pooled RR 0. 76, 95% CI 0.71 to 0. 88, I2=0.0%), suggesting a potential tradeoff between greater benefits and greater harms. However, serious adverse events were only reported in two trials,18, 19 and the ES-10 rate of serious adverse events was relatively low (about 4 percent overall in IDEAL ), with an absolute differen ce of about 1 percent , and adverse events with antiviral treatments generally resolve following discontinuation of therapy. Trials found no clear difference in estimates of relative effectiveness of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribav irin compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin in patient subgroups stratified by age, sex, race, viral load, fibrosis stage, and genotype, although absolute response rates were lower in older patients, Black patients, pat ients with high viral load, patients with more advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and patients with genotype 1 infection. 16-19, 51 SVR rates ranged from 24 to 42 percent lower in patients with genotype 1 infection compared with patients with genotype 2 or 3. In patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection, dual therapy for 12 to 16 weeks appears to be associated with a lower likelihood of SVR compared with dual therapy for 24 weeks, with no differences between 24 weeks and longer courses of therapy. 39-44 Standard doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2b were more effective than lower doses (no trials compared different doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2a).41, 45- 49 Although trials comparing different ribavirin doses found no clear differences, they evaluated different dose comparisons, precluding firm conclusions.39, 50, 75, 76 Triple Therapy Regimens With Pegylated Interferon, Ribavirin, and Either Boceprevir or Telaprevir Trials of triple therapy regimens with the protease inhibitors boceprevir or telaprevir (both approved by the FDA in 2011) in treatment -na\u00efve patients with genotype 1 infection found each associated with substantially higher SVR rates than standard dual therapy without a protease inhibitor. SVR rates with triple therapy were similar to the 70 -80 percent observed with dual therapy in patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection. 23, 26- 28, 53- 57, 77 Trials that evaluated the telaprevir regimen recommended by the FDA (12 weeks of triple therapy with telaprevir followed by response -guided duration of 12 or 36 weeks of dual therapy) reported SVR rates of 75-80 percent. 54, 56 Trials that evaluated the boceprevir regimen recommended by the FDA for antiviral- na\u00efve patients with cirrhosis (4 weeks of dual therapy lead -in followed by 44 weeks of triple therapy with boceprevir) reported SVR rates of 66-75 percent.26, 28 Trials that evaluated other regimens in antiviral na\u00efve patients, including fixed duration telaprevir regimens, shorter fixed duration triple therapy boceprevir therapy, and boceprevir without dual t herapy lead -in, reported similar or lower SVR rates. As with the head -to-head trials of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin compared with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin, RR estimates for triple , compared with dual , therapy were similar (or there were no clear differences) in patient subgroups based on age, sex, or race, although absolute SVR rates were lower in older patients and B lack patients. In two trials, triple therapy with boceprevir was no more effective tha n dual therapy in the subgroup of patients with lower HCV- RNA viral load (<600,000 or <800,000 IU/mL), 26, 28 but two trials of triple therapy with telaprevir were inconsistent in showing differential effects depending on baseline viral load.54, 55 There was insufficient evidence to evaluate relative effectiveness of triple , compared with dual , therapy based on fibrosis stage. In addition to a higher likelihood of SVR, another advantage of triple therapy regimens in patients with genotype 1 infection is the potential for a shorter duration of treatment (24 or 28 weeks in patients with early virologic response, compared with the standard 48 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin). Shorter courses of treatment would probably be ES-11 appealing to patients, given the frequency of bothersome flulike symptoms associated with interferon -based therapy. On the other hand, triple therapy regimens were associated with increased risk of certain harms, in particular hematological adverse events (neutrope nia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) with boceprevir , and anemia and rash (including severe rash in up to about 10 percent of patients , which could result in treatment discontinuation) with telaprevir. However, there was no clear increase in risk of serious adverse events or overall withdrawal due to adverse events with use of protease inhibitors, and the adverse events appear to be self -limited following drug discontinuation. Sustained Virologic Response A fter Antiviral Therapy , and Clinical Outcomes The st rongest evidence on the association between an SVR after antiviral therapy and improved clinical outcomes is a large U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) cohort study (n=16,864) that adjusted for many confounders and found decreased risk of all -cause m ortality compared with no SVR across patient groups stratified by genotype (adjusted 1, 2, and 3, respectively). 8 Despite controlling for important confounders, the pos sibility of residual confounding is suggested by the very rapid separation of mortality curves for people with an SVR versus those without an SVR, which was observed at 3 months after assessment for SVR. This is more rapid than expected given the typically prolonged natural history of HCV infection. Therefore, estimates of effects of SVR on clinical outcomes from this study may be exaggerated, although it is not possible to determine to what degree. Eighteen other cohort studies also found an SVR after anti viral therapy associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality and complications of chronic HCV infection, including studies specifically of patients with baseline cirrhosis, but had more methodological shortcomings. In addition, 10 of the 19 studies were conducted in Asia, where the incidence of HCC in patients with chronic HCV infection is higher than in the United States, 78 potentially limiting their generalizability. Other studies found an SVR after antiviral therapy associated with better scores o n measures of quality of life than with no SVR, but those studies focused on short -term outcomes and typically did not adjust for confounders or blind patients to SVR status when assessing outcomes.

Moderate Dual Therapy With Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a or Alfa-2b Plus Ribavirin: Duration Effects Sustained virologic response Two trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection found no difference in likelihood of achieving an SVR between 48 vs. 24 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (pooled RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.1; I2=43%). Moderate Sustained virologic response Four trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection found 24 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa- 2a or alfa-2b) more effective than 12-16 weeks for achieving an SVR (pooled RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29; I2=79.5%). Relative risk estimates ranged from 1.01 to 1.33 in the four trials and may have varied in part due to differences across studies in ribavirin dosing. Moderate Sustained virologic response Three trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection with a rapid virologic response (undetectable HCV -RNA by week 4) found no differences between 24 vs. 12 -16 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa- 2a or alfa-2b) plus ribavirin 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; I 2=66.7%).

Moderate Sustained virologic response Three trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection who did not specifically have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis found no clear difference in likelihood of SVR between lower doses of ribavirin (400 or 800 mg flat dose or 600 to 800 mg weight -based dose) vs. higher doses (800 or 1,200 mg flat dose or 800 to 1400 mg weight - based dose). Moderate Sustained virologic response One small trial of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection (N=60) and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak stage 4 -6) found 600 to 800 mg daily of ribavirin associated with lower likelihood of SVR than 1000 to 1200 mg daily (45 vs. 72 percent, RR 0.62, 95 % C I 0.40 to 0.98). Low Triple Therapy With Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b, Ribavirin, and Boceprevir vs. Dual Therapy With Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b Plus Ribavirin Sustained virologic response Two trials of patients with genotype 1 infection found triple therapy with boceprevir (pegylated interferon alfa- 2b plus ribavirin for 4 weeks, followed by the addition of boceprevir for 44 weeks) associated with higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa- 2b plus ribavirin therapy for 48 weeks (pooled RR 1.81; 95% CI 1.58 to 2.06; I2=0.0%), with an absolute increase in SVR rate of 31% (95% CI 23 to 39).

Mortality and long -term hepatic complications A large VA hospital study that controlled well for potential confounders found an SVR after antiviral therapy associated with lower risk of all - cause mortality vs. no SVR (adjusted HR for genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Eighteen other cohort studies found an SVR associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality, liver -related mortality, HCC, and other complications of ESLD compared with no SVR, with stronger effect estimates than the VA study (adjusted HRs generally ranged from around 0.10 to 0.33). However, the studies had methodological shortcomings, including inadequate handling of confounders, and 10 were conducted in A sia. Moderate Short -term quality of life Nine studies found an SVR associated with greater improvement in measures related to quality of life (generic or disease -specific) 24 weeks after the end of antiviral treatment vs. no SVR, with differences averaging less than 5 to 10 points on various SF -36 domains. All studies were poor -quality and were characterized by failure to adjust for confounders, high loss to followup, and failure to blind patients to SVR status.

Findings in Relations hip to What Is Already Known Our findings regarding the comparative effectiveness of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin are consistent with recent system atic reviews that also found the former associated with a lower likelihood of SVR.14, 79 Our findings of no clear difference in comparative effectiveness between 12 to 16 weeks compared with 24 weeks of response- guided dual therapy with pegylated interfero n plus ribavirin in hepatitis C genotype 2 or 3 infection with rapid virologic response are discordant with a recent systematic review, which found a shorter duration of treatment associated with a lower likelihood of achieving an SVR.80 The discrepancy may be explained by the inclusion in the other systematic review of a study that we excluded because it evaluated a nonstandard dose of pegylated interferon, 81 as well as its inclusion of subgroup analyses from trials of patients randomized to different fixe d durations of therapy prior to assessment of rapid virologic response,40, 42, 43 which we considered separately because they did not represent randomized comparisons of response -guided treatment. Because telaprevir and boceprevir are so new, we are unaware of other published systematic reviews on the comparative benefits and harms of regimens including these drugs, compared with standard dual therapy. Our findings on the association between achieving an SVR and ES-20 reduced risk of mortality or complications a ssociated with chronic HCV infection are consistent with a recent review that used some systematic methods.82 Applicability The trials included in this review generally met criteria for efficacy studies based on the exclusion of patients with common comorbidities (such as serious psychiatric conditions or recent or ongoing substance abuse). In addition, the trials may have overestimated efficacy compared with what would be seen in typical practice due to improved adherence as a result of closer followup, ef fects of trial participation, selection of patients, or other factors. A separate review funded by AHRQ will be focusing on issues related to the screening for HCV infection in adults. 29 The severity of baseline liver disease in the patients enrolled in t he trials suggests a broad range of patients were enrolled . In trials of triple therapy with boceprevir or telaprevir, the proportion of patients with cirrhosis at enrollment ranged from <1 to 11 percent.26-28, 53, 54, 56, 57 Trials that reported the proportion of patients with minimal or no fibrosis reported rates of 27 -39 percent.27, 53, 54, 56, 57 Evidence to evaluate potential differences in comparative benefits or harms in patient subgroups based on age, sex, race, and other clinical factors was relati vely limited, precluding strong conclusions in these specific subgroups. The strongest evidence on the association between an SVR versus no SVR after antiviral therapy and reduced mortality comes from a study performed in a VA population, which might limit generalizability to other settings. 8 As described above, studies conducted in Asia on the association between an SVR after antiviral therapy and risk of clinical outcomes may be of limited applicability to U.S. populations because of a higher incidence of HCC in Asian patients with chronic HCV infection. 78 However, the incidence of HCC is increasing in the United States in HCV- infected people,83 which may attenuate such concerns regarding applicability.78 The results of this CER are not applicable to popul ations excluded from the review , including patients previously treated with antiviral therapies and excluded populations such as patients with Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) coinfection, post -transplant patients, or hemodialysis patients. Antiviral therapy is not recommended in patients following kidney transplant, and ribavirin is not recommended in those with more severe (stage 3 to 5) kidney disease since it is cleared via renal function and associated with increased risk of hemolytic anemia in this setting. 84 Such patients were typically excluded from randomized trials of antiviral treatment. Implications for Clinical and Policy Decisionmaking Our review has potential impl ications for clinical and policy decisionmaking. For patients with genotype 1 infection, triple therapy regimens with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa -2b, ribavirin, and telaprevir or boceprevir may be considered an alternative to dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa -2b plus ribavirin as standard treatment due to substantially superior efficacy for achieving SVR compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa - 2a or alfa -2b, as well as a shorter duration of treatment. Factors that may affect decisions to use regimens with boceprevir or telaprevir include cost and specific harms associated with use of these drugs (such as hematologic adverse events with boceprevir and anemia and rash with telaprevir). Dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin appears to be associated with a higher likelihood of achieving SVR compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon ES-21 alfa-2b plus ribavirin, but absolute differences were relatively small. Therefore, decisions about which pegylated interferon to use may be affected by other considerations, such as cost, patient preferences, or other factors. For genotype 2 or 3 infection, standard doses and duration (24 weeks) of pegylated interferon as part of dual therapy are more eff ective than shorter regimens or lower doses, lending support to dosing guidance from the FDA and clinical practice guidelines.11, 85, 86 Evidence on differential effects of ribavirin dose are too limited to draw strong conclusions about optimal dosing of t his component of antiviral regimens, al though differences appeared relatively small. The findings that absolute SVR rates are lower in certain subgroups (such as older patients, Black patients, patients with worse baseline fibrosis, and patients with high viral load) can be used to guide individualized decisionmaking. Patients who are less likely to achieve a n SVR may make different informed decisions about therapy compared with those more likely to achieve an SVR, given the adverse effects associated with treatment. The findings of the review are also relevant to screening recommendations, which are based in part on the effectiveness of treatments in people found through screening to have HCV infection. Important new evidence that may affect assessments regarding potential benefits of screening include stronger evidence on the link between achieving an SVR and improvement in clinical outcomes, as well as evidence showing substantially higher SVR rates with newer triple therapy regimens with boceprevir or telaprevir in patients with genotype 1 infection, the predominant type of HCV infection in the United States. Limitations of the Comparative Effectiveness Review Process Our review had some potential limitations. We excluded non- English- language articles, which could result in language bias, although a recent systematic review found little empirical evidence that exclusion of non-English- language articles leads to biased estimates for noncomplementary or alternative medicine interventions.87 We did not form ally assess for publication bias with funnel plots due to small numbers (<10) of studies for all comparisons. Small numbers of studies can make interpretation of funnel plots unreliable, and experts suggest 10 studies as the minimum number of studies to pe rform them . 88 We included some studies that were published only as abstracts and found their inclusion or exclusion from analyses did not change conclusions. In addition, we searched trial registries and solicited drug manufacturers for additional unpublis hed trials and identified none. Another potential limitation is that we included cohort studies to evaluate the association between SVR and either mortality or hepatic complications associated with chronic HCV infection. Such studies are susceptible to con founding if factors associated with SVR (such as age, race, viral load, or fibrosis stage) are also associated with these outcomes. Therefore, we only included studies that reported adjusted risk estimates, and we evaluated how well studies addressed key p otential confounders as part of our quality assessment. Nonetheless, residual confounding is a possibility, even in cohort studies that adjust for potential confounding. Limitations of the Evidence Base We identified several important limitations of the ev idence base. First, studies assessing important long -term clinical outcomes associated with current antiviral treatments for chronic HCV infection are not available. In the case of antiviral regimens involving newly approved antiviral drugs, such studies a re not possible yet because of the extended followup required to adequately evaluate effects on clinical outcomes. Second, no trials directly compared regimens ES-22 with boceprevir with regimens with telaprevir. Given the increased efficacy of these regimens fo r genotype 1 infection, trials directly comparing their effects would be helpful for guiding health care providers' treatment choices between these drugs. Third, few trials have evaluated the regimens approved specifically by the FDA for these drugs, limiting confidence in conclusions regarding estimates of benefits and harms for the regimens likely to be used in clinical practice. Fourth, few methodologically rigorous studies conducted in settings applicable to U.S. populations evaluated the associati on between achieving an SVR and improvements in clinical outcomes. Such studies would be very helpful for confirming the results of the recent large, well - conducted VA cohort study showing an association between achieving an SVR and reduced mortality risk. 8 Future Research Evaluating the comparative effectiveness of current antiviral regimens on clinical outcomes in randomized trials or cohort studies is a challenge due to the long lead time and large sample sizes necessary to adequately assess these outcom es. This might be more feasible if the studies were to focus on populations at higher risk for complications from chronic HCV infection (e.g., patients with baseline cirrhosis, high viral load, or other risk factors for progression). For all trials of antiviral treatments, studies that enroll broader populations with medical and psychological comorbidities, as frequently encountered in clinical practice, are needed to better understand comparative effectiveness, rather than just comparative efficacy. Studies designed using an effectiveness paradigm would also be helpful for understanding real -world outcomes of antiviral regimens, including effects related to the poorer treatment adherence than expected from efficacy trials. Trials directly comparing triple therapy with telaprevir compared with triple therapy with boceprevir would be very helpful for understanding comparative effectiveness of these two protease inhibitors. In addition, trials evaluating the boceprevir regimen recommended by the FDA in antivira l-na\u00efve patients without baseline cirrhosis are needed to verify that results from studies of previously treated patients were appropriately generalized. Prolonged followup of patients exposed to telaprevir and boceprevir is needed to understand the long -term harms associated with these medications. A number of other protease inhibitors and other newer drugs for treatment of hepatitis C virus infection are currently in active development , and further studies with new drugs and drug regimens are expected, including regimens without interferon. 89 It is critical that future studies that evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with an SVR versus no SVR after antiviral therapy adequately control for other factors that influence clinical outcomes in chronic HCV infection. Studies on effects of achieving an SVR on long- term quality of life would be very helpful for understanding other potential clinical benefits of antiviral therapy, but a significant challenge is whether it is possible to ethically blind pat ients to virologic status, which may have an important effect on assessments of quality of life.

PMID: 22256811. 1 Introduction Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic bloodborne pathogen in the United States. HCV is primarily acquired by large or repeated percutaneous exposures to blood, with injection drug use the strongest risk factor. Based on a national survey of households, approximately 1.6 percent of U.S. adults over 20 years of age have antibodies to HCV, indicating prior acute HCV infection. 1 About 78 percent of patients with acute HCV infection develop chronic HCV infection, defined by the presence of persistent viremia. Chronic HCV infection has a variable course, but it is a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) . Chronic HCV infection was associated with an estimated 15,000 deaths in the United States in 2007, 2 and it is the most common indication for liver transplantation among American adults, accounting for more than 30 percent of cases.3 The p revalence of chronic HCV infection is thought to have peaked in 2001 at 3.6 million people, and the yearly incidence has declined from more than 200,000 cases per year in the 1980s to around 16,000 cases in 2009. 4, 5 However, complications related to chron ic HCV infection, which frequently occur only after decades of infection, are expected to rise for another 10 to 13 years.4 The goals of antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infection are to prevent the long -term health complications associated with HCV inf ection, such as cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and liver cancer, but it is a challenge to design and carry out clinical trials long and large enough to provide direct evidence related to these outcomes. The sustained virologic response (SVR) rate, typi cally defined as a decline in HCV -RNA (Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid) to undetectable levels 24 weeks following completion of antiviral treatment, is the standard marker for successful treatment in clinical trials because it is strongly associated wit h long -term absence of viremia. 6, 7 Recent studies have evaluated the association between achieving an SVR and reductions in mortality, liver failure, and cancer.8, 9 The treatment of HCV infection has evolved dramatically over the past several decades. Recombinant type I interferons were introduced as monotherapy in the mid- 1980s, but were only modestly successful at achieving SVR (overall <20 percent).10-13 Subsequent trials found dual therapy with interferon and the synthetic nucleoside analogue ribaviri n more effective than monotherapy with interferon, although the SVR rates remained under 50 percent.10-13 In the early 2000s, the combination of \"pegylated\" interferon plus ribavirin became the standard antiviral treatment for HCV infection.14-16 The first pegylated interferon was approved by the FDA in 2001. Pegylation refers to the cross -linking of polyethylene glycol molecules to the interferon molecule, which delays renal clearance and thereby permits less frequent dosing (once weekly vs. three times a week with nonpegylated interferon). 17 Currently, two pegylated interferons are available: pegylated interferon alfa -2a and pegylated interferon alfa -2b. Both are Type I alfa interferons, but differ in the size and structure of the interferon and polyethyle ne glycol molecules, as well as in their pharmacokinetic properties (Table 1).17 One pegylated interferon consists of 31 -kilodalton (kDa) -2b conjugated to 12- kDa polyethylene glycol ( brand name PEG -intron\u00ae). The other consists of recombinant 20- kDa interferon alfa -2a linked to 40 -kDa polyethylene glycol (trade name Pegasys\u00ae). The dosing schedule is fixed for pegylated interferon alfa -2a and is based on weight for pegylated interferon alfa -2b. Each pegylated interferon is approved for dual therapy with ribavirin. Although each pegylated interferon is approved for combination therapy with a specific brand of ribavirin manufactured by the respective manufacturer (Copegus \u00ae for pegylated interferon alfa -2a and Rebetol\u00ae for alfa - 2b), the ribavirin is pharmacologically identical. The FDA -recommended doses of ribavirin are 2 800 to 1200 mg/day for pegylated interferon alfa -2a, depending on weight and genotype, and 800 to 1400 mg/day for pegylated interferon alfa -2b, depending on weight. Dual therapy wit h pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa- 2b) plus ribavirin is associated with higher SVR rates (about 55-60 percent overall) than either nonpegylated interferon plus ribavirin or pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) monotherapy. Although previous revi ews found insufficient evidence to determine whether dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or pegylated interferon alfa -2b is more effective,18, 19 more head -to-head trials directly comparing these two regimens are now available.20-23 A number of factors affect response to antiviral treatment. The two major pretreatment predictors of SVR are the viral genotype and the pretreatment viral load.15 In the United States, genotype 1 infection is found in around three -quarters of HCV -infected patients.24 HCV genotype 1 infection is associated with a substantially lower response to antiviral treatment than infection with genotypes 2 and 3, which are present in about 20 percent of HCV -infected patients. A pretreatment viral load of <600,000 i nternational uni ts per milliliter (IU/mL) is associated with higher likelihood of achieving an SVR. 15 Other factors less consistently or less strongly associated with increased likelihood of SVR include female sex, age less than 40 years, non-Black race, lower body weight ( 75 kg), absence of insulin resistance, elevated a lanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and absence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis on liver biopsy. 15 Effects of race on the likelihood of SVR may be due in part to polymorphisms in the interleukin - 28B (IL28B) gene.25, 26 An issue complicating antiviral treatment is the high rate of adverse effects observed with interferon -based therapy, including flulike symptoms, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric and hematologic adverse effects.27 Such adverse effects can be difficult to tolerate and can lead to premature discontinuation of therapy. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first direct acting antiviral agents, boceprevir (trade name Victrelis\u00ae) and telaprev ir (trade name Incivek\u00ae), for treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection (Table 1).28, 29 Both drugs are classified as nonstructural (NS) 3/4A protease inhibitors, with a potential advantage of shorter duration of therapy (24 to 28 weeks) when used in c ombination with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa- 2b) compared with standard dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a plus - 2b) plus ribavirin for genotype 1 infection (48 weeks) (Table 1). 30-32 3 Table 1.

Understanding the comparative benefits and harms of the various antiviral regimens is critical for making informed treatment decisions in patients with chronic HCV infection, particularly given the availability of new treatment options. This review will assess the comparative effecti veness of antiviral treatments in adults with chronic HCV infection who have not received previous antiviral drug treatment. In addition to assessing the comparative effectiveness of different drug regimens, the review will evaluate effects of different medication doses, durations of therapy, and dosing strategies (such as weight -based or response- guided vs. fixed treatment). To help with individualized clinical decisionmaking regarding antiviral therapy for chronic HCV infection, it will also evaluate how comparative effectiveness varies depending 4 on HCV genotype, viral load, and other demographic and clinical characteristics. Because estimating potential benefits and harms of HCV screening requires an understanding of the effects of treatment in people wit h HCV infection, this review will be used, together with a separate review on HCV screening, 35 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to update its HCV screening recommendations. Scope and Key Questions The analytic framework and Key Questions used to guide this report are shown below (Figure 1). The analytic framework shows the target populations, interventions, and intermediate and health outcome measures we examined. The following Key Questions are the focus of our report: Key Question 1 a. What is the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatment in improving health outcomes in patients with HCV infection? b. How does the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatment for health outcomes vary according to patient subgroup characteristics, including but not limited to HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, or genetic markers? Key Question 2 a. What is the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments on intermediate outcomes, such as the rate of SVR or histologic changes in the liver? b. How does the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatment for intermediate outcomes vary according to patient subgroup characteristics, including but not limited to HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, or genetic markers? Key Question 3 a. What are the comparative harms associated with antiviral treatments? b. Do these harms differ according to patient subgroup characteristics, including HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, or genetic markers? Key Question 4 Have improvements in intermediate outcomes (SVR, histologic changes) been shown to reduce the risk or rates of adverse health outcomes from HCV infection? Key Question 1 focuses on direct evidence on the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments for chronic HCV infection on health outcomes (such as death, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, HCC, need for transplantation, or quality of life). Because of the long duration (typically decades) necessary develop major hepatic complications related to chroni c HCV infection, it is difficult to assess for such outcomes in clinical trials. In addition, dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin has only been available since 2001, and protease inhibitors only became approved by the FDA in 2011, which might not be enough time to adequately evaluate some long -term clinical outcomes. Therefore, Key Question 2 focuses on evidence on the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments for chronic HCV infection on intermediate outcomes (SVR and histological improvements). Key Question 4 assesses the link between intermediate and clinical outcomes, in order to facilitate interpretation 5 of results obtained for Key Question 2. Key Question 3 focuses on the comparative harms of different ant iviral treatments. Figure 1. Analytic framework for treatment of hepatitis C infection in adults KQ = Key Question 6 Methods Input From Stakeholders The topic of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment was nominated for a comparative effectiveness review (CER) in a public process. The Key Question s were proposed in the public nomination process and developed by investigators from the Evidence -based Practice Center (EPC) with input from expert Key Informants (KI), who helped to refine Key Question s, identify important methodological and clinical issues, and define parameters for the review of evidence. The revised Key Question s were then posted to a public Web site for comment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the EPC agreed upon the final Key Questions after reviewing the public comments and receiving additional input from a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) convened for this report. We the n drafted a protocol for this CER, which was reviewed by the TEP and is available on the AHRQ Web site where it was posted in for-guides -reviews- and- reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&product id=855. A multidisciplinary group of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in hepatitis C treatment and research were selected to serve as the TEP members to provide high - level content and methodological expertise throughout the development of the review. Prior to participation in this report, the TEP members disclosed all financial or other conflicts of interest. The AHRQ Task Order Officer and the authors reviewed all of these disclosures and determined the panel members had no significant conflicts of interest that precluded participation. KIs and TEP members had expertise in the areas of hepatology, epidemiology, screening, and primary care. TEP members and other experts were invited to provide external peer review of the draft report. Search Strategy To identify articles relevant to each Key Question , a research librarian searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ovid MEDLINE \u00ae (Appendix A) from 1947 to April 2011 (see Appendix A for the search strategies and a final updated search was conducted in August 2012 following the receipt of peer reviewer comments. The search strategies were peer reviewed by another research librarian and revised prior to finalization. Unpublished trials were sought by searching clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, Clinical Trial Results, WHO Trial Registries) and grants databases (NIHRePORTER, HSRProj, and AHRQ GOLD) . Scientific Information Packets on unpublished and published trials were solicited from manufacturers of included antiviral drugs through the Scientific Resource Center. We also hand- searched the reference lists of relevant studies. Searches were updated prior to finalization of the report t o identify relevant new publications. Study Selection We developed criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies based on the Key Question s and the populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting (PICOTS) approach. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, summarized below, are described in more detail by Key Question in Appendix B. Papers were selected for full review if they were about chronic HCV infection, were relevant to Key Questions in the analytic framework, and met the predefined 7 inclusion criteria. To evaluate potential effects of publication bias, we included trials published only as conference abstracts as sensitiv ity analyses. We restricted inclusion to English language articles. Studies of nonhuman subjects were also excluded, and studies had to include original data. Abstracts and full -text articles were dual reviewed for inclusion and exclusion for each Key Ques tion (Appendix B). Full -text articles were obtained for all studies that either investigator identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria. Two investigators independently reviewed all full-text articles for final inclusion or exclusion (Appendix C) . A list of excluded studies with primary reasons for exclusion can be found in Appendix D. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus, with a third investigator making the final decision if necessary. Population and Conditions of Interes t The target population for Key Questions 1 through 3 was nonpregnant adults with chronic HCV infection who have not had previous antiviral drug treatment. Pregnant women were excluded as no antiviral treatment for HCV infection is currently recommended during pregnancy due to potential teratogenic effects. 36 We also evaluated comparative benefits and harms in patient subgroups defined by HCV genotype, race, sex, stage or severity of disease, viral load, weight, genetic markers (i.e., polymorphisms in the IL28B gene), and other factors (such as body weight). For Key Question 4, the target population was adults with chronic HCV infection who had received a course of interferon -based antiviral therapy. We excluded post - transplant patients, HIV patients, and hemodia lysis patients, because treatment considerations and response to therapy may differ from what is observed in the general population of patients with chronic HCV infection without these conditions. Interventions and Comparisons We included antiviral regime ns recommended in current guidelines for treatment of HCV infection, specifically dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa -2b plus ribavirin for genotype 2 or 3 infection,15 and triple therapy regimens with the recently approved protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir, which are used in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2a or alfa -2b plus ribavirin, for genotype 1 infection.37 We included studies of interferon monotherapy and standard interferon plus ribavirin only for Key Quest ion 4, which evaluated the association between intermediate and clinical outcomes. We excluded regimens that involved antiviral drugs that are not approved in the United States for treatment of chronic HCV infection. For Key Questions 1 through 3, we included studies that compared dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, or that compared triple therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa- inhibitor or compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin. We also included studies that evaluated different doses or dosing protocols (i.e., weight -based vs. standar dized) of the same antiviral drugs, or different durations of therapy or methods (e.g., response -guided therapy vs. fixed- duration therapy) for guiding duration of therapy. We focused on dose and duration comparisons of dual therapy with pegylated interfer on (alfa -2a or alfa- 2b) plus ribavirin in patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3. For Key Question 4, we included studies of patients with chronic HCV infection who received antiviral treatment that compared outcomes between those who achieved an SVR (or impr oved histological findings) after antiviral therapy and those who did not. 8 Outcomes Clinical outcomes were mortality, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, HCC, need for transplantation, and quality of life. We classified clinical outcomes assessed 1 year or earlier after the end of antiviral treatment as short- term and those assessed after at least 1 year as long - term. Intermediate outcomes were SVR rates and improvements in histological outcomes. We defined a sustained virologic response as the absence of de tectable HCV -RNA in the serum six months after the end of a course of therapy. 15 We did not evaluate measures of earlier virologic response (such as undetectable HCV -RNA before or through week 12 of therapy or at the end of therapy). Although such early vi rologic outcomes predict whether a patient will achieve an SVR and can be used to guide therapy decisions (e.g., whether to continue therapy or duration of therapy), they are less accurate than the SVR for predicting long- term remission. 15 Histological response has been defined as a 2- point or greater decrease in the inflammatory score or fibrosis score, or a 1 -point decrease in the fibrosis score, although relatively few trials evaluate histological response and definitions are less standardized compared w ith SVR.15, 38 We did not evaluate improvement in liver function tests as an intermediate outcome (e.g., sustained biochemical response, or normalization of liver transaminases six months after the end of a course of therapy), due to its poor correlation w ith SVR. 39-42 Harms of treatment included withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events such as neutropenia, anemia, psychological adverse events, flulike symptoms, and dermatologic adverse events. Timing We did not apply a minimum threshold for duration of studies. We defined long- term outcomes as those measured one year or more after the completion of antiviral therapy and short - term outcomes as those measured prior to one year after the completion of antiviral therapy. Setting Studies conduc ted in primary care and specialty settings were included. Types of Studies We included randomized trials for all Key Questions. For Key Question 4, we included cohort studies that compared clinical outcomes between patients who achieved an SVR compared wi th those who did not achieve an SVR, or that compared clinical outcome between patients who achieved a histological response compared with those who did not. Many factors (such as age, race, viral load, and fibrosis stage) may be associated with both the l ikelihood of achieving an SVR as well as the likelihood of hepatic complications. 15 Therefore, we excluded studies on the association between achieving an SVR and mortality or hepatic complications that only reported unadjusted risk estimates, given the st rong potential for confounding. Because almost no studies on the association between SVR and quality of life reported adjusted risk estimates, we included studies that reported unadjusted risk estimates for this association. Data Extraction We extracted th e following data from included studies into Excel spreadsheets: study design, setting, population characteristics, eligibility and exclusion criteria, the antiviral regimen (including duration and dose), and results for each outcome. Data abstraction for e ach study was 9 completed by two investigators: the first abstracted the data, and the second reviewed the abstracted data for accuracy and completeness against the original articles. For Key Question 4, some studies reported adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between achieving an SVR and clinical outcomes relative to untreated patients, and for no SVR and clinical outcomes relative to untreated patients, but did not report a risk estimate for SVR compared with no SVR. We calculated the HR for S VR compared with no SVR based on the two HRs and their reported confidence intervals, assuming zero correlation between the two reported HRs. Such HRs are usually positively correlated; an assumption of zero correlation results in the most conservative (wi dest) confidence interval for the HR for SVR compared with no SVR. Assessing Quality We assessed quality for each study based on the predefined criteria listed in Appendix E. We adapted criteria from methods proposed by Downs and Black43 and the USPSTF.44 The criteria used are consistent with the approach recommended in AHRQ's Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews (Methods Guide). 45 We used the term \"quality\" rather than the alternate term \"risk of bias.\" Although both refer to internal validity, \"quality\" may be more familiar to most users and has potential advantages in terms of readability. We rated the quality of each randomized trial based on the methods used for randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding; the s imilarity of compared groups at baseline; maintenance of comparable groups; adequate reporting of dropouts, attrition, crossover, adherence, and contamination; loss to followup; the use of intent -to-treat analysis; and ascertainment of outcomes. 44 We rated the quality for each cohort study based on whether it used nonbiased selection methods to create an inception cohort; whether it evaluated comparable groups; whether rates of loss to followup were reported and acceptable; whether it used accurate methods for ascertaining exposures, potential confounders, and outcomes; and whether it performed appropriate statistical analyses of potential confounders. 44 For Key Question 4, we considered studies to have performed adequate statistical analyses of potential co nfounders if they adjusted at a minimum for age, sex, genotype, viral load, and hepatic fibrosis stage in a multivariate model including SVR or histological response; evaluated these factors and excluded them from the multivariate model because there was n o association in either univariate or step -wise multivariate analyses; or accounted for these factors using other methods such as stratification or restriction. Following assessment of individual quality criteria, individual studies were rated as good, fair, or poor quality, as defined below. 44, 45 Good quality studies are considered likely to be valid. Good quality studies clearly describe the population, setting, interventions, and comparison groups; use a valid method for allocating patients to interve ntions; clearly report dropouts and have low dropout rates; use appropriate methods for preventing bias; and appropriately measure outcomes and fully report results. Fair quality studies have some methodological deficiencies, but no flaw or combination of flaws judged likely to cause major bias. The study may be missing information, making it difficult to assess its methods or assess limitations and potential problems. The fair quality category is broad, and studies with this rating vary in their strengths and weaknesses \u2014the results of some fair quality studies are likely to be valid, while others are only probably valid. Poor quality studies have significant flaws that may invalidate the results. They have a serious or fatal flaw in design, analysis, or rep orting; large amounts of missing information; or 10 discrepancies in reporting. The results of these studies are judged to be at least as likely to reflect flaws in the study design as true effects of the interventions under investigation. We did not exclude poor quality studies a priori, but they were considered the least reliable studies when synthesizing the evidence, particularly when discrepancies between studies were present. Assessing Research Applicability We recorded factors important for understandin g the applicability of studies such as whether the publication adequately described the study population, the country in which the study was conducted (studies indicate that the rate of HCC in patients with chronic HCV infection is higher in Japan and othe r Asian countries compared with the United States), 46 how similar patients were to typical populations of those with chronic HCV infection, whether differences in outcomes were clinically (as well as statistically) significant, and whether the antiviral re gimens and other aspects of care evaluated were reasonably representative of standard practice. 47 We also recorded the funding source and role of the sponsor. We did not assign a rating of applicability (such as high or low) because applicability may diffe r based on the user of this report. Data Synthesis For Key Questions 1 through 3, we performed meta -analysis of trials that evaluated similar populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes to estimate pooled relative risks using the DerSimonian -Laird method in a random effects model. 48 A random effects model results in estimates that are similar to a fixed effects model when there is little or no between -study statistical heterogeneity, but results in more conservative estimates (wide r confidence intervals) when statistical heterogeneity is present. Heterogeneity was assessed by calculating the Q - statistic and the percentage of the total variance due to between study variability (I2 statistic).49 When present, statistical heterogeneity was explored through subgroup and sensitivity analyses, as well as qualitatively. Subgroup analyses were performed in groups stratified by HCV genotype as well as by race, age, body weight, viral load, stage/severity of disease, and IL -28b status when the se data were available. We performed sensitivity analysis by excluding poor - quality studies, excluding outlier trials and including trials that used nonstandard doses of antiviral drugs, and adding results from trials published only as abstracts to evaluat e the stability of estimates and conclusions. We did not formally assess for publication bias with funnel plots due to small numbers (<10) of studies for all comparisons. Small numbers of studies can make interpretation of funnel plots unreliable, and expe rts suggest 10 studies as the minimum number of studies to perform funnel plots. 50 All analyses were performed using Stata 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, 2009). For Key Question 4, we did not perform meta -analysis, since all studies were cohort stud ies, and many had methodological shortcomings (including failure to adjust for important confounders) and varied in populations assessed, treatments received, and other factors. Rather, these studies were synthesized qualitatively. Strength of the Body of Evidence We assessed the overall strength of evidence for a body of literature about a particular Key Question in accordance with the AHRQ Methods Guide.45 The strength of evidence was based on the overall quality of each body of evidence, based on the type and quality of studies (graded good, fair, or poor); the consistency of results within and between study designs (graded high, 11 moderate, or low); the directness of the evidence linking the intervention and health outcomes (graded direct or indirect); and the precision of the estimate of effect, based on the number and size of studies and confidence intervals for the estimates (graded high, moderate, or low). We did not downgrade a body of evidence for directness that evaluated an intermediate outcome, if the intermediate outcome was the specific focus of the Key Question. We did not grade supplemental domains for cohort studies included in Key Question 4 because they were not relevant (dose- response relationship) or because important methodological shortcomings (in particular failure to adjust for critical confounders) limited their usefulness (magnitude of effect and direction of plausible confounding). We were not able to formally assess for publication bias due to small numbers of studies, methodological shortcomings, or differences across studies in designs, measured outcomes, and other factors. We graded the strength of evidence for each Key Question using the four key categories recommended in the AHRQ Methods Guide. 45 A \"high\" grade indicates high confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A \"moderate\" grade indicates moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. A \"low\" grade indicates low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and further research is likely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. An \"insufficient\" grade indicates evidence either is unavailable or is too limited to permit any conclusion.

Study flow diagram: Treatment for hepatitis C virus infection in adults 14 Key Question 1a. What is the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatment in improving health outcomes in patients with HCV infection? No randomized trial or observational study evaluated the comparative effectiveness of current antiviral treatment regimens for chronic HCV inf ection on improving long- term clinical outcomes (strength of evidence: insufficient). Three trials that compared current antiviral regimens found no differences in risk of short -term mortality, but reported very few (20 total) events (strength of evidence: low). One open- label randomized trial of patients with genotype 4 infection found dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin associated with statistically significant, slightly better short -term scores on some generic and liver disease -specific quality of life assessments than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa- 2b plus ribavirin (strength of evidence: low). No trial evaluated comparative effects of current antiviral treatment regimens for chronic HCV infection (dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa- 2b plus ribavirin or triple therapy with pegylated interferon -2a or alfa -2b, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor) on risk of long- term clinical outcomes. Three trials reported short- term mortality (through 6 month s after the completion of antiviral therapy), but reported few deaths (20 total), resulting in very imprecise estimates (Appendix H: Evidence Table 1). One large trial found no difference between dual therapy with standard dose pegylated interferon alfa -2b (1.5 mcg/kg/week) plus ribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin in risk of short -term mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 2.8), based on 11 deaths in over 2000 subjects. 22 Another trial found no differ ence between triple therapy with boceprevir and dual therapy in risk of short -term all- cause mortality (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.2), but only reported 5 deaths in over 700 patients.32 One trial of response -guided triple therapy with telaprevir versus dual therapy reported four deaths in over 1088 patients, resulting in a very imprecise estimate (RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.16 to 14).51 Two trials evaluated comparative effects of current antiviral regimens for chronic HCV infection on short -term quality of life (Appen dix H: Evidence Table 11).52, 53 One trial of patients with genotype 4 infection found dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin associated with slightly higher (better) scores on some Short -Form 36 (SF- 36) health survey subscales than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin 24 weeks after the end of treatment (differences of 3.2 to 5.7 points on the Bodily Pain, Vitality, Social Functioning, and Role Emotional subscales, each on a 0 to 100 scale). 53 Dual therapy wi th pegylated interferon alfa -2a was also associated with slightly higher scores on the Physical Component Summary score (3.2, points, p<0.02), but there was no difference on the Mental Component Summary score, or on five of six domains on the Chronic Liver Disease questionnaire, though dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin was associated with a slightly higher overall score (difference 0.4 point on a 1 to 7 scale, p=0.02). The trial was open- label and patients do not appear to have been blinded to virologic response status, which could have affected quality of life assessments. A trial of patients with genotype 1 infection with undetectable HCV -RNA after 24 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa- 2a plus ribavirin found continuation of dua l therapy for another 24 weeks associated with worse quality of life scores at the end of treatment than pegylated interferon alone for the last 24 weeks, but the clinical relevance of this finding is limited since the shorter regimen was associated with lower 15 likelihood of achieving an SVR and is not considered the standard of care for genotype 1 infection.52 Key Question 1b. How does the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatment for health outcomes vary according to patient subgroup characteristics, including but not limited to HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease or genetic markers? No randomized trial or observational study evaluated comparative effects of current antiviral treatment regimens on any clinical outcomes in patients stratified by HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, genetic markers, or other factors (strength of evidence: insufficient). Key Question 2a. What is the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments on intermediate outcomes, such as the rate of SVR or histologic changes in the liver? Dual Therapy W ith Pegylated Interferon Alfa -2a or Alfa -2b Plus Ribavirin Seven trials found dual therapy with standard doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin associated with lower likelihood of achieving an SVR than pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus CI to 0.95, I2=27.4%), with an absolute difference in SVR rates of 8 percentage points (95% CI 3 to 14) (strength of evidence: moderate). Dual Therapy W ith Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a or Alfa -2b Plus Ribavirin: Duration Effects Two trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection found no difference in likelihood of achieving an SVR between 48 versus 24 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (p ooled RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11, I 2=42.7%) (strength of evidence: moderate). Four trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection found 24 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) more effective than 12 -16 weeks for achieving an SVR (pooled RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29, I2=79.5%). Relative risk estimates ranged from 1.0 to 1.3 (strength of evidence: moderate). Three trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection with a rapid virologic response (undetectable HCV -RNA by week 4) found no differences between 24 versus 12- 16 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin (pooled RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14, I 2=66.7 %). Relative risk estimates ranged from 0.89 to 1.1 (strength of evidence: moderate). 16 Dual Therapy W ith Pegylated Interferon Alfa -2a or Alfa -2b Plus Ribavirin: Dose Effects Six trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection found lower doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2b (0.75-1.0 mcg/kg or 50 mcg) associated with low er likelihood of achieving an SVR than higher doses (1.5 mcg/kg or 100-150 mcg) (pooled RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99, I 2=20.2 %) (strength of evidence: moderate). Three trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection who did not specifically have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis found no clear difference in likelihood of SVR between lower doses of ribavirin (400 or 800 mg flat dose or 600 to 800 mg weight -based dose) versus higher doses (800 or 1200 mg flat dose or 800 to 1400 mg weight -based dose) (strength of evidence: moderate). One small trial of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection ( N=60 ) and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak stage 4 -6) found 600 to 800 mg daily of ribavirin associated with lower likelihood of SVR than 1000 to 1200 mg daily (45 vs . 72 percent, RR 0.62, 95% C I 0.40 to 0.98) (strength of evidence: low). Trials of Triple Therapy With Pegylated Interferon Alfa -2b, Ribavirin, and Boceprevir Two trials of patients with HCV genotype 1 infection found dual therapy lead- in with pegylated i nterferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin for 4 weeks followed by 44 weeks of triple therapy with boceprevir associated with higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy for 48 weeks (pooled RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.06, I2=0.0%), with an absolute increase in SVR rat e of 31 percentage points (95% CI 23 to 39) (strength of evidence: moderate). One trial of patients with genotype 1 infection found 48 weeks of triple therapy with boceprevir using low dose of ribavirin (400-1000 mg daily) associated with a non- statistically significant trend towards lower likelihood of SVR than 48 weeks of triple therapy with a standard ribavirin dose (800-1400 mg daily) (36 vs. 50 percent, RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.3) (strength of evidence: low). Trials of Triple Therapy With P egylated Interferon Alfa- 2a or Alfa -2b, Ribavirin, and Telaprevir Three trials of patients with genotype 1 infection found triple therapy with telaprevir for 24 weeks (12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa -2b, ribavirin, and telaprevir followe d by 12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa -2b plus ribavirin) associated with higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa - 2b plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (pooled RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75, I 2=0.0%), with an absolute increase in SVR rate of 22 percentage points (95% CI 13 to 31) (strength of evidence: moderate). One trial of patients with genotype 1 infection found no difference in likelihood of SVR between triple therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a, ribavirin, and telaprevir for 12 weeks versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa- 2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (strength of evidence: moderate). One trial of patients with genotype 1 infection found response -guided triple therapy with telaprevi r (pegylated interferon alfa -2a, ribavirin, and telaprevir for 8 or 12 weeks 17 followed by response -guided dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin for an additional 12 or 36 weeks) associated with higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.9), with an absolute increase in SVR rate ranging from 25 to 31 percent. The regimen with 8 weeks of telaprevir was associated with a slightly lower SVR rate than th e 12 week telaprevir regimen (69 vs. 75 percent) (strength of evidence: low). One trial of patients with genotype 1 infection found no difference in likelihood of SVR between triple therapy with telaprevir for 48 weeks (12 weeks of triple therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a, ribavirin, and telaprevir followed by 36 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin) versus triple therapy with telaprevir for 24 weeks (12 weeks of triple therapy followed by 12 weeks of dual therapy) (strength of evidence: low). One trial of response -guided triple therapy with telaprevir (24 or 48 weeks, based on absence or presence of HCV -RNA from weeks 4 through 20) found similar SVR rates (81-85 percent) for regimens that varied on telaprevir dose ( 750 mg three times daily vs. 1125 mg two times daily) and type of pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) (strength of evidence: low). One trial of patients with an extended rapid virologic response to initial triple therapy with telaprevir reported similar high (92 and 88 percent) SVR rates (92 and 88 percent) in patients randomized to a total of 24 or 48 weeks of therapy (strength of evidence: low). Dual Therapy W ith Pegylated Interferon Alfa -2a Plus Ribavirin Compared With Dual Therapy With Pegylated I nterferon Alfa-2b Plus Ribavirin Ten trials that directly compared dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin to dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin in patients with genotypes 1, 2, or 3 infection met inclusion criteria (Table 2, Appendix H: Evidence Table 1).20-23, 53- 58 Two of these trials were published only as abstracts and were included only in sensitivity analyses; we could not adequately assess their quality due to limited information in the abstracts. 54, 56 One other trial compared pegylated interferon alfa -2a versus pegylated interferon alfa- 2b as part of response -guided triple therapy with telaprevir and was also only included in sensitivity analysis.59 One trial enrolled a mix of treatment na\u00efve and treatment experienced patients but reported SVR in the treatment -na\u00efve subgroup.57 Of the eight trials that could be quality rated, two21, 58 were rated poor quality and six were rated fair quality (Appendix H: Evidence Table 2). Frequent methodologic shortc omings were open- label design,20, 21, 23, 53, 55, 57 high or unclear loss to followup,20-23 and unclear or inadequate methods of allocation concealment.21, 23, 53, 55, 57, 58 Sample sizes ranged from 66 to 3,070. Five trials, including the trial that compa red triple therapy regimens, only enrolled patients with genotype 1 HCV infection;22, 55, 57- 59 the others enrolled either a mix of genotypes or a specific genotype other than genotype 1. The proportion of patients with cirrhosis at baseline ranged from <5 -20 percent, 20, 23, 59, 60 and the proportion of patients with elevated transaminases ranged from 60 -100 percent20, 21, 23, 53, 58, 60 in trials that reported this information. All but two trials54, 57 included a comparison of a standard dose of pegylated interferon alfa -2a (180 mcg/week) with a standard dose of pegylated interferon alfa -2b (1.5 mcg/kg/week). One trial evaluated multiple pegylated interferon alfa -2b doses.22 Ribavirin dosing varied across studies. All trials used weight -based dosing of ribavirin except for one, 18 which used an 800 mg daily flat dose (it also enrolled only genotype 3 patients).54 Three trials used different ribavirin doses with pegylated interfe ron alfa -2a and alfa -2b.22, 23, 59 Nine trials evaluated fixed- duration regimens, with 48 weeks of treatment for genotypes 1 or 4 and 24 weeks for genotypes 2 or 3.20, 21, 23, 53- 58 Table 2.

Results were similar when the meta- analysis included the trial59 that evaluated pegylated interferon alfa -2b versus pegylated interferon alfa -2a as part of a trip le therapy regimen with telaprevir and ribavirin (eight trials, pooled RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96, I2=26%) and a trial56 only available as a conference abstract (nine trials, pooled RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97, I2=25%), or excluded two poor -quality tria ls (five trials, pooled RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95, I2=47%).21, 58 Two trials, one published only as an abstract, compared only a standard dose of pegylated interferon alfa -2a (180 mcg weekly) versus nonstandard doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2b (1.0 mcg/kg/week or 60- 150 mcg/week).54, 57 Pooled estimates were similar when these trials were included in the analysis (nine trials, pooled RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95, I2=22%).

However, differences in ribavirin dosing could have affected treatment comparability. Excluding IDEAL22 had little effect on the pooled e stimate and eliminated statistical heterogeneity (six trials, pooled RR CI 0.76 to 0.90, I2= 0%) (Figure 4).20, 23, 53, 55, 58 Figure 4.

Six trials compared fixed -duration regimens of dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa-2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin in patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection.63, 64, 66, 68, 70, 71 Two trials found no difference between 48 versus 24 weeks of dual therapy in likelihood of achieving an SVR (pooled RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.1, I2=43%) (Figure 5).63, 71 Four other trials found 24 weeks of dual therapy associated with a higher likelihood of achieving an SVR than 12 to 16 weeks of dual therapy (pooled RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3; I 2=80%),64, 66, 68, 70 but substantial statistical heterogeneity was present (I2=80%) (Figure 6). Of the four trials, three found 12 to 16 weeks of dual therapy ass ociated with lower likelihood of SVR compared with 24 weeks.64, 66, 68 The fourth trial,70 which found no difference between 16 versus 24 weeks of dual therapy (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.1), used weight -based dosing of ribavirin starting at 1,000 mg (1,000- 1,200 mg), compared with a flat dose of 800 mg or weight -based dosing starting at 800 mg (800- 1,400 mg) in the other three trials. This trial also enrolled only patients with a genotype 2 infection, whereas the others enrolled genotype 2 or 3. It reported substantially higher overall SVR rates 26 (94 vs. 95 percent) than the other trials (57 62 percent vs. 6778 percent). Excluding this trial from the meta -analysis reduced statistical heterogeneity, with no appreciable impact on the pooled estimate of effect ( three trials, pooled RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3, I2=47%).64, 66, 68 Another potential source of heterogeneity was the evaluation of pegylated interferon alfa -2b and high attrition in one of the trials.66 However, excluding this trial did not affect the pool ed estimate or reduce statistical heterogeneity (three trials, pooled RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.3, I2=86%).64, 68, 70 Figure 5.

Another trial (n=1831 with genotype 2 or 3 infection) found no difference between dual therapy for 24 weeks with pegylated interferon alfa-2b 1.5 mcg/kg week and flat -dose ribavirin 800 mg versus weight -dosed ri bavirin 800 to 1400 mg (60 vs. 62 percent, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.0). 82 One other smaller trial (n= 282) found no difference between dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a with flat doses of ribavirin 400 mg versus ribavirin 800 mg in likelihood of an SVR (64 vs. 69 percent, RR 0.92, 95% C I 0.78 to 1.1). 80 One trial (n=60 with genotype 2 or 3 infection) of pegylated interferon alfa -2a found 600- 800 mg daily of ribavirin associated with lower likelihood of SVR than 1000- 1200 mg daily (45 vs. 72 percent, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.98), but differed from the others in that it enrolled subjects primarily with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak stage F4 -F6). 81 Trials of Therapy Pegylated Interferon Alfa -2b, Ribavirin, and Boceprevir Two randomized trials compared triple therapy with boceprevir, pegylated interferon alfa -2b and weight -based ribavirin with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin in antiviral treatment -na\u00efve patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infecti on (Table 32 Serine Protease (SPRINT -1)30 and SPRINT -232 trials (n =1088 and 520, respectively) were conducted in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

Versus dual therapy, the relative risk for achieving an SVR for the two 48- week triple therapy arms combined was 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.5), and for the two 28- week triple therapy arms combined was 1.5 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.9). Four -week dual therapy lead -in was associated with an increased absolute rate of achieving an SVR versus no lead-in of 2 percent for the 28- week regimens and 8 percent for the 48- week regimens. SPRINT -2 compared a fixed duration triple t herapy regimen, a response -guided triple therapy regimen, and dual therapy. 32 The fixed duration regimen consisted of four weeks of dual therapy lead -in with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin followed by the addition of boceprevir for 44 weeks (48 weeks total). The response -guided approach consisted of a four - week dual therapy lead -in, followed by triple therapy for 24 weeks. Patients with undetectable serum HCV -RNA from weeks 8 through 24 completed their antiviral treatment at week 28. Patients w ith detectable HCV -RNA at any time between weeks 8 and 24 continued dual therapy for another 20 weeks (48 weeks total). The third (control) arm consisted of dual therapy for 48 weeks. SVR rates for the three regimens were 66, 63, and 38 percent, respectively, (p<0.001 for either boceprevir regimen vs. dual therapy), with an absolute risk difference of 25-28 percent for triple compared with dual therapy. Compared with dual therapy, the relative risk for achieving an SVR for the two regimens with boceprevir c ombined was 1.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0). The only treatment regimen evaluated in both SPRINT trials was the 48 -week regimen with dual therapy lead- in for the first 4 weeks and boceprevir added for the final 44 weeks. Based on data from both trials, triple therapy was associated with a higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy (pooled RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.1, I 2=0%), with a pooled absolute increase in SVR of 31 percentage points (95% CI 23 to 39) (Figure 9).30, 32 SPRINT -1 also included a separate trial of 75 patients randomized to weight -based low dose (400-1000 mg) or standard dose (800-1400 mg) ribavirin as part of 48 weeks of triple therapy with boceprevir without dual therapy lead in 30 Low dose ribavirin was associated with a non - statistically significant trend towards lower likelihood of SVR (36 vs. 50% , RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.3). 36 Figure 9. Sustained virologic response: 48 weeks of triple therapy with boceprevir (4 weeks of dual therapy lead -in with pegylated interferon alfa -2b followed by the addition of 44 weeks boceprevir) versus 48 weeks of dual therapy in patients with genotype 1 infection Trials of Triple Therapy With Pegylated Interferon (Alfa -2a or Alfa -2b), Ribavirin, and Telaprevir Six randomized trials compared triple therapy with telaprevir, pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa-2b and weight -based ribavirin compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa -2b and ribavirin for antiviral treatment -na\u00efve patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection (Table 7, Appendix H: Evidence Table 3).31, 51, 59, 85- 87 A seventh, small trial was excluded because it evaluated patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 (telaprevir is only approved for use in genotype 1 infection).88 One trial31 was rated good quality and the remainder fair quality (Appendix H: Evidence Table 4). The proportion of patients with cirrhosis at baseline in the trials ranged from 0 -10 percent. Methodological shortcomings included open- label design or unclear blinding procedures,59, 85, 87 unclear randomization methods,31, 8 5 and unclear reporting of attrition.31, 86 Three trials (n=189 to 323) evaluated fixed duration triple compared with dual therapy regimens (12, 24, or 48 weeks).31, 85, 86 Two other trials51, 59 (n=161 and 1088) evaluated response -guided duration triple t herapy regimens, including one trial51 that compared the FDA - recommended telaprevir dosing regimen (12 weeks of triple therapy followed by 12 or 36 weeks of dual therapy, depending on early virologic response) with dual therapy. 84 The sixth trial (n=322) compared different durations of antiviral therapy in patients who experienced an extended rapid virologic response.87 In all evaluated triple therapy regimens, telaprevir was administered with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa- 2b) plus ribavirin for the first 8 to 12 weeks. For regimens longer than 12 weeks, dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa-2b plus ribavirin without telaprevir was continued for the remainder of the regimen.

Three trials found the 24- week fixed duration triple therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa -2b, ribavirin, and telaprevir associated with higher likelihood of achieving an SVR than 48 weeks of dual therapy (pooled RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.8, I2=0%) (Figure 10).31, 85, 86 The pooled absolute increase in SVR rates was 22 percentage points (95% CI 13 to 31). Two of the trials found no difference between the 12- week fixed duration triple therapy regimen versus 48 weeks of dual therapy (pooled RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.6, I2=14%) (Figure 11).31, 85 One of the trials also found a 48- week triple therapy regimen with telaprevir associated with similar likelihood of SVR versus a 24- week triple therapy regimen (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.4).31 The other trial also found a 12- week triple therapy regimen of telaprevir plus pegylated interferon without ribavirin associated with a non -statistically significant trend towards lower likelihood of achieving an SVR than pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin for 48 wee ks (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.1).85 One trial of 24 -week fixed duration triple therapy with telaprevir was conducted in Japan,86 while the other two were conducted in the United States and Europe. Additionally, the Japanese trial studied telaprevir with pegylated interferon alfa -2b, compared 39 with pegylated interferon alfa -2a in the other fixed duration trials. Excluding this trial did not change the pooled result for SVR (two trials, pooled RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.8, I2=0%).31, 85 Figure 10.

In the telapre vir arms, patients with an extended rapid viral response (HCV -RNA undetectable between weeks 4 and 12) continued pegylated interferon plus ribavirin for a total of 24 weeks, while those without an extended rapid viral response continued dual therapy for a total of 48 weeks. Patients randomized to dual therapy received pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin for a fixed duration of 48 weeks. Both telaprevir treatment- guided response regimens were associated with higher SVR rates than dual therapy (69, 75, and 44 percent for 8 weeks of telaprevir, 12 weeks of telaprevir, and dual therapy, respectively; p<0.001 for either telaprevir regimen vs. dual therapy), with an absolute increase in SVR ranging from 25-31 percent for triple therapy compared with dual t herapy. The relative risk for achieving an SVR in the combined telaprevir arms versus dual therapy was 1.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.9). One trial of response -guided triple therapy with telaprevir (24 or 48 weeks, based on absence or presence of HCV -RNA from weeks 4 through 20) found similar SVR rates (81-85 percent) for regimens that varied on telaprevir dose (750 mg three times daily vs. 1,125 mg two times daily) and type of pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b). 59 Another trial of patients with an extended ra pid virologic response to initial triple therapy with telaprevir reported similar, high (92 and 88 percent) SVR rates in patients randomized to a total of 24 or 48 weeks of therapy, meeting the study's predefined noninferiority threshold. 87 Overall (I-square d = 13.8%, = 0.281) Study McHutchison, 2009 Hezode, 2009 1.19 (0.86, 1.64) 55/99 Events, 6/17 49/82 1 .5 1 2 4 48 weeks Dual Therapy 41 Key Question 2b. How does the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatment for intermediate outcomes vary according to patient subgroup characteristics, including but not limited to HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, or genetic markers? The largest randomized trial (n=3070) of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin found no clear differences in relative risk estimates for SVR in genotype 1 patients stratifie d by race, sex, age, baseline fibrosis stage, or baseline viral load. Characteristics associated with lower absolute SVR rates across dual therapy regimens were older age, Black race, advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and high baseline viral load (strength of evidence: low). Four randomized trials of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin found no clear differences in relative risk estimates for SVR in patients stratif ied by genotype. Genotype 1 infection was associated with a lower absolute SVR rate than genotypes 2 or 3 (strength of evidence: moderate). Two trials of triple therapy with boceprevir for 48 weeks (4 weeks of dual therapy lead- in with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin followed by 44 weeks of triple therapy with pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and boceprevir) found no difference in relative risk estimates for SVR in men versus women, and no clear difference in relative risk estimates for Black versus non- Black patients. Black race was associated with a lower absolute SVR rate than non- Black race (strength of evidence: moderate). Two trials found triple therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b, ribavirin, and boceprevir associated with higher likelihood of achieving SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin in patients with high baseline HCV -RNA viral load (>600,000 or > 800,000 IU/mL), but found no difference in likelihood of SVR in patients with lower viral load (strength of e vidence: moderate). One trial of response -guided triple therapy with telaprevir (12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa -2a, ribavirin, and telaprevir followed by response -guided dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a and ribavirin) versus dual thera py with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin for 48 weeks found no clear differences in relative risk estimates in patients stratified by age, sex, race, baseline fibrosis status, or body mass index. Characteristics associated with lower absolute rates of S VR were older age, Black race, advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and higher body mass index. One other trial of 24- week fixed duration triple therapy with telaprevir, pegylated interferon alfa -2b, and ribavirin versus 48 weeks of dual therapy found no differ ences in estimates of effect in patients stratified by sex or age (strength of evidence: moderate). Two trials of triple therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa- 2b), ribavirin, and telaprevir versus dual therapy depending reported inconsistent f indings for differential relative risk estimates according baseline viral load (strength of evidence: insufficient). 42 Dual Therapy W ith Pegylated Interferon Alfa -2a Plus Ribavirin Compared With Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2b Plus Ribavirin Five trials of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa -2b evaluated SVR rates in patients subgroups defined by demographic and clinical characteristics (Appendix H: Evidence Table 1 and Evidence Table 2).20-23, 56 The la rgest study (n=3070), the IDEAL trial, which only enrolled patients with genotype 1 infection, reported no clear differences in relative risk estimates for SVR dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin in patients stratified by race (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.3 for Black patients and RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.2 for white patients), sex (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.1 for males and RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.3 for females), a ge (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.2 for <40 years and RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.1 for age >40 years), baseline fibrosis (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.4 for METAVIR F3 or F4 and RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.1 for METAVIR F0 to F2), and baseline viral load (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.1 for HCV -RNA 600,000 IU/mL). 22 However, overall absolute SVR rates across dual therapy regimens were lower in older (38 percent) versus younger (53-56 percent) patients, Black patients (23 -26 percent) versus white patients (53-55 percent), patients with F3 or F4 (21- 24 percent) versus F0 to F2 fibrosis (42-44 percent), and patients with high (35-36 percent) versus low viral load (61 -66 percent). The relative risk estimate was somew hat lower for patients 75 to 85 kg (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98) than other weight groups (RR ranged from 0.89 to 1.1) but the confidence intervals for the estimates overlapped, and results were potentially confounded by differential ribavirin dosing acco rding to weight. Four smaller (n=183 to 431) trials found no clear differences in relative risk estimates in patients stratified by genotype, although rates of SVR were lower by 24-42 percent for genotype 1 infection than genotypes 2 and 3 infection. 20, 21, 23, 56 One of these trials also found no clear differences in relative risk estimates in patient groups stratified by presence or absence of cirrhosis, or high or low viral load. 20 Two trials that compared different durations of therapy in patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection reported risk estimates for SVR stratified by patient characteristics.68, 70 They found no differences in relative risk estimates for 16 weeks of therapy compared with 24 weeks of therapy when patients were stratified according to fibrosis stage, body mass index, sex, or age (all RR estimates close to 1). Although the pooled estimates suggested lower likelihood of SVR with 16 compared with 24 weeks of therapy in patients with HCV -RNA >800,000 IU/mL 0.93, I 2=0%) and no difference in those with a viral load less than 800,000 IU/mL (pooled RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06, I2=0%), the estimates were imprecise and the confidence intervals overlapped.68, 70 Another large trial that compared 48 weeks with 24 w eeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin found similar rates of SVR in patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection regardless of baseline viral load.63 43 Triple Therapy With Pegylated Interferon (Alfa-2a or Alfa-2b), and Boceprevir trials (n=520 and 1097) of triple therapy with boceprevir for a total of 48 weeks (4 weeks dual therapy lead -in with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin followed by the addition of 44 weeks of boceprevir) vers us 48 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin found no difference in relative risk estimates for SVR in men (pooled RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2, I2=0%) versus women (pooled RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.8, I2=57%).30, 32 There was al so no clear difference in the relative risk estimates for Black (pooled RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2, I2=0%) and non- Black patients (pooled RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.0, I2=0%), although the overall absolute SVR rate across regimens was lower in Black (53 percent) compared with non- Black (63-78 percent) patients. The relative risk estimate was higher for patients with HCV -RNA viral load >600- 800,000 IU/mL at baseline (pooled RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.3, I2=0%) than those with a lower viral load (pooled RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.5, I2=0%), with an absolute SVR rate of 63 -73 percent in individuals with a high viral load and 85-91 percent in individuals with a lower viral load. Although triple therapy with boceprevir was associated with no difference in likelihood of SVR in the subgroup of patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, the number of patients randomized to triple therapy was small (n=30) and the estimate was imprecise (pooled RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.1, I 2=0%). Telaprevir One trial (n=1088) of response -guided duration triple therapy with telaprevir (12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa -2a, ribavirin, and telaprevir followed by response -guided duration dual therapy) versus 48 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin found no cl ear differences in relative risk estimates in patients stratified by age, sex, race, baseline fibrosis status, or body mass index.51 Absolute SVR rates were higher in patients younger than 45 years versus those older (83 vs. 70 percent), white patients ver sus Black patients (75 vs. 62 percent), patients with no or minimal fibrosis versus those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhotics (81 vs. 62 percent), and those with body mass index <25 versus those with higher body mass index (83 vs. 69 percent). Triple ther apy was more effective than dual therapy in patients with a baseline HCV -RNA viral load > 800,000 IU/mL (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.4), but there was no difference in likelihood of achieving an SVR in those with a baseline viral load <800,000 IU/mL (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.3), with triple therapy associated with similar absolute SVR rates across viral load strata (78 and 74 percent). In a second trial, SVR rates were similar among men (76 percent) and women (70 percent), age less than or greater than 50 (85 vs . 67 percent), and high versus low baseline viral load (69 vs. 74 percent). 86 Another trial of patients with an extended rapid virologic response on triple therapy with telaprevir reported similar, high (80 -90 percent) SVR rates with either 12 versus 36 additional weeks of dual therapy in patients stratified by race, body mass index, or fibrosis stage.87 Key Question 3a. What are the comparative harms associated with antiviral treatments? Dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b was associated with slightly greater risk of headache (three trials, pooled RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.2, I2=0%), lower risk of serious 44 adverse events (two trials, pooled RR 0.76, 95% CI 0. 71 to 0. 88, I2=0%), lower risk of neutropenia (five trials, pooled RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83, I2=38%) , and lower risk of rash (two trials, pooled RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88, I2=0%) than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin, with no differences in withdrawals due to adverse events (strength of evidence: moderate). Triple therapy with boceprevir for 48 weeks (pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin for 4 weeks followed by addition of boceprevir for 44 weeks) was associated with increased risk of neutropenia (two trials, pooled RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.3, I2=0%), dysgeusia (two trials, pooled RR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.2, I2=0%), anemia (two trials, pooled RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.8, I2=0%), and thrombocytopenia (two trials, pooled RR 3. 2, 95% CI 1. 2 to 8.2, I2=0%) than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin. The incidence of anemia was about 25 percent with triple therapy and the incidence of neutropenia about 33 percent , with severe anemia in 4 -5 percent and severe neutropenia in 8 -15 percent. There was no difference in the overall risk of wit hdrawal due to adverse events (strength of evidence: moderate). In two trials, there were no statistically significant differences between a 12 -week regimen of triple therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a, ribavirin, and telaprevir versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin in risk of any assessed adverse event (strength of evidence: moderate). In three trials, a 24 -week regimen of triple therapy with telaprevir (pegylated interferon alfa-2a or alfa -2b, ribavirin, and telaprevi r for 12 weeks followed by pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for 12 weeks) was associated with increased risk of anemia (three trials, pooled RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5, I2=0%) and rash (three trials, pooled RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, I2=0%) versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks. Among patients randomized to the 24 -week telaprevir regimen, one to two- thirds experienced rash (7-10 percent experienced severe rash) and 27 -91 percent experienced anemia (4 -11 percent experienced severe anemia). There was no difference in risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (strength of evidence: moderate). In one trial, response -guided triple therapy with telaprevir (pegylated interferon alfa -2a, ribavirin, and telap revir for 8 or 12 weeks followed by response -guided duration pegylated interferon alfa -2a and ribavirin) was associated with increased risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (27 vs. 7.2 percent, RR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6 to 5.7), anemia (38 vs. 19 percent, RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.5), any rash (36 vs. 24 percent, RR 1.5 , 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8), and severe rash (5 vs. 1 percent, RR 4.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 13) versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (strength of evidence: low). Dual Therapy W ith Pegylated Interferon Alfa -2b Plus Ribavirin Compared With Dual Therapy With Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a Plus Ribavirin Seven head -to-head randomized trials of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin versus dual therap y with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin reported adverse events (Table 8, Appendix H: Evidence Table 1 and Evidence Table 2).20-23, 53, 57, 58 Characteristics of the trials were described earlier (see Key Question 2a). 45 There was no difference be tween dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b and dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a in risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (six trials, pooled RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.7, I2=42%) (Figure 12).20, 22, 23, 53, 57, 58 In the largest st udy, the IDEAL trial, about 13 percent of patients randomized to dual therapy with standard doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2b or pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin withdrew due to adverse events, versus about 10 percent in those randomized to low -dose pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin.22 Excluding the low -dose pegylated interferon alfa -2b arm of IDEAL from the pooled analysis resulted in a similar pooled estimate (six trials, RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.7, I 2=30%).20, 22, 23, 53, 57, 58 One outlier trial found dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b associated with substantially higher risk of withdrawal due to adverse events than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a (RR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 12). 20 Excluding it eliminated statistical heterogeneity, but the association remained non -statistically significant (five trials, pooled RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.1, I2=0%).22, 23, 53, 57, 58 Figure 12. Withdrawal due to adverse events: Dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa- 2b plus ribavirin versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin Two trials found dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin associated with lower risk of serious adverse events than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin (pooled RR 0. 76, 95% CI 0. 61 to 0.95, I2=0%).22, 23 In the IDEAL trial, serious treatment -related adverse events occurred in about 4 percent of patients.22 There were no statistically significant differences between regimens in risk of anemia, thrombocytopenia, depression, fatigue, myalgia, or flulike symp toms (Table 8). Dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin was associated with slightly greater risk of headache (three trials, pooled RR 1. 1, 95% CI 1.1 to 1. 2, I 2=0%)20, 22, 57 and slightly lower risk of rash (two trials, Overall (I -squared = 42.3%, p = 0.123) Study Ascione, 2010 Rumi, 2010 Miyase, 2012 ID Kamal, 2011 Yenice, 2006 McHutchison, 2009 1.12 (0.73, 1.73) Risk 4.25 (1.46, 12.35) 1.03 (0.53, 1.98) 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88, I2=0%)22, 57 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83, I2=38%)20-23, 57 than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin. In the IDEAL trial, dual therapy with either pegylated interferon (alfa-2a or alfa -2b) was associated with fatigue in about 65 percent of patients, headache in about 45 percent, nausea in about 40 percent, and myalgia in about 25 percent, neutrophil count <500/mm3 in about 5 percent, and hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL in about 3 percent.22 Table 8.

Trials of Triple Therapy With Pegylated Interferon (Alfa- 2a or Alfa -2b), Ribavirin, of either boceprevir or telaprevir versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin without a protease inhibitor in patients with genotype 1 infection reported adverse events (Appendix H: Evidence Table 3 and Evidence Table 4).30-32, 85, 86 Characteristics of the trials were described earlier (see Key Question 2a). Boceprevir For boceprevir, two trials evaluated a 48- week fixed duration regimen consisting of dua l therapy lead -in for 4 weeks with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin, with the addition of boceprevir from weeks 5 through 48.30, 32 Triple therapy was associated with increased risk of neutropenia (two trials, pooled RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.3, I2=0%), dysgeusia (two trials, pooled RR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.2, I2=0%), anemia (two trials, pooled RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.8, 47 I2=0%), and thrombocytopenia (two trials, pooled RR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 8.2, I2=0%) versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon a lfa-2b plus ribavirin (Table 9). About 25 percent of patients on triple therapy experienced anemia and about 33 percent neutropenia , with an incidence of severe neutropenia (neutrophil count <500 cells per \u00b5 L) that ranged from 8-15 percent and an incidence of severe anemia (hemoglobin <80 or <85 g/L) of 4-5 percent. In addition, more patients randomized to boceprevir triple therapy used erythropoietin (43 and 87 percent) than those randomized to dual therapy (24 and 33 percent). One of the trials reported s imilar use of granulocyte stimulating agents with boceprevir triple therapy and dual therapy (8 vs. 6 percent). 32 There were no statistically significant differences between triple therapy and dual therapy in risk of withdrawal due to adverse events, serious adverse events, depression, fatigue, headache, myalgia, chills/rigors, rash, or flulike symptoms (Table 9).

Rash was reported in 44-77 percent of patients randomized to 12 weeks of triple therapy with telaprevir, with 6 percent of patients reporting severe rash. 31, 85 48 Table 10.

Two trials f ound no difference in risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.6, I2=60%).85, 86 The third trial did not report withdrawal due to adverse events separately for the 24 week telaprevir regimen, but reported a similar trend towards h igher risk of withdrawal due to adverse events for all telaprevir regimens combined (12, 24, or 48 weeks) versus dual therapy (21 vs. 11 percent, RR 2.0, 95% CI 0.97 to 4.1). 31 One trial evaluated triple therapy with telaprevir for 8 or 12 weeks followed by response - guided dual therapy for 12 or 36 weeks versus dual therapy for 48 weeks.51 Since the two telaprevir regimens were associated with similar rates of harms, results were combined. The trial found response -guided therapy with telaprevir associated with increased risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (27 vs. 7.2 percent, RR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6 to 5.7), anemia (38 vs. 19 percent, RR 49 2.0, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.5), any rash (36 vs. 24 percent, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8), and severe rash (5 vs. 1 percent, RR 4.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 13). A trial of extended early virologic responders (undetectable HCV -RNA levels at weeks 4 and 12) to telaprevir triple therapy reported very similar rates of adverse events in patients randomized after 20 weeks of therapy to 4 weeks vers us 28 more weeks of dual therapy. 87 The overall incidence of rash was 38 percent (severe rash 5 percent) and the incidence of anemia 42 percent (severe anemia 6 percent). Key Question 3b. Do these harms differ according to patient subgroup characteristics, including HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, or genetic markers? No trial of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin reported harms in patients stratif ied by factors such as HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, or genetic markers. Three trials that restricted enrollment to patients with genotype 1 infection reported risk estimates for risk of harms that were similar to the risk estimates based on all trials (strength of evidence: insufficient). No trial evaluated harms associated with triple therapy with pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and boceprevir or telaprevir versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin in patient subgroup s. All trials evaluated patients with genotype 1 infection (strength of evidence: insufficient). No trial of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin reported harms in patients stratified by factors such as HCV genotype, age, race, sex, stage of disease, or genetic markers. A subgroup of three trials of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a versus pegylated interferon alfa -2b that restricted enrollment to patients with genotype 1 infection reported pooled estimates for risk of harms that were similar to the risk estimates based on all trials. 22, 58, 59 All trials of triple therapy including protease inhibitors restricted enrollment to patients with genotype 1 i nfection. Key Question 4. Have improvements in intermediate outcomes (SVR, histologic changes) been shown to reduce the risk or rates of adverse health outcomes from HCV infection? A large Veterans Affairs (VA) study that controlled well for potential confounders found an SVR after antiviral therapy associated with lower risk of all- cause mortality versus no SVR (adjusted HR for genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Eighteen other cohort studies found an SVR associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality, liver- related mortality, HCC, and other complications of end- stage liver disease versus no SVR, with stronger effect estimates than the VA study (adjusted HRs generally ranged from around 0.10 to 0.33). However, the studies had methodological shortcomings, including inadequate handling of confounders, and 10 were conducted in Asia (strength of evidence: moderate). Nine studies found an SVR associated with greater improvement in measures relat ed to quality of life (generic or disease -specific) 24 weeks after the end of antiviral treatment versus no SVR, with differences averaging less than 5 to 10 points on various SF -36 domains. All studies were poor quality and were characterized by failure t o adjust for 50 confounders, high loss to followup, and failure to blind patients to SVR status (strength of evidence: low). All-Cause Mortality, Liver-Related Mortality, and Complications Related to Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection Nineteen cohort studie s evaluated the association between achieving an SVR following interferon -based antiviral therapy and mortality (all -cause or liver -related) or complications related to chronic HCV infection, such as HCC, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or gastrointestina l bleeding, and these 19 studies reported risk estimates adjusted for potential confounders (Table 11, Appendix F, Appendix H: Evidence Table 9).8, 9, 89- 105 Sample sizes ranged from 105 to 16,864 subjects and duration of followup ranged from 3 to 9 years. Ten studies were conducted in Asia. 89, 95- 100, 102, 104, 105 Four studies focused on patients who received pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin.8, 9, 91, 94 The others evaluated patients who received nonpegylated interferon plus ribavi rin, or either pegylated or non pegylated interferon monotherapy. Ten studies8, 89, 92, 97- 101, 104, 105 evaluated general populations of HCV patients treated with antiviral therapy (baseline rate of cirrhosis ranged from 3 -20 percent) and nine studies9, 90, 91, 93 -96, 102, 103 focused on patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis at the time of antiviral treatment. Six studies90, 93- 96, 102 enrolled patients with cirrhosis only, and the baseline rate of cirrhosis ranged from 21 -77 percent in three others.9, 91, 103 All studies had methodological shortcomings (Appendix H: Evidence Table 10). Eight studies92-94, 100, 102- 105 were rated poor quality and the remainder fair quality. Although all of the studies reported adjusted risk estimates, only eight8, 89, 91, 95- 98, 101 of the 19 studies evaluated five key potential confounders (age, sex, genotype, viral load, and fibrosis stage). No study clearly described assessment of outcomes blinded to SVR status and only five studies 8, 94, 97, 98, 102 reported the num ber of patients who met inclusion criteria but were excluded due to missing data or loss to followup. For general populations of HCV patients treated with antiviral therapy, the largest study (n=16,864) had the fewest methodological shortcomings and was al so conducted in the United States. (Appendix H: Evidence Table 11).8 It adjusted for multiple potential confounders, including age, sex, viral load, presence of cirrhosis, multiple aspa levels, and others; and stratified results by genotype. In a predominantly male (>95 percent) population of veterans, the study found SVR after antiviral therapy associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality versus no SVR, after a median fo llowup of 3.8 years (adjusted HR 0.71 0.75] for genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Although point estimates showed somewhat smaller effects for genotype 1 compared with genotypes 2 or 3, the confidence intervals for the three genotypes overlapped. The very rapid (within 3 months after assessing for SVR for genotype 3) separation of mortality curves suggests possible residual confounding, given the expected duration required to observe benefits in long- term clinical outcomes. Clinical outcomes other than mortality were not assessed. Nine other studies also evaluated the association between achieving an SVR and mortality or hepatic complications in general populations of HCV patients (Appendix H: Evidenc e Table 11).89, 92, 97- 101, 104, 105 One fair -quality study from Scotland found an SVR after antiviral therapy associated with decreased risk of liver -related mortality (adjusted HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.58) and liver -related hospital episodes (adjusted H R 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34) versus no SVR.98 One Australian study (poor quality) found no statistically significant association between 51 virologic response status (SVR, response -relapse, or nonresponse) and all -cause mortality, liver - related mortality, or HCC, although trends favored the SVR group.92 The other seven studies (three poor quality), all conducted in Asia, each found an SVR after antiviral therapy associated with substantially lower risk of all- cause mortality, liver- related mortality, or HCC versus no SVR.89, 97, 99- 101, 104, 105 Six studies reported substantially lower risk for all- cause mortality than the U.S. study described above (adjusted HR range 0.12 to 0.39).89, 97, 100, 101, 104, 105 For liver- related mortality, four studies89, 97, 100, 104 reported adjusted HRs that ranged from 0 .04 to 0.17 and for HCC, four studies reported adjusted HRs that ranged from of 0.12 to 0.36.89, 99, 101, 105 Six studies of European or North American populations (two poor quality) evaluated the association between achieving an SVR after antiviral therap y and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis prior to antiviral treatment (Appendix H: Evidence Table 11). 9, 90, 91, 93, 94, 103 One study (fair quality) found an SVR after antiviral therapy associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality or liver transplantation versus no SVR (adjusted HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.46).9 Another study (poor quality) found an SVR associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.4).103 Four studies found an SVR associated with decreased risk of liver -related mortality and HCC versus no SVR (adjusted HRs ranged from 0.12 to 0.27 and from 0.19 to 0.46, respectively).9, 90, 91, 103 For complications of chronic HCV infection (variably defined), six studies reported adjusted HRs that ranged from 0.13 to 0.38. 9, 90, 91, 93, 94, 103 Results from three Asian studies95, 96, 102 (one poor quality) were consistent with the North American and European studies. One study102 found an SVR associated with lower risk of all -cause mortality versus no SVR (adjusted HR 0.07, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.56) and three studies95, 96, 102 found an SVR associated with lower risk of HCC versus no SVR (adjusted HR range 0.18 to 0.40). One study stratified results according to presence or absence of cirrhosis of baseline. Although effects of an SVR versus no SVR on all -cause mortality appeared more favorable in patients with cirrhosis compared with those without cirrhosis, estimates were imprecise and confidence intervals overlapped substantially, precluding strong conclusions.104 The only study to evaluate the association between improvement in histological outcomes and clinical outcomes did not meet inclusion criteria because it did not report adjusted risk estimates.106 In 96 patients with chron ic HCV infection and cirrhosis, it found regression of cirrhosis (defined as a decrease in METAVIR fibrosis score from 4 to 2) after interferon -based therapy associated with decreased risk of liver -related events (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, HCC, or liver transplantation) or death (0 vs. 4 events/100 patients -years, p=0.002) after a median followup of 10.5 years. Transplantation- free survival was 100 percent in patients with regression of cirrhosis compared with 74 percent in those without regression (p=0.02). In addition to failure to analyze potential confounders, the study only included patients who underwent a post -treatment biopsy, which could have resulted in selection bias, and cirrhosis regr ession only occurred in 13 patients, resulting in low precision. 52 Table 11.

Quality of Life Nine cohort studies evaluated the association between an SVR following interferon- based antiviral therapy and outcomes related to quality of life (Appendix H: Evidence Table 12).107-115 Sample sizes ranged from 138 to 1121. Only one study107 reported adjusted risk estimates, thus we included studies that reported unadjusted risk estimates. Eight studies107, 108, 110- 115 evaluated patients originally enrolled in randomized trials27, 41, 116- 119 of antiviral treatments. Two studies evaluated the same cohort of patients113, 115 and one study114 evaluated a cohort of patients included in a study108 that reported results for three pooled cohorts. One study included patients randomized to pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin, although results were not stratified according to what type of antiviral therapy was received.111 The remainder of the studies evaluated nonpegylated interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy, or nonpegylated or pegylated interferon monotherapy. All studies were rated poor quality (Appendix H: Evidence Table 13). One study adjusted for potential confounders,107 one study reported low loss to followup,112 and one study reported blinding of patients to virologic outcomes.110 Followup was at 24 weeks after treatment (typically 72 weeks from start of treatment) in all studies. No study evaluated longer term quality of life according to SVR status. All of the studies found patients with an SVR experienced better improvement from baseline on individual SF -36 domains as well as SF -36 physical and mental component summary scores compared with those with no SVR (Appendix H: Evidence Table 14). In most studies, differences between patients with and without an SVR on various SF -36 domains were less than 5 to 10 points. Patients with an SVR also reported greater improvements from baseline on hepatitis C specific quality of life measures (health distress and limitations ) and measures related to fatigue and sleep somnolence. However, results are subject to the methodological limitations of the studies. One study also found achieving an overall response (defined as SVR plus 2- point improvement in the Histological Activity Index) associated with improved quality of life compared with those without an overall response. 113 58 Discussion The evidence reviewed in this study is summarized in Table 12. The specific domain scores used to determine the overall strength of evidence for each body of evidence are shown in Appendix G. Antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection continues to evolve. No study has evaluated comparative effectiveness of current antiviral regimens on long -term clinical outcomes such as mortality, complications of chronic HCV infection, or quality of life. Such trials would be difficult to design and carry out due to the long time required for complications of chronic HCV infection to develop in most patients. The first pegylated interferon was approved by the FDA only in 2001, and the initial major trials of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin were published in 2002. The protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir were approved only in 2011. Although some trials reported short -term (prior to 1 year after the end of antiviral therapy) mortality, 22, 32, 51 few adverse events were reported, precluding reliable conclusions. Dual Therapy Regimens With Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin In lieu of direct evidence on long- term clinical outcomes, sustained virologic response (SVR) rates are the primary outcome to assess comparative benefits of different antiviral regimens. In trials of treatment- na\u00efve patients, the likelihood of achieving an SVR was slightly lower with dual therapy with pegylated i nterferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin (pooled RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; I2=27%), with a difference in absolute SVR rates of about 8 percentage points.20-23, 53, 55, 58 Although the largest study, the IDEAL trial, found no difference in SVR rates between dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b, excluding the IDEAL trial from pooled analyses resulted in similar effect estimates. 22 Although there was no difference between dual therapy regimens in risk of withdrawals due to adverse events, dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin was associated with a lower risk of serious adverse events than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin (pooled RR 0.76, 95% CI 0. 61 to 0.95, I 2=0% ), suggesting a potential tradeoff between greater benefits and harms. However, serious adverse events were only reported in two trials ;22, 23 the rate of serious adverse events was relatively low (about 4 percent overall in IDEAL), with an absolute difference of about one percent; and adverse events with antiviral treatm ents generally resolve following discontinuation of therapy. Trials found no clear differe nces in estimates of relative effectiveness of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b in patient subgroups stratified by age, sex, race, viral load, fibrosis stage, and genotype, although absolute response rates were lower in older patients, Black patients, patients with high viral load, patients with more advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and genotype 1 infection. 20-23, 56 SVR rates ranged from 24-42 percent lower in patients with genotype 1 infection compared with patients with genotype 2 or 3. In patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection, dual therapy for 12 to 16 weeks appears to be associated with lower likelihood of SVR compared with dual therapy for 24 weeks, with no differences between 24 weeks and longer courses of therapy.63, 64, 66, 68, 70, 71 Standard doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2b were more effective than lower doses (no trials compared different 59 doses of pegylated interferon alfa -2a).66, 73- 77 Although trials comparing diffe rent ribavirin doses found no clear differences, with the exception of one trial that found lower doses associated with lower SVR rates in patients with advanced fibrosis,81 they evaluated different dose comparisons, precluding firm conclusions.63, 80, 82 Table 12.

Moderate Sustained virologic response Four trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection found 24 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa- 2a or alfa-2b) more effective than 12-16 weeks for achieving an SVR (pooled RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3; I2=80%). Relative risk estimates ranged from 1.0 to 1.3 in the four trials and may have varied in part due to differences across studies in ribavirin dosing. Moderate Sustained virologic response Three trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection with a rapid virologic response (undetectable HCV -RNA by week 4) found no differences between 24 vs. 12 -16 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa-2a or alfa-2b) plus ribavirin (pooled RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.1, I2=66%). Relative risk estimates ranged from 0.89 to 1.1. Moderate Dual Therapy With Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a or Alfa-2b Plus Ribavirin: Dose Effects Sustained virologic response Six trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection found lower doses of pegylated interferon alfa- 2b (0.75- 1.0 mcg/kg or 50 mcg) associated with lower likelihood of achieving an SVR than higher doses (1.5 mcg/kg or 100- 150 RR to 0.99; I2=20%). Moderate Sustained virologic response Three trials of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection who did not specifically have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis found no clear difference in likelihood of SVR between lower doses of ribavirin (400 or 800 mg flat dose or 600 to 800 mg weight -based dose ) vs. higher doses (800 or 1,200 mg flat dose or 800 to 1400 mg weight -based dose). Moderate Sustained virologic response One small trial of patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection (N=60) and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak stage 4 -6) found 600 to 800 mg daily of ribavirin associated with lower likelihood of SVR than 1000 to 1200 mg daily (45 vs. 72 percent, RR 0.62, 95% C I 0.40 to 0.98).

Moderate Sustained virologic response One trial of patients with genotype 1 infection found 48 weeks of triple therapy with boceprevir using a low dose of ribavirin (400- 1000 mg daily) associated with a non - statistically significant trend toward lower likelihood of SVR compared with 48 weeks of triple therapy with a standard ribavirin dose (800- 1400 mg daily) (36% vs. 50%, RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.3). Low Triple Therapy With Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a or Alfa-2b, Ribavirin, and Telaprevir vs. Interferon Alfa-2a or Alfa-2b Plus Ribavirin Sustained virologic response Three trials of patients with genotype 1 infection found triple therapy with telaprevir for 24 weeks (12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a, ribavirin, and telaprevir followed by 12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin) associated with a higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa- 2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (pooled RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.8; I2=0%), with an absolute incr ease in SVR rate of 22% (95% CI 13 to 31).

Mortality and long-term hepatic complications A large VA hospital study that controlled well for potential confounders found an SVR after antiviral therapy associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality vs. no SVR for genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Eighteen other cohort studies found an SVR associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality, liver -related mortality, HCC, and other complications of ESLD compared with no SVR, with stronger effect estimates than the VA study (adjusted HRs generally ranged from around 0.10 to 0.33). However, the studies had methodological shortcomings, including inadequate handling of confounders, and 10 were conducted in Asia. Moderate Short -term quality of life Nine studies found an SVR associated with greater improvement in measures related to quality of life (generic or disease -specific) 24 weeks after the end of antiviral treatment vs. no SVR, with differences averaging less than 5 to 10 points on various SF -36 domains. All studies were poor -quality and were characterized by failure to adjust for confounders, high loss to followup, and failure to blind patients to SVR status.

Triple Therapy Regime ns With Pegylated Interferon, Ribavirin, and Either Boceprevir or Telaprevir The relatively low SVR rates with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin dual therapy for genotype 1 infection (present in about three -quarters of U.S. patients with HCV infection) h as led to ongoing efforts to identify more effective treatment alternatives. Recent trials found triple therapy regimens with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b), ribavirin, and either boceprevir or telaprevir associated with substantially higher SVR rates than standard dual therapy with pegylated interferon (alfa -2a or alfa -2b) plus ribavirin in treatment -na\u00efve patients with genotype 1 infection.30-32, 51, 59, 85- 87SVR rates with triple therapy approached the 70 -80 percent rates observed with dual therapy in patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection. Trials that evaluated the telaprevir regimen recommended by the FDA (12 weeks of triple therapy with telaprevir followed by response -guided duration of 12 or 36 weeks of dual therapy) reported SVR rates of 75-80 percent. 51, 59 Trials that evaluated the FDA -recommended boceprevir regimen for antiviral- na\u00efve patients with cirrhosis (4 weeks of dual therapy lead -in followed by 44 weeks of triple therapy with boceprevir) reported SVR rates of 66 -75 percent.30, 32 Trials that evaluated other regimens in antiviral na\u00efve patients, including fixed duration telaprevir regimens, shorter fixed duration triple therapy with boceprevir, and boceprevir without dual therapy lead- in, 67 reported similar or lower SVR rates. The S VR rates with various antiviral regimens or placebo are summarized in Table 13. Table 13. Sustained virologic response rates with different antiviral regimens for hepatitis C virus infection Regimen Sustained Virologic Response Rate 6 Months after Treatm ent (%) Approximate Number Needed To Treat T o Achieve One Sustained Virologic Response Compared With Placebo References Placebo <2 Not applicable 1 regimens recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration evaluated in trials of antiviral -na\u00efve patients. The boceprevir regimen recommended by the FDA84 for antiviral- na\u00efve patients without baseline cirrhosis (4 weeks of dual therapy lead -in with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin followed by the addition of boceprevir for 24 weeks for virologic responders at weeks 8 to 24, or 4 weeks of dual therapy lead- in followed by the addition of boceprevir for 32 weeks and then 12 additional weeks of dual therapy for late virologic responders) has not been evaluated in a trial of antiviral- na\u00efve patients. Rather, the FDA recommendation was based on a trial of previous partial responders to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin which found slightly highe r SVR rates in late virologic responders who received 32 weeks of triple therapy followed by 12 weeks of dual therapy versus those who received 44 weeks of triple therapy, each following 4 weeks of dual therapy lead -in (SVR rates 79 vs. 73 percent). 123 As in the head- to-head trials of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin versus pegylated interferon alfa- 2b plus ribavirin, relative risk estimates were similar (or there was no clear difference) in patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race, although absolute SVR rates were lower in older patients and Black patients. Triple therapy with either boceprevir or telaprevir was no more effective than dual therapy in the subgroup of patients with lower HCV - RNA viral load (<600,000 or <800,000 IU/mL). 30, 32, 51 There was insufficient evidence to evaluate relative effectiveness of triple compared with dual therapy based on fibrosis stage. In addition to higher likelihood of SVR, another advantage of triple therapy regimens in patients with gen otype 1 infection is the potential for shorter duration (24 or 28 weeks in patients with early virologic response compared with the standard 48 weeks of dual therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin). Shorter courses of treatment would probably be appealing to patients of high relevance to patients, given the high frequency of bothersome flulike symptoms associated with interferon -based therapy. Triple therapy regimens were associated with increased risk of certain harms, in particular hematological adverse events (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) with boceprevir and anemia and rash (including severe rash in <10 percent of 68 patients that could result in treatment discontinuation) with telaprevir. However, there was no clear increase in risk of serious adverse events with use of protease inhibitors, and the adverse events appear to be self -limited following drug discontinuation. Sustained Virologic Response After Antiviral Therapy and Clinical Outcomes The strongest evidence on the association between an SVR after antiviral therapy and improved clinical outcomes is a large VA cohort study (n=16,864) that adjusted for many confounders. 8 The VA study found decreased risk of all -cause mortality in patients who achieved an SVR compared w ith those who didn't achieve an SVR across groups stratified by for genotypes 2, and 3, respectively). Despite controlling for important confounders, the possibility of residual confounding is suggested by the very rapid separation of mortality curves for patients with an SVR versus those without an SVR, which was observed at three months after assessment for SVR. This is more rapid than expected given the typically prolonged natural history of HCV infection. Therefore, estimates of effects of SVR on clinical outcomes from this study may be exaggerated, though it is not possible to determine to what degree. Eighteen other cohort studies also found an SVR after antiviral therapy associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality and complications of chronic HCV infection, including studies specifically of patients with baseline cirrhosis, but had more methodological shortcomings. In addition, 10 of the 19 studies were conducted in Asia, where the incidence of HCC in patients with chronic HCV infection is higher than in the United States, 46 potentially limiting their generalizability. Other studies found an SVR after antiviral therapy associated with better scores on various measures of quality of life than no SVR, but those studies focused on short -term outcomes, and typically did not adjust for confounders or blind patients to SVR status when assessing outcomes. Findings in Relationship to What Is Already Known Our findings regarding the comparative effectiveness of dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2b plus ribavirin compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin are consistent with recent systematic reviews that also found the former associated with a lower likelihood of SVR. 18, 124 Our findings of no clear difference in comparative effectiveness between 12 to 16 weeks compared with 24 weeks of response- guided dual therapy with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin in hepatitis C genotype 2 or 3 infection with rapid virologic response are discordant with a recent systematic review, which found a shorter duration of treatment associated with a lower likelihood of achieving an SVR. 125 The discrepancy may be explained by the inclusion in the o ther systematic review of a study that we excluded because it evaluated a nonstandard dose of pegylated interferon,65 as well as its inclusion of subgroup analyses from trials of patients randomized to different fixed durations of therapy prior to assessment of rapid virologic response, 64, 68, 70 which we considered separately because they did not represent randomized comparisons of response -guided treatment. Because telaprevir and boceprevir are so new, we are unaware of other published systematic reviews on the comparative benefits and harms of regimens including these drugs, compared with standard dual therapy. Our findings on the association between achieving an SVR and 69 reduced risk of mortality or complications associated with chronic HCV infection are consistent with a recent review that used some systematic methods.126 Applicability The trials included in this review generally met criteria for efficacy studies, based on the exclusion of patients with common comorbidities (such as serious psychiatric conditions or recent or ongoing substance abuse) who may receive treatments in clinical practice. In addition, the trials may have overestimated efficacy compared with what would be seen in typical practice due to improved adherence as a result of closer fol lowup, effects of trial participation, selection of patients, or other factors. A separate review funded by AHRQ will focus on issues related to adherence in the treatment of HCV infection. 127 The severity of baseline liver disease in the patients enrolled in the trials suggests that they enrolled a broad range of patients. In trials of triple therapy with boceprevir or telaprevir, the proportion of patients with cirrhosis at enrollment ranged from <1 -11 percent.30-32, 51, 59, 85, 87 Trials that reported th e proportion of patients with minimal or no fibrosis reported rates of 27-39 percent.31, 51, 59, 87 Evidence to evaluate potential differences in comparative benefits or harms in patient subgroups based on age, sex, race, and other clinical factors was rel atively limited, precluding strong conclusions in these specific subgroups. The strongest evidence on the association between an SVR versus no SVR after antiviral therapy and reduced mortality comes from a study performed in a VA population, which might li mit generalizability to other settings. 8 As described above, studies conducted in Asia on the association between an SVR after antiviral therapy and risk of clinical outcomes may be of limited applicability to U.S. populations because of a higher incidence of HCC in Asian patients with chronic HCV infection. 46 However, HCC incidence is increasing in the United States in HCV -infected patients,128 which may attenuate such concerns regarding applicability. The results of this CER are not applicable to populati ons excluded from the review, including patients previously treated with antiviral therapies and excluded populations such as patients with HIV coinfection, post -transplant patients, or hemodialysis patients. Antiviral therapy is not recommended in patient s following kidney transplant, and ribavirin is not recommended in those with more severe (stage 3 to 5) kidney disease since it is cleared via renal function and associated with increased risk of hemolytic anemia in this setting. Such patients were typically excluded from randomized trials of antiviral treatment. 15 Implications for Clinical and Policy Decisionmaking Our review has potential implications for clinical and policy decisionmaking. For patients with genotype 1 infection, triple therapy regimens with pegylated interferon or alfa- 2b), ribavirin, and telaprevir or boceprevir may be considered an alternative to dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a or alfa -2b plus ribavirin as standard treatment due to substantially superior efficacy for achieving SVR compared with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa - 2a or alfa -2b, as well as a shorter duration of treatment. Factors that may affect decisions to utilize regimens with boceprevir or telaprevir include cost and specific harms associated with use of these drugs (such as hematologic adverse events with boceprevir and anemia and rash with telaprevir). Dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa -2a plus ribavirin appears to be associated with higher likelihood of achieving SVR compare d with dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, but absolute differences were relatively small and may be offset in part by 70 a small increase in serious (but generally self -limited) adverse events. Therefore, decisions about which pegylated interferon to use may be affected by other considerations, such as cost, patient preferences, or other factors. For genotype 2 or 3 infection, standard doses and duration (24 weeks) of pegylated interferon as part of dual therapy are more effective t han shorter regimens or lower doses, lending support to dosing guidance from the FDA and clinical practice guidelines. 15, 33, 34 Evidence on differential effects of ribavirin dose are too limited to draw strong conclusions about optimal dosing of this component of antiviral regimens, though differences appeared relatively small. The findings that absolute SVR rates are lower in certain subgroups (such as older patients, Black patients, patients with worse baseline fibrosis, and patients with high viral load) can be used to inform individualized decisionmaking. Patients who are less likely to achieve a SVR may make different informe d decisions about therapy compared to those more likely to achieve an SVR, given the adverse effects associated with treatment. The findings of the review are also relevant to screening recommendations, which are based in part on the effectiveness of trea tments in patients found through screening to have HCV infection. Important new evidence that may affect assessments regarding potential benefits of screening include stronger evidence on the link between achieving an SVR and improvement in clinical outcom es, as well as evidence showing substantially higher SVR rates with newer triple therapy regimens with boceprevir or telaprevir in patients with genotype 1 infection, the predominant type of HCV infection in the United States. Limitations of the Comparativ e Effectiveness Review Process Our review had some potential limitations. We excluded non- English- language articles, which could result in language bias, although a recent systematic review found little empirical evidence that exclusion of non-English- language articles leads to biased estimates for noncomplementary or alternative medicine interventions.129 We did not formally assess for publication bias with funnel plots due to small numbers (<10) of studies for all comparisons. Small numbers of studies can make interpretation of funnel plots unreliable, and experts suggest 10 studies as the minimum number of studies to perform funnel plots. 50 We included some studies which were published only as abstracts and found that their inclusion or exclusion from analyses did not change conclusions. In addition, we searched trial registries and solicited drug manufacturers for additional unpublished trials and identified none. Another potential limitation is that we included cohort studies to evaluate the association between SVR and mortality or hepatic complications associated with chronic HCV infection. Such studies are susceptible to confounding if factors associated with SVR (such as age, race, viral load, or fibrosis stage) are also associated with these outcomes. Therefore, we only included studies that reported adjusted risk estimates, and we evaluated how well studies addressed key potential confounders as part of our quality assessment. Nonetheless, residual confounding is a possibility even in cohort studies that adjust for potential confounding. Limitations of the Evidence Base We identified several important limitations of the evidence base. First, studies assessing important long -term clinical outcomes associated with current antiviral treatments for chroni c HCV infection are not available. In the case of antiviral regimens involving newly approved 71 antiviral drugs, such studies are not possible yet because of the extended followup required to adequately evaluate effects on clinical outcomes. Second, no trial s directly compared regimens with boceprevir compared with regimens with telaprevir. Given the increased efficacy of these regimens in patients with genotype 1 infection, trials directly comparing their effects would be helpful for informing treatment choi ces between these drugs. In addition, few trials have evaluated the specifically FDA -approved regimens for these drugs, limiting confidence in conclusions regarding estimates of benefits and harms for the regimens likely to be used in clinical practice. Th ird, almost all of the randomized trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Studies have shown that such studies tend to report more favorable results for drugs produced by the funder than studies funded by governmental or other sources. 130, 131 Four th, there was relatively limited information on effects of newer triple therapy regimens with a protease inhibitor in subgroups defined by age, body weight, baseline fibrosis stage, and other important factors. Such information would be helpful for individualizing treatment decisions with these regimens. Finally, few methodologically rigorous studies conducted in settings applicable to U.S. populations evaluated the association between achieving an SVR and improvements in clinical outcomes. Such studies would be very helpful for confirming the results of the recent, large, well-conducted VA cohort study showing an association between achieving an SVR and reduced mortality risk. 8 Future Research Evaluating the comparative effectiveness of current antiviral regimens on clinical outcomes in randomized trials or cohort studies is a challenge due to the long lead -time and large samples necessary to adequately assess these outcomes. This might be more feasible if the studies were to focus on populations at higher r isk for complications from chronic HCV infection (e.g., patients with baseline cirrhosis, high viral load, or other risk factors for progression). For all trials of antiviral treatments, studies that enroll broader populations with medical and psychologica l comorbidities, as frequently encountered in clinical practice, are needed to better understand comparative effectiveness, rather than just comparative efficacy. Studies designed using an effectiveness paradigm would also be helpful for understanding real -world effects of antiviral regimens, including effects related to the poorer treatment adherence than expected from efficacy trials. Studies that evaluate the usefulness of genomics and other methods for individualizing treatment decisions in patients wit h HCV infection are also needed. Trials directly comparing triple therapy with telaprevir compared with triple therapy with boceprevir would be very helpful for understanding comparative effectiveness of these two protease inhibitors. In addition, trials e valuating the boceprevir regimen by the FDA in antiviral - na\u00efve patients without baseline cirrhosis are needed to verify that results from studies of previously treated patients were appropriately generalized. Prolonged followup of patients exposed to telaprevir and boceprevir is needed to understand the long -term harms associated with these medications. A number of other protease inhibitors and other newer drugs for treatment of hepatitis C virus infection are currently in active development and further stu dies with new drugs and drug regimens are expected, including regimens without interferon. 88 It is critical that future studies that evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with an SVR versus no SVR after antiviral therapy adequately control for other facto rs that influence clinical outcomes in chronic HCV infection. Studies on effects of achieving an SVR on long- term quality of life would be very helpful for understanding other potential clinical benefits of antiviral 72 therapy, but a significant challenge is whether it is possible to ethically blind patients to virologic status, which may have an important impact on assessments of quality of life. 73 References 1.
