Greystone Regenerative Medicine Reviews Dr Shober was a huge help to me with my knee pain. The pain in my knee has significantly decreased, and I feel I am able to live an active lifestyle again. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a nontraditional approach to their joint pain Wish I would have discovered Greystone Regenerative Medicine sooner. I'm a flight attendant and sitting on the jumpseat all month is brutal. My shoulder and hip are feeling better thanks to the advanced therapies. Once Dr. Shober gets discovered it will be hard to get in! I am so happy to have found Dr. Nathaniel. I have always struggled with acne and scarring. I have tried creams, peels, micro needling, you name it! The opus plasma treatment has been the only thing that has worked. I have since regained my confidence back after getting treatment and my skin looks refreshed! The space is clean and Dr. Nathaniel and Amber both made me feel comfortable and understood my lifelong frustrations. I will most certainly be back! So I found myself in Concord; hungover, beat up & in need of an IV. I was just looking for a inexpensive, non-sketchy IV place but what I found was so much more than that. Nathaniel at Greystone is a true medical professional. Very concerned with proper and effective administration of the IV and also about concerned about my overall health and how he could help. His demeanour was kind, thoughtful & warm and his knowledge and skills were truly impressive. I left Greystone feeling like a million bucks and was pleasantly surprised that Nathaniel followed up a few hours later to check on me. I got an IV, but he does wayyyy more treatments than that and he seemed to really be on the cutting edge of medical tech. When I'm back in town, I will 100% come back. Highly recommended Dr Shober at Greystone Regenerative Medicine has helped me so much.. I went in with knee pain and with the treatments I had I can now go up and down stairs with no knee pain. I am so grateful for all the knowledge he shares as well. Thank you. I highly recommend . 10 Total Reviews 5 Average Rating Get In Touch Learn More About "}
