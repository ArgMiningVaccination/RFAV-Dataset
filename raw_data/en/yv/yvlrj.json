Q & A: Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Information for 2015-2016 September 21 , 2015 - Q & A Vaccine Information for Providers v 1.0 2. How do I order my supply of vaccine and when will it arrive ? Immunization providers should initially order a two to four week supply of influenza vaccine and continue to order on a monthly basis. Order only the amount you estimate you will use within the month. We encourage you to start immunizing as soon as you rec eive your vaccine supply. Please try to first immunize people at greatest risk of influenza -related complications and those people who live with or care for them. In terms of timing, s easonal influenza vaccine is sent from the manufacturer to the Nova Scotia Provincial Biodepot over a period of 6 -8 weeks in varying quantities. This usually takes place in mid to late October. It's critical for Public Health to manage the supply of vaccin e to ensure equitable distribution to all immunization providers. Every year, there are potential delays in vaccine development and distribution from vaccine manufacturers. In addition, distribution from the Biodepot takes a week to 10 days, so it is impos sible to for every provider to receive their supply at the exact same time. We ask for your patience and your h elp explaining the situation when clients ask why some providers have vaccine earlier than others. 3. What are my accountabilities as an immunization provider?
