Introduction Federal Regional Council The Federal Regional Council (FRC) is a co nsortium of 25 federal departments and agencies representing approximately 60 program offices in Region IX. A primary goal for th e FRC is to work in a coordinated manner to make federal programs more effective and efficient in Region IX. The FRC, which celebrated its 16th anniversary in FY14, includes several committees which focus on broad geographic areas and/or special population s in the vast expanse of Region IX. Thes e include the following committees: Border, T ribal Affairs, Homelessness (Region IX Interagency Council on Homelessn ess), and the Outer Pacific. Executive Orders and Administrati on initiatives serve as the underlying auth ority to guide each committee's work in fulfilling Administration priorities. Outer Pacific Committee The Outer Pacific Committee (OPC) focuses on issues related to th e three U.S. Flag Territories: American Samoa (AS), Commonweal th of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), an d Guam and also of the three Freely Associated States: Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Republic of the Marshall Islands (R MI), and Republic of Palau (ROP). Collecti vely, these territories and states are refe rred to as the US-affiliated Pacific Island jurisdicti ons (USAPI). At the end of 2009, the Guam-C NMI Military Build-Up Committee/Task Forc e merged with the OPC and military buildup issues in the Western Pacific continue to have high priority at OPC meetings. Outer Pacific Committee accomplishments for FY2014 The OPC has met regularly since 1998. By convening the participat ing federal agencies, the committee believes it can achieve be tter outcomes for the people in the Pacific jurisdictions. The Committee's goals for FY 2014 included the following: 1) Compilation and dissemination of the annual grants report 2) Improved communications between federal agencies on Pacific issues 3) Program planning and coordination 4) Improving grants and financial manage ment in the Pacific jurisdictions 5) Enhancing central office/regional office collaboration 6) Increased committee membership In 2014 the committee convened on six occasions and is plea sed to report accomplishments in the following areas: 1) The OPC prepares an annual report on \"Grants to the Outer Paci fic\" for use by federal representatives but which is also widely requested by officials in the Pacific jurisdictions. The current report reflecting FY2014 grants marks the 15th year this document has been prepared. Copies of th e report will be distributed for the 9th year in a row at the annual Interagency Group on Insular Areas (IGIA) meeting that is held after th e National Governors Association Winter meeting in Washington, D.C. 2) The FRC met twice in Hawaii, cohosted by the Honolulu Fede ral Executive Board. These in-person meetings in April and September discussed FRC activities in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands, including work by the OPC. The focus of these meetings including opportunities for greening variou s federal agencies, unique challenges and opportunities faced by these island communities, including climate change im pacts, and innovative partnerships. 3) The committee continued its past cooperative efforts with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Minority Health and the Asian Pacific Islander American Heal th Forum in addressing health disparities in the Pacific jurisdictions. The committee also continued working throughout the year with other governmental entities including the Department of the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs (DOI/OIA ) and the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islands (WHIAAPI) to develop strategies to address ineq uities in health care access in the jurisdictions. 4) Since the beginning days of the OPC, the issue of grants and financial management has been a priority concern. The committee continued its communications with DOI/OIA, the Gradua te School (formerly the USDA Graduate School) and other partners on the development of strategies to provide training and mentorship in best practices for grants and financial management. The committee continues to promote the groundbrea king fiscal training and mentoring work that has been accomplished in the Pacific by one of its member agencies, th e HHS/Administration for Children and Families, as a model for other federal agencies to emulate in improving grants an d financial management practices in the jurisdictions. 5) The committee continued to keep its membership abreast of deve lopments in the field of tele communications in the Pacific. With the rapid development of technologies and linkages in the Pacific, there continue to be major developments and impending improvements in telecommunica tions capabilities that are regularly brought to the attention of the OPC. iv 6) The committee continues to be involved in deliberations and strategy development with the federal effort to assist Guam in preparing for the arrival of military personnel, at some point in the future. Committee members' issues and concerns regarding the military buildup have been shared via the committee with the Interagency Group on Insular Affairs. The OPC also participates in the FRC meetings when th e Governor of Guam and his staff attend to share their concerns regarding the US military buildup plans 7) In line with the committee's work plan, addi tional federal agencies joined the OPC in 2014 and participated in our meetings.
