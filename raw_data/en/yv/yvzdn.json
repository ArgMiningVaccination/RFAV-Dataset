I never thought about it, but I was basically spraying myself with toxins. Luckily, there are amazing non toxic perfume alternatives made in America. I'm a tough customer when it comes to fragrance, so I was surprised when I fell in love with at least one scent from each of these brands. I never thought essential oils could be so intoxicating! I've been so happy with all the non toxic perfumes I've found made with essential oils, based in a carrier oil. They are rich, fragrant, and offer subtle scents. Non Toxic Perfumes We Love, All American Made Did we miss your favorite non-toxic American made perfume brand? Let us know in the comments below and we will add it to this source list for natural beauty products! Annie Oakley Perfumery, located in a small Indiana town, has been around since 1980. The perfumery began creating hand-blended fragrances, pure essential oils, and luxurious bath and body products for women and men long before the more popular maker movement began. A personal favorite is Sunset Eau de Toilette Natural Spray for women. Forager Aromatherapy Blends allows you to create your own soothing scent. With coconut oil as a base, you can pick up to six of their essential oil options to create a scent to soothe your mind, body, and soul. Lauren Brooke Cosmetiques Organic Perfume Oil in Intrigue is the perfect scent. Just as the name suggests the perfume's subtle sophisticated scent which includes a floral blend of Lotus & Patchouli and a hint of spice, offer an intriguing scent that's perfect for everyday wear. Tsi-La Fleur Sauvage is an alluring and sultry scent, it's softer and sweeter than Forager Botanicals Nectar. The tantalizing tuberose and seductive jasmine have been stimulating passion for ages. I love wearing this scent at night for a richer, deeper scent. Vert Mont Anima offers artisanal botanical perfumes handmade in Vermont. The line offers really intimate scents, in that only those who are closest to you will smell your perfume. I personally love the Ver Mont Perfumery's Anima scent. The scent profile is comprised of Persian Lime (soft citrus), Melissa (rosy lemon balm) Frankincense, and Ylang Ylang (offers a distant floral note). It's a really soulful fragrance. "}
