Based on experimental studies with humans exposed to other coronaviruses, animals exposed to SARS -CoV-2, and modeling estimates, the median infectious dose is likely between 10 and 1,000 viral particles (plaque -forming units, PFU). We need to know the infectious dose for humans by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection efforts. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How eas ily is it spread? ..................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans through close contact and aerosol transmission.35, 84, 268, 468 Asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2569 and play a large role in new case growth.395 Infection risk is particularly high indoors.57 Household transmission is rapid,17 and household contacts spread infection more than casual community contacts.484 Superspreading events (SSEs) appear common in SARS -CoV-2 transmission and may b e crucial for controlling spread. Rates of transmission on public transit are unclear but appear low;253 the US CDC recommends masks during travel.612 Children of any age can acquire and transmit infection in homes, schools, and community settings, though there is some evidence that younger children (<10 -15) are less susceptible and less infectious than older children and adults. Individuals who have clinically r ecovered but test positive for COVID -19 are unlikely to be infectious.407, 743 We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets). Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ........................................................ 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other cor onaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.398, 412, 414 Current evidence sug gests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausible.75 SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans, but the potential role of long -term reservoir species is unknown. Several animal species are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? ........................ 6 On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2 -14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days b efore symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. It is estimated that most individuals are no longer infectious beyond 10 days after symptom onset. The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximately 5 days. Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious. We need to know the incubation duration and length of infectivity in different patient populations. Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? .................................................................. 7 Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.9 Older individuals and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men.506 Fever is most often the first symptom. COVID -19 is more severe than seasonal influenza, evidenced by hig her ICU admission739 and mortality rates.539 In the US, 34% of hospitalized patients required ICU admission, and 12.6% of hospitalized patients died from COVID -19.462 COVID -19 symptoms commonl y persist for weeks646 to months103 after initial onset. Between 16% and 76% of cases are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection,89, 97, 362, 375, 385, 459, 491, 505, 642, 657 though changing symptom definitio ns make it difficult to compare asymptomatic fractions through time.452 The case fatality rate (CFR) is unknown, but adults >60522 and those with comorbidities are at elevated risk of death.647, 765 Minority populations and essential workers are disproportionately affected by COVID -19.466 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,177 though generally show milder126, 426 or no symptoms. We need to know the true case fatality rate, asymptomatic fraction, and the duration of debilitating symptoms. Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ....................................... 8 Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown.28, 713 Reinfection is possible but rare. Antibody and T -cell responses persist in most patients for >6 months. Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 is possible but appears rare, though the true frequency is unknown. The contribution of historical coronavirus exposure to SARS -CoV-2 immunity is unknown.483 We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? ................... 9 Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable. Validated serological (antibody) assays are being used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. We need to identify additional factors that affect the accuracy of serological or PCR -based diagnostic tests. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? .........................................................................................................10 COVID -19 treatment recommendations are provided by the WHO,718 NIH,490 Infectious Disease Society of America (ISDA),64 and British Medical Journal (BMJ),72 base d on ongoing analysis of evidence from clinical trials and peer reviewed data analysis. Recommendations for the use of Remdesivir vary. We need clear, randomized trials for treatment efficacy in patients with both severe and mild/moderate illness. Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? ...............................................................................................................................11 Two vaccines are currently being administered under US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. We need to understand vaccine uptake and efficacy rates, as well as how well vaccines reduce transmission. Non- pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? .....................12 Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders and widespread face mask use effectively reduce transmission. Individual behaviors (e.g., face masks, social distancing) have been associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.526 Particular focus should be placed on minimizing large gatherings where superspreading events are more likely.723 Research is needed to plan the path to SARS -CoV-2 elimination via pharmaceutical and non -pharmaceutical interventions. We need to understand measures that will limit spread in the winter, particularly in indoor environments. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .......................................................................13 SARS- CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and humidity.60 Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS- CoV-2 transmission in humans. Viable SARS -CoV-2 and/or RNA can be recovered from contaminated surfaces; however, survivability varies. In the absence of sunlight, SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for weeks. SARS- CoV-2 survival in the air is highly dependent on the presence of UV light and temperature. Stability of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples depends on temperature and transport medium. There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 is transmitted to people through food. We need to quantify the duration of viable SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, not simply the presence of RNA. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? .........................................................14 Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Several methods exist for decontaminating N95 respirators496 and other PPE. We need additional SARS -CoV-2 decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .....................................................................................................15 Face masks appear effective at reducing infections from SARS -CoV-2. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID - 19, even with recommended PPE. We need to continue assessing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ...............................................................................16 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species . We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? .................................................................................17 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Several viral variants, in cluding B.1.1.7, are being investigated for their effects on transmission and/or virulence.373 Several human genomic regions, including those determining blood type, affect COVID -19 prevalence and/or severity.33 There is some concern regarding SARS -CoV-2 strains involved in continued human and mink transmission. We need to link genotypes to phenotypes (e.g., disease severity) in infected patients, and identify differences in transmissibility or symptom severity caused by different SARS -CoV-2 mutations. Forecasting - What forecasting models and methods exist? ................................................................................................. 18 Several platforms provide digital dashboards summarizing the current status of the pandemic in US states and counties. The US CDC provides ensemble forecasts of cases and deaths based on the arithmetic mean of many participating groups.108 Additional forecasting efforts are designed to assess the effects of interventions such as social distancing and vaccination. We need to know how different forecasting methods have fared when compared to real data and develop an understanding of which model features contribute most to accurate and inaccurate forecasts. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. Based on experimental studies with humans exposed to other coronaviruses , animals exposed to SARS -CoV-2, and modeling esti mates, the median infectious dose is likely between 10 and 1,000 viral particles ( plaque -forming units , PFU). Non-human primates A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS -CoV-2 infected cynomolgus macaqu es via combination 50 total dose).581 Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x106 PFU (delivered through several routes), while marmosets developed mild infections when exposed to 1x106 PFU intranasally.425 Rhesus macaques are effectively via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route TCID 50).169 Rhesus macaques infected -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate human Rhesus macaques ocular inoculation TCID 50), resulting in mild infection; however, gastric inoculation did not result in infection (same dose), suggesting a limited role of gastric transmission. Interpretation is limited due to the small scale.168 African green monkeys replicate aspects of human disease, including severe pathological symptoms (exposed to 500,000 PFU via intrana sal and intratracheal routes),728 mild clinical symptoms (aerosol exposures between 5,000 and 16,000 PFU),284 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with small particle aerosol exposure doses as low as 2,000 PFU.70 Aerosol exposure of three primate species (African green monkeys, cynomolgus macaques, and rhesus macaques) via a Collison nebulizer resulted in mild clinical disease in all anim als with doses between 28,700 and 48,600 PFU.325 Rhesus macaques have been suggested as the best non -human primate model of human COVID -19.424 Infectious SARS -CoV-2 has been isolated from rhesus macaque feces, suggesting possible fecal -oral transmission.763 Rodents and other animal models The SARS -CoV-2 median infectious dose in Golden Syrian hamsters via the intranasal route was experimentally estimated at Low-dose (1,800 PFU) with SARS- CoV-2 resulted in mild clinical symptoms, the production of infectious virus, and seroconversion.465 Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 TCID 50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infections (all hamsters infected).617 Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU intranasally exhibited mild clinical symptoms and developed neutralizing antibodies,121 and were also capable of infecting individuals in separate cages. Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected after timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID 50/minut e) to between 900 and 1080 TCID 50 (~630- 756 PFU). All mice (4/4) exposed for 25- 30 minutes became infected, while no mice (0/8) became infected after exposure for 0 -20 minutes (up to 720 TCID 50, ~504 PFU).53 This paper has methodological caveats (e.g., particle size). infected with 316,000 TCID 50343 or 600,000 TCID 50574 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disease.343, 574 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contac t.343 In a separate ferret study, 1 in 6 individuals exposed to 102 PFU via the intranasal route became infected, while 12 out of 12 individuals exposed to >104 PFU became infected.593 Modeling estimates The infectious dose of a pathogen can be estimated by the amount of genetic material passed between an infector and infectee (called \"bottleneck\" size ); 626 using epidemiological data, sequencing data, and statistics, the average \"bottleneck\" size for SARS -CoV-2 has been estimated as ~1,200 viral particles , though exposure routes were not possible to identify .545 Modeling aerosol exposures from 5 case studies suggests the inhalation ID 50 for SA RS-CoV-2 is approximately 361 -2,000 viral particles, which is approximately 250 -1,400 PFU.548 Related Coronaviruses Humans exposed TCID 50 (~7 PFU).79, 479 The inhalation infectious dose of seasonal coronavirus 229E is unknown in humans. The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67-540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).159, 163 Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) between 100- 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.19, 141, 393, 760 What do we need to know? We need to know the infectious dose for humans by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection efforts. Human infectious dose by aerosol, surface contact (fomite), fecal -oral routes, and other potential routes of exposure Most appropriate animal model(s) to estimate the human infectious dose for SARS -CoV-2 Does exposure dose determine disease severity? What is the ratio of virus particles/virions to PFU for SARS -CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 4 Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? What d o we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans through close contact and aerosol transmission.35, 84, 268, 468 As of 1/ 12/2021, pandemic COVID -19 has caused at least 91, 022,306 infections and 1,948,146 deaths globally.321 In the US, there have been 22,620,330 confirmed COVID -19 cases and 376,295 confirmed deaths ,321 though both cases32 and fatalities are underesti mate s.501, 727 Estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1 .438, 516, 578, 735, 759 Unmitigated COVID - 19 outbreaks can result in the majority of a population becoming infected within a few months.94 A variant of SARS -CoV-2, called B.1.1.7 (also VUI or VOC 202012/01), is associated with a 50- 75% higher transmission rate than other strains,156 corresponding with an increase in the reproduction number (R) of 0.4 -0.7.677 SARS- CoV-2 can spread via aerosol or \"airborne\" transmission beyond 6 ft in certain situations719 such as enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation.112 The risk of infection from fomites is believed to be low.285 Exhaled breath may emit 105-107 genome copies per person per hour;434 the amount of infectious virus remains unknown. Vertical trans mission from mother to fetus is possible198, 676 but rare.648 Asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2569 and play a large role in new case growth .395 Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset.39, 700 Pre-symptomatic73, 348, 627, 637, 741, 762 or asymptomatic49, 304, 433 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2,420 and between 51%323 (US) and 75.9%615 (China) of infections are thought to have come from individuals who were not symptomatic at the time of transmission . Asymptomatic individuals can transmit disease as soon as 2 days after infection.636 There is evidence that asymptomatic individuals transmit SARS -CoV-2 less often than symptomatic individuals.65, 89, 644 Most transmission occurs before symptoms begin and within 5 days of symptom onset.128 Infection risk is particularly high indoors .57 SARS- CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation12, 390, 598, 630 in indoor areas such as restaurants.400 Positive SARS - CoV-2 patients were twice as likely as negative patients to report that they had recently eaten in restaurants224 or worked in an office.220 Clusters are often associated with large indoor gatherings,381, 517 including bars, restaurants,752 and gyms.124 Very few outbreaks have occurre d in outdoor settings.90 Household transmission is rapid ,17 and household contacts spread infection more than casual community con tacts.484 On average, 16.6%435 to 18%346 of household contacts of infected index patients acquire SARS -CoV-2 (i.e., the \"attack rate\") . Attack rates are higher for symptomatic index cases, spouses of index cases, and adults ,435 though transmission to children may be underestimated.264 75% of household infections occurred within 5 days of illness onset in the index case .264 In a US study, 31 of 58 households (54%) with a primary SARS -CoV-2 case showed evidence of secondary transmission; in 7 of the se 31 households (23%), all household members became infected.391 High viral load may increase transmission risk.333 Superspreading events (SSEs) appear common in SARS -CoV-2 transmission and may be crucial for controlling spread. Most new infections come from a few infectious individuals (overdispersion parameter k = 0.2 -0.5).16, 194, 371, 377, 687 Rates of transmission on public transit are unclear but appear low ;253 the US CDC recommends masks during travel.612 Several studies have identified plausible transmission on airplanes .48, 134, 293, 340, 474 Fluorescent tracer research on commercial airplanes suggests a low risk of aerosol or surface transmission during flights, though key parameters remain uncertain.618 On trains in China, transmission rates were high for those in the same row as an infectious individual (1.5 -3.5% attack rate), though low for non -neighboring passengers.300 Outbreaks have also occurred on public buses.432 Children of any age can acquire and transmit infection in homes, schools, and community settings, though there is some evidence that younger children (<10 -15) are less susceptible and less infectious than older children and adults. The role of children in SARS -CoV-2 transmission is unclear . There is evidence of high transmission in the home,308, 376, 391, 518 at school,265, 317 and in the community.292, 540, 621 However, there have also been suggestions that children are both less susceptible to COVID -19435 and less infectious ,771 resulting in low secondary transmission rates in schools, for instance.238, 773 It may be that young children (<10) are less susceptible and less infectious than adults, while older children and adolescents are more similar to adults.254 Contact tracing in China, Iceland, and Israel has found lower rates of transmission to and from younger children (<10 -15) compared to adults, but similar rates in older children.154, 520, 639 After schools reopened in Italy, attack rates were low in preschool (0%) and elementary school children (0.38%), but in middle and high school students (6.5%).365 Discrepancies regarding the susceptibility and infectivity of children may be partly explained by age . Children are also less likely than adults to test positive for COVID -19 via RT -PCR709 despite being infected,184, 655 underestimating pediatric COVI D-19 infections .154, 449 Serological studies in Germany ,291 Spain ,653 and Italy86 found high rates of SARS -CoV-2 exposure in children, though the fin ding is not ubiquitous .65 Separating the effects of differential susceptibility, infectivity, test positivity, and testing likelihood449 by age is crucial to understand the role of children. Individuals who have clinically recovered but test positive for COVID -19 are unlikely to be infectious.407, 743 What do we nee d to know? We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets). How common is transmission from bodily fluids like semen,392 urine,638 and feces?668 How infectious are young children compared to adults? What is the emission rate of infectious particles while breathing, talking, coughing, singing, or exercising ? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 5 Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.398, 412, 414 Current evidence suggests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausible.75 Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,768 with a suggested bat origin.142, 768 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,115 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.59, 143, 740, 751 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangol in samples collected several years ago,361 and pangolins positive for coronaviruses related to SARS -CoV-2 exhibited clinical symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.397 However, a survey of 334 pangolins did not identify c oronavirus nucleic acid in 'upstream' market chain samples, suggesting that positive samples from pangolins may be the result of exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. These data suggest that pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses.384 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor- binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS- CoV-1,731 potentially explaining its high transmissibility. Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range .450 Modeling s uggests a wide range of animal hosts for SARS -CoV-2, though experimental studies are still needed.151 Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans, but the potential role of long -term reservoir species is unknown . Infected mink have been linked to human infections in workers at mink farms.508 In the US, researchers experimentally exposed big brown bats ( Eptesicus fuscus) to SARS -CoV-2 via the oropharyngeal and nasal route and found no subsequent signs of infe ction, clinical symptoms, or transmission.277 Deer mice can be experimentally infected with SARS -CoV-2 via intranasal exposure (104 or 105 TCID 50)199 and are able to transmit virus to uninfected deer mice through direct contact.260 Their capacity as a reservoir species is unknown. Rabbits are susceptibl e to SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route (dose = 104-106 TCID 50) and develop asymptomatic infections, though infectious virus can be found in the nose for up to 7 days after exposure.476 Their reservoir potential is unknown. Bank voles ( Myodes glareolus ) seroconvert after SARS -CoV-2 exposure, but do not exhibit clinical symptoms and do not transmit infection to others.664 Several animal species are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters and ferrets are susceptible to infection.121, 343 In the Netherlands, farmed mink developed breathing and gastrointestinal issues, which was diagnosed as SARS -CoV-2 infection.1 SARS -CoV-2 cases in mink on US farms show high mortality rates, and farms have implemented strict biosecurity measures.364 Infected mink in the US have been linked to human infections.4 Several non -huma n primates are also susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 including cynomolgus macaques,581 African green monkeys,728 and Rhesus macaques.425 Raccoon dogs (mammals related to foxes) are susceptible to COVID -19 (105 intranasal exposure dose) and were shown to transmit infection to other raccoon dogs in neighboring enclosures.237 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100 ,000 -520,000 PFU via the intranasal route614 or a combination of routes276), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.614 Wild cats (tigers and lions)698 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.440, 757 Studies have confirmed that human keepers transmitted SARS -CoV-2 to tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo.56 Two cases of SARS- CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in pet domestic cats.107 Ducks, chicken s, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS -CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens ,614 100,000 PFU for pigs ,614 ~70,000 PFU for pigs and chickens599 all via intranasal route).614 When pigs were inoculated by the oronasal route (106 PFU), minimal to no signs of clinical disease were noted, suggesting limited transmission concerns.537 Chicken, turkey, duck, quail, and geese were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 after experimental exposures.635 Cattle exposed to SARS -CoV-2 showed no clinical disease but exhibited low levels of viral shedding in the nose, which could be residual virus from the exposure dose.665 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 produced anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies76 but exhibited no clinical symptoms.614, 623 In Italy, approximately 3 -6% of domestic dogs and cats showed detectable neutralizing antibodies to SARS -CoV-2, though no evidence exists of transmission from dogs or cats to humans.524 What do we need to know? We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes. What is the intermediate host(s) (if any)? Which animal species can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans?

Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2 -14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. By general consensus, the incubation period of COVID -19 is between 5372 and 6701 days.744 Fewer than 2.5% of infec ted individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.372 However, more recent estimates using different models calculate a longer incubation period, between 7 and 8 days.550 This could mean that 5 -10% of individuals undergoing a 14 - day quarantine are still infectious at the end.550 There is evidence that younger (<14) and older (>75) individuals have longer COVID -19 incubation periods, creating a U - shaped relationship between inc ubation period length and patient age349 while adolescent and young adult populations (15 - 24 years old) have been estimated at ~2 days.402 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.49, 120, 269, 647, 762 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic,113, 587, 647, 762 and asymptomatic and pre -symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.39, 341, 774 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop.288 Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.39 Of individuals quarantining after a COVID -19 contact in the home, 81% of those testing negative on day 7 also tested negative on day 14; 19% of individuals undergoing a 7 -day quarantine, then, were at risk of developing and potentially transmitting COVID -19.584 The percentage of individuals at risk declined to 7% for those still asymptomatic and test -negative 10 days after contact.584 This indicates that quarantines of less than 14 days still carry some risk of disease and transmission, and that care should be taken after completing a shortened quarantine period (e.g., wearing a mask, avoiding close conta ct).584 It is estimated that most individuals are no longer infectious beyond 10 days after symptom onset. A systematic review of published studies on SARS -CoV-1, SARS -CoV-2, and MERS -CoV found none that reported isolation of infectious virus from COVID -19 patients beyond 9 days from symptom onset , despite high viral loads by genetic tests .119 While the amount of virus needed to infect another individua l is unknown, mild- moderate COVID -19 cases appear to be infectious for no longer than 10 days after symptom onset, while severely ill or immunocompromised patients may be infectious for 20 -70 days 44 after symptom onset; individuals can also transmit infection before symptoms appear.682 Asymptomati c individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.301 The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximately 5 days. On average, there are approximately 4183 to 7.5394 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval). Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China and additional meta -analysis, the mean serial interval is between 4.4 and 6.0 days.182, 553, 744 The serial interval of COVID -19 has declined substantially over time as a result of increased case isolation,23 meaning individuals tend to transmit virus for less time. The generation time (time between infection events in a chain of transmission) for SARS -CoV-2 is estimated as 4-5 days.261 Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious. Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days on average, with asymptomatic individuals shedding virus for less time (11 days) than symptomatic individuals (17 days).428 Asymptomatic and mildly ill patients who test positive for SARS -CoV-2 take less time to test negative than severely ill patients.385 Patients infected by asymptomatic or young (<20 years old) individuals may take longer to develop symptoms than those infected by other groups of individuals. 701 Viral RNA loads in the upper respiratory tract tend to peak within a few days of symptom onset and become undetectable approximately two weeks after symptoms begin.681 The duration of the infectious period is unknown,681 though patients can test positiv e for SARS -CoV-2 viral RNA for extended periods of time, particularly in stool samples.681 Patients being released from the hospital may still exhale detectable levels of SARS -CoV-2 RNA (~7,000 genome copies per hour), though the infectivity of these patients is unknown.767 What do we need to know? We need to know the incubation duration and length of infectivity in different patient populations. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the disease? How soon can asymptomatic patients transmit i nfection after exposure? Does the incubation period correlate with disease severity or exposure dose?

What do we know? Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.9 Older individuals and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men.506 Fever is most often the first symptom. Most symptomatic COVID -19 cases are mild (81%) .647, 722 Fever,37, 269 cough,269 and shortness of breath114, 125, 303 are generally the most common symptoms, followed by malaise, fatigue, and sputum/secretion.150 Chills, muscle pain,473 sore throat, gastrointestinal symptoms,583 neurological symptoms,406 and dermatological symptoms150 also occur with COVID -19.114 Headaches are common, may persist for weeks, and may be associated with shorter disease duration.104 Loss of taste or smell is highly predictive of COVID -19458 and appears more common in mild cases.380 In children, loss of taste or smell, nau sea or vomiting, headache, and fever were predictive of COVID -19 infection .344 Children were less likely to exhibit cough and loss of taste or smell than adults, but m ore likely to show sore throat.376 COVID -19 generally begins with fever, then cough and malaise.366 In 49 children with COVID -19 (0- 22 years), however, only 51% developed fever.749 Only 20% of emergency department patients testing positive for COVID -19 had fevers >100\u00b0 F.674 In older patients, delirium should be considered a symptom of COVID -19 with or without other typical signs.337 Initial assessments suggest that the B.1.1.7 (UK) and 501Y.V2 (South Africa) SARS -CoV-2 variants do not alter severity.729 COVID -19 is more severe than seasonal influenza, evidenced by higher ICU admission739 and mortality rates.539 In the US, 34% of hospitalized patients required ICU admission , and 12.6% of hospitalized patients died from COVID -19.462 Higher SARS -CoV-2 RNA loads at initial screening or upon admission have been associated with greater risk of death.87, 257, 436, 707 Individuals of any age can develop severe symptoms and require ICU care.509 SARS- CoV-2 attacks blood vessels in the lung95 and is associated with hyperactive platelets,74 leading to clotting complications and ARDS.15, 672 Clotting affects multiple organs559 and is present in 15 -27% of cases.427 COVID -19 a lso causes pneumonia,513 cardiac kidney damage,38, 634 pancreatitis,29 arrhythmia, sepsis, stroke,451, 531 respiratory complications ,666 and shock .269, 303, 683, 765 COVID -19 symptoms commonly persist for weeks646 to months103 after initial on set. Most (88%) individuals infected with COVID -19 (n=86) showed evidence of lung damage six weeks after clinical recovery.270 In China, fatigue and muscle weakness persisted for at least 6 months in the majority (63%) of COVID -19 patients, with severe initial disease resulting in worse long- term respiratory outcomes.302 While the frequency of \"long -haul\" COVID -19 is unknown, chronic COVID -19 requires reduced workloads in ~45% of patients and inability to work in 22% of patients 6 months after initial symptoms.158 Concern is also growing about the possibility of long -term neurological symptoms.160 Around 9% of hospitalized patient s experience at least 1 hospital readmission within 2 months of COVID -19 recovery.374 In Italy, 22% of hospitalized COVID -19 patients developed secondary bacterial or fungal infections.200 Between 16% and 76% of cases are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection ,89, 97, 362, 375, 385, 459, 491, 505, 642, 657 though changing symptom definitions make it difficult to compare asymptomatic fractions through time.452 The case fatality rate (CFR) is unknown, but adults >60522 and those with comorbidities are at elevated risk of death.647, 765 Cardiovascular disease, obesity,18, 533 hypertension,755 diabetes,448 cancer,688 down syndrome,139 and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.647, 765 Prior k idney disease may increase disease severity,498 though age may be the dominant factor.494 The CFR increases with age (data from China and Italy): 0 -19 years < 0.2%; 20 -29 years = 0 -0.2%, 30- 39 years = 0.2 -0.3%, 40- 49 years = 0.4%, 50 -59 years 1.0 -1.3%, 60- 69 years = 3.5 -3.6%, 70- 79 years = 8.0 -12.8%, >80 years = 14.8- 20.2%.503 In Iceland, the overall CFR has been estimated at 0.3 -0.6% but increases to ~4% in those over 70 years old.271 An estimated overall infection fatality rate for Indiana was calculated as 0.26%, increasing to 1.71% for those >65 years old .69 Minority populations and essential workers are disproportionately affected by COVID -19.466 Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic populations , including children,51 acquire SARS -CoV-2 infection at higher rates than other groups227, 259, 512, 547 and are hospitalized244, 549 and die disproportionately.295, 453 Hispanic and Black COVID -19 patients tend to die at younger ages than white patients.730 Social vulnerability is associated with greater SARS -CoV-2 transmission risk.153 Pregnant women with COVID -19 require ICU care at similar rates as non -pregnant women63 and are less likely to present with fever and myalgia,25 but have higher rates of preterm delivery.726 Severity in pregnant women may be associated with underlying conditions25 and may be predicted early.463 Preterm births are more likely in symptomatic patients.165 In the UK, healthcare workers are >7 times more likely to develop severe COVID -19 than non -essential em ployees.475 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,177 though generally show milder126, 426 or no symptoms. 21% to 28% of children (<19 years old) may be asymptomatic.426, 519, 551 Most symptomatic children show mild or moderate symptom s.258, 519 Severe symptoms in children416 and infants88, 426 are more likely in those with complex medical histories.610 A rare inflammatory condition in children ( MIS-C)251 is linked to COVID -19 infection ;579, 656 the prevalence of is unknown. Children with both severe and moderate initial symptoms can progress to MIS -C,250 but gastrointestinal symptoms appear common in those that do.214 Black children are overrepresented among MIS-C patients .383 What do we need to know?

What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown.28, 713 Reinfection is possible but rare . Antibody and T -cell responses persist in most pa tients for >6 months. In a study of healthcare workers in the UK, those with SARS -CoV-2 antibodies from prior exposure (n=1,167) were protected from reinfection for a median of 127 days (no symptomatic reinfection, 3 subsequent positive PCR tests).430 Researchers have found SARS -CoV-2 antibodies circulating in patients for 3 -6 months after infection.216, 271, 580, 582 Mild COVID -19 infections can induce detectable immune responses for at least 3 months .582 Antibody levels increas e with disease severit y652 and are largely unaffected by patient age.216 A UK study found evidence of antibody levels waning after 4 -6 months, though the study looked at population- level seroprevalence and not individual antibody levels.697 Neutralizing antibody responses are present within 8 -19 days after symptom onset419, 641 and can persist for months.680 Individuals with more severe infections developed higher neutralizing antibody levels that persisted longer than those with asymptomatic or mild infections.605 The antibody IgM appears to contribute substantially to SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing ability, with IgG also contributing to a lesser extent.245 Asymptomatic cases generate weaker antibody responses to SARS -CoV-2.133 Multiple components of the human immune response to SARS -CoV-2, including circulating antibodies, memory B cells, and memory T cells, are detectable for at least 6 -8 months after infection regardless of initial symptom severity , though the presence or quantity of these components cannot imply protective immunity per se .152 Antibody levels declined in 156 healthcare workers who tested positive for SARS -CoV-2, with 28% dr opping below detectable levels when tested after 60 days , suggesting caution in single time -point assays to detect prior SARS -CoV-2 infection.604 SARS- CoV-2 specific memory B cells are involved in the human immune response, and provide evidence of B cell -mediated immunity after mild -moderate COVID -19 infection.500 T-cell responses may persist for at least 6 months, though they appear stronger in individuals with more severe COVID -19 cases.775 While memory B and T cells both persist for at least 6 months, there is some variability in the persistence o f specific antibodies (e.g., IgG vs. IgA).239, 613 Strong, early inflammatory immune responses are associated with more severe clinical presentation.166 There appear to be several distinct immunological phenotypes associated with COVID -19, with cytokine storm syndrome present in ~3 -4% of patients .471 A more common phenotype is characterized by a lack of Type I interferon response and general immunosuppression, which may help to explain variability in corticosteroid treatment effects.471 Asymptomatic patients appear to mount robust T -cell responses, express higher levels of interferon -gamma and interleukin - 2, and have more coordinated production of pro- inflammatory and regulatory cytokines than symptomatic patients.378 In a 35 -year study of 10 men, reinfection with seasonal coronaviruses occurred 1 -3 years after initial infection.188 Previous studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibodies may wane after several years.99, 736 Reinfection with SARS- CoV-2 is possible but appears rare, though the true frequency is unknown. Researchers in Hong Kong353 and the US651 have identified COVID -19 reinfections. Reinfections have been either less353 or more s evere651 than the initial infection. The infectiousness of re -infected individuals is unknown. Two studies suggest limited reinfection potential in macaques, with re -challenge 28 days170 or 35 days123 after initial exposure resulting in no clinical symptoms. Ferrets infected with 102-104 PFU were protected from acu te lung injury following secondary challenge with SARS -CoV-2 28 days after initial exposure, but they did exhibit clinical symptoms.593 The contribution of historical coronavirus exposure to SARS -CoV-2 immunity is unknown.483 Cross -reactivity in T -cell responses between other human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 may explain some variation in symptom severity among patients.445 Key components of the human immune response (memory B cells) are activated by SARS- CoV-2, and may persist for decades to offset any waning antibody immunity.486 Cross -reactivity from seasonal coronaviruses also enhances the immune response toward the S2 unit of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.486 Two studies identified key components of the adaptive immune system (CD4+ T cells) in the majority of recovered COVID -19 patients, and these cells reacted to SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.82, 263 These studies also identified Spike protein responses in CD4+ T cells of ~30 -40% of unexposed patients,263 suggesting some cross -reactivity between other circulating human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2.82, 263 Long -lasting T -cell responses have been seen in S ARS-CoV-1 patients, and T -cell cross - reactivity between other coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 suggest additional immune protection.379 Children do not appear to be protected from SARS -CoV-2 infection by historical exposure to seasonal coron aviruses.606 Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS -CoV-2,546 though there has been some cross -reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.659 What do we need to know? We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. How do different components of the immune response contribute to long -term protection? How does initial disease severity affect the type, magnitude, and timing of any protective immune response? Given different immunological respo nses for men compared to women,643 as well as for adults compared to children,703 are distinc t diagnostic tests or medical treatments required for the different groups?

When during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable. As of 12/16/2020 , the FDA has granted EUAs to 303 diagnostic tests, including 231 molecular, 62 antibody, and 10 antigen tests,229 which includ e one for detecting neutralizing antibodies from prior SARS -CoV-2 infection201 and at -home diagnostic assay s for SARS -CoV-2 infection.231-232 The US FDA also issued an EUA for an at -home test kit capable of testing for both COVID -19 and influenza ,209 and has granted an EUA for the Ellume COVID -19 at -home antigen test, available without a prescription to symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals at least two years of age .190, 230 The US CDC recommends that anyone who has been in contact with a positive COVID -19 case should be tested.117 The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results. The false -negative rate for RT -PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more likely to give false -negative results before symptoms begin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.358 Low viral loads can lead to false -negative RT -PCR tests, and viral loads are lower in late stage infections as well as a t the end of a given day.410 The duration of PCR -detec table viral samples is longer in the lower respiratory tract than the upper respiratory tract; nasopharyngeal sampling is most effective (89%) between 0 and 4 days after symptom onset but falls significantly (to 54%) by 10 to 14 days.441 After 10 days, alternative testing methods (e.g., lower respiratory samples) may be necessary.441 The UK variant B.1.1.7 affects the S -gene portion of some PCR diagnostic assays, though most assays use multiple SARS -CoV- 2 targets and diagnostic ac curacy is not expected to be affected.729 The US FDA is tracking the potential efficacy of diagnostics on new COVID -19 variants.233 Assays targeting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (N) instead of the Spike protein (S) of SARS -CoV-2 may improve detection.92 Newer tests target up to three viral components, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity.96 It is recommended that nasopharyngeal swabs, mid- turbinate swabs, anterior nasal swabs, saliva, or combined anterior and oropharyngeal swabs be used instead of oropharyngeal swabs alone to increase sensitivity.279 Rapid tests based on RT -PCR or standard laboratory nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are preferred over rapid isothermal NAATs in symptomatic individuals to reduce the chance of false -positives.279 Symptom -based screening at airports was ineffective at detecting cases (9 identified out of 766,044 passengers s creened),176 and intensive screening on a US military base during mandatory quarantine did not identify any COVID -19 cases.388 Exhaled breath condensate may be an effective supplement to na sopharyngeal swab -based PCR ,592 and other work examining breath- based samplers is ongoing.609 Foam swabs lead to more accurate diagnostic tests than polyester swabs for collecting patient samples, though polyester swabs are good enough to be used in case of a shortage in foam swabs.283 Asymptomatic individuals are more likely to test negative for a specific antibody (I gG) compared to symptomatic patients .706 The CRISPR -Cas12a system is being used to develop fluorescence -based COVID -19 diagnostic tests.175, 306, 689 India has approved a rapid CRISPR -based test paper capable of accurate results within an hour of nasopharyngeal swab.6 Low-sensitivity tests (like lateral flow assays) may be beneficial despite lower accuracy, because they reduce the time necessary to identify and subsequently contain potential outbreaks.454 Immunological indicators45, 193, 236, 243, 287, 305, 482, 538, 628, 640, 684, 754 blood glucose levels ,690 oxygen levels345 and bilirubin levels418 may help identify future severe cases,135 and decision -support tools for diagnosing severe infections exist .447, 622, 734 High -throughput diagnostic are comparable in sensitivity and specificity to PCR, and may increase sampling speed.532 A high - throughput diagnostic assay for screening asymptomatic individuals has received US Emergency Use Authorization.77, 234 Infrared temperature readings may be misleading when used at the entrance of buildings with low outdoor temperatures.186 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Repeated serological testing is necessary to identify asymptomatic544 and other undetected patients.597 Research has shown high variability in the ability of tests by different manufacturers to accurately detect positive and negative cases . 368, 708 Meta -analysis suggests that lateral flow assays (LFIA) are less accurate than ELISA or chemiluminescent methods (CLIA), but that the target o f serological studies (e.g., IgG or IgM) does not affect accuracy.408 Lateral flow assay results differ more from ELISA when administered early in disease course (e.g., 3 -7 days after symptom onset ).286 The FDA has excluded several dozen serological diagnostic assay s based on failure to conform to updated regulatory requirements.205 In a study with pregnant women, rapid antibody (lateral flow assay) testing resulted in a 50% positive predictive value and 50% false positive rate, which are lower than the values touted for non -pregnant populations. 197 What do we need to know? We need to identify additional factors that affect the accuracy of serological or PCR- based diagnostic tests. What is the relationship between disease severity and the timing of positive serological assays? Are certain subpopulations (e.g., those with blood cancers )492 more likely to show false -negative tests? How likely are children of different ages to test positive via RT -PCR?

These recommendations are summarized below and are continually updated with clinical trial data . Treatment recommendations For hospitalized , critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO (with organ failure and ARDS ), dexamethasone is strongly recommended .127, 297, 515, 521, 632, 654, 733 For hospitalized patients with sever e (reduced oxygen, SpO2 94%) but not critical disease, there is a conditional recommendation for dexamethasone treatment.297 For hospitalized patients, it is recommended that treatment with convalescent plasma only proceed in the course of a clinical trial, as treatment benefits are not uniformly reported (knowledge gap) .26, 309, 327 -328, 443, 525, 560, 620 For any subset of patients, there is a strong recommendation against the use of hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin3, 14, 78, 105, 217, 247, 335, 456, 502, 554, 603 and lopinavir/ritonavir102, 242, 262, 401 due to lack of observed benefit. There is a c onditional recommendation against the use of famotidine for the sole purpose of COVID -19 treatment.64 For hospitalized patients with non -severe illness, SpO2 94% and no supplemental oxygen, there is a conditional recommendation against the use of glucocorticoids.297 For hospitalized patients, conditional recommendation against the routine use of tocilizumab as current clinical results are mixed in benefit 289-290, 391, 439, 464, 478, 596, 633 The BMJ publishes a tool that shows treatment options based on patient comorbidities and disease severity .71 Recommendations for the use of Remdesivir vary. The US FDA has approved the use of Remdesivir in hospitalized patients 12 years and older,211 with an Emergency Use Authorization for other patient groups.202, 488 In the US, there is a conditional recommendation for Remdesivir treatment in hospitalized, severe patients , compared to no antiviral treatment.62, 514, 696 In the US, for hospitalized patients on supplemental oxygen but not mechanical ventilation, there is a conditional recommendation of 5 day course of Remdesivir vs. 10 day course .64 In the US, in hospitalized patients not on supplemental oxygen, there is a conditional recommendation against the routine use of Remdesivir,64 though it may be considered for patients at high risk of severe disease.490 The WHO and BMJ , however, recommend against Remdesivir use in patients of any seve rity.72, 718 For mild and mobile patients, there is a conditional recommendation against the routine use of antibody treatments bamlanivimab or casirivimab plus imdevimab, unless the patients are at increased risk for severe disease.64, 490 For hospitali zed patients with severe disease who are not on mechanical ventilation and cannot receive corticosteroids, there is a conditional recommendation for the use of baricitinib plus Remdesivir.64, 331 For hospitalized patients, treatment with Remdesivir, baricitinib, and corticosteroids is recommended only under a clinical trial (knowledge gap) .64 Clinical trial updates Clinical trials of convalescent plasma treatment in mild, older adult patients reduced progression to seve re disease403 but continues to show no benefits in severely ill C OVID -19 patients.334 Further analysis in clinical trials for mild C OVID -19 patients is warranted and in progress. Regeneron's REGN -COV2 treatment has been associated with reductions in symptom duration564 and viral load702 and has received Emergency Use Authorization to treat mild/moderate COVID -19 patients ,565 but not in hospitalized patients with high oxygen requirements.563 Eli Lilly has received Emergency Use Authorization from the US FDA for its monoclonal antibody product, bamlanivimab, for use in recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID -19 patients,405 but not for hospitalized patients.431 Common treatment medications for ex isting disease pre -COVID -19 diagnosis Statins444, 594 and RAAS inhibitors694 (for hypertension) appear to elevate COVID -19 risk.31, 467, 568, 629 Insulin u se may increase mortality risk compared to other type 2 diabetes treatments750 such as metformin.81, 322, 360, 429 Patients 65 years and up receiving chroni c anticoagulant treatment showed higher survival than propensity -matched controls.167 What do we need to know? We need clear, randomized trials for treatment efficacy in patients with both severe and mild/moderate illness. Does time to viral clearance correlate with symptom severity or time to symptom resolution?

In the US, vaccination priority is being given to healthcare workers and long -term care residents (1a), all individuals 75 and older and frontline essential workers (1b), and all people 65 -75 and those 16 -64 with high -risk medical conditions (1c).178 Candidates that have received or applied for approval in the US : Pfizer/BioNTech - mRNA vaccine named BNT162b2 (also called Tozinameran715 and Comirnaty191) Vaccine is given as 2 shots, 21 days apart.534 At the final study endpoint (170 confirmed COVID -19 cases out of 43,000 participants), the vaccine showed 95% efficacy at 7 days after the second vaccine dose (28 days after fir st dose), which was consistent across age, sex, race, and ethnicity.543 Efficacy was 94% for those individuals over 65.543 There were 43,661 study participants, with 162 cases (9 severe) in the placebo group and 8 cases (1 severe) in vaccine group.535 Safety was assessed in children (n=100, 12 -15 years old), racially and ethnically diverse patients (30 -42% of trial pool), and individuals 56 -85 years old (41- 45% of participants).536 No serious safety concerns were observed, and adverse events included fatigue , headache,536 and pain at the injection site and mu scle pain.536 After reports of two allergic reactions in UK healthcare workers,586 the US CDC concluded that individuals with known allergies to foods, latex, or pollen (for instance) do not have to take special precautions for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 446 but should talk to their doctor and be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination.586 Rates of anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the US are estimated at 11.1 per million doses.645 Storage and shipping requirements are -70\u00b0C; o nce thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to 5 days at refrigerated (2-8\u00b0C) conditions.536 Pfizer and BioNTech received Emergency Use Authorization from the US FDA for individuals 16 and older .207 The WHO issued an Emergency Use Listing for this vaccine, accelerating approval and distribution in many countries.720 Moderna - mRNA vaccine named mRNA -1273461 Vaccine is given as 2 shots, 28 days apart.461 At the conclusion of Phase III clinical trial, the vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy, 14 days after the second dose.46 Efficacy was consistent across age, race, ethnicity, and sex.46 Vaccine -induced antibodies persisted for at least 119 days.721 There were 30,000 study participants, with 185 cases (30 severe, 1 death) in the placebo group and 11 cases (0 severe) in the vaccine group. 461 Side effects included fatigue (10%), muscle aches (9%), joint paint (5%), and headaches (5%).461 Pain and redness at the injection site were also noted ; adverse events increased in frequency after the second dose.461 The vaccine can be shipped and stored at standard freezer temperatures ( -20\u00b0C) for 6 months, and is expected to be stable under refrigeration (2 -8\u00b0C) for 30 days and at room temperature for 12 hours.460 Moderna was granted an EUA from the US FDA for individuals 18 and older .206 It has also been approved in Canada101 and recommended for use in those 18 and older in the European Union.192 Phase III Trials (testing for efficacy) : The adenovirus vaccine candidate AZD1222 (from University of Oxford and AstraZeneca ) showed 62% efficacy in individuals given two full doses, and 90% efficacy in an accidental subset of individuals given a half dose followed by a full dose.42 The vaccine appears safe, and instills a robust immune response across age groups.555 The vaccine is given in two doses, 1 month apart.42 The Phase III trial included 23,000 participants, all over 18.42 The vaccine is stable at 2- 8\u00b0C for up to 6 months.42 This vaccine has been approved for use in the UK, Argentina, and India.58 Russia's Gamaleya Institute announced that their adenovirus ( Sputnik V ) vaccine is 91.4% effective 28 days after the first dose, and over 95% effe ctive 42 days after the first dose (21 days after the second dose), based on 39 COVID -19 cases in 19,000 participants.241 No trial protocols (e.g., age, ethnicity) or data have been published for Sputnik V.98 Sino vac's CoronaVac has report edly shown >70% efficacy in Brazilian healthcare workers ; no data have been published.144 Many vaccine candidates are undergoing Phase III trials, including those from Janssen (with Johnson and Johnson),319 CanSino CoVLP),266 Anhui Zhifei China Academy vaccine Covaxin, despite no published Phase III safety or efficacy data .58 C hina's Beijing Ins titute of Biological Products, in conjunction with Sinopharm, have reported 79% efficacy of their BBIBP vaccine, which has been approved for use by the Chinese government; no published Phase III data exist yet.699 What do we need to know? We need to understand vaccine uptake and efficacy rates, as well as how well vaccines reduce transmission. We need a high -level overview of vaccine administration rates for initial and booster doses in different populations. What is the protective ef ficacy of a single dose of each vaccine in use in the US, and does it vary by age group? Does dosing with two different vaccines for initial and booster doses affect protective efficacy (e.g., Pfizer then Moderna)? How long after initial dosing are booster doses effective (e.g., 4, 6, 12, 20 weeks)? How do different vaccines protect against SARS -CoV-2 variants?738 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 12 Non -pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders and widespread face mask use effectively reduce transmission . Social distancing and other policies quickly reduced spread throughout China,354, 357, 359, 422, 437, 686 Europe,246, 332 and Delaying control measures increases outbreak duration181 and mortality.747 Reductions in transmission appear 6-9 days after the implementation of NPIs, and increased tran smission is generally visible 14 -20 days after NPIs are lifted.399 Tiered restrictions in the UK resulted in 2 -44% reductions in transmission, depending on restriction severity.157 Widespread lockdowns in the UK also reduced the genetic diversity of circulating SARS -CoV-2 lineages.180 US counties with mask mandates have lower case growth rates than neighboring counties lacking mask mandates.608 Modeling suggests that widespread use of facemasks is effective at reducing transmission485 even when individual mask efficiency is low,189 though their benefits are maximized when most of the population wears masks.225 In the US, shelter -in-place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar closures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases.146 Similarly, more public health interventions in a given week is strongly associated with lower COVID -19 growth rates in the next week.329 Telework policies may reduce new cases.220 Mobility226, 367 and physical contact rates320 decline after public health control measures are implemented. Mobility reductions in the US have been associated with significant reductions in COVID -19 case growth.47, 282 Social distancing and reductions in both non -essential visits to stores and overall movement distance led to lower transmission rates.470 A combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are likely required to effectively limit transmission.215, 350 School closures alone appear insufficient,318, 359 though likely reduced mortality in the UK573 and the US.43 Reducing capacity at crowded indoor locations such as restaurants, gyms, hotels, cafes, and religious organiza tions may be an effective way to reduce COVID -19 transmission without more substantial lockdowns.124 Increasing air flow rates in indoor environments, improving mechanical filtration efficiency, and wearing masks may also reduce indoor transmission rates.338 Adolescents and young adults (15 -24) may require different messaging to improve adherence to NPIs and public health policies ,273 and self-reported adherence to NPI policies (e.g., mask use) is consistently low in 18 - to 29 -year -olds.307 In the US, limiting transmission in younger populations is crucial for reducing hospitalizations and mortality in older cohorts .507 In the US, remote learning at colleges and universities significantly reduced local COVID -19 burden after classes resumed.386 Individual behaviors (e.g., face masks, social distancing ) have been associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.526 The US CDC has indicated that face masks inhibit transmission by both reducing the number of exhaled part icles from infectious individuals, as well as reducing the number of inhaled particles when worn by uninfected individuals.111 The US CDC recommends universal masking when indoors to inhibit the spread of COVID -19, alongside physical distancing, avoiding nonessential indoor and crowded outdoor spaces, postponing travel, and increasing ventilation and disinfection .296 Always wearing masks, maintaining physical distance >1m, and frequently washing hands were all associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection in individuals who had direct contact with infected individuals. 179 A Danish study found that mask use was not associated with protection from COVID -19 infection, but suf fered from limitations in timing (i.e., low COVID -19 prevalence) and self-reporting, and did not assess reductions in emission rates.91 Particular focus should be placed on minimizing large gatherings where superspreading events are more likely.723 Eliminating superspreading events can result in slower case growth while easing broadly restrictive interventions.330 Retrospective contact tracing may help identify the source of large clusters of cases, and should be implemented d ue to the overdispersion or heterogeneity in secondary transmission arising from each primary COVID -19 case.118 There are multiple types of superspreading events, and different policies are required to mit igate risks from each.27 Research is needed to plan the path to SARS -CoV-2 elimination via pharmaceutical and non -pharmaceutical interventions. In South Korea, early implementation of rapid contact tracing, testing, and quarantine was able to reduce the transmission rate of COVID -19.637 Contact tracing and high levels of testing and physical distancing356 may limit COVID -19 resurgence .22, 218 Premature relaxation of public health control measures may facilitate rapid increases in prevalence at the state level.240 Modeling suggests that periods of social distancing or lock -down may be effective in reducing exposure from asymptomatic cases .658 Testing is critical to balancing public health and economic costs.658 Rolling interventions may be necessary .745 Undetected cases can lead to elevated risk of re -emergence after restrictions are lifted.280 Synchronizing public health interventions across US state lines may reduce the total number of required interventions .588 Modeling shows that travel restrictions are likely to have the greatest impact at reducing SARS -CoV-2 transmission in countries that are highly connected to those with high incidence, and also in countries with low incidence.590 SARS- CoV-2 variants w ith higher transmission rates (e.g., B.1.1.7) may require additional restrictions to reduce transmission, as their reproduction numbers may not go below replacement (R = 1) with standard restrictions.677 What do we need to know? We need to understand measures that will limit spread in the winter, particularly in indoor environments. How effective are school closures when COVID -19 prevalence in the community is high? Low? What is the benefit of \"cocooning\" high -risk individuals in terms of averted deaths and hospitalizations?691 What NPIs are effective at reducing transmission from common SARS -CoV-2 variants? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 13 Environmental Stabilit y - How long does t he agent live in the environment? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and humidity.60 Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS -CoV-2 transmission in humans. Viable SARS -CoV-2 and/or RNA can be recovered from contaminated surfaces; however, survivability varies. Both temperature and humidity contribute to SARS -CoV-2 survival on nonporous surfaces, with cooler, less humid environments facilitating survival (stainless steel, ABS plastic, and nitrile rubber; indoors only; simulated saliva matrix).68 Persistence is reduced with warmer temperatures (37 \u00b0C), and enhanced at colder temperatures (4 \u00b0C).281 SARS- CoV-2 was shown to be stable up to 7 days (25 -27\u00b0C; 35% RH) on smooth surfaces, to include plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, and surgical masks.417 At 22 \u00b0C, SARS -CoV-2 was shown to be detectable (via plaque assay) on paper currency for up to 24 hours, on clothing for up to 4 hours, and on skin for up to 96 hours.281 SARS- CoV-2 was found to be stable across pH 3 -10 on several surfaces at 22 \u00b0C.132 After 3 hours (22\u00b0 C, 65% RH), no infectious virus was detected on printing and tissue papers; on day 2, none was found on treated wood and cloth; on day 4, none was found on glass or banknote; on day 7, none was found on stainless steel or plastic.132 At standard room temperature and humidity, SARS -CoV-2 becomes undetectable on common library items after 2 to 8 days of quarantine depending on the material (e.g., book cover vs leather) and conditions (e.g., stacked vs unstacked).8, 313, 607 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces for up to 3 days (21 -23\u00b0C, 40% RH)669 and infe ctious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH)132 and other PPE for at least 72 hours at 22\u00b0 C .275 SARS- CoV-2 RNA was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days .469 SARS- CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for COVID -19 surveillance,20 and can warn of SARS -CoV-2 cases ahead of positive PCR tests and hospital admissions.527 In the absence of sunlight, SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for weeks. In the absence of sunlight, infectious SARS -CoV-2 can re main on non- porous (e.g., glass, vinyl) surfaces for at least 28 days at 20\u00b0C and 50% RH; higher temperatures greatly reduce the environmental stability of SARS -CoV- 2.577 This value is longer than other stability estimates,131, 577, 669 potentially due to a fluid matrix with more protein to simulate human respiratory fluid and a higher inoculation dose.577 In simulated saliva on sta inless steel surfaces, SARS -CoV-2 shows negligible decay over 60 minutes in darkness, but loses 90% of infectivity every 6.8 -12.8 minutes, depending on simulated UVB radiation .561 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed a data -based model for SARS -CoV-2 decay on inert surfaces (stainless steel, ABS plastic and nitrile rubber) at varying temperature and relative humidity , also considering UV light .173 SARS -CoV-2 survival in the air is highly dependent on the presence of UV light and temperature. DHS has developed a tool for estimating the decay of airborne SARS -CoV-2 in different environmental conditions.172 Due to the effects of evaporation, m odeling suggests that hot, dry c onditions increase the aerosol risk of SARS -CoV-2, though cold, humid conditions facilitate transmission by droplet spread.761 Experimental studies using SARS -CoV-2 aerosols (1.78 -1.96 m mass median aerodynamic diameter in artificial saliva matrix) found that simulated sunlight rapidly inactivates the virus, with 90% reductions in infecti ous concentration after 6 minutes in high -intensity sunlight (similar to mid -June) and 19 minutes in low -intensity sunlight (similar to early March or October).601 In dark conditions, the half -life of aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 is approximately 86 minutes in simulated saliva matrix.601 Humidity alone had no significant impact on aerosolized virus survival.601 SARS- CoV-2 was shown to have an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (without sunlight, particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23\u00b0C and 65% RH),669 retaining infectivity for up to 16 hours in appropriate conditions (23\u00b0 C, 53% RH, no sunlight).212 It does not appear that pollen or air particulates are carriers of SARS -CoV-2,185 despite some country -level associations.54 Stability of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples depends on temperatu re and transport medium. RNA in clinical samples collected in viral transport medium is stable at 18 -25\u00b0C or 2-8\u00b0C for up to 21 days without impacting real-time RT -PCR results.624 RNA in clinical samples is also stable at 4 \u00b0C for up for 4 weeks with regard to quantitative RT -PCR testing (given that the sample contains 5,000 copies/mL). Separately, storage of RNA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature (18- 25\u00b0C) resulted in unstable sample concentrations.529 There is currently no e vidence that SARS -CoV-2 is transmitted to people through food. There is no documented evidence that food, food packaging, or food handling is a significant source of COVID -19 infections,315, 711 though several outbreaks have a hypothe sized food origin.278 Infectious SARS -CoV-2 has been found on frozen food packaging, but has not been linked to actual infections.570 SARS- CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70 \u00b0C) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4\u00b0C).131, 558 SARS -CoV-2 maintains infectivity for at least 21 days when inoculated on frozen foods and stored below -20\u00b0C.223 What do we need to know? We need to quantify the duration of viable SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, not simply the presence of RNA. It is unclear how viability of SARS -CoV-2 is affected across the food sup ply chain .748 Can SARS -CoV-2-contaminated wastewater cause infections?409, 552 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 14 Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? What do we know? Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. A systematic review identified sunlight, UV light, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite as methods to reduce surface contamination.60 However, the levels of decontamination necessary to affect transmission per se are still unknown.60 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SA RS-CoV-2.355 Chlorine bleach effe ctive against live virus in lab tests.130 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants that have been found effective against SARS -CoV-2 spe cifically .195 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.504 Regular disinfection of hospital rooms (with benzalkonium wipes) can reduce the presence of SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, though contamination is widespread without regular cleaning.342 Chlorhexidine digluconate may be ineffective.41 Oral antiseptic rinses used in pre- procedural rinses for dentistry containing povidone -iodine (PVP -I) are effective decontaminants of SARS -CoV-2, completely inactivating SARS -CoV-2 at concentrations above 0.5% in lab tests (for 15 -30 s) .66 Efforts are ongoing to create paint -on surfaces61 or other surface coatings196 that can rapidly inactivate SARS -CoV-2. Iodine -based antiseptics may be able to decontaminate nasal passages, though any influence on transmission is unknown.235 A mouth- spray previously investigated for the cold 229E (Cold Zyme \u00ae) effectively inactivated SARS -CoV-2 in vitro ; additional tests are necessary to determine any clinical benefit.272 Indoor air filters based on non- therma l plasma or reactive oxygen species may be effective at reducing circulating SARS -CoV- 2 concentrations, estimated by reductions in surrogate virus, though additional testing on live SARS -CoV-2 virus is needed.595 Indoor air filtration devices based on hydroxyl radical cascades, which do not emit ozone, are being trialed at 4 UK hospitals due to their efficacy in reducing concentrations of a surrogate virus (M2 phage).21, 660 In tests with a surrogate virus (Phi6 phage), a modified version of the Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS) was effective at decontaminating military aircraft in approximately three hours using high heat and humidity ;631 Phi6, however, may be less stable than SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, and therefore may not be the best surrogate.710 Aquila Bioscience has developed a spray decontamination technique to pair with its existing alcohol - and chemical -free wipe; these products may be used to capture SARS -CoV-2 on skin, surfaces , and washable masks via high -affinity binding.80 Masks with laser -induced graphene may facilitate decontamination, particularly when masks are exposed to sunlight.24 Peracetic acid dry fogging was shown to be effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on stainless steel coupons, simulating whole - room fumigation.149 Due to the lack of documented transmission via fomites, widespread decontamination of surfaces (e.g., streets, sidewalks) may not be necessary.481 Several methods exist for decontaminating N95 respirators496 and other PPE. Researchers have identified four methods capable of decontaminating N95 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heating to 70 \u00b0C, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). 222 Ethanol (70%) was associated with loss of physical integrity.222 Dry heat and UV decontamination can also be used under certain conditions.221 Additional methods showing efficacy against SARS -CoV-2 on respirators i nclude pulsed xenon ultraviolet light,619 (using a multicooker),174 and methylene blue plus light.387 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.575 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.203 The FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating ten N95 masks at a time using devices already p resent in many US hospitals , 83 though fit failure after reuse remains a concern.404 Respirator decontamination methods such as VHP appear to efficiency after repe ated decontamination cycles.528 Several decontamination methods, including UVC, are capable of decontaminating N95 respirators for 10 -20 cycles without loss of fit or filtration efficiency.11 Stacking respirators may increase decontamination rates without compromising efficiency.591 Peracetic acid may be effective in combination with VHP.324 The US FDA has issued guidance for bioburden reduction systems using dry heat to decontaminate certain respirators.661 A Canadian technology (\"D -Pod\") using heat and UVC for PPE is being manufactured for North American distribution.249 A thermal in activation model for SARS -CoV-2 provides estimates of infectivity reduction based on time and temperature.746 Forced air ozone reactors may be able to decontaminate surgical gowns, though SARS -CoV-2 tests are needed.138, 415 What do we need to know? We need additional SARS -CoV-2 decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply. Does contamination with human fluids/waste alter disinfectant efficacy profiles? We need to know how to efficiently and effectively decontaminate whole rooms and large spaces. What level of decontamination is necessary (e.g., log -reduction) to eliminate transmission risk from contaminated surfaces? We need to understand how different testing methods and standards affect decontamination efficacy estimates. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 15 PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? What do we know? Face masks appear effective at reducing infections from SARS -CoV-2. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses647 demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and infection control.600 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers is high.567 Contacts with healthcare workers tend to transmit COVID -19 more often than other casual contacts.693 Hospital -acquired infection rates fell after introduction of comprehensive infection control measures, including expanded tes ting and use of PPE for all patient contacts.576 Universal masking policies also reduced the rate of new healthcare worker infections.692, 770 Even among healthcare personnel reporting adequate PPE early in the pandemic (March -April), rates of infection were 3.4 times higher than the general population.487 A modeling study suggests that healthcare workers are primarily at risk from droplet and inhalation exposure (compared to contact with fomites), with greater risk while in closer proximity to patients.326 \"Healthc are personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield).\"109 The WHO considers face shields as inferior to masks and respirators for control of droplet transmission.717 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long - sleeve gowns as well as gloves.714 PPE that covers all skin may reduce exposure to pathogens.213, 705 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those working with potential aerosols.716 Additional protection (Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with hood), should be considered for high- risk procedures .85 KN95 respirators ar e, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.204 On May 7, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer authorize d.210 A study suggests that P100 respirators with removable filter cartridges have similar filtration efficiency compared to N95 respirators and could plausibly be used if N95 respirators were in short supply.523 Particular care should be taken with \"duckbill\" N95 respirators, which may fail fit tests after repeated doffing.164 Dome - shaped N95 respirators also failed fit tests after extended use.164 The US FDA cautions healthcare facilities using passive protective barrier enclosures without negative pressure, and has withdrawn a prior Emergency Use Authorization for the devices. 208 Experiments with mannequins show that face masks reduce potential spread of SARS -CoV-2 when w orn by an infectious individual, but also that face masks by non -infected recipients can reduce the number of inhaled particles; the protective effect was maximized when both infected and uninfected individuals (mannequins) wore masks.663 Researchers have developed a lipopeptide fusion inhibitor that prevents SARS -CoV-2 transmission in ferrets given the peptide prophylactically via the intranasal route; human studies have yet to be conducted.162 Non- medical masks may be effective at slowing transmission, though data specific to SARS -CoV-2 are sparse.7, 10 On 4/3/2020, the US CDC recommended wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.110 The CDC recommends masks without exhalation vents or valves,106 as masks with valves can allow particles to pass through unfiltered.673 The WHO recommends that the general population wear non- medical masks when in public settings and when physical distancing is difficult, and that vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly) wear medical masks when close contact is likely.712 Infected individuals wearing facemasks in the home before the onset of symptoms was associated with a reduction in household transmission.695 A meta -analysis of SARS -CoV-1, MERS, and COVID -19 transmission events found evidence that wearing face masks and eye protection were each associated with lower risk of tra nsmission ,136 with N95 respirators more effective than surgical masks.136 In a separate meta -analysis, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care professionals including influenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influenza.499 N95 respirators were associated with up to 80% reductions in SARS -CoV-1 infections.499 Surgical face masks, respirators , and homemad e face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals to other individuals.155, 389, 667 Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of seaso nal coronavirus expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m).389 Homemade masks reduce overall flow from breathing and coughing (63 -86% reduction) but also generate leakage jets facing downward and backward from the wearer's face.675 Some non -standard materials (e.g., cotton, cotton hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3 m,347 while other materials (e.g., T -shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35 -62%).685 Of 42 homemade materials tested, the three with the greatest filtration efficiencies were layered cotton with raised visible fibers. 753 Neck fleeces commonly worn by runners may increase the frequency of small aerosol particles, compared to wearing no mask at all.219 Cotton T -shirt masks appear ineffective at reducing emitted particles when individuals talk, breath e, sneeze, or cough, with those made of single layers increasing emitted particles during these activities.40 Smaller aerosol particles (e.g., <0.1 m) are more difficult to filter for most res pirators and face masks.137 What do we need to know? We need to continue assessing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. When and how do N95 respirato rs and other face coverings fail? How effective are homemade masks at reducing SARS -CoV-2 transmission? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 16 Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. New analysis of SARS -CoV-2 and related SARS -like coronaviruses suggests that SARS -CoV-2 jumped directly from bats to humans, without the influence of an intermediate 'mixing' host .75 Pangolin coronaviruses were shown to be more divergent and split off from bat coronaviruses earlier than SARS -CoV-2.75 Current sampling of pangolin viruses does not implicate them as an intermediate to human SARS -CoV-2.75 These data suggest SARS -CoV-2 emerged from circulating bat coronaviruses in SE China/SE Asia and additional zoonotic emergence of novel coronaviruses could occur. Based on phylogenetic analysis, SARS -CoV- 2 most likely emerged from Rhinolophus (horseshoe) bats living in China, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, or another Southeast Asian country,369 though historical recombination with pangolin coronaviruses may explain some features of the SARS -CoV-2 genome.228 Genomic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human- derive d or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.34, 768 Phylogenetics suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to coronaviruses found in pangolins.412, 414 The SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein, which mediates entry into host cells and is a major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein.423 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat coronaviruses423 and coronaviruses found in pangolins.414 Comparing genomes of multiple coronaviruses using machine -learning has identified key genomic signatures shared amo ng high case fatality rate coronaviruses (SARS -CoV-1, SARS -CoV-2, MERS) and animal counterparts.274 These data furt her suggest that SARS -CoV-2 emergence is the result of natural emergence and that there is a potential for future zoonotic transmission of additional pathogenic strains to humans.274 Deletion mutants were identified at low levels in human clinical samples, suggesting that the PRRA furin cleavage site alone is not fully responsible for human infection, but does confer a fitness advantage in the human host.725 Additional whole - genome sequencing in humans would help to confirm this finding. Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"34 Both scenarios are consistent with the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Some SARS- CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses,724 and data suggest that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses.412, 414 Genomic evidence suggests a plausible recombination event between a circulating coronavirus in pangolins and bats could be the source of SARS -CoV-2.396, 737 Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS -like coronaviruses.758 Additional research is needed. There are multiple studies showing that t he SARS -CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain, the portion of the protein responsible for binding the human receptor ACE2, was acquired through recombination between coronaviruses from pangolins and bats.34, 396, 413, 758 These studies suggest that pangolins may have played an intermediate role in the adaptation of SARS -CoV-2 to be able to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. Additional research is needed. A key difference between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coronaviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (inserti on of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).147 A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an insertion between the S1/S2 cleavage site of the Spike protein. While distinct from the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS -CoV-2, this evidence show s that such insertions can occur naturally.766 Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,34 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"34 Work with other coronaviruses has indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition motif.161 A report claiming a laboratory origin of SARS -CoV-2742 has been heavily disputed by scientists at Johns Hopkins University.5 What do we need to know? We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate species? Are there closely related circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS - CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOU S DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 1/12/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 17 Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to December 2019. Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.36, 59, 556 The estimated mutation rate for SARS -CoV-2 is 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.670 SARS- CoV-2 is acquiring nucleotide changes at a rate that suggests the virus is undergoing purifying selection (that the genome is stabilizing toward a common geno me).732 Low genetic diversity early in the epidemic suggests that SARS -CoV-2 was capable of jumping to human and other mammalian hosts,732 and that additional jumps into humans may occur. In an analysis of ~3,500 COVID -19 patients, researchers identified 17 SARS -CoV-2 genome variants that were consistently associated with severe illness, and 67 SARS -CoV-2 genome variants consistently associated with mild disease.679 The variants were not rare overall, suggesting use as a screening tool, though a single variant alone is not necessarily responsibl e for virule nce.679 Variants leading to the most severe illness were located in the C -terminal end of the Spike protein.679 Several viral variants, including B.1.1.7, are being investigated for their effects on transmission and/or virulence.373 An existing variant (VOC 202012/01, also called B.1.1.7) that is increasing in prevalence in some areas of the UK187 has been associated with higher transmission rates,298 though confirmation in human or animal studies is needed. There have been no links between this variant and enhanced virulence.442 The variant consists of several mutations linked to the vir al Spike protein336 and receptor -binding domain.557 Initial evidence suggests that at least one existing vaccine (from Pfizer/BioNTech) is able to neutralize SARS -CoV-2 with one specific mutation (N501Y) found in both the UK and South African SARS -CoV-2 variants, though its efficacy on the entire variant ( composed of multiple mutations) has not yet been assessed.738 Phylogenetic and clinical analysis suggests the D614G mutation in the Spike protein is associated with higher ra tes of SARS - CoV-2 transmission,678 but no change in clinical severity in infected patients.351 D614G rapidly increased in l ocal frequency ,351, 4 21, 541, 756 though it is possible that founder effect s contributed to its prevalence.671 Limited animal model results support the possib ility of increased transmissibility,299, 542 and t he mutation slightly increase d viral replication in human cell lines.541, 756 Broad phylogenetic analysis, however, suggests that no current, recurring SARS -CoV-2 mutations (including D614G) are associated with higher rates of transmission in human populations.671 The D614G mutation appears to make the virus more susceptible to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies or by convalescent plasma.704 Antibodies induced by the D614G mutation or wild -type virus are able to neutralize each other.382 A separate Spike protein receptor binding motif variant (called N493K) shows evidence of immune escape from polyclonal sera and neutralizing antibodies , potentially affecting the ability of vaccines and therapeutics that target thi s region.649 Several human genomic regions, including those determining blood type, affect COVID -19 prevalence and/or severity .33 Blood type may affect COVID -19,252 with evidence of slightly increased prevalence30, 55, 255 and moderately increased severity in those with type A blood294, 411 (though evidence i s mixed ).370 In US hospital patients, COVID -19 prevalenc e was slightly higher in individuals with non -O-type blood; blood type affected both risk of mechanical ventilation (lower in type A, higher in B and AB compared to O) and death (higher in AB, lower in A and B compared to O), and Rh negative status was pro tective for all three measures.772 Non-O-type blood has been associated with clotting issues.171 A large study (n=225,556) found that individuals with type O blood had less severe disease and lower risk of death from COVID -19 than individuals with other blood types, and that Rh -negative status showed lower COVID -19 prevalence.562 Other regions associated with severe disease include locus 3p21.31, where certain alleles are found more often in patients with respiratory distress requiring ventilation, 252 as well as those with s evere disease.511 Individuals with defective androgen signaling (long polyQ allelic repeats in the androgen receptor gene) were more likely to have severe COVID -19, possibly due to increased inflammatory responses; this may influence treatment decisions.52 In a study of 2,244 critically ill COVID -19 patients, researchers identified novel associations between several genes involved in innate antiviral defenses (IFNAR2 and OAS) and host -driven inflammatory lung injury (DPP9, TYK2, and CCR2).510 There is some concern regarding SARS -CoV-2 strains involved in continued human and mink transmission . Repeated outbreaks of COVID -19 on mink farms, and the detection of mink -adapted SARS -CoV-2 in humans, has led to the mass culling of all mink in Denmark.571 The S tate Serum Institute has noted mutations in the Spike protein that differed from commonly circulating strains and initially showed a decreased susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies.314 The main SARS -CoV-2 variant associated with mink outbreaks in the Netherlands involves the Y453F mutation, which has also been identified in humans outside of Europe; this suggests the strain originated in humans.145 Continued analysis of SARS -CoV-2 strains in humans and mink suggests that commo n mutations in humans are transmitted to mink, and subsequent mutations in mink facilitate transmission back to human populations; more work is needed to assess the consequences of such mutations in animals prior to human transmission. 93 What do we need to know? We need to link genotypes to phenotypes (e.g., disease severity) in infected patients, and identify differences in transmissibility or symptom severity caused by different SARS -CoV-2 mutations . How do viral mutations affect the long -term efficacy of specific vaccines or therapeutics ? Which viral variants affect transmission rates or disease severity?

We need to know how different forecasting methods have fared when compared to real data and develop an understanding of which model features contribute most to accu rate and inaccurate forecasts. We need to know how vaccine efficacy, uptake, and deployment will alter COVID -19 progression. How will spillover and movement between countries affect local COVID -19 resurgence after initial vaccine distribution? We need real -time, publicly available dashboards to estimate vaccine uptake and adherence rates across the US.
