Pfizer and Moderna require two shots for full protection. J&J requires one. mRNA vaccines help your body quickly identify, remember, and respond to a virus even if it changes over time. Scientists have been studying mRNA vaccines for over 10 years (Pfizer and Moderna). The vaccines do not contain a live COVID-19 virus and cannot make you sick with COVID-19. Communities of color have been most impacted by the COVID-19 virus, and the vaccine will help prevent more hospitalizations and deaths in minority communities. The FDA & CDC have studied the J&J vaccine and have determined that it is safe & effective and blood clots from the vaccine are extremely rare. Talk to your doctor if you are at risk for developing clots before vaccination. Can be considered for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Talk to your doctor about what is right for you. Talk to your doctor if you have questions. After 28 days, all available COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. COVID-19 Vaccine and children: The Facts COVID-19 Vaccine and Your Child: The Facts 14 Pfizer's 2 shot vaccine is authorized for children 12 and older. Moderna (2 dose) and J&J (1 dose) are authorized to those who are 18 and older. mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) do not alter your body's DNA. Acting as a messenger (the \"m\" in mRNA), the vaccine simply delivers instructions for your body to learn how to protect against the COVID-19 virus. The second dose ensures the message was received, which is why you may feel stronger side effects. Both doses of the vaccine are required for full protection and you are considered \"fully vaccinated\" 2 weeks after your second dose or 14 days after 1 dose of J&J. Safety: The FDA and CDC have determined the vaccine is safe. Lengthy clinical trials, thousands of participants, and massive amounts of data have led to this conclusion by medical experts. Side Effects: The side effects include swelling or pain at the injection site, headache, body ache, fever and chills (flu-like symptoms), but these feelings often subside within a couple of days. Transmission: Children and teens are not immune to COVID infection and can also pass the virus onto others like parents and grandparents who may get really sick if not vaccinated. You are part of the herd. Every shot counts to reach herd immunity to contain the COVID-19 virus and end the pandemic. The vaccine is not thought to be a concern for those with nut allergies, but please consult your doctor if you have allergies or have experienced an allergic reaction to vaccines.The vaccines do not contain a live COVID-19 virus and cannot make you sick with COVID-19. Vaccination offers the strongest protection against COVID-19 infection and illness. By vaccinating against COVID-19 you can safely get back to doing the things you love.Common Myths about the COVID-19 vaccines Myth: I will be protected against COVID-19 after the first dose, and I don't need a second dose. For Pfizer (ages 12 and older) and Moderna (ages 18 and older) vaccines, it is important to get the second dose in order to have the most protection the vaccine can offer. You are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after your second dose. The Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one dose and you are fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving it. Myth: The vaccine isn't safe. The COVID-19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials with a diverse group of individuals to make sure they meet safety standards. There were no significant safety concerns identified. We will not administer a COVID-19 vaccine unless the FDA has determined it is safe and effective. Myth: I have allergies, I shouldn't get the vaccine. People with severe allergies who have experienced anaphylaxis in the past or allergic reactions to vaccines should talk to their primary care doctor about whether they should get the COVID-19 vaccine. Myth: Children cannot get sick with COVID-19. According to the CDC, \"while fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults, children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, can get sick from COVID-19, and can spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to others. Children, like adults, who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms (\"asymptomatic\") can still spread the virus to others. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all. However, some children can get severely ill from COVID-19. They might require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe. In rare cases, they might die. CDC and partners are investigating a rare but serious medical condition associated with COVID-19 in children called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). We do not yet know what causes MIS-C and who is at increased risk for developing it.\" For more information, visit the CDC's website. Myth: I got the vaccine so I don't have to wear a mask. The CDC has recommended that those who are fully vaccinated no longer need to wear masks indoors or outdoors, except in certain circumstances such as when traveling (planes, buses, trains, and public transportation) or when in a hospital, for example. However, state and local mandates as well as some businesses may still "}
