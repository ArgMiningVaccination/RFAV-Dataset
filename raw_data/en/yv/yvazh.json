This legislation will give people with dementia and carers important new legal rights. The first edition of our new newsletter written for and by people with dementia was published. We also held the national launch of Alzheimer's Forum - a website produced by people with dementia. We held a parliamentary lobby to protest about charging for care and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (Nice's) recommendation that the NHS should no longer prescribe drugs for Alzheimer's disease. This was our biggest lobby to date and it brought the issue to the attention of the public, the national press and MPs. We launched the Alzheimer Society's first nationally accredited training programme designed specifically for care staff working with people with dementia. We started raising awareness of vascular dementia, and of how people can reduce their risk of developing it, through a new three-year project called 'Hearts and Brains'. We will establish a brain bank in partnership with the Alzheimer's Research Trust to support future research into all types of dementia. We will use the information we have gathered from people with dementia and carers to persuade Nice to reconsider its guidance on the use of Alzheimer's drugs. We will develop an electronic dementia training programme, bringing quality information and guidance to care workers without the need for expensive training courses and books. We will launch an online research journal in order to make research findings widely accessible. We will set up a services directorate to ensure that people with dementia and carers receive the same level of care and support throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland.FIVE ACHIEVEMENTS OF 2004/2005 FIVE GOALS FOR 2005/2006CHAIRMAN'S FOREWORD DR NICHOLAS CAREY I cannot end this brief introduction without mention of three special people who sadly have died this year: Cora Phillips, the Society's co-founder; Marjorie Stone, former vice chairman; and Baroness Emily Blatch, former vice president. All three symbolised what is so special about the Society - real dedication to the cause combined with energy and integrity. They will all be sadly missed. Finally, on behalf of all my trustees, a big thank you to all the members, staff and volunteers who have made the Society what it is. Dr Nicholas Carey FCGI Chairman Alzheimer's SocietyTo ensure that we can remain in the forefront, and for us to continue to grow and provide consistent services and support across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Society is undergoing a series of changes. These involve a newer, smaller board of trustees, along with an advisory council where members will be drawn from all parts of the Society and whose purpose will be to assist the board of trustees in the development of policy for its work. Considerable changes are also underway at the operational level, which will lead to us being fully compliant with best practice. All of this, of course, creates uncertainty for staff and volunteers alike, and I'd like to pay tribute to everyone involved for their support and commitment, including the chief executive and his senior management team, and the volunteers and staff in the branches and regions, without whom the work of the Society would not be possible. Despite personal concerns about changes in the Society, they have continued to provide support and advice to thousands of people with dementia, their families and carers.I am delighted to introduce this year's annual review, which I am sure you will agree demonstrates superbly the breadth and extent of our work in our 25th year. The Alzheimer's Society is of immense importance, providing support, advice and services to thousands of carers and families affected by dementia. We can be proud of what we have achieved in lobbying government to ensure that the mental capacity bill contained provision for people with dementia. Our protestations and active work to overturn the recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) have contributed to a rethink, although we have yet to learn the final outcome. 2004/2005 was a great year - we helped more people, our income grew, public awareness increased and the government was not allowed to forget us! Alzheimer's Society 1Dementia is the major health and social care challenge of the 21st century. It affects over 750,000 people in the UK, including at least 14,000 people from minority ethnic communities. The number of people with dementia is set to rise steadily as the population ages and as people are diagnosed earlier. It is estimated that by 2010 there will be approximately 840,000 people with dementia in the UK. Symptoms of dementia include loss of memory, confusion and difficulties with speech and understanding. Dementia is more than just forgetfulness. It is a degenerative condition, which means that the person's ability to remember, understand, communicate and reason will gradually decline. There are some drugs available that can slow down the symptoms temporarily but there is, as yet, no cure.WHAT IS DEMENTIA? WHO DOES THE ALZHEIMER'S SOCIETY HELP? The Alzheimer's Society provides practical support, information and advice for anybody affected by dementia. This includes people with dementia, family carers, friends, relatives and medical and care professionals. Although just over half of the people diagnosed with dementia have Alzheimer's disease, there are over 100 different types of dementia, including vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and fronto-temporal dementia. The Society supports people with any type of dementia. This year, we launched a new project called 'Hearts and Brains' to increase awareness and understanding of vascular dementia. Most people with dementia are over the age of 65, but the Society works hard to reach out to the 18,000 younger people with dementia in the UK. We provide support for people of all ages. Alzheimer's Awareness Week 2004 \u00ae focused on the needs of the many children and young people affected by dementia in the family. Dementia is a global issue, affecting 18 million people worldwide. The Society is a member of Alzheimer's Disease International and it works closely with dementia charities and organisations in other countries. 2 Alzheimer's Society Earlier diagnosis, drugs for Alzheimer's disease and better awareness mean that more and more people with dementia are able and willing to speak out for themselves. Many are telling us - and the government - what they need. They are using their insight and their passion to reach out to others through writing, public speaking, campaigning and building websites. REACHING OUT TO OTHERS Alzheimer's Society 3with dementia in the local area, providing services that make dementia easier to live with. Thanks to a generous donation from the Big Lottery Fund, we have been able to employ two development workers for our Living with Dementia programme. They will provide advice and guidance to local branches to enable them to respond well when people with dementia contact them asking for information or support or wanting to get involved in the Society's work. Some branches run day care or home care services, others run counselling sessions for people with dementia, or organise befriending or advocacy programmes. Many branches run social get-togethers where people with dementia and their carers can enjoy some quality time together. The North Somerset branch has been holding regular tea dances for its members for the last three years. There is a mix of dance and sing-alongs, followed by tea and sandwiches. Roy Hopkins, who has dementia, comes with his wife Winifred. He says, 'I was pretty nervous when I came to the tea dance the first time because I'd never really danced much before but I've enjoyed coming with Winifred, who likes waltzes.' This year saw the launch of our new newsletter, Living with dementia , written by and for people with dementia. Through the newsletter, people with dementia share experiences, tips and messages of support. As soon as the first edition went out, we were inundated with positive feedback and requests for information. 'It's like a breath of fresh air,' wrote one reader. 'It made me feel more positive.' Subscriptions already stand at over 2,000 and we are confident that readership will continue to grow. Another success of the year was the national launch of the Alzheimer's Forum. Alzheimer's Forum is a website that a group of people with dementia living in the West Kent area have been writing and maintaining since 2000. It acts as an online meeting place for people with dementia, where they can talk about their experiences, share a joke and pass on information. This year the group decided that, in order to reach as many people as possible, the forum should be launched on our national website. Please visit www.alzheimers.org.uk/alzheimersforum and take a look. Much of the Society's campaigning success is due to the passion and the courage of the people with dementia who support our aims. Throughout the year, people have been writing letters to their MPs to demand better services and access to drugs, speaking publicly about their experiences and taking part in protests and lobbies. This is a powerful way to raise awareness, and increasing numbers of people are keen to speak out. We held a training session in Kent this year to encourage people who want to work with the media and to give them some experience of how it feels. One brave volunteer agreed to take part in a videotaped interview with a member of our public affairs team. Afterwards he commented, 'You quickly forget you have an audience and a camera pointing in your face. With an understanding interviewer, you just focus on the conversation and your story.' People with dementia have also helped us to develop a comprehensive range of helpful and accessible information for anyone experiencing memory problems. I'm told I have dementia is a practical guide produced by and for people with dementia. A range of 16 information sheets accompanies the booklet, covering topics such as treatments for dementia, staying healthy and driving. Across England, Wales and Northern Ireland our 265 Society branches and support groups work directly with people 4 Alzheimer's Society 'My advice to anyone who deals with people with dementia is \"Listen, listen, listen\". It can take time, but just listen, talk to them - you will learn something' (person with dementia) OUR NEW LIVING WITH DEMENTIA NEWSLETTER HAD 2,000 SUBSCRIPTIONS WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF BEING LAUNCHEDMany people are surprised to discover that dementia does not only affect people in their old age. Over 18,000 people with dementia in the UK are under the age of 65. The challenges of dementia are different for younger people - they may have jobs or dependent children and be more physically active. We can provide information about the types of dementia that affect younger people and the services and support available around the country. This year we published Younger people with dementia: an approach for the future, which discusses the needs of younger people and how organisations can meet these needs by working together to provide positive services. The ACE club in Rhyl, funded by the Society's Rhyl and District branch and the Welsh Assembly's Carers Strategy, organises a range of activities for younger people. These have ranged from a belly dancing class and Reiki healing to shopping trips to Chester and a ferry across the Mersey. Linda, who attends the club with her husband Gary, says, 'It's made a huge difference to me. Before, I was afraid of going outside the house. I was shocked to discover I had dementia because I thought it only affected older people.'Alzheimer's disease is not the only cause of dementia. There are over 100 different types of dementia, and vascular dementia is the second most common of these. This year, we launched a three-year project called Hearts and Brains to raise awareness of vascular dementia, especially among people at risk of developing the condition. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia. People with vascular dementia have shared their experiences and worked with us to produce a range of publications that explain the symptoms, progression and treatment of the condition. We will be holding workshops for health professionals all round the country in the coming year to review vascular dementia, the risk factors and the potential for prevention.

Alzheimer's Society 7Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK work tirelessly, caring for friends or relatives who have dementia. It can be an exhausting and demanding task, for which carers often receive little recognition, support or financial help. Nobody should face dementia alone. We are committed to providing carers with practical assistance, emotional support and the information they need to make informed choices.SUPPORTING THOSE WHO CARE 8 Alzheimer's Society Many carers feel lonely or isolated at times. It can be difficult to talk about the pressures and anxieties of caring with people who don't really understand. On our Alzheimer's Helpline, carers can speak with trained advisers who can provide reassurance and a sympathetic listening ear, as well as give up-to-date information on all aspects of dementia and caring. Last year, the helpline service dealt with around 20,000 enquiries. Our Lesbian and Gay Network continued throughout the year to provide telephone support for lesbians and gay men caring for a partner, relative or friend. Lesbian and gay carers can face ignorance and prejudice when they try to get access to support and services, adding pressure to an already difficult situation. Knowing that somebody is only a phone call away really can make all the difference. For more information about the Lesbian and Gay Network please visit www.alzheimers.org.uk/Gay_carers . We produce a wide range of helpful information sheets, leaflets and booklets. Our monthly newsletter, Share , keeps members informed about dementia, caring, news and research developments. Information is available in large print, in Braille and on audiocassette, and basic information is available in a variety of languages. Our website contains a wealth of information on dementia, caring, research, news and campaigns. Last year, it received almost one million visits. Please go to www.alzheimers.org.uk to find out more. The website also hosts Talking Point, our online discussion forum. It has almost 1,000 members and is an ideal place to ask for advice, share information, join discussions or simply let off steam! Norman, who cares for his wife Peggy, says, 'Talking Point (TP) is a rock, an escape, a little world of friends removed from the cares of the day, something to hold on to and look forward to at the end of each day. TP is there for us to rant, to sympathise, to open our hearts and in return find some comfort with our big family. There is always someone there for us.' To join the TP family please visit www.alzheimers.org.uk/Talkingpoint . We also provide practical, hands-on assistance for carers all around the country, including befriending projects, training courses and respite care. All Society branches run carers support services; there are about 600 Society carers support groups in the UK. These act as a lifeline for many carers, enabling them to enjoy a change of scene, some company, a chance to talk through their problems, or simply some time to have a cup of tea and put their feet up. For example, the Bradford branch has run a support group for carers of younger people with dementia for the past five years. The unusual thing about this group is that it meets in a local pub, creating a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Carers can bring their loved ones with them - they all enjoy some time together and then split into two separate groups part-way through the evening. Dave, whose wife Maureen has dementia, says, 'What's nice about this group is it gives me the chance to chat with others who are in a similar situation and, because it's a pub, it's a relaxed setting.'Many carers struggle to make ends meet. Our dementia support grants scheme aims to relieve some of the immediate financial pressure and to provide encouragement to continue when times are tough. As one carer wrote to us, 'When my husband became ill, it seemed like a final blow to have financial worries.' We were able to help this carer with a grant towards the cost of her household bills. She told us later: 'We are so grateful for your contribution. This certainly supports my determination to keep my darling husband at home for his entire life.' This year we extended the scheme to make grants available to carers whose loved ones have died or gone into residential care. THE ALZHEIMER'S HELPLINE DEALS WITH 20,000 ENQUIRIES EVERY YEAR'After my phone call to you I felt call to you I felt helped, comforted helped, comforted and reassured' Alzheimer's Society 9Quality Research in Dementia (QRD) is the award-winning research grants programme of the Alzheimer's Society. Uniquely, it truly represents the priorities of people with dementia and carers by actively involving them in all aspects of its work.IN SE ARCH OF TH E ANSWERWE ARE COMMITTED TO SPENDING OVER \u00a31 MILLION ON RESEARCH EVERY YEAR 10 Alzheimer's SocietyThis mutually beneficial partnership between people with dementia, carers and the research community is made possible through the QRD Network, which lies at the heart of our success. It is made up of 150 people with dementia, carers and former carers. They set the strategy for research, comment on grant applications, select applications for funding, monitor projects and tell people about research results. Their personal experience of dementia means that they know better than anyone which research developments could make the most difference. With the generous donations of our supporters, we are able to invest over \u00a31 million in research every year. QRD funds research in three different areas: cause, cure and care. The search for cause and cure gives us hope for the future, while research into care ensures that we deliver the best help right now. Research priorities include stem cell research, early diagnosis, risk factors, vaccines, and alternative and complementary therapies. However, we receive many more grant applications than we are able to fund. The success of our grants programme depends on the generosity of donors and supporters. As Clive Ballard, director of research, says, 'We should be optimistic that research can deliver improvements in treatment and care in the near future. This can, however, only be achieved if the research strategy is coherent, if the funding is adequate and if there are enough scientists with the right skills.' For more information, visit www.qrd.alzheimers.org.uk . We have been able to fund some exciting research projects in the last year, any one of which could lead to dramatic improvements in the quality of life of thousands of people. For example, a generous donation from the Mike Gooley Trailfinders Charity has enabled us to award a three-year fellowship grant to Dr Wendy Noble, who will be investigating why brain cells die in Alzheimer's disease. She will be looking at how plaques and tangles develop in the brain cells of people with Alzheimer's disease and how this process could be prevented. This research has already led to a clinical trial of lithium for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and is likely to inform the development of other effective new drugs. It is important that we build and maintain a high profile for dementia research and that dementia scientists are encouraged to share their knowledge and learn from each other. Five of our research fellows were fortunate enough to attend the ninth international conference for Alzheimer's and related diseases, held in Philadelphia, USA, this year. This was a prestigious event, with 4,500 researchers and old age psychiatrists presenting their work, running sessions and giving talks. One of our research fellows said: 'We met many researchers, including some who showed interest in future collaboration. By the end of the conference I had a notebook filled with comments, ideas and tutorial notes.' Disseminating information is a key part of building a high profile for dementia research. We are currently developing an online journal, which will include a variety of review articles on key areas of research. The journal will be freely available and will be launched in the autumn of 2005. Another key priority for the coming year is the development of an Alzheimer's brain bank, which will support future work into all types of dementia. We are delighted to be able to work with the Alzheimer's Research Trust on this exciting project. 'I cared for my husband for eight years. 'I cared for my husband for eight years.

(Victoria Morgan)(Victoria Morgan)' We must maintain our enthusiam and commitment, ' We must maintain our enthusiam and commitment, and look for ways to increase our support for and look for ways to increase our support for research ' (Director of Research, Alzheimer's Society)(Director of Research, Alzheimer's Society) Alzheimer's Society 11In March 2005, 600 supporters of the Alzheimer's Society gathered in London for the biggest parliamentary lobby we have ever organised, under the banner of 'Remember those who forget'. Many were angry and disappointed - but they were also passionate and determined to be heard. DETERMINED TO BE HEARDThe reason for this outburst of anger and passion? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) had just made its shocking recommendation that the NHS should no longer prescribe drugs for Alzheimer's disease - its argument being that, at \u00a32.50 a day, the drugs were too expensive. We have campaigned for many years for the widespread availability of these life-changing drugs. It is unthinkable that Nice should now recommend their withdrawal. Thankfully, we have thousands of vocal and committed supporters, who have deluged Nice with their passionate protests. As actor Tony Robinson says, 'From my own personal experience I know that dementia doesn't discriminate - so why should the NHS? I am astonished that Nice thinks that \u00a32.50 a day is too much to pay for precious extra quality time with a loved one with dementia.' The lobby really pressed home the point and we will not ease the pressure until we have persuaded Nice to reconsider its decision. The parliamentary lobby also had a second important goal: to call for an end to the charging of personal care. Six years after the Royal Commission on Long Term Care recommended that people with dementia should receive all their care free of charge, people are still expected to pay for help with eating, dressing and using the toilet. Barbara Pointon, carer and speaker at the lobby, says, 'No way is it 'personal/social care' only; attending to hygiene, food and toileting is just the tip of the iceberg. What about the 24-hour vigilance, dealing with changes in personality, difficulties in communication, having the patience to reply to repetitive questions?' The sheer size of the crowd calling for an end to this injustice said it all, and many people with dementia and carers shared their personal experiences with MPs. The day was a huge success, and we are hopeful that it will bring about much-needed change. Years of hard work and campaigning paid off in March 2005 when MPs voted the mental capacity bill through its final parliamentary stages. The new Mental Capacity Act marks a major turning point in the legal rights of people with dementia and carers. For the first time, people with dementia cannot legally be presumed incapable of making their own decisions. Carers, too, will benefit from new rights under the act: implementation of the act in 2007 will mean that they must be consulted about decisions relating to the health and welfare of people who have lost capacity. We are delighted that the act has finally become law. For more information about our campaigning work please visit www. alzheimers.org.uk/News_and_Campaigns . Alzheimer's Awareness Week 2004 \u00ae focused on children and young people. When someone is diagnosed with dementia, their children or grandchildren may find it difficult to understand the condition and deal with painful changes in their relationship with loved family members. One young person told us, 'When my grandfather forgot my name I felt like he didn't actually love me anymore. But then I found out it was because of dementia.' We produced an engaging leaflet to explain dementia to children, and sent branches all around the country packs of materials to use in local schools. We also made a video called 'About my grandfather... about my grandmother', which premiered in Leicester Square in July. And to top it all, we designed a drawing competition for children, which asked them to show how they thought memories, feelings and thoughts were stored in the brain. The results were colourful, fascinating and often moving. 12 Alzheimer's Society ' Thankfully, there are drugs which can ease the symptoms - for a while. Now it seems that small light is about to be extinguished for so many families. \u00a32.50 isn't much to change someone's life for a day, is it?'

We have developed our expertise over many years of research and experience. But this knowledge only becomes truly powerful when it is shared with the people and organisations that can really make a difference.SHARING KNOWLEDGE 16 Alzheimer's Society We share our knowledge through a comprehensive training programme for both Society staff and external organisations. We also produce books, training manuals and videos, and organise conferences. This year, we launched the Alzheimer's Society's first ever nationally accredited training course aimed specifically at improving the quality of care given to people with dementia. The course, 'An introduction to dementia care', was produced in collaboration with Bupa Care Homes, Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the University of Sunderland. It uses video sessions and an interactive course workbook to encourage care workers to develop a person-centred and positive approach towards their work. We have high hopes that this course will encourage thousands of care staff to learn more about dementia and take pride in the vital job they do. Graham Stokes, head of mental health at Bupa Care Homes, says, ' The aim of this programme is to provide carers with an understanding of what it is like to live with dementia and encourage them to view dementia care as a career choice.' There also continues to be a great demand for our more established training courses, and organisations are increasingly asking us to provide courses for them in-house. This year, Brunelcare - an organisation that provides home care, day care and nursing residential care throughout Bristol and Avon - asked us to provide our six-day 'Dementia care training skills' course for its employees. Christine Allen from Brunelcare says, 'The course was even better than I expected, and in a style I could really relate to.' We can also put care providers in touch with leading dementia care trainers through our approved trainers scheme. All Society approved trainers have been through a rigorous assessment process and are well qualified to transform an organisation's training programme and significantly improve the quality of dementia care provision. It is important that those at the frontline of care - care assistants as well as managers - have easy and direct access to resources to develop their knowledge and skills. Next year we plan to produce a booklet to introduce new care workers to the rewards and the challenges of their chosen career. We also intend to develop an interactive online training programme for both students and care staff, so that they can learn on their own initiative, without the need for expensive training courses and books. Motivating and inspiring those who provide care for people with dementia - and those who will do so in coming years - is a key part of what we do. We are committed to finding the funds and the resources to make this possible. For more information about the Quality Care team, please visit www.alzheimers. org.uk/Working_with_people_with_dementia .Publications Our publications are widely used in a variety of care settings to provide care staff with practical information and guidance on all aspects of dementia care.

Local fundraising enables branches to run services for people with dementia and carers. Our nationwide programme of Memory Walks, held to coincide with World Alzheimer's Day, has become a popular and successful way for branches to raise money. Last year, 4,500 people from 72 branches around England, Wales and Northern Ireland stepped out in support of the Society, raising a total of \u00a3134,000. The London Memory Walk took 250 people along a riverside route past some of the country's best-known landmarks, including Big Ben and the London Eye. The writer and critic AA Gill, who joined the walk, said, 'Alzheimer's is a cruel disease... Everyone who has taken part in this year's Memory Walk has helped raise funds that will make an enormous difference to the lives of people with dementia and their carers.' Every year, many of our more adventurous supporters complete mountain hikes, run marathons and throw themselves out of aeroplanes to raise money for us. Society supporter David Grigson ran the Great North Run last year and raised a staggering \u00a320,173 for the Alzheimer's Society - the most ever raised by a single participant in any event. David says, 'My father had Alzheimer's disease and after seeing how hard it was for my mother to cope I really wanted to do something for the Society.' He later ran the London Marathon, raising a further \u00a314,000! This year, we launched a series of overseas treks to raise money for the Our work is dependent on the generosity of our donors and funders and on the commitment of Society supporters all around the country who work so hard to raise money for us. Their continuing support brings us closer to achieving our goals: to support every person with dementia and carer who needs our help, and to find a cure. 18 Alzheimer's Society ' OUR WORK IS DEPENDENT ' OUR WORK IS DEPENDENT ON THE GENEROSITY OF DONORS AND OF DONORS AND FUNDRAISERS.

Everyone completed the trek and the group raised over \u00a3150,000. One trek participant said, 'What a truly memorable trip, I will never forget the experience. Thanks for the opportunity not only to have the journey of a lifetime but also to raise an incredible amount of money for a charity so close to my heart.' Another 90 people are now eagerly anticipating trips to China in September and October. Many companies give us valuable income and help to raise awareness of dementia around the country. This year, we have been delighted to work with the Foresters, who have raised \u00a390,000 for us over the last three years, and HBOS, who ran a pin badge campaign in July. Barlow, Lyde & Gilbert also supported us for a second year and organised a fantastic quiz night for us, hosted by Jo Brand. We are extremely grateful to all the wonderful companies who continue to support our work.We are also grateful to the hundreds of charitable trusts and foundations for their generous donations. The Ingram Trust, for example, has supported the Society for the past six years. It is currently helping to fund our caring grants scheme and our Living with Dementia programme - two crucial areas of our work. We were also thrilled this year to receive a charitable donation of more than \u00a31 million from the Mike Gooley Trailfinders Charity. The money will be used over the next three years to fund two research fellowships that will improve understanding of dementia and explore ways of improving drug treatments for the condition. Professor Clive Ballard, director of research, said, 'We are delighted to accept this generous donation. It gives us a fantastic opportunity to build on the major advances that have been made in dementia research since the launch of the Society 25 years ago.' Alzheimer's Society 19Society money In 2005, the Society's total income from its national organisation, branches and subsidiaries increased by 9 per cent to \u00a333.3 million. Subscriptions, donations and fundraising income, which accounts for 40 per cent of total income, grew by over \u00a32 million. Over \u00a31 million of this increase was raised in branches with the help of the Society's branch volunteers and staff. The Society received restricted funds of \u00a3400,000 during the year as part of a commitment of over \u00a31 million from the Mike Gooley Trailfinders Charity. The launch during the year of overseas treks and the continued success of the Society's raffle contributed to an increase in surpluses in Alzheimer's Trading Ltd of more than 50 per cent when compared to the previous year. Investment income and profits also increased by 46 per cent. All these successes enabled the Society to spend an extra \u00a32.1 million on its charitable activities during 2004/2005. Highlights for the year \u00a311.4 million was spent on care services in local and national centres across the country A total of \u00a311.7 million (\u00a31.7 million more than last year) was spent on developing new services and branches, and supporting volunteer-led activity The Society spent almost \u00a3140,000 on small dementia carer grants in response to over 327 applications Less than 1.7 per cent of the Society's income was spent on corporate management and administrationChallenges Even with over 260 branches and support groups, there is more to do. The Society is always looking for ways to help people with dementia and their carers from the moment they need support. The Society uses its money to top up the shortfalls experienced by many of its contracted services - but it continues to challenge the government commitment for a full cost recovery in future. The Society is undergoing a series of changes, as part of its One Society programme. The major phases of the implementation of this programme will take place over the coming 18 months. The programme aims to provide more and better services for people with dementia wherever they live in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is also an investment in the Society's infrastructure to ensure that it can continue to improve quality of life for all those touched by dementia well into the future. As a volunteer-dependent organisation, the Society strives to support and retain volunteers to achieve its objectives. Ever increasing legislation puts considerable pressure on the Society's resources - it could achieve so much more if this was relieved. As the One Society programme is implemented, it should release volunteers to focus on what they do best.

Alzheimer's Society 23FINAL WORD NEIL HUNTCHIEF EXECUTIVE Above all, we will move into a phase where the Alzheimer's Society is clear about what it is trying to achieve and how it will achieve it. We will be in a position to tell our story more clearly than ever before. We will have an even greater role to play in helping people through the difficult journey of living with dementia. On behalf of the Society, I would like to extend my best wishes to all who use our services - people with dementia, carers and families, professional - and to our volunteers and staff. Neil Hunt Chief Executive Alzheimer's SocietyThe benefits will be seen in our capacity to do much more for our cause than we are currently able to do. We will offer new services in places where we currently have no presence. We will be able to put the services that we offer now on a more secure footing and we will be able to ensure quality and performance throughout. We will be able to raise more funds for our work. We will be able to harness the tenacity and determination of our volunteers to press home the vital messages about the policies and services that people with dementia need. In the introduction to this review our chairman referred to some of the changes that are taking place inside the organisation. These changes are substantial and we need to manage the pace, scale and cost of them carefully. But we do need to see these changes through. Throughout the Society there is recognition that these changes will bring huge benefits . 24 Alzheimer's Society ROYAL PATRON HRH Princess Alexandra GCVO PRESIDENT EMERITUS Sir Jonathan Miller CBE PRESIDENT Jon Snow VICE PRESIDENTS Katie BoyleAngela BrowningProfessor Lord Morris PC RossorDame Rosemary Rue DBE MPProfessor Gordon Wilcock CHAIRMAN Dr Nicholas Carey FCGI CHIEF EXECUTIVE Neil Hunt PATRONS Dame Judi DenchMs Britt Ekland Council members who served during the year to 31 March 2005 HONORARY OFFICERS Chairman: Dr Nicholas Carey FCGIVice Chairman: Irene Kerr Treasurer: Graham Dewhirst BOARD MEMBERS Dr Joe Blackledge MBE (Midlands) Beryl Cave (London) resigned 18 September 2004 Corinne Clarke (North West) elected 18 September 2004Richard Crace elected 18 September 2004 Peter Downing resigned 18 September 2004John Finnigan (Trent) Allan Graham Peter Laycock (Eastern)Rosalind Macbeth (South West) resigned 21 March 2005 Bill Megraw (Northern Ireland)William MitchellMarilynne Morgan CBAlan Peters Dr Carolyn Popham (Southern) elected 18 September 2004Mervyn Powell (Wales) elected 18 September 2004Joanne Schofield, resigned 4 April 2004 Judy Thompson (Northern)Dr Daphne WallaceLinda WebberPat Wilson (Yorkshire) Eileen Winston (Central)John Wood MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COMMITTEEProfessor Carol BrayneDepartment of Community MedicineUniversity of Cambridge Dr Keiran Breen Department of PsychiatryUniversity of Dundee Professor Alistair Burns (Chairman) Department of Old Age PsychiatryUniversity of Manchester Professor Murna Downs Professor in Dementia Studies University of Bradford Professor Jim Edwardson Institute for the Health of the ElderlyNewcastle General Hospital Dr Nick Fox Dementia Research GroupInstitute of Neurology, London Dr Stephen Gentleman Neuroinflammation and Repair Unit Imperial College School of Medicine LondonDr Nori Graham Alzheimer's Disease InternationalLondon Dr Diane Hanger Department of NeuroscienceInstitute of Psychiatry, London Dr Steve Illiffe Royal Free Hospital and University CollegeLondon Professor Paul G Ince Academic Unit of PathologyUniversity of Sheffield Professor Robin Jacoby University Department of Psychiatry, Oxford Ms Enid Levin Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE)London Professor Simon Lovestone Department of PsychiatryMaudsley Hospital, London Professor Ian McKeith Department of Old Age PsychiatryInstitute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle Professor Mike Nolan School of Nursing and MidwiferyUniversity of Sheffield Professor Mike Owen Division of Psychological MedicineUniversity of Wales College of Medicine Cardiff Professor Gordon Wilcock Department of Care of the ElderlyUniversity of Bristol Professor Bob Woods University of Wales, Bangor SOCIETY PEOPLE Alzheimer's Society 25REVIEW Alzheimer's Society Gordon Greencoat 0898 Annual review August 2005 ISBN 1 872874 86 X Registered charity no 296645 A company limited by guarantee and registered in England no 2115499Quotations featured in this review do not necessarily relate to the individuals pictured Design: www.thiswayupdesign.co.uk.
