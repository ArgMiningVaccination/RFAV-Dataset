You should seek [treatment for ADHD](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/adhd)if you consistently have difficulty with attention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity that interferes with your daily life. Symptoms of ADHD include the inability to sustain attention during tasks, difficulty organizing tasks and activities, being easily distracted, frequent fidgeting or squirming, and talking or interrupting excessively. If these symptoms interfere with your career, academics, or relationships\u2014for example, consistently failing to complete professional projects on time\u2014you should seek an evaluation for ADHD. How does treatment for ADHD work? Effective treatment for ADHD often consists of medication, behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes. Stimulant medications such as Adderall and Ritalin work by altering levels of neurotransmitters in the brain; higher levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are known to improve attention and focus. Therapy works by helping people with ADHD understand the condition, discuss their areas of difficulty, and develop behavioral strategies to manage their symptoms. In some cases, modifying one's diet and exercise can also help improve symptoms. Are there specific medications for ADHD? Medications to treat ADHD are generally stimulants, the most common are Adderall and Ritalin. There are two categories of used as an alternative if stimulants aren't effective or viable for a particular patient. How long does treatment for ADHD take? It's tough to give an exact time frame because everyone varies. In terms of medications, stimulants begin to work very soon after you take them, generally within the hour. It may take time to identify the right medication and dosage, but the medication itself is fast-acting. In terms of therapy, it takes time to develop skills and put them into practice, but you will likely see improvements within a few weeks or months. About Psychiatrists, meds and Psychiatric Nurses.
