When alcohol is used as an antiseptic, an unpleasant odor denaturant is often added to prevent drinking. Contrary to a widespread belief, alcohol at 70o (or even at 60o) is a better antiseptic than alcohol at 90o. [antecedent]Affection healed or always in evolution.

SANITARY EDUCATION COUNCILS This medication is intended to alleviate a temporary state of fatigue. It is necessary to distinguish normal physical fatigue occurring as a result of a major effort for example and asthenia which is fatigue outside of any effort. \u00b7 Fatigue arising from physical exertion is normal: rest is enough to make it disappear. \u00b7 Fatigue that does not give in to rest or asthenia is the feeling of not being able to provide an effort before it even began. This fatigue can be the consequence of overwork, of a disease. \u00b7 Some medications may also cause unusual fatigue: read the package leaflet for medications you are taking and ask for advice from your pharmacist or doctor. But in many cases no precise cause is found. Fatigue can be manifested by very variable symptoms. This can be a general impression of weakness. But sometimes symptoms may be associated with it such as sleep disorders (insomnia, restless sleep ...), intellectuals (difficulties of concentration, memory and attention ...), sexual (decreasing desire ...), character irritability, pessimism, sadness, demotivation ...) ... You can reduce your fatigue by respecting as much as possible the following tips: \u00b7 Rest, relax, look for the reasons for your fatigue; \u00b7 Practice regular and appropriate physical activity; \u00b7 Have a balanced diet (especially avoid alcohol, tobacco, stimulants); \u00b7 Find your sleeping rhythm (regular bedtime and sufficient sleeping time). Seek advice from your pharmacist or doctor in the following cases: \u00b7 No improvement after 1 month of treatment. \u00b7 Increased feeling of fatigue during treatment. \u00b7 Occurrence of new symptoms or unusual symptoms.
