Randy Levine, Ph.D. Certified Master Healer Randy Levine was born and raised in Miami Beach, Florida. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Miami in 1986. The opportunity to study with Dr. Ibrahim Jaffe was an eye-opening experience to see a Master Healer with Clairvoyant Talents integrate his gifts into alignment with Divine Will for Love and Healing. Randy has studied with Ibrahim Jaffe for over 15 years. He completed the Master Healer's Apprenticeship Program in 2016. Dr. Jaffe has formulated a model of healing that works directly at the level of the subconscious mind to change the pictures, beliefs and emotions that contribute to psychological distress and physical illness. Rumi's quote is the motto of my understanding of Sufi Healing. \"Don't look away from the bandaged place\". \"That's where the light comes in\". The Sufi Healing approach invites the client to infuse the appropriate Divine Quality into the wounds stored in the subconscious. The Divine Qualities then begin to clean the wound and help transform it. Deep emotions are to be felt in the body and experienced compassionately. Letting Go of the old pictures, emotions and beliefs into the new Divine Qualities is an important key to healing. Often one then has to overcome the fear of letting go of the familiar old patterns. When one understands that the original wound which is causing distress is the very means to learning how to understand and live these Divine Qualities the client becomes more hopeful and more peaceful. Healing occurs as the Divine Qualities become more available in one's heart and mind. In effect the 99 Divine Names of the One Love are light transmissions that can bring greater peace, compassion, forgiveness, love and patience. Sufi healing can help with psychological issues of depression, anxiety, trauma, anger, and need for greater compassion. This approach can also assist those in recovery. While I do not have the clairvoyant skills of Dr. Jaffe, I do attempt to assist your healing through our work together with these 99 Divine Qualities. When the Light of the Divine begins to change the pictures and emotions stored at the subconscious level of the mind healing often occurs. In my own work on myself and with the assistance of my fellow classmates, I have found greater peace through the Sufi Healing approach. An added bonus is you're enjoying more inner light in your heart and mind. In surrendering to the Divine Qualities, you purify your heart, and you come to better know your Divine Inner Essence which is a gift and blessing from God.
