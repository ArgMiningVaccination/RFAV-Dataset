These topics , covering a broad rang of scientific questions, will continue being the mainstream of the scientific work during the next period. Phenotypes Both for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) t h e r e i s a w i d e i n t e r e s t i n reviewing the current p henotypes. In asthma there is a need to improve its characterization by integrating multiple aspects of the disease and at the same time to assess the redistribution of asthma in different entities. During the last years we have started to apply unsupervis ed methods to this problem. The aim was to identify distinct asthma phenotypes by applying Latent Class Analysis (LCA), a model -based clustering method, to two large epidemiological studies. Adults with asthma who participated in the follow -up of the Epidemiological study on Genetics and Environment of Asthma and the European Community Respiratory Health Survey were included. Four asthma phenotypes were distinguished by the LCA in each sample 1. Research is in progress to search genetic determinants of asthm a phenotypes based on such clustering approach through a larger collaboration, from that work initiated through the EAL. The same approach is being followed in MeDALL where both classical (expert based) and novel (unsupervised) phenotypes will be extensive ly compared by means of several omic strategies in a large network of birth cohorts in Europe2. The work on COPD phenotypes has followed a similar approach with a recent publication showing the existence of different sub phenotypes one of them closely rese mbling the so called metabolic syndrome3. The redefinition of the current respiratory phenotypes is now receiving increasing attention, with a number of papers recently published 4,5,6,7 Environmental determinants Among the environmental determinants of respiratory diseases our EAL has given particular attention to occupation and air pollution. Exposure to cleaning products both in specific occupation al settings and in the general populations has been linked to an increased risk of asthma. In the context of EAL, a state of the art review on cleaning related asthma has been conducted and identified current knowledge gaps8. Recent studies have strengthened the exis ting evidence of an increased risk of asthma and other adverse respiratory effects in cleaning workers. Similar effects are seen in other settings in which cleaning products are used such as healthcare professionals and homemakers9,10. The predominant effect mechanisms remain largely unclear and may include both specific sensitization and irritant -related features. New research is in progress in the area and in particular a new project with the USA on American Nurses (collaboration wit h Nurses Health study) . 1 Siroux V, Basagana X, Boudier A, et al.

LEA - Renewal 16/30 26/04/11 Acute respiratory effects of air pollution are well established and there is increasing evidence of long term effects11. Epidemiologic studies have now shed light on the long -term effects on chronic pathologies and on the health bene fit of air quality improvements12,13,14. The evidence of systemic effects of air pollution has supported its causal role on a variety of health effects at low levels and suggested the role of various pathways 15,16. A major challenge is the assessement of traffi c related pollution at a fine level to assess long -term effect s. That area of research will markedly progressed in the context of the European Escape project which will provide refined assessment of exposure and by studying the associations of other traits with air pollution. Though not environmental sensu strictu physical activity and diet are , beyond their relevance per se, important both as effect modifiers of environmental exposures as well as potential confounders i n many of the EAL studies . Associations of physical activity with asthma characteristics have been studied in the NHS and E3N studies17,18 a n d c u r r e n t l y b e i n g s t u d i e d i n t h e E G E A s t u d y . Methodological aspects regarding the assessement of physical activity and diet are a challenge19. Regarding diet, emphasis at the current stage is on the epidemiological methods like the use of confirmatory analysis to derive dietary patterns, especially in the case of small studies and the use of structural models. A diet questionnaire has been included in the ECRHS III Genetics and gene environment interactions Current challenges in gene environment interactions concern the improvement of phenotypic and environmental characterization and setting up interdisciplinary research to understand the determinants of asthma , and setting collaborations at sufficient scale . Several research programs are being developed in genetics and gene environment interactions, in particular on gene occupational hazards interaction involving EGEA and ECRHS and others to increase power, taking advantage of GWAS genotyping already performed for these studies 20. T h e e v i d e n c e o f g enetic heterogene ity of asthma according to age of onset shows the relevance of genetic ap proaches to disentang le the phenotypic heterogeneity of such complex disease21. Although gene environment interactions attr act a lot of attention, there are y e t f e w d e m o n s t r a t e d i n t e r a c t i o n s . Interactions of genes with farming environment have been studied for candidate genes of innate immunity and recently by a gnostic approaches22,23. Enhanced associations of early respiratory infections with early -onset asthma was demonstrated for individuals with 17q21 genetic variants24. Gene environment interactions studies regarding air pollution and occupational hazards in relation to respiratory phenotypes are increasing, but few interactions can be considered as established.15,25,26. Studies considering several genes from the same pathway or for which gene- gene interaction has been suggested are emerging in the area of gene environment interactions, but proper pathways analyses, considering systematically various 11Perez L, Rapp R, K\u00fcnzli N.

Am LEA 17/30 26/04/11 pathways have not yet been conducted26,27 The development of large -scale genetic studies of asthma will likely change the situation. Two types of approaches may be de veloped based on testing hypotheses (candidate interactions) at the gene or pathway level, or in searching interactions with genes of yet unknown function which may be evidenced through genome -wide associations, but such approaches are challenging.23,28,29,30 The working hypothesis The scientific plan of the EAL for the new period (2011 -2014) will continue the research lines that are currently active, while exploring new areas of interest. As explained in the section on strategies, the scientific program of the LEA pay s now greater attention to research on childhood health as well as to the environmental determinants of health. Phenotypes Asthma is a term that includes different phenotypes. Comparative assessments of classical and novel phenotypes, based on unsupervised methods, will provide new opportunities for the definition and diagnosis of asthma related entities. This will be done through t he EU FP7 MedALL . In adults, s tudies (JM J -Aymerich, Pin, R Varraso, V Siroux ). COPD is a heterogeneous disease involving different subphenotypes -It is anticipated that with the development of a respiratory program in E3N, the ageing of EGEA and ECRHS cohorts, t h e continuation of PAC -COPD, the recognition of COPD as a major research topic by WHO, there will be opportunities for development of common re search program . (JM A n t \u00f3 , J B o u s q u e t , J Garcia- Aymerich . Environmental determinants Occupation and indoor exposure to cleaning products are significant risk factors for asthma development and morbidity - Research will focus on the assessment of exposures in various settings, studies on the associations with asthma phenotypes are in progress and in planning phase in France (EGEA, E3N), Europe (ECR HS), USA (Nurses Health study); been (NETA, IAGO) Nadif, R Varraso, JP Zock). Research o n air pollution w i l l b e m a r k e d l y developed through the improvement of exposures in progress thanks to the Escape consortium (FP7 funding). It is planned to strengthen collaborative work in this area between CREAL and both Inserm teams (in the context of the recruit ment of B Jacquemin as CR1 in Villejuif and the participation of R Slama fro m Grenoble in the EAL) by further develo ping studie s in asthma, l ung function, enlarging collaborations to other phenotypes such as rhinitis and biomarkers, and to children health. As a first step, research of air pollution effects on respiratory health in early life is going on in Eden (France) and Inma ( Spain) cohorts (M. Pedersen post -doctoral position, with V Siroux, R Slama M Kogevinas and J Sunyer). Strengthening international collaboration in this area is planned in the context of two European projects Escape and MedAll , whose possibilities have to b e fully exploited, in particular through a long term visit of B Jacquemin planned in CREAL . (B Jacquemin, Slama, J Sunyer ). Physical activity and diet do not be long to standard data collected in respiratory epidemiology. It is therefore of great interest to further develop mutual access to data sets with such information. Researchers from Inserm and CREAL with interest in these two related lifestyle determinants will further develop collaborations . Developments will take place by analyses on EGEA, E3N, NHS, PAC - COPD and new data collection which will take place in ECR HS III .

Candidate -environment interactions. Steyerberg EW, The novel \"genomic pathway approach\" to complex diseases: a reason for (over -) optimism? Epidemiology 2009 ;20:500 -7. LEA - Renewal 18/30 26/04/11 Other environmental risk factors. Beyond the environmental determinants already studied in relation to respiratory outcomes, increasing collaborations with environmental epidemiologists, both in CREAL , and Grenoble will open avenues for improving exposure assessment methods (using environm ental models or exposure biomarkers) and for integration of understudied environmental characteristics in the respiratory and child health areas . Among others, endocrine disruptors will be considered Villanueva, JP Zock ). Genetics and gene environment interactions We have now set up condit ions for collaborative work in genetics , following in particular our participation to the Gabriel Consortium on asthma (EU -FP6) which provided GWAS information for several cohorts, including EGEA and ECRHS a n d c o l l a b o r a t i o n s wi t h s p e c i f i c g e n e t i c e p i d e mi o l o g y groups will continue . Developments will include the analyses on both classical (such as asthma severity) and novel phenotypes (derived from our previous work on latent class analyses (see above). Gene environment interactions analyses will be developped at a larger scale than previously, with a focus on occupation in the short term, then with projects on air pollution, always in the context of European and international collaborations. Various approaches are planned including candidate approaches at the gene or pathway level as well as pangenomic analyses. Development of epigenetic approaches is planned in particular in children , through collaborations , within FP7 EU MedAll and in a new birth cohort set -up in Grenoble ( JR Gonzales, F Kauffmann, M Kogevinas, R Nadif, V Siroux) Other areas of interest Biomarkers - Inclusion of bi omarkers as markers of exposure and of early biological effect or disease are increasingly used in epidemiology and will offer opportunities for translational research. The area is challenging at various levels, but is a developing a r e a b e t w e e n t h e p a r t i e s , w i t h e x c h a n g e o f biological samples and mutual access to infrastructure in the context of studies set up in both institutions with biobanks associated with epidemiological surve ys. Further development towards system biology is planned in the interdisciplinary frame of the MedAll project. (S Guerra , R Nadif , R Slama ). Child health - Although studies on children were conducted in CREAL and although the EGEA study (Inserm) recruited children , the EAL program of the fi rst peri od was focused on adul ts. Thi s wi l l be changed because of the increasin g recognition of the importance of early life events in respiratory diseases and beyond, pushing to expand the understanding of that critical period in the context of the DoHAD (Developmental Origins of Health and Diseases) hypothesis . This orientation als o relates to the development of high profile research in the area both in Grenoble and CREAL. An epidemiologist with specific competence in the area has arrived in Grenoble (Avenir Inserm grant, no w the director of the team), the obtention at CREAL of an E RC senior research grant in children epidemiology and the starting of MedALL a major EU -FP7 project cocoordinated by Inserm and is h ( Ant\u00f3, Bousquet, Siroux, R Slama, J Sunyer, M Vrijheld) Statistical methods - Building on existing new developments (latent class analysis, structural modelling) of collaborations between both institutions, it is planned to explore more systematically areas of applications of up -to-date methods. There is a scientific need to refine statistical methods in epidemiology in areas such as unsupervised methods to defined novel phenotypes, issues of causality between environmental and lifestyle determinants, intermediate phenotypes and clinical phenotypes (structural modelling, ..) or path way analyses in the field of genetics and gene environment interactions to take a few examples of research in progress by the various teams . Mastering efficiently a variety of new methods is a typical beneficial aspect of achieving a critical mass of resea rchers of a structure such as a EAL. (JM Ant\u00f3, X Basaga\u00f1a, J Garcia -Aymerich, JR Gonzales, , V Siroux, R Slama, R Varraso ). Social aspects. H e a l t h i n e q u a l i t i e s (and, symmetrically, the study of social inequalities in environmental exposures, related to the concept of environmental justice) is an area of major public health importance a n d of increasing recognition in the scientific arena. In the context of our EAL, inequalities in environmental health and interactions between environ mental and social factors are topics which deserved particular attention. These topics are seen as topics of large interest in CREAL LEA - Renewal 19/30 26/04/11 and in Villejuif, without major focus till now. The topic is related to the heterogeneous level of exposur e regarding occu pational and other environmental hazards , but also to other aspects of more recent interest in the respiratory field such as obesity. It has been listed as an area to be developped both a t CREAL and recommended by AERES for Inserm Villejuif. There is an in terest of various researchers and already available data in the cohorts constituted. Developing this area appears of public health relevance and well connected with developments in environmental epidemiology. It is planned to develop a collaborative progra m based on these aspects, with a first step based on a more systematic analysis of the data already collected in existing surveys . CREAL will host as visiting researcher Bruna Galobardes a well known social epidemiologist currently in Bristol. (JM Ant\u00f3, F Kauffmann , N Le Moual, R Varraso, M Vrijhel d). The strategy For the next period, the name of the EAL will be changed in International laboratory in respiratory and environmental epidemiology to underline the increasing importance of environmental epidemiology in the Inserm part, since the last application (and successful evaluation by AERES with A+ in both cases) of the two teams in their respective research cent ers (team 5 at U1018 and team 12 at U823 - s e e a p p e n d i x ) . A broader focus on environmen tal exposures will also allow to better capitalize the expertise of other scientists in CREAL a n d G r e n o b l e . Environment is considered as before in its broad sense, i.e. classical environmental factors such as occupational hazards, indoor exposures, and out door air pollution, as well as lifestyle factors such as smoking, nutrition or physical activity. No aspect included in the first application will be removed, but as shown above, extensions are considered at various levels, based on the current status of i ntegrated research b e t w e e n institutions, the international evolution of research questions and the extended interest of the greater number of scientists involved in the EAL for the next period. After having developed in the previous period a global collab orative approach going beyond the usual project by project initiative, the current strategy is at aiming to reach a critical mass . Increasing the number of scientists and a better integration of the capabilities of the involved teams will results in bett er capacity of developing long -term longitudinal projects and in a higher ca pacity of bringing new hypothese s and improved methods. The later will be achieved both b y concentration of the mutual strengths as well as th rough complementary initiatives. Such gl obal approach will strengthen our common research priorities on which the complementarit y of the different groups can be exploited in contribution to the development of respiratory and environmental epidemiology in Europe. The renewed LEA will increase t he visibility of the associated laboratories. Respiratory and environmental epidemiology are facing new challenges, which requires a major development at the international level. The EAL is now well -known internationally and has attracted several post docs. It is essential that respiratory epidemiology becomes an attractive area of research for young epidemiological scientists in Europe and elsewhere. Environmental epidemiology is a driving force in CREAL in Barcelona, an essential part of the Grenoble team and the \" environment and health \" axis of the Villejuif research center is coordinated by the Villejuif team leader. The EAL a l r e a d y appears an incentive for networking at a larger level a n d t h r e e s pecific collaborations illustrate such growing networking, with a major epidemiological research center in Switzerland (SWTH, N K\u00fcnzli), and two in United States (Arizona Respiratory Center, F Martinez and Harvard, C Camargo). In the three instances, there are already close collabora tions with both Inserm and CREAL including junior and senior researchers exchanges, publications and common grants applications. LEA - Renewal 20/30 26/04/11 The potential impact for knowledge in the field of life sciences The advancement of knowledge in the field of life sciences is at a crucial stage of transformation. On the one hand the explosion of \"omics\" technologies has been a marked advance in the understanding of the mechanisms of chronic diseases at the molecular and cellular level . However , at the same time, it has become apparent a greater need for translation of such knowledge in the understanding of the clinical expression and population health problems . Our research program is able to make significant contributions in this field. Regarding the research on the respiratory phenotypes our results should be useful to redefine the current paradigms of disease classification and diagnosis. New knowledge in this area is likely to have a major impact in both research and practice. In resea rch it may open new avenues for etiological and mechanistic research , w h i c h m a y l a t t e r h a v e a t r a n s l a t i o n i n t o n e w molecular and therapeutically targets. Our research on gene by environment interaction will benefit of high expertise on the crucial aspect of the assessment of environment, a too often neglected aspect31. Understanding the burden of the diseases in the societies and strengthening the scientific basis of prevention and protection policies is an important part of our program. Regarding environm ental determinants both cleaning exposures and air pollution are largely disseminated exposures in the communit y. A closer understanding of their e f f e c t s a n d m e c h a n i s m s of action is crucial for the improvement of the current health protection strategies. A better undert anding of the influence of water contamination, endocrine disruptors, o n respiratory morbidity and other outcomes is likely to have an important public health impact. 31 W i l d C P .

The number of environmental epidemiologists has increased, coherent with the change in the EAL t i t l e , i n p a r a l l e l w i t h t h e n u m b e r o f r e s p i r a t o r y e p i d e m i o l o gists and of chest physicians (two in 2007, one in Inserm and one in Creal ; now four , with two in Inserm and two in Creal) . Frequent short -term travel exchanges are key to maintain a dynamic collaboration and should be facilitated by an appropriate funding dedicated to the EAL functionning. Long visits of researchers are starting to take p lace. Are planned in particular of Nicole Le Moual in CREAL t o w o r k o n t h e o c c u p a t i o n t h e m e a n d B \u00e9 n \u00e9 d i c t e J a c quemin t o C R E A L t o d e v e l o p f u r t h e r collaboration on air pollution. Visits of researchers from CREAL at Inserm will be promoted as well. The exchange of post -doc is an essential aspect of the EAL and should be developped. In the previous period, there has been exchange based on one position both ways. To be noticed the first concerned have been recruited a t Inserm as CR1, showing the excellence of the candidates and of the framework of the EAL. The current post docs are developing programs explicitely based on combined projects (one on Villejuif and CREAL and one on CREAL and Grenoble). It is of crucial importance that the funding for postdocs is allocated up to a larger scale (2 x centers) in consistence with the wider focus of the EAL in the next period. Grant applications are increasi ngly applied by Inserm and CREAL researchers with the participation of the other institution. For now, besides EU (successful) funding, only ANSES in France allows that LEA - Renewal 22/30 26/04/11 the foreign partner can benefit of the budget and increasing such possibilities from national fundings would be useful. Nevertheless, even without funding, th e actual participation on the scientific project is likely to increase the success rate in national fundings, in particular in the current era where large collaborations are increasingly searched, not only on genetics, but also on phenotypic and environmental issues. Ethical issues raised by the project and the way they will be treated Ethical issues are of great interest for both institutions. A specific program is planned in the context of MedAll and a paper on \"Ethical challenges in gene environment interactions\" is in preparation by F Kauffmann and Anne Cambon (WP leader of ethics i n MedAll), a topic relevant for EAL w o r k in progress in the IAGO project. LEA - Renewal 23/30 26/04/11 D) Added value of the EAL/IAL (1 page) To what extend the EAL/IAL and its resources will be of any added value for the research proposal and to the career development of researchers involved in the project. 1) Access to cohorts/infrastructures. Access to cohorts/infrastructures will remain as an important asset of the EAL during the next period. CREAL has brought access to data from ECRHS and a stable platform for integrative and pooled analysis of ECRHS, EGEA and SAPALDIA studies is now well established. This will be an important source of analysis and publications during the next period. Analysis on gene by environment interaction and pathway analysis will be made possible through this collaboration. Inserm has facilitated for CREAL access to E3N cohort which is planning a respiratory module i n c l u d i n g s p irometry in the context of E4N (cohorts from the program \"Investissements d'avenir\"), a maj or extension over several generations of the population of women ascertained through E3N. Both labs will benefit by extending current studies on this unique population. MeDALL project (FP7; coordinators J Bousquet and Josep M Ant\u00f3) has made possible to include the largest pool of birth cohorts focusing on respiratory and allergy in Europe and will facilitate the acces s of the Inserm teams to the cohorts . Research o n biomarkers will be taken to a step forward with the ongoing collaboration of Inserm with CRE AL for several adult studies ( EGEA, ECRHS II and III ) as well as in the context of WP6 in MeDAL L. In all thes e initiatives Inserm will be benefited of CREAL access to infrastructures of PRBB including the Laboratory of Human Genetic Diseases, a multiplex platform for the assessment of targeted pro teomics and the Laboratory of Im munology. 2) Grants . The strategy applying new research proposal in collaboration will be strengthened in the next period. A new application to the FP7 EU environment c a l l , l e a d b y t h e I n s e r m t e a m ( J Bousquet) with the participation of CREAL i s now under evaluation (ClimALL, Climate change and allergy: Science to Policy) 3) Visibility and attractiveness . The EAL visibility and attractiveness will be reinforced with its extension for a new period. The EAL research programs will be increasingly known from the Inserm research centers (in particular in the context of the Environment and Health axis of the CESP/U1018 in Villejuif ) and in the Inserm respiratory epidemiology community, in the context of the biannual French - speaking (usually) respiratory epidemiology seminar coorganized by respiratory epidemiology teams from Inserm at Villejuif with Inserm U700 for more than 20 years. CREAL will host the world congress in environmental ep idemiology in September 2011 (ISEE 2011) making this a unique opportunity to make the EAL better known and attractive to new postdoctoral researchers. CREAL is a partner of a proposal to have PRBB centres recognized as an integrated health research centre by the ISC III (Ministry of Science and Innova tion of Spain) and F Kauf fmann has been invited to integrate its Scientific Advisory Boa rd. 4) Decrease in research fragmentation. Decrease in research fragmentation during the next period will be a consequence of the strategies alluded to above. Future work on several EAL programs, like phenotypes, biomarkers, genetics, among others, will sub stantially benefit of the EAL integrativ e structure and research being conducted by the researchers in both labs will be les s isolated. The scale of research fragmentation will also be reduced at the institutional level a s EAL provides a unique opportunity to share strategic plans for the future , something that has occurred in the past and that will be strengthened in the future. Following what has been initiated in the previous period, during the next EAL the decrease in research fragmentation will continue t hrough both new international resear ch applications and networks. ClimALL application (under evaluation) is an important example of propagating existing collaboration in childhood health researc h in CREAL (ENRIECO and CHICOS FP7 projects) into a new project (MeDALL) and form here to a new fi eld like climate change ( C l i m A L L ) . A closer collaboration of the EAL w i t h t w o o t h e r c e n t r e s i n B a s e l a n d Tucson is already taking place. The development of EAL is therefore an important node in the context of a wider networking in research in respiratory a nd environmental epidemiology .

This is a small, focused and structured group, with a strong leader in an international arena, with a long and successful track record of respiratory epidemiology that fits coherently with the well planned project for the new period (on respiratory effects of cleaning products, nu rsing, air pollution, dietary products and genes). The group research lies in either international collaborative projects or the French EGEA case- control that they lead. EGEA incorporates clinical, environmental, molecular and genetic epidemiology, collabo rating with other INSERM units. The group is evolving successfully with young researchers. Weaknesses: The group has limited teaching activity and a short record of PhD students; it is too small to face the high specialized technical challenges in the stat istical analysis (spatial statistics, genetic analysis) that probably would require external technical support, and does not take advantage of the life- course studies carried out at INSERM. Recommendations: The group needs to plan the new incorporation of new researcher, a senior with a long career, to fit successfully in their well structured project; the panel advise to incorporate psychosocial determinants; even though their record of publications is in the upper decile, they should plan how to capitaliz e in a more efficient way their production; a final recommendation refers to increase the number of PhD incorporations.

The research activities of the group on environmental epidemiology applied to fecundity and reproduction had a main focus on air polluti on. Because of widespread exposure and high burden carried by adverse reproductive outcomes, this topic is of major importance for public health. The group had the responsibility of a unique data collection on fertility in France, obtained important result s on adverse effects of air pollution on fetal growth, and also proposed important methodological improvements for assessing exposure to air pollutants. This junior Team published in top journals in environmental health (9 publications since the creation o f the group in 2008). The team is also strongly implicated with other groups for conducting large cohort studies that allow investigating birth outcomes in relation to environmental pollution. Appreciation on the impact, the attractiveness of the resear ch unit and of the quality of its links with international, national and local partners The group has strong potential in terms of attractiveness. The team leader is involved in teaching and training of students in national and international courses. He is a wellrecognized expert in environmental epidemiology and actively participates to scientific and non -scientific committees (organization of international workshop on air pollution and reproduction, president of the Programme National de Recherche sur l es Perturbateurs Endocriniens). The group has attracted one post -doc and a PhD student. Appreciation on the strategy, governance and life of the research unit The team has a clear strategy of developing activities on environmental epidemiology within th e IAB, and will extend its focus to respiratory diseases by the arrival of the asthma group, which was formerly part of Team 11 (results of the asthma group are evaluated separately). Appreciation on the project The new group will conduct important studies for the understanding of the relationships between environmental exposures and health, with focus on exposure assessment methodology, and the study of genetic or epigenetic pathways to characterize the role of e nvironment on reproductive function and respiratory health. Projects on epigenetic markers will be developed in collaboration with Team 6. The project of the team is based on solid experience of the team members in the field and strong partnerships with ot her groups at a national and international level. Conclusion Overall appreciation Overall, the appreciation of the visiting committee is excellent. The emergence of this research group may have a strong impact on the development of environmental epid emiology at a local and national LEA - Renewal 28/30 26/04/11 level, and may rapidly constitute a pole of attraction for new researchers in the field. Strengths and opportunities The group is very dynamic, focused, well -known at the national and international level, able to attrac t important national and international funding. Weaknesses and threats The main weakness of the group is the absence of senior scientists with an HDR which prevents the possibilities of development. The group may be a bit isolated in its field of exper tise at the IAB. The suggested link between epidemiology and cancer was not clear to the committee. Recommendations Attract more foreign post- docs and students with experience in epidemiology.
