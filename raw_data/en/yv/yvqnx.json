Baseline AIMS shall be completed under the following circumstances: a. upon recommendation for treatment with neuroleptic medication, prior to the administration of the drug; or b. inmates who are on neuroleptic medications upon arrival to DCC. 2. All inmates currently taking neuroleptic me dication shall be assessed at least once every six months, or more frequently as determined by the Psychiatrist/Psychiatric Certified Registered Nurse Practitioner (PCRNP). 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 3 - Physical Exams, Preventive Health Evaluations, and Clearance for Use of Force 3-5 Issued: 11/29/2016 Effective: 1/12/2017 3. Any inmate whose neuroleptic medicati on is discontinued s hall be screened at the following intervals: three months, or whenev er the Psychiatrist/PCRNP determines and documents the need for follow-up screening. NOTE : In rare instances, withdrawal movement disorders can emerge after three months following the discontinuation of a neuroleptic. This is more apt to occur following the use of a long acting, injectable neuroleptics. If movements are observed after the three month screening, the inmate shall be referred to the Psychiatrist/PCRNP for assessment. 4. The Psychiatrist/PCRNP may request more frequent AIMS exams based on the inmate's condition. 5. The AIMS examination ma y be completed by the Psychiatrist/PCRNP or licensed nurse who has been trained in this procedure. 6. When the AIMS test is performed by a Lic ensed RN, the results shall be reviewed by the Psychiatrist/PCRNP. 7. Only the Psychiatrist/PCRNP shall make a diagnosis of the presence of Tardive Dyskinesia. When such a diagnosis is made, t he Psychiatrist/PCRNP shall work with the inmate to determine the most appropriate c ourse of treatment, c onsidering both the effects of Tardive Dyskinesia and the inmate 's psychiatric condition. Action taken shall be fully documented in the inmate's medical record. F. Medical Clearances for Activities, Athl etic Programs, Employment, Food Service Workers, or Housing Restrictions (Gro und Floor, Lower Bunk, Single Cell, etc.) 10 1. At a minimum, the followin g procedures shall be conducted: a. a screening shall be completed by a practitioner during the inmate's initial examination. Clearances sha ll be ordered, documented in the progress notes, and the DOCNet Inmate Status App lication shall be updated; and b. subsequent assessments shall be perfo rmed during the inmate's preventive care evaluations, and all results/findings/updates shall be documented in the progress notes; the Inmate Status Application shall be updated to reflect changes in clearances. 2. Additional Criteria for Food Service Workers 11 a. An inmate, infected with a disease in co mmunicable form, capable of transmission by food, shall not work in a food services area. 10 4-4365 11 4-4322 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 3 - Physical Exams, Preventive Health Evaluations, and Clearance for Use of Force 3-6 Issued: 11/29/2016 Effective: 1/12/2017 b. Prior to assignment, an inmate shall be examined by a practitioner, and the results documented in the progress notes, as to s pecific health problems that shall prohibit him/her from working in the food service area: (1) open wounds; (2) acute respiratory infections; and (3) acute Hepatitis A (inmate with old Hepat itis A may work in food service when medically cleared). c. An inmate with a chronic disease (HIV, H epatitis B and C) may work in food service. G. Medical Screening for Inmate Candidates: SCI Quehanna Boot Camp and SCI Pine Grove (Youthful Offender Program [YOP]) 1. Introduction a. The goal of this medical screening program is to maximize the safe participation of inmates in the physical fitness progra ms of SCI Quehanna Boot Camp and SCI Pine Grove YOP. The goals of the pre-participation m edical evaluation are: (1) to identify medical problems associated with life-threatening complications during exercise; and (2) to identify medical conditions requi ring documentation that the patient is medically stable prior to partici pation in an exercise program. b. At the time of evaluat ion for placement at SCI Quehanna Boot Camp, and SCI Pine Grove YOP, a physician/PA/ CRNP, shall review the DC-471/DC-471A, New Reception/Parole Violator Return Screening Form (refer to Section 2 of this procedures manual), the physical examinatio n, comprehensive dental examination, and appropriate lab, Electro-Cardiogram (E CG), and x-ray reports to determine the inmate's medical eligibility for participat ion in these programs. The recommendations shall be recorded in the Progress Notes and the DC-440B, Supplemental Medical Screening for Inmate Candidates SCI Queh anna Boot Camp and SCI Pine Grove YOP (Attachment 3-F). c. Additional fitness testi ng may be required prior to clear ance for participation at the Boot Camp. d. There are medical conditions that are a ssociated with life threatening complications, and are considered disqualifying for high intensity exercise programs. Many of these are cardiovascular disorders and are associated with sudden death. The most common are: (1) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM); 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 3 - Physical Exams, Preventive Health Evaluations, and Clearance for Use of Force 3-7 Issued: 11/29/2016 Effective: 1/12/2017 (2) valvular heart disease (rheumatic hear t symptomatic mitral valve prolapse); (5) Marfan's syndrome; (6) atherosclerotic coronary heart disease; and (7) heart conduction abnormalities. These conditions can be difficult to detect in the medical evaluat ion process, and most athletes who die suddenly from these conditi ons have no symptoms. If suspected, the candidate should be evaluated by a cardio logist prior to the recommendation for participation in an exercise program. e. There are other medical c onditions that are not automatically disqualifying. Chronic medical conditions require evaluation and docum entation that they ar e stable (with or without medications) and the inmate is safe to fully participate in Boot Camp activities. If the medical status cannot be determined, a final decision on participation can be deferred, pending either furt her evaluation (e.g. echocardiogr am) or the correction of disqualifying abnormal findings (e.g. elevat ed blood pressure). Finally, inmates with acute injuries or illnesses may be deferred until the natural healing process has been completed (e.g. fractured fibula). Thes e include, but are not limited to: (1) cardiovascular disorder: (a) hypertension-(140/90) or great er, uncontrolled by medication within the past 30 days; (b) history of bacter ial endocarditis; (c) arrhythmias not controlle d within the past 30 days; (d) heart murmur not specifically clear ed by the physician as functional and benign; and (e) electrocardiographic abnormalities ot her than heart block, or cardiac enlargement. However, a referral to a cardiologist is not necessary whenever the findings ar e determined to be a normal variant. (2) an inmate with a chronic illness who is stabl e on medications or those receiving preventive therapy for TB may be processed if cleared by a physician; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 3 - Physical Exams, Preventive Health Evaluations, and Clearance for Use of Force 3-8 Issued: 11/29/2016 Effective: 1/12/2017 (3) an inmate with asthma or diabetes mellitus must be considered on an individual basis as to his/her ability to perfo rm rigorous physical activities (see Quehanna Boot Camp Physical Fitness Manual Ac tivities/Requirements, Attachment 3-G), his/her ability to adjust his/her medi cation as appropriate, and the medical facilities available at the Boot Camp; (4) an inmate with seizure disorders may be considered if he/she is controlled with medication and free of seizur es for six (6) months; (5) renal disorder: (a) single kidney - restrict ed from contact sports; (b) unexplained proteinuria; and (c) myoglobinuria. (6) hematologic disorders: (a) sickle cell disease (sickle cell trait is acceptable); (b) platelet abnormality; and (c) hemoglobin less than 10 grams. (7) symptomatic HIV; (8) acute communicable disease; (9) an inmate whose condition requires medical isolation; (10) active ulcerative colitis or In flammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn's Disease); (11) chronic pancreatitis; (12) significant abnormalities of liver function as determined by the physician or active hepatitis of any type (Hepatitis C treatment); (13) chronic pelvic inflammatory disease; (14) fever (> than 101.4); (15) history of heat related illness; (16) pregnancy and women within eight weeks postpartum; (17) malignancies; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 3 - Physical Exams, Preventive Health Evaluations, and Clearance for Use of Force healing fractures of any body part until healed. Special attention shall be made to the inmate's ability to perform Boot Ca mp exercises, as outlined in the Quehanna Boot Camp Physical Fi tness Manual Activities/Requirements; and (19) an inmate with a history of psychiatric illness, including eating disorders, must be evaluated and cleared by a psychiatrist as stable and able to function under the regulations of the Boot Camp. f. The DC-440B, shall be used by practitioners from the sending facility, to document the evaluation for placement in the physical fitness programs. 2. Medical History A thorough medical history is cr itical for detecting conditions that preclude, or restrict, participation in an exercise program. A comple te personal history, family history, and review of systems, can detect 80 percent of conditions that might restrict participation, or require further evaluation. When a practitioner screens an inmate for these programs, the medical history questionnaire shall be reviewed with the inmate. Important components of the medical history are: a. family history: (1) family history of cardiovascular di sease, sudden death, death at an age younger than 50; and (2) family history of hypertrophic cardio long history: cardiopulmonary (2) hypertension; (3) heart murmur; (4) diabetes; (5) seizures; (6) renal disease; (7) psychiatric disease; (8) heat related illness; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 3 - Physical Exams, Preventive Health Evaluations, and Clearance for Use of Force 3-10 Issued: 11/29/2016 Effective: 1/12/2017 (9) rapid increases or decreases in weight; (10) previous exclusion fr om sports for any reason; (11) prior surgery and complications; (12) loss of function in a paired organ (eye, testis, kidney, etc.); (13) current medications; (14) immunization history; (15) current pregnancy; and (16) menstrual history in female inmates. c. injury history: (1) past injuries with sequelae (pain, lim itations or impairm ents, etc.); and (2) head injuries with loss of consciousness. 3.

However, some inmates remain at the Reception Facility once they have been classified. In this inst ance, the Reception Facility becomes the Parent Facility. 2. The Parent Facility's responsibilities normally begin on either the 91 st day of incarceration or when the classification process is complete and the inmate is assigned to a Parent Facility, whiche ver occurs sooner. 3. Within 30 days of arrival to the Parent Facility, a dentist will review the dental treatment plan. If the treatment plan or any of the required documentation in Subsection A. 6.a-k above has not been completed, a dentist is required to gather the missing data. 6 C. Dental Services Provided by the Department7 Dental services shall be provided on a priority basis, as determined by a dentist. 1. Inmate's Refusal to Accept Recommended Dental Treatment a.

Foll ow-up with the staff member or inmate who was involved in an exposure to ensure that: (a) questions are directed to the appropriate personnel; (b) copies of reports are collected, including medical and other inform ation regarding an exposure to blood- borne pathogens. This information is maintained in a locked file in a secure area separate from personnel files; (c) procedures are explained for obtaining certification of significant exposure for staff members in accordance with the Confidentiality of HIV - Related Info rmation Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq ; and (d) subsequent to the exposure, the medical department shall provide appropriate intervention and referral s in accordance with Department policy 13.1.1 , Section 5 ; (3) maintain a list of staff trained to pr ovide HIV/AIDS P revention (post -test) Counseling; (4) provide educational materials as needed for the inmate population; (5) shall encourage the inmate to disclose HIV/AIDS related information to the Parole Officer to ensure appropriate follow -up care; and 3 (6) maintain a current list of community HIV/AIDS services .4 2. Transmission of HIV a. There is no evidence that HIV is transmitted by casual social contact with infected individuals. While HIV has been isolated in many body fluids, only blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk have been implicated in its transmission. Therefore, the routes of transmission are via: (1) intimate sexual contact; (2) sharing of needles and syringes contaminated with blood; (3) blood and blood products containing HIV; (4) prenatal transmission from mother to neonate (mother and 3 4-ACRS -4C-10 4 4-ACRS -4C-10 13.2.1, Section 8- 02 Bulletin Page 3 of 10 (5) possible transmission through mother's milk to infant. b. HIV is transmitted primarily through direct sexual contact involving exchange of implicated body fluids or through the exchange of blood from a person who is infected with HIV. HIV infection is also transmitted by shared needles contaminated with blood. Other evidence for transmission through blood products has been found in the occurrence of AIDS in hemophilia patients receiving clotting factors made from infected blood prior to 1985 . Although HIV has occasionally been found in very small quantities in the saliva, urine, feces, and tears of a few people with HIV infection, current evidence indicates that these body fluids are not vehicles of transmi ssion unless they contain visible blood. 3. Confidentiality 5 a. Any HIV-related information of a medical nature may not be revealed by a HCW or volunteer of the Department, unless authorized by the Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq., or other state or federal statute or regulation. Any written consent to disclosure of confidential HIV -related information shall include the various items and requirements as enumerated in the Confidentiality of HIV - Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq . b. Communication within the correctional facility shall not divulge an individual's HIV/AIDS diagnosis or medical condition, except to those who are authorized by the Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq . If written, such information is to be maintained in locked file drawers, compartments, or other secure space in accordance with Subsection G.3.f. below . c. A list of inmates with HIV/ AIDS shall not be posted, in accordance with this procedures manual. d. The D epartment's rules, regulations, and directives governing confidentiality shall apply in accordance with Department policy DC- ADM 003, \"Release of Information,\" and the Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq . e. Because of the nature of the disease, an HIV infected employee shall have understandable concerns over confidentiality and privacy in connection with medical documentation and other information about his/her condition. Officials who have access to such information are required to maintain the confidentiality of that information. Supervisors, managers, and others included in making and implementing personnel management decisions involving employees with HIV/AIDS shall strictly observe applicable privacy and confidentiality requirements as noted in Management Directive 505.26. f. The following procedures are to be adhered to regarding HIV /AIDS related information on a state employee or his/her dependents. 5 4-ACRS -4C-10, 5 -6A-4354, 5- 6C-4396 13.2.1, Section 8- 02 Bulletin Page 4 of 10 (1) If this information exists in a written form, it is not to be maintaine d in the employee's Electronic Official Personnel Folder ( eOPF ). It is to be maintained in a separate, locked file drawer, compartment, or other secure place with restricted access, under jurisdiction of the party who received the information (medical offi cer, health care coordinator, supervisor, etc.) or in the personnel office. If maintained in the personnel office, access is to be limited to the personnel officer and a designated custodian of sensitive personnel records. In all cases, the employee in question shall be informed of what written information is being maintained, where it is kept, and security provisions for its release in accordance with the Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq . (2) Access to HIV/ AIDS related inf ormation in employee records is to be limited to only those parties who are the original recipients of that information, those designated individuals in the personnel office, and those who have been pre-approved through written consent by the affected empl oyee , unless there is a medical emergency that requires an immediate response. Copies shall not be made of records, which identify a Department employee's HIV/ AIDS status. (3) HIV/AIDS related information is not to be forwarded to future employers should the employee change jobs, unless the release of such information has been pre-approved in writing by the affected employee. (4) Paperwork containing HIV/ AIDS related information on an employee that must be processed through a chain of parties , such as work -related disability forms, are to be handled with strict confidentiality. The employee in question must be informed of how these forms are processed. If possible, agencies shall restrict the routing of these forms, processing them directly from the employee's immediate supervisor to the personnel office. g. Confidentiality restrictions on written HIV /AIDS related information also apply to the verbal communication of that information. If a supervisor, co- worker, or other state employee learns information on a Department employee's possible HIV/AIDS condition, that information is not to be communicated to other state employees or members of the public. Unless there is a specific need to do so, verbally communicated information on a state employee's HIV/AIDS status shal l not be converted to a written record. 4. Identification/Surveillance 6 a. There shall be no involuntary HIV testing of an inmate of the Department except as provided in the Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq. This Act establ ishes criteria for routine and mandated testing. See Department policy 13.1.1, Section 5. b. HIV testing shall be offered at the home facility in conjunction with Hepatitis C testing on an \"opt -out\" basis. \"Opt -out\" testing requirements are as follows: 6 5-6A-4354 13.2.1, Section 8- 02 Bulletin Page 5 of 10 (1) the inmate is notified that HIV testing will be performed as part of normal intake testing; (2) he/she is provided the required educational material that includes an explanation of the test, including its purpose, potential uses, limitations , and the meaning of its results; and NOTE: A nurse may provide this explanation during routine intake testing with the DC -555, PA Department of Corrections Education f or HIV Testing. (3) if the inmate declines testing at that time, he/she is required to sign a DC - 462, Release from Responsibility for Medical Treatment . c. Otherwise, HIV testing shall only be ordered by a practitioner . The order must be based upon the inmate's current medical history and clinical signs and symptoms. Inmate requests for testing shall be routinely approved, even if the inmate does not admit to high- risk behavior , but testing more frequently than every six months shall be performed only in exceptional circumstances. A program is to be instituted at each Corrections facility to encourage an inmate to voluntarily be tested for HIV if there is no documentation of HIV testing during the current incarceration so that those who are infected can receive appropriate early counseling and treatment. If an inmate does not request an HIV test , but has exhibited ear ly symptoms of HIV illness or high -risk behavior, the practitioner may order an HIV test with documentation of the inmate's consent in the DC -472, Progress Note . The practitioner shall provide an explanation of the test, including its purpose, potential us es, limitations, and the meaning of its results. 7 d. The inmate shall receive an explanation of the test, including its purpose, potential, uses, limitations, and the meaning of its results (DC -555) prior to the HIV test. He/she shall be offered an interpret er if needed and given ample time to ask questions. The Language Line Services (through the Business Office) will be used for interpretation. The inmate must sign a DC- 462 if refusing any specific testing . e. Testing protocols recommended by the CDC shall be followed. T he practitioner may order additional tests to determine the proper staging and classification of infection . 8 f. Post-test counseling (1) The results of all HIV screening tests, positive and negative, will be reviewed with the patient. This may be s cheduled with either a provider or a nurse who has completed the HIV counseling training from the Department. (a) For positive results, counseling shall be in compliance with all CDC and Pennsylvania DOH guidelines and protocols, as well as requirements outli ned in the Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq. Documentation of this encounter shall be made in the DC-472 of the health record and shall include the rationale for testing, 7 5-6A-4357, 4- ACRS- 4C-10 8 5-6A-4357 13.2.1, Section 8- 02 Bulletin Page 6 of 10 discussions with the inmate, and plans for manag ement of the condition. The patient shall be enrolled in the HIV Chronic Care Clinic where treatment will be ordered by an HIV specialist.9 (b) For patients with a negative result, it will need to be determined if the testing occurred during a six -month post -exposure window that would warrant a repeat test. (2) Psychiatry and/or psychological services shall be offered to inmates with positive test results and documented in the health record. (3) Pennsylvania DOH shall be notified by the facility I CN of this reportable disease and partner notification services shall be offered . (4) Housing plans for an inmate having a positive test result shall be handled on a case -by-case basis, using medical and security considerations . Under ordinary circumstances, an inmate that is k nown to be HIV positive shall be housed with general population. (5) If an inmate is paroled or released before the test results are known, when the test results do return , a notation must be made in the medical record by the physician reviewing the test results. The test results shall be forwarded to the Pennsylvania DOH who shall provide appropriate notification/ counseling. 5. Treatment 10 a. Department programs serving those with HIV/AIDS infection shall address the special needs of this population. The inmate may face stigma and discrimination. He/s he may be coping with physical deterioration and the psychological and social impact of having a fatal disease. The Department has an obligation to provide adequate medical care for every inmate including those with HI V/AIDS , including following the latest CDC and other federal guidelines and protocols, where available, for patient diagnosis and treatment. b. The practitioner shall complete his/her assessment using professional judgment and current HIV diagnostic procedur es. Past and present historical data from the inmate and from the inmate medical record shall be consulted. Information that the practitioner shall consider includes: (1) demographic data; (2) risk factors (IV drug abuser, h omosexual and heterosexual high- risk sex, hemophilia transfusions, other transfusion Section 8- 02 Bulletin Page 7 of 10 (3) history of symptoms: fatigue, fever, anorexia, malaise, depression, dyspnea, persistent diarrhea, night sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and shortness of breath; (4) particular attention shall be paid to history and/or current evidence of: (a) drug abuse; (b) assaultive behavior; (c) indiscriminate sexual behavior; and/or (d) victimization. (5) the practitioner performing a physical exam shall give special attention to: (a) lymphadenopathy; (b) oral changes; (c) candidiasis; (d) mental status changes; (e) rashes and/or skin changes; (f) rales in lungs; (g) weight loss; (h) fever; (i) jaundice; and (j) track marks. 6. Inmate Care Statement a. There is no evidence that the risks in providing direct care to an inmate infected with HIV are any greater than those associated with caring for any other sick person. Therefore, a healthy HCW shall not be excused, on his/her own request, from providing care to these inmates. A HCW, who believes he/she may be at increased risk because he/she is immunosuppressed or have other clinical conditions that may confer an increased risk of acquiring an infection, shall discuss his/her concerns with his/her supervisor. These cases s hall be evaluated on an individual basis in cons ultation with correctional administration and the HCW's physician. Claims by the HCW must be supported by written medical documentation. 13.2.1, Section 8- 02 Bulletin Page 8 of 10 b. Specific guidelines for the care of an inmate infected with HIV are outlined in Section 16-QI Plan, Appendix 16 -B, Chapter 02 HIV of this procedures manual . 7. HIV/AIDS in the Workplace a. The provisions of this section are in accordance with Management Directive 505.26. If more detailed information is needed, the Directive may be referenced. b. A Department employee and a job applicant with HIV/AIDS infection, or those perceived to have these conditions, shall not be discriminated against with regard to appointment, transfer, promotion, or any other employment or personnel action. Under no circumstance can an appointing authority require a current or prospective state employee to receive an HIV antibody test, or reveal the results of a previous test or diagnosis, as a condition of employment. Should the Department learn of a current or prospective state employee's HIV/AIDS infection , that information shall not be used regarding employment or personnel actions except where the employee concurs. c. In the event a Department employee with HIV/AIDS is unable to physically carry out his/her job duties, he/she shall be afforded the same considerations as any other employee whose illnesses prevent him/her from fully performing his/her job. Because of the episodic nature of the secondary illnesses which affect persons with AIDS, an employee may request reasonable accommodations which shall allow him/her to work with his/her handicap. Such requests shall be supported by appropriate documentation from the employee's physician. These requests are to be honored where operationally feasible, based on the job setting involved and the resources of the facility. An employee with HIV/AIDS infection who request s a transfer or a lateral or downward reclassification because of his/her medical condition shall have these requests considered, consistent with facility needs, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Management Directive 505.7 . d. An employee who refuses or objects to working with a co- worker, inmate, client, or member of the public having, or perceived to have, HIV/AIDS infection shall be counseled and educated in: (1) how the virus is, and is not, transmitted in the workplace; and (2) the Commonwealth's Management Directive 505.26 and this procedures manual on AIDS in the workplace. e. Should the employee continue to refuse to work with those individuals, the employee may be subject to appropriate progressive discipline, up to and including dismissal. f. Department policy prohibits discrimination against persons with, or perceived to have, HIV/AIDS infection. Complaints about alleged discrimination against a n employee or prospective employee may be addressed to the agency Equal Employment Officer. g. In addition, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act 43 P.S. \u00a7951 et seq . has been interpreted to cover discrimination against individuals with, or perceived to h ave, HIV/AIDS infection. Discrimination based on HIV/AIDS infection is prohibited in 13.2.1, Section 8- 02 Bulletin Page 9 of 10 employment in Pennsylvania. Any person wishing to file discrimination complaints with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) should contact the PHRC regional o ffice in his/her geographical area. 8. Case Reporting In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, both HIV and AIDS are required to be reported to the DOH. CHCA/designee is responsible for this function. 9. HIV/AIDS Discharge Care a. The purpose of HIV/AIDS Discharge Care is as follows: (1) coordinate effective care and access supportive services for HIV positive individuals as they transition out of correctional facilities back to their communities; (2) prepare HIV positive inmates for community reintegration and conver sely prepare communities (AIDS service organizations, social workers, health care workers, housing, etc.) for transitioning these inmates into needed services; and (3) the transition shall be achieved through a collaborative relationship between the following agencies , but not limited to: Pennsylvania DOH, Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (DHS ), and seven Regional AIDS Planning Coalitions. b. The procedures below shall be followed regarding HIV/AIDS Discharge Care: (1) the ICN shall serve as the point of contact between the Department, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (PBPP), and the seven Reg ional AIDS Planning Coalitions; (2) the ICN/designee shall notify HIV/AIDS positive inmates of the existence of the Discharge Care Initiative Program and eligibility. The ICN shall confirm the inmate's anticipated release date and explain the transitional planning to the inmate prior to his/her release. Inmate education shall include the following: (a) the completion of a DC -108(a), Authorization for Rele ase of Information is required prior to inmate contact with Case Manager (telephone or telemedicine); and (b) the DC-108 signed by the inmate, carries a timeframe of 180 days . (3) if the inmate refuses to communicate via teleconferencing or videoconferencing with th e Case Manager, the ICN shall document the refusal on the DC-462, and on the DC-472; (4) when the inmate agrees to participate in the Discharge C are Initiative, the ICN shall notify the Regional AIDS Planning Coalition representative in the appropriat e inmate discharge area; 13.2.1, Section 8- 02 Bulletin Page 10 of 10 (5) the Regional AIDS Planning Coalition representative shall send the Regional Agency's discharge pl anning forms to the ICN for the inmate's signature. The physician must sign the Employability Form. The signed Discharge Pl anning Form shall be faxed or emailed to the Regional Agency; (6) ICN facilitates contact with the Regional AIDS Planning Coalition's Case Manager. This contact may be by phone or teleconferencing, as feasible; (7) the ICN shall confirm with the Regional AIDS Planning Coalition's Case Manager that all forms and service care plans are in place for each inmate; (8) the ICN shall document the results of this encounter on the DC -472; and (9) on the day of discharge, the inmate receives a supply of HIV medications dependent upon the type of discharge according to the Inmate Transfer Logistics Grid located in the resources section of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) . 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-1 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 2017 Section 8 Infection Control1 A. Regulations of Communicable and Non -Communicable Diseases The Corrections Health Care Administrator (CHCA) shall ensure: 1. compliance with regulations established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania governing the reporting of communicable diseases (Pa Code, Title 28, Chapter 17) ;2 2. notification to specific Divisions of Health is made and documented as stipulated in the guidelines; 3. the Infection Control Nurse (ICN) notifies the Bureau of Health Care Services ( BHCS ) Infection Control staff of the index case; 4. the facility medical department follows the treatment guidelines established by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH); 5. the facility medical staff shall document on the DC- 472, Progress Not es (See 13.1.1, \"Management and Administration of Health Care Procedures Manual,\" Section 5 - Occupational Exposure to Blood -borne Pathogens, Attachment 5- D), in the inmate's medical record the treatment offered to the inmate, as well as when the DOH was notified; and 6. appropriate isolation and quarantine guidelines are followed. B. Contagious Disease Notification 1. A contagious disease is an illness that is caused by a specific infectious agent (virus) that can be transmitted by blood and body fluids from an infected person to a susceptible person. The following diseases require blood/body fluid precautions: a. Arthropodborne viral fevers; b. -Jacob; d. Hepatitis B (including HbsAG carriers); Hepatitis anti -HCV titer); 1 4-ACRS -4C-09 2 4-4354 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-2 Relapsing fever; and Syphilis (primary and secondary). 2. Responsibilities The CHCA/designee shall: a. maintain an accurate list of inmates who have been diagnosed with a contagious disease that requires blood and body fluid precautions; b. ensure the information is maintained in a secure location; c. ensure that any employee may be advised, upon request, whether an inmate under his/her care, custody, and control has a communicabl e disease. This information shall also be provided in cases where there has been an occupational exposure to blood and/or other bodily fluids; d. maintain a Contagious Disease List Log (Attachment 8- A) which documents the nature of each request (for general information or because of a specific incident involving exposure to body fluids), and have the employee who reviews the list sign and date the log; e. ensure that no employee is permitted to photocopy or hand copy the communicable disease list; and f. advise each individual who reviews the list that, according to the concept of Universal/Standard Precautions, all human blood and body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and other blood -borne pathogens. Universal/S tandard Precautions shall be observed to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. Under circumstances where fluid is difficult or impossible to identify (mixture of oil and body fluids), this fluid shall be considered potential ly infectious material. C. Employee Tuberculosis (TB) Control 1. Tuberculosis Information 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-3 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 a. TB is caused by a bacterium, M. tuberculosis , that is transmitted in airborne particles of five microns or less in size. These airborne particles are produced when a pers on who has TB Disease ( TBD) of the lung or larynx shouts, sings, coughs, or otherwise exhales forcibly. TB infection occurs when another person inhales small airborne particles containing the TB organism. b. Every Department employee has some risk of occupat ional exposure to TB. This risk is greatest for health care workers and employees working on medical units, transportation, or on hospital coverage. c. TB infection is effectively prevented by the use of administrative controls, engineering and work practice controls, and by the use of personal protective devices. Administrative controls include policies to ensure the rapid detection, isolation, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of persons likely to be infected with TB. Engineering controls refer to proper ly designed and maintained isolation rooms and areas for cough- inducing procedures. Work practice controls are measures, which workers can use to minimize the duration of exposure to a work hazard when rooms are in use. Examples relevant to TB control incl ude keeping isolation room doors closed, organizing tasks to reduce the number and duration of trips into isolation rooms, and the use of personal protective devices. These measures reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of TB transmission. d. Most people infected with the M. tuberculosis do not have any symptoms or signs of the disease. His/Her infection can only be detected with the TB skin test. This test, more properly called a Mantoux test, involves the injection of a substance called Purified Protein De rivative (PPD) into the skin. Persons with a positive test are likely to be infected with the TB organism. Such persons receive a direct benefit by learning of his/her infection, because treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) can significantly r educe the person's chance of ever progressing to actual TB D. e. A person w ith HIV infection or immune system compromise is at increased risk to develop TBD if he/she becomes infected. Any employee with serious health conditions should ask his/her private phy sician whether he/she has increased risk from TB infection. 2. Responsibilities a. Central Office (1) BHCS, Chief of Clinical Services shall: (a) ensure the development and annual review and revision of the Tuberculosis Control Plan, as well as the Annual Operati ons Inspection in accordance with Department policy 6.3.1 , \"Facility Security;\" (b) determine the risk assessment for work areas in the Department; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-4 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (c) in functions such as: i.

The DC-514 shall be used as a reference in the event of a manufacturer recall of test solution; (f) training/review is provided to health care staff as well as other facility staff in accordance with Department policy 5.1.1, \"Staff Development and Training,\" and that a current list of employees who have received training is maintained; and (g) asymptomatic inmate converters shal l be reported as they are identified to the BHCS Infection Control staff by using the DC-469. (4) Department and Vendor Medical Staff shall: (a) comply with the Department's TB control program to ensure rapid detection, isolation, diagnostic evaluation, and t reatment of persons suspected of having TB; 5 and (b) perform employee TSTs , inform employees of test results, and provide test records to the ICN. (5) Every Department and Facility Employee shall: (a) comply with the Department's Tuberculosis Control Plan; (b) use engineering controls and personal protective equipment when indicated; and 5 4-ACRS -4C-08 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-7 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (c) submit to TST and follow -up evaluation as indicated by the Screening Program and the BHCS Information Control staff/ICN. 3. Risk Assessment - Employee Assessment of risk of infection/disease shall be based on the time spent with the inmate population. The risk assessment in terms of an employee being exposed or possibly becoming infected with TB is generally broken down into four categories. The categories are: a. No Risk - No TST needed. This person has NO contact or very limited contact with inmates. Examples are: (1) a person who fills the vending machine; (2) a construction worker; (3) a volunteer who comes into the facility and is with the inmate less than two days/month; or (4) a consulting physician. b. Low Risk - Annual TST needed. Examples are: (1) a volunteer who comes into the facility and works with the inmates two or more days/week and/or several weeks/month; or (2) contact staff who work with the inmates two or more days/week. NOTE: Most positions in the Department are associated with a low risk of TB transmission. Positions not designated below as intermediate or high risk are considered as low risk. An employee in a low risk position must have TST results documented no less oft en then every 12 months. c. Intermediate Risk - annual TST needed: Health care workers, security staff permanently assigned to medical units, medical transport personnel, and hospital coverage (outside and infirmary) are in inter -mediate risk. Staff in the se positions must have documented TST results no less often than annually . d. High Risk Staff working in areas with: (1) a significantly higher skin test conversion rate compared to other work areas; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-8 Issued: 2017 (2) a cluster of conversions; or (3) other evidence of transmission of TB. NOTE : The facility Medical Director in conjunction with the Chief of Clinical Services and the local Department of Health shall determine when conditions for designation as a high- risk area have been met. Staff working in a high risk area must have the TST conducted and results documented every three months until the final significant exposure is determined at which time the risk assessment shall be re- defined. 4. Tuberculosis Screening Program a. Every employee, as well as others working in Department facilities, must have a TST at a frequency determined by the risk assessment for his/her work area as outlined in the Risk Assessment Guidelines in Subsection C.3. above . b. The TST test shall be completed according to the Skin Testing for Tuberculosis (Attachment 8 -E), and Classification of Reactions to the Tuberculin PPD (Attachment 8 -F). c. The test result must be read and recorded 48- 72 hours after administration. If the TST is not read within 48 -72 hours after administration, the test must be repeated. A positive TST is determined by 10 or more millimeters induration except in those situations outlined on the Classification of Reactions to the Tuberculin PPD, where a reading of >5 millimeters induration is read as a positive PPD. d. An employee with a documented prior positive TST response shall not be retested. He/She is permanently exempt from TB skin testing requirements. If Department staff at a Department site did not perform the prior positive test, the employee must provide, on a one- time-only basis, written documentation describing the date, type, and measured response for his/her positive skin test and chest x -ray (CXR). For purposes of tuberculosis screening, including after a positive TST, a single Posterior Anterior (PA) view is requ ired, a lateral view is not necessary. Only Mantoux test results can be accepted. CXR results are also required for this documentation. Employees unable to provide this documentation shall be retested in order to validate the history. e. New employees must have a current, valid Mantoux test result at the time of employment.6 Employee Situation Required Action (1) Employee with documented - Accept able from any date, or provided positive TST as outlined above. 6 4-4386 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-9 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (2) Employee with documented - Acceptable - shall require a single negative TST within the past step upon employment 12 months (3) Employee with a documented - Acceptable - no further testing required negative TST within the last to begin employment three months (4) Employee with NO documented - Required to have a two- step TST TST within the past 14 months (5) Two Step TST Procedure (a) First test is negative - Second test administered one to three weeks after negative initial TST result is obtained.

Employees Who Convert to Positive TST (1) Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) (a) An employee who has a hist ory of past negative TST results, and who, upon annual testing, or at anytime converts to a positive TST , shall not be referred for an annual TST in the future. The employee is now considered a 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 2017 positive reactor ( TST) and shall now be monitored and treated according to the procedures contained in Subsection C.4.k. above . (b) An employee who converts from a negative to a positive TST , shall, in the absence of symptoms of active TBD , be given 14 calendar days to provide documentation from his/her own physician certifying a negative CXR (copy of report) and freedom from TBD on the DC- 554. Failure to do so shall result in suspension, in accordance with Department policy 4.1.1 unless there are known extenuating circumstances that warrant other action. (2) Suspect or Active TB An employee with a new positive TST who exhibits a productive cough or other symptoms of TBD must be excluded from the workplace. This exclusion shall be maintained if his/her physician has diagnosed suspected or confirmed TBD until he/she is deemed to be non- infectious by his/her physician or the DOH. The physician or DOH shall document on the DC- 554 (Attachment 8- G) that the employee is not contagious and is currently under treatment. (a) the ICN shall contact the BHCS Infection Control staff; (b) the BHCS Infection Control staff shall direct the ICN to contact the DOH and report the active case; and (c) the DOH shall direct the contact investigation at the facility. 5. Employees Involved in a Contact Investigation a. Anyone who shared the same air wit h a known case of infectious disease for a sufficient amount of time (minimum eight - 12 hours/day - seven days/week is spent with an inmate) is at risk for tuberculosis infection. b. The contact investigation concerning the employee or any other individual s shall be conducted in accordance with this policy, and the procedures contained in Subsection D.9.b. below . 6. Employee Protection a. Every staff member coming in contact with a known or suspected case of infectious tuberculosis must wear an N -95 mask approv ed by the Department at all times while in the same room as the inmate. Staff assigned to these areas shall receive training regarding the fit and use of the filtration/respirator devices in accordance with Department policy 15.1.1, concerning respirator f itness. b. Transportation of an inmate with known or suspected infectious TB shall be con - ducted in accordance with the security precautions in Department policy 6.3.1, and in 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and wear N95 respirators, and the inmate must wear a surgical facemask. 7.

Tasks in TB Control - the facility ICN shall be responsible for the following: a. There are four general tasks in the system of TB control. This section considers each task as it applies to tuberculosis infection and to TBD to include:7 (1) prevention; (2) detection; (3) containment; and (4) treatment. b. Each facility must designate one staff person to coordinate these activities. This generally shall be the nurse responsible for infection control. This person shall consult and coordinate activities with the BHCS Infection Control staff, and local public health officials. 2. Prevention a. Prevention of TB infection is accomplished by detecting and containing an inmate with TBD before he/she spreads the disease to others. This is di scussed in Subsection D.8. below . 7 4-4355 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-13 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 b. Prevention of TBD in an inmate with infection is covered in Subsection D. 11. below . 3. New Reception Transfer and TB Control The BHCS has established guidelines to facilitate the new reception transfer programs and maintai n TB control. A Diagnostic and Classification Center (DCC) inmate entering any facility shall be assessed for signs /symptoms of TB upon reception. The following process has the approval from the Pennsylvania DOH/TB Control Program: a. If symptomatic: The inmate shall be placed in a negative pressure room and further evaluated in accordance with this procedures manual. b. If asymptomatic, the inmate: (1) shall be housed separately; (2) may go to mainline as part of a group to eat, NOT with general population; (3) needing medical services: (a) as many services as possible shall be taken to this designated block; (b) if the inmate needs to be transported to the medical department for a service (wound dressing, etc.), he/she shall be escorted at a time when there are few general population inmates in the department. No mask shall be necessary for this inmate or staff; and (c) if the inmate experiences a sudden medical emergency and needs to be transported to the medical department, there is no need for an inmate or staff to w ear a mask. (4) In this new reception transfer group shall receive his/her TST and CXR at the DCC facility. c. The DC-544, New Reception Transfer Medical Intake Questionnaire (refer to Section 2, Attachment 2- C) shall include questions on: (1) a history of T BD; (2) past positive TST; and (3) signs/symptoms of TB D. 4. Detection of Tuberculosis Infection with TST 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-14 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 a. Every new reception or parole violator shall be screened for the presence of tuberculin reactivity with a TST upon entry or reentry into Department cus tody, and at least annually thereafter.8 An inmate staying in a reception facility less than seven days shall receive initial screening through the DC- 544. Positive responses on the DC-544 shall result in referral to the Medical Department. The inmate shal l be isolated in respiratory isolation until cleared by the Medical Department. b. A new reception inmate staying in a facility more than seven days shall receive a full medical evaluation in accordance with Section 2, Initial Intake and Screening and Medica l Clearance for Transfer of this procedures manual, including a TST and a CXR. c. Initial screening shall consist of a two- step Mantoux TST and a screening CXR. For purposes of tuberculosis screening, including after a positive TST, a single Posterior Anteri or (PA) view is required, a lateral view is not necessary. Further testing may be indicated upon contact with a known case of tuberculosis. Single step testing is acceptable if there is documentation of a negative TST within the past 12 months. 5. Housing and Group Movements for newly Received Inmates During Screening for TB Infection or Disease (includes PVs and Authorized Temporary Absences [ATAs]) a. If the inmate is symptomatic (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, fever, or diaphoresis) he/she shall be placed in a negative pressure room and further evaluated in accordance with this procedures manual. b. If asymptomatic, the inmate: (refer to Bulletin #1) (1) shall be housed separately until cleared for general population. (Each facility shall establish a local housing policy for a new inmate who is not medically cleared as to TB, based upon security issues and physical layout of the facility); (2) may go to mainline as part of a group to eat, NOT with general population; (3) needing medical services: (a) as many services as p ossible shall be taken to this designated block; (b) if the inmate needs to be transported to the medical department for a service (wound dressing, etc.), he shall be escorted at a time when there are few general population inmates in the Department. No mask shall be necessary for this inmate or staff; (c) if the inmate experiences a sudden medical emergency and needs to be transported to the Medical Department, there is no need for the inmate or staff to wear a mask; 8 4-4355 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-15 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (d) if it is decided the inmate is medical ly cleared to travel to SCI Camp Hill, he shall receive the appropriate TST at SCI Camp Hill. This shall be one step or two steps depending on the length of time since his last documented PPD. He shall also have a CXR performed; and (e) if the inmate must r emain at the receiving facility to be medically cleared, and shall not be leaving for an extended period of time, he shall receive the appropriate PPD (one step or two steps) depending on the length of time since his last documented PPD. He shall also have a CXR performed. (4) If newly received (includes PVs and ATAs ) and being screened for TB by a two - step, Mantoux TST , may be moved to general population after the: (a) first step PPD is negative; and (b) the screening CXR is within normal limits and there is no suspicion of TB as indicated by x -ray. c. In general, newly received inmates may be transferred to SCI -Camp Hill or Muncy if: (1) the first step PPD is negative; and (2) the screening CXR is within normal limits and there is no suspicion of TB as indicated by x -ray. 6. Testing Frequency a. Routine TST is performed annually, except as specified below: (1) an inmate working in a health services area shall have TST every six months; and (2) an HIV positive inmate shall have TST every six months. b. An inmate transferring to a Community Corrections Center (CCC) shall have TST two weeks before transfer, if he/she has not been tested within 12 months prior to transfer. If the inmate is found to be out of compliance by the ICN/designee at the support facility, the ICN/designee m ust contact the CCC Director or the CCC Contract Facility Coordinator at the regional office to report the need for the inmate's annual TST. It is acceptable to have an alternate certified health care facility conduct the test. The CCC Direc tor or Contract Facility Coordi nator at the regional office is responsible for sending the results of the test to the ICN at the support facility for input into the TB tracking system. In the event that an inmate is received in the CCC from a State Correctional Facility who is in need of his/her annual TST , it is acceptable to have the inmate return to the support facility for testing or an alternate certified health care 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-16 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 facility. Documentation of that result must be forwarded to the support facility's Medical Department .9 c. If an inmate out on ATA was held in another facility, he/she shall not need a CXR upon return to his/her home facility. TB screening shall be performed as appropriate according to the schedule already established for the inmate. Housing and group movem ent procedures shall be followed in accordance with Subsection D.5. above . d. A facility must immediately skin test any inmate who arrives on transfer without a TST result within the previous 12 months, or documentation of a past positive. Housing and group movement procedures shall be following in accordance with Subsection D.5. above . e. Only an inmate with a health care professional's written documentation of prior Mantoux skin test reactivity or TBD shall be excused from testing. Documentation fr om the DOH or the Department is acceptable. This inmate shall be required to have an annual review. f. The TST shall be done according to the guidelines in Skin Testing for Tuberculosis and Classification of Reactions to the Tuberculin PPD . g. The test result must be read and recorded 48- 72 hours after application. If the TST is not read within 48 -72 hours, it must be repeated. h. A pregnant inmate is required to have a TST . An assessment of signs/ symptoms is required for a pregnant inmate who is past positive, by history, on her TST testing. The DC-469 must be completed and filed in the medical record. i. Neither BCG vaccination, nor lactation are contraindications for TST . These inmates shall receive an annual PPD. j. Any inmate with a positive TST shall be encouraged to be tested for HIV infection. k. Known TST reactors need not undergo repeated testing or annua l CXRs . The health care professional (physician, physician assistant [PA], registered nurse [RN], licensed practical nurse [LPN]) shall question the inmate regarding symptoms of TB on an annual basis. The findings shall be documented on the DC- 469 in the medical record and entered in the automated inmate TB tracking system. The health care professional shall counsel the inmate to promptly report any symptoms of TBD to the medical department. 7. Refusal of Testing a. An inmate who refuses to have TST or symptom review is to be counseled about the importance of the test. If he/she continues to refuse, he/she MUST be 9 4-ACRS -4C-08 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-17 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 kept in Administrative Custody (AC) in accordance wi th Department policy DC- ADM 802 , \"Administrative Custody Procedures\" (total time in AC is 30 days). When the 30 days have elapsed, the inmate shall be educated in the importance of the TST, he/she shall be examined, a symptom review completed , CXR done and chest auscultation before release to the general population. This is an administrative decision, not a medical one. b. A DC- 462, Release from Responsibility for Medical Treatment (refer to Section 1, Attachment 1- F) must be completed and filed in the medica l record. c. An inmate who refuses TST need not be placed on medical hold; however, he/she can only be transferred between Department facilities if he/she is documented to be without symptoms of TB at the time of transfer. Receiving Department facilities must be informed that the inmate being transferred is in AC status and is refusing TST. d. A CXR shall be performed prior to transferring the inmate into AC status. A single Posterior Anterior (PA) view is required, a lateral view is not necessary. e. An inmate in AC status must be asked by nurses to reconsider having the test every day for the first week, then once a week for the remainder of the 30 days. An inmate in AC status can agree to have the test at any time, and does not have to wait until he/she is next scheduled to be asked to reconsider. Each encounter must be recorded in the medical record. f. The inmate shall be educated in the importance of the annual TST. He/she shall be handled as a past positive and receive an annual TB review. g. An inmate that cont inues to refuse the symptom review or physical exam at the end of the 30 days shall be referred to BHCS for further instructions. 8. Detection of Tuberculosis Disease (TBD) a. The determination for the management of a suspect case of TB D is to be based solely on the likelihood of the presence of exposure and/or active disease. Psychiatric or other medical specialty diagnoses do not override the management of any case or suspected case of TB exposure or disease, and an exception to this is only to be made by the BHCS, Chief of Clinical Services or Assistant Medical Director(s). The on-site Medical Director has the responsibility and authority to make treatment decisions for each case under this policy unless an exception to the policy is indicated. b. If there is a need to screen an inmate for pulmonary or laryngeal TB, as determined by the on -site Medical Director, the inmate is to be placed in respiratory/airborne isolation in a negative pressure room. Three morning sputum specimens shall be collected and sent f or Acid -Fast Bacillus (AFB) smear and culture. The use of aerosolized saline may be needed to produce an adequate specimen. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-18 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 c. The initial evaluation of an inmate suspected of having TBD shall consist of a 2 -view CXR ( posterior -anterior and lateral view s are necessary) and at least three morning sputum specimens sent for AFB smear and culture. Sputum collection may only occur in respiratory/airborne isolation rooms, early morning specimens, and done on consecutive days. Staff assisting in the collection must w ear an N -95 mask approved by the Department at all times while in the same room as the inmate. A court order must be sought to compel a CXR and sputum collection, if necessary. d. Cultures shall be obtained on any specimen sent for an AFB smear. e. Sensitivity studies shall be requested for all cultures positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ). f. Adequate sputum samples must be obtained on any inmate with suspected or known TBD, even if the only known site of infection is extrapulmonary. A signi ficant number of inmates with extrapulmonary disease also have pulmonary disease. g. Healthcare staff must judge the adequacy of sputum samples. Sample collection must be observed. The observer shall encourage the inmate to breathe deeply and cough forcefull y to produce a good specimen. Asking the laboratory for a gram stain on questionable samples may assist judgment of sample adequacy. The presence of few epithelial cells and many white blood cells indicates that the sample is adequate. h. Induced Sputum Samples: The acquisition of good sputum samples may be assisted by the use of nebulized saline, but this procedure must be done with the inmate in respiratory /airborne isolation. Sputum induction is required for inmates suspected of having active TB who are unable to produce sputum on his/her own. i. Sputum samples that are reported by the laboratory as QNS (quantity not sufficient) or overgrowth on culture are not always negative for AFB. New specimens must be submitted when these results are obtained. T hree consecutive new sputum specimens shall be obtained. j. Mycobacterial Laboratory Services (1) Each medical vendor, or, in the absence of a vendor, each facility, must identify and maintain a relationship with a laboratory able to provide AFB smear results within 48 hours of sample submission, and preliminary positive culture results within 10- 21 days of specimen collection using liquid culture media and rapid identification methods. Facilities unable to find a laboratory that can provide this turn-around time shal l notify the BHCS Infection Control staff for assistance. (2) Prior knowledge of infection with MDR (Multiple Drug Resistant) - TB must be reported to the laboratory with specimen submission. (3) Induced sputum specimens are usually quite watery. The laborato ry must be informed that a specimen is induced sputum or it may be mistaken for saliva. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-19 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (4) Only level II or III TB laboratories shall be used. Specimens found to show AFB on smear at a community laboratory must be sent to a level II or III laboratory for further analysis. Further, a new specimen is to be obtained and sent directly to the level II or III laboratory. (5) All specimens that grow M. tuberculosis or other mycobacteria shall be sent to the reference laboratory for drug susceptibility testing. 9. Cont ainment Procedures a. Indications for TB Isolation (Respiratory/Airborne Isolation) Respiratory/Airborne isolation is indicated for any inmate who has evidence of contagious TB. This includes, but is not limited to, inmates with: (1) confirmed or suspected pulmonary or laryngeal TB; and (2) a clinical indication of TB that includes: (a) symptoms of TBD (cough, hemoptysis, fever, chills, night sweats, and weight loss). An inmate with a productive cough lasting more than 14 days, despite treatment for a respiratory infection, shall be considered to have a symptom of TBD . An inmate with a productive cough and none of these other symptoms may be treated out of respiratory/airborne isolation if the working differential diagnoses do not include TB D; (b) abnormal CXR, excluding stable non- inflammatory lesions unchanged from previous films; (c) undiagnosed laryngeal lesions; (d) a positive TST ; and (e) sputum smears that are AFB positive. b. Starting TB Isolation (Respiratory/Airborne Isolation) TB Isolation (respiratory/airborne iso lation) must be instituted as soon as the indication for it is recognized, and must continue until the criteria for discontinuing respiratory/airborne isolation are met, in accordance with Subsection D.8. e. below. The DC-494, Respiratory/Airborne Isolation Flow Sheet (Attachment 8- H) must be used for all occasions of respiratory/airborne isolation. The DC- 495, AFB Bacteriology Sheet (Attachment 8- I) shall be used to record sputum results. Refer to Respiratory Isolation Algorithm (Attachment 8- J) to facilita te this process. c. Maintenance of TB Isolation (Respiratory/Airborne Isolation) 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-20 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (1) An inmate in respiratory/airborne isolation shall be housed continuously in a negative pressure room designated for this purpose and maintained in accordance with current pub lic health guidelines. Whenever an inmate is housed in respiratory/airborne isolation, a clearly visible sign must be posted indicating the necessary precautions. (2) An inmate may leave respiratory/airborne isolation only for medical treatments, which cannot be provided within respiratory/airborne isolation. Showering outside the isolation room is not permitted unless the shower area is within a separate physical space with adequate negative air pressure and air exchanges. Sponge baths may be used if the i solation room does not have a shower. An inmate must wear a regular surgical mask if he/she leaves the isolation room for a medical treatment. All staff coming in contact with this inmate shall wear an N - 95 mask. (3) Outdoor recreation of the isolated inmat e is permitted provided the inmate wears a regular surgical mask to and from his/her destination, and the outdoor area is isolated from others. Staff will wear the N -95 mask. (4) Legal visits are the only visits permitted to an inmate in respiratory/airborne isolation. Legal visitors must be notified that the inmate is being housed in respiratory/airborne isolation, must be informed of proper respiratory precautions he/she should take, and must be given an approved particulate respirator for use during the v isit. Legal visitors must be asked to sign the DC- 513, Disclaimer for Visitors to Inmates in Respiratory/Airborne Isolation (Attachment 8- K), but may visit without signing the disclaimer. If the legal visitor refuses to sign the visitor disclaimer, the for m shall be completed and signed by two witnesses. The legal visit disclaimer shall be filed in the miscellaneous section of the inmate's medical record. (5) Department employees, consultants, and any other persons entering or sharing a closed space with an inmate in respiratory/airborne isolation must properly and continuously wear an approved N -95 mask while in this space. Any person who enters respiratory/airborne isolation rooms in the performance of his/her job must have training in particulate respirator use. Medical health staff supervising respiratory/airborne isolation must ensure that Department employees, consultants, and others exposed to the isolated inmate use these particulate respirators (Ref: fit testing) in accordance with Department policy 15.1.1 . d. Transfer of Inmates in TB Isolation (Respiratory/Airborne Isolation) (1) An inmate in respiratory/airborne isolation must be placed on medical hold and may not be transferred between facilities without authorization from the BHCS. (2) The following steps must be taken when a facility has more inmates in need of respiratory/airborne isolation than it has available isolation rooms. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-21 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (a) each inmate in isolation must be reviewed to determine whether he/she meets the criteria for release from isolation; and (b) if no inmate meets the criteria for discharge from isolation, facility staff must contact the BHCS Infection Control staff and the inmate shall be transferred to the nearest facility with an available negative pressure isolation room. (3) Physicians and nurses from a facility transferring an inmate in respiratory/ airborne isolation must contact his/her counterpart at the receiving facility to review the case. The contact must occur before the inmate leaves the transferring facility. This applies whether t he receiving facility is a Department correctional facility, another criminal justice agency, or a hospital. (4) Employee Protection During Transfer of Inmates in Respiratory/Airborne Isolation: (a) Anyone likely to share the same breathing space with an inmat e in respiratory/airborne isolation must be informed of that inmate's status. (b) Transport staff for a respiratory/airborne isolation inmate must have completed training and fit testing; these staff members must wear the approved particulate respirators continuously while in the same breathing space as the inmate. Any respirator with an N -95 level of respiratory protection is acceptable for transporting an inmate with suspect or active TB. (c) Transport staff are encouraged to keep his/her vehicle's windows open, weather permitting, whenever transporting an inmate in respiratory/airborne isolation status. The vehicle's heating and air -conditioning system shall not be set on the recirculating cycle. (d) A respiratory/airborne isolation inmate must wear a surgic al mask (NOT N- 95 masks) continuously while out of respiratory/airborne isolation rooms. e. Release from Respiratory/Airborne Isolation Respiratory/airborne isolation shall be maintained until one of the following conditions is met ( DC-494, Attachment 8- H, DC-495, Attachment 8- I, and Respiratory Isolation Algorithm, Attachment 8 -J): (1) An inmate with a positive AFB smear may only be released from respiratory/ airborne isolation if (a), (b), and (c) are all true: (a) has completed two weeks of appropriate therapy; i. appropriate therapy for most inmates is the four -drug regimen recommended in Subsection D. 12. below; and 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-22 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 ii. appropriate therapy for an inmate with known or suspected TBD requires a minimum of two drugs to which the organism is sensitive, or which the inm ate has never received. (b) is clinically improving; and (c) three consecutive (collected on different days) sputum smear and culture results are AFB negative. NOTE: An inmate with confirmed or suspected TBD may not be released from respiratory/airborne isolati on with positive AFB smears. (2) All sputum smears are negative and symptoms have improved on therapy directed toward another disease (bronchitis, pneumocystis pneumonia). (3) All culture results are known and show no growth of M. tuberculosis . Record result s on the DC- 495. Mavium or other mycobacteria do not require respiratory/airborne isolation. 10. Public Health Containment Measures a. Public health tasks of facility staff and the BHCS Infection Control staff. (1) Facilities are responsible for the direct inmat e care aspect of the communicable disease program. This includes, among other things: (a) routine TST; (b) detection of cases; (c) diagnosis and treatment of cases; (d) prophylactic and active TBD case follow -up at a minimum of every 30 days through a TB chronic care clinic with chronic care flow sheet documentation; (e) reporting of suspected and confirmed cases to the state and/or county public health office, and to the BHCS Infection Control staff;; (f) maintenance of respiratory/airborne isolation rooms and other containm ent procedures; (g) notification of TB diagnosis and treatment status to receiving providers if an inmate must be transferred; (h) conduct contact investigations; and (i) provide results of investigations to the DOH. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-23 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 2017 512, Active/Con firmed TB Cases Log (Attachment 8 -L) of active and confirmed TB cases under their care. (3) The BHCS shall assist facilities in the organization and administration of their communicable disease control efforts. The BHCS Infection Control staff shall: (a) advis e facilities about the Department's communicable disease control policies; (b) help organize group testing for surveillance or contact investigations; (c) help facilities find information about treatment or management of inmates; (d) facilitate the accurate and tim ely reporting of a suspect and active case to public health officials; (e) assist in developing the departmental lesson plan for TB; and (f) assist in discharge planning for an inmate receiving direct observed therapy who is about to be released from custody or transferred to a CCC. b. Contact Investigation Guidelines This policy section presents a system for evaluating persons exposed to an inmate with active TB. Anyone who shared breathing air with a known or suspected case of contagious disease for a significant amount of time is at risk for TB infection (work, activities, religious services, neighboring cells) in accordance with Subsection C. 3. above . (1) Round One (a) A contact investigation is comprised of two rounds of testing 10 to 12 weeks apart. An inmate, D epartment staff, contract staff, visitor, and any other possible contact must be considered for evaluation (PPD and review of symptoms). (b) Facility medical staff shall conduct the contact investigation with the guidance and assistance of BHCS Infection Control staff and DOH. i. The decision to test a contact shall depend on the diagnosis of suspected or confirmed TB and positivity of sputum smears in the index case, estimates of the infectivity of the index case, the proximity and duration of contact with th e index case, and the presence of host factors that could increase the chance of a contact becoming infected. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-24 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 ii. The investigation shall begin with close contacts and shall be extended in stages (also called circles) to progressively lower -risk groups until the rate of skin test conversion in a tested group is less than 6%. iii. Induration greater than or equal to five (5) mm shall be considered a positive TST for all contacts investigated. This standard applies to staff as well as inmates. iv. Every contact who is either a known HIV seropositive , is at high risk for HIV infection, or is known to be immunocompromised, with less than five mm induration on the TST, shall be assessed for the risk of TB infection or disease on a case- by-case basis by the facility Medical Director. (c) TST in conjunction with a contact investigation is voluntary with the following exceptions: i. if the inmate demonstrates signs or symptoms consistent with possible TB; and ii. there are conversions of PPD status to positive among other inmates or staff during contact investigation. Anyone refusing shall be counseled about the benefits of testing. The BHCS and Infection Control staff must be consulted concerning the enlargement of the circle(s). (d) Any identified contact shall be asked whether he/s he has symptoms of TB. Appropriate isolation precautions shall be taken for an inmate with these symptoms. Employees with symptoms of TB must be excluded from the workplace in accordance with Subsection C. above of this procedures manual. (e) Employee cont acts with a new positive TST shall be referred to his/her private physician or local public health office for further evaluation. A normal CXR report and a statement certifying freedom of TBD is required to be forwarded to the ICN prior to the employee's r eturn to his/her job assignment. (f) All inmate contacts with a positive PPD shall be evaluated as outlined in Subsection D.7.c. above . (g) An inmate contact with induration less than five mm on TST shall receive a CXR (a single Posterior Anterior [ PA] and lateral view is necessary) if: i. he/she has symptoms of tuberculosis; ii. the circumstances of his/her contact make him/her very likely to have been infected; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-25 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 iii. other contacts with a similar degree of exposure have a high prevalence of infection; and iv. he/she is known or suspected to be immunocompromised. NOTE : An employee who meets these criteria shall be referred to his/her private physician or local public health office for further evaluation. (h) HIV counseling and testing shall be made available to each identified contact that is uncertain of his/her HIV serostatus. An employee who is uncertain of his/her HIV status shall be referred to his/her private physician. (I) Unless a course of treatment for LTBI is known to have been completed, treatment for LTBI shal l be offered to all contacts who receive a CXR, and to every HIV infected inmate identified in a contact investigation as having a significant exposure (see Subsection D. 9. b. above.) An individual with known HIV infection shall be counseled specifically on how TSTs may be affected in people with compromised immune systems. Treatment for LTBI shall be started as soon as active disease is ruled out. (2) Round Two Any person who was negative in Round One (either PPD or review of symptoms) shall be evaluated in Round Two between 10 and 12 weeks of the initial plant or review. Contacts whose first TST showed less than 5 mm induration shall receive a second Mantoux test 10 to 12 weeks after the end of his/her exposure to the index case. (a) The facility shall maint ain a log of all contacts considered for testing using the Tuberculosis Case Epidemiological Co ntrol Record (Attachment 8- M). This log shall list the contacts who accept or refuse testing and the results of TSTs. The BHCS Chief of Clinical Services and Inf ection Control staff shall determine if the contact investigation circles shall be extended. The BHCS Infection Control staff shall direct the facility ICN if the circle is to be extended. Any person refusing testing shall be counseled. The ICN must also s ubmit a summary report at the conclusion of the investigation, and flag all suspected incidents of transmission on the DC- 512. The DOH shall receive a copy of this log. (b) The DC-496 is to be completed for all converters. 11. Reporting to the DOH a. Facility heal th staff must report every confirmed or suspected case of active TBD to the BHCS Infection Control staff via telephone 24 hours of diagnosis or suspicion. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-26 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 b. Local Public Health Office notification must be made by telephone and by submission of the reporting forms Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis (Attachment 8- N) by the ICN/designee. 12. Treatment of TB (Infection or Disease) All TB therapy in the Department, including treatment for LTBI, shall be Direct Observed Therapy (DOT). a. Direct Observed Therapy (DOT) (1) DOT requires that an LPN, RN, physician, or PA observe the inmate place the medication in his/her mouth and then swallow. The inmate's mouth shall then be inspected for unswallowed pills. (2) DOT must be documented for each dose. This shall be doc umented on the Medication Administration Record (MAR). (3) Inmate DOT Refusal (a) If an inmate initially refuses DOT for active disease, he/she shall remain in respiratory/airborne isolation until he/she agrees to complete the therapy. (b) If an inmate refuses to complete the full course of treatment for active disease, he/she shall be evaluated by a physician, three sputums obtained for AFB smears, and a physician shall make a determination for further treatment in consult with the BHCS, Chief of Clinical Servi ces and Assistant Medical Director(s). The DOH shall be notified of all refusals by the BHCS Infection Control staff. (4) If the inmate is in a CCC and is non- compliant with DOT for active disease, the BHCS, Chief of Clinical Services, Assistant Medical Dir ector(s), and the DOH shall be consulted. (5) Title 28, Pennsylvania Code, Chapter 27, Communicable and Non - communicable Diseases requires treatment of TBD . Refusal by an inmate is grounds for seeking a court order requiring therapy. The facility Medical D irector shall consult the BHCS, Chief of Clinical Services and Assistant Medical Director(s). If a court order is determined to be necessary, the facility Medical Director and BHCS shall consult with the Office of Chief Counsel. (6) An inmate receiving DOT for TBD shall not be transferred to another facility until it is determined that: (a) he/she shall remain in a Department facility until anticipated completion of treatment; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-27 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (b) a comprehensive discharge plan is completed. The discharge plan must identify the name, address, and phone number of the provider who shall assume care when the inmate is released or enters pre- release. The plan must include an appointment date for the inmate to be seen by the provider after release. The BHCS Infection Control staff shall assist in this discharge planning if requested by the ICN/designee; and (c) the plan for continuing therapy must be discussed with the receiving health care provider whenever an inmate on DOT is transferred. This applies to transfers to a CCC as well as to a community provider who may care for a released or pre- release inmate. An inmate transferred to community providers shall continue to receive DOT. b. Indication for Treatment for LTBI (1) Any inmate with a positive TST shall be offered the opportunity to rece ive treatment for LTBI unless written documentation is received to show that such therapy has been previously completed. (2) An inmate with CXR findings consistent with prior TBD or silicosis shall be offered prophylaxis according to current CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines and updates at the following website: http://www.cdc.gov . (3) An immunocompromised inmate who had contact with a known case of active TB shall be offered prophylactic INH for nine months. (4) LTBI Therapy Among HIV -Positive, PPD -Positive Inmates Unless specifically contraindicated, LTBI therapy shall be provided to a HIV - positive inmate as cited in Subsection D.11.b.(2) above : (a) who has a positive TST (greater than or equal to 5 mm of induration); (b) who has not already been treated for TB infection; and (c) whose test results exclude active TB. NOTE : This LTBI therapy is indicated even if the date of TST conversion cannot be determined. (5) LTBI Therapy for HIV -Positive, PPD -Negative Inmates (a) When assessing an HIV -infected inmate who has negative PPD ( TST results), the most important factors in considering LTBI therapy are the likelihood of exposure to transmissible active TB and the likelihood of latent M. tuberculosis infection. LTBI therapy shall be considered for an HIV - infected inmate who does not have a documented positive PPD -tuberculin 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-28 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 response but who has had recent contact with an inmate who has infectious pulmonary or laryngeal TB. Repeat TST of initially PPD -negative contacts three months after cessation of contact with infectious TB may be used to assist in decisions about duration of LTBI therapy. However, most of these inmates shall complete a full nine- month course of LBTI ther apy in accordance with Subsection D.11.b. (2) above . Refer all questions to the BHCS Infection Control staff. (b) LTBI therapy for an inmate who is not PPD positive also may be considered. Such therapy may be beneficial for: i. children who are born to HIV -infected women and are close contacts of a person who has infectious TB; and ii. HIV-infected adults who reside or work in facilities and are continually and unavoidably exposed to inmates who have infectious TB. Some experts recommend continuing Isoniazid LTBI t herapy indefinitely for HIV-infected persons who have an ongoing high risk for exposure to M. tuberculosis (inmates of prisons in which the prevalence of TB is high). c. Refusing LTBI Therapy An inmate may refuse LTBI therapy, but must be instructed in the rationale for and expected benefits of LTBI therapy before his/her refusal is acknowledged. Refusal of LTBI therapy must be documented in the medical record and automated inmate TB tracking system. In addition, an inmate shall be asked to attest to his/her refusal on a DC-462, (refer to 13.2.1, Section 1 - Inmate Health Care Plan, Attachment 1- F). The inmate must be recalled by nursing staff for annual review to document the presence or absence of symptoms of tuberculosis. Preventive therapy must be re-expla ined and re -offered at each recall visit. d. Contraindications to LTBI Therapy (1) No inmate shall be started on prophylactic therapy until active disease is ruled out by interview, examination, CXR, and (if indicated) sputum smears and cultures. (2) An inmate over 35 years old or with pre -existing liver disease may still be treated with INH therapy. He/She may safely receive the benefits of LTBI therapy, but shall have a baseline Liver Function Test (LFT) prior to initiating INH and repeated LFTs at four weeks and at eight weeks during this therapy. If INH toxicity occurs and treatment must be discontinued, some benefit is obtained from even a partial course of therapy. Rifampin may be used as a second line of therapy after LFTs return to normal. e. Multi -Drug LTBI Therapy 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-29 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 An inmate converting to a positive TST result after known or suspected contact with a case of MDR -TB shall be considered for multi -drug LTBI therapy. (1) The inmate shall first have his/her risk of infection with MDR -TB estimated . (2) The deci sion to use multi -drug LTBI therapy shall then be based on the DC- 495. (3) Physicians identifying an inmate for whom multi -drug LTBI therapy is indicated shall contact the BHCS, Chief of Clinical Services or Assistant Medical Director(s) to discuss therapy. f. Monitoring LTBI Therapy (1) The inmate shall be seen periodically by the nurse or physician/PA and evaluated by obtaining liver function testing at two, four, and eight months and concerning symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pai n, jaundice, biliuria, clay colored stools). INH must be immediately stopped if these signs or symptoms are present. The symptoms must be evaluated and not simply attributed to INH therapy. (2) Any inmate who develops symptoms of TB D while on DOT must be im mediately placed into respiratory/airborne isolation and evaluated as outlined in Sub- Section D.5. above . g. Interrupted LTBI Therapy (1) If an inmate starts DOT and then becomes non- compliant he/she shall be counseled about the benefits of therapy and then g iven the opportunity to resume DOT. A second episode of non- compliance shall be considered a refusal of therapy. In addition, the inmate shall be asked to attest to his/her refusal on a DC-462, (refer to 13.2.1, Section 1 - Inmate Health Care Plan, Attachment 1 - F). The inmate shall have his/her DOT stopped and be counseled to promptly report any symptoms of tuberculosis to his/her facility health staff. He/She shall then be managed as a past positive as stated in Subsection D.6.q. above . (2) The following gui delines shall be used for the resumption of therapy if an interruption of preventive therapy should occur: (a) for an inmate who received DOT for less than three months and interrupted treatment more than 30 days, start over at day zero and complete the indicated length of therapy; and (b) for an inmate who received DOT for more than three months and interrupted treatment less than 30 days, resume therapy where he/she left off. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-30 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (c) the required number of doses must be administered within 3 months after the anticipat ed date of completion. 13. Therapy of TBD a. Treatment Procedures (1) Every inmate with suspected or confirmed active tuberculosis MUST be isolated as outlined in Subsection D.7. above . (2) All treatment of TBD should be undertaken with consultation with the BHC S Infectious Disease Specialist, or Pulmonologist knowledgeable in the treatment of TB and according to current CDC, MMWR, and ATS guidelines and updates at the following website: http://www.cdc.gov . b. Monitoring Treatment Effectiveness (1) One sputum smear shall be obtained weekly after the diagnosis has been established. Once a negative smear is obtained, additional smears and cultures shall be obtained on consecut ive days until three consecutive smears are AFB negative. Sputum smears and cultures shall then be obtained monthly until completion of therapy. (2) The inmate may be released from isolation when all culture results are known and none show growth of M. tub erculosis . The facility Medical Director shall consult with the BHCS, Chief of Clinical Services or Assistant Medical Director(s) for approval of this release. (3) At least monthly, the inmate shall be evaluated by a physician or PA until therapy is complet ed. This evaluation must include a review of symptoms of TB and side effects of the inmate's medications. A focused physical examination shall be performed. CXR and laboratory studies must be obtained when indicated. Documentation shall be completed on the DC-472, (refer to 13.1.1, Section 5- Occupational Exposure to Blood -borne Pathogens, Attachment 5- D) and other appropriate medical records forms when indicated. (4) The following data shall be recorded at each physician visit: (a) presence or absence of sympt oms; (b) weight; (c) temperature; (d) presence or absence of physical findings; (e) abnormal laboratory values; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-31 Issued: 1/9/2017 2017 (f) dates and results sputum collections; and (g) date and result of CXRs. (5) If the sputum culture fails to become negative after three months of therapy: (a) compliance with DOT must be reviewed; (b) the laboratory shall be notified that MDR -TB is suspected. Any changes in therapy must be based on updated sensitivity data; and (c) consult with the DOH. (6) The DC-497, Tuberculosis Chemoth erapy Flow Sheet (Attachmen t 8-O) shall be used to monitor medication use. (7) Monitoring of adverse effects of medications must be consistent with guidelines found in the First -Line TB Drugs (Attachment 8 -P) and as cited in Subsection D.11.b.(2) above. c. Nursing Review of Tetanus Hi story/Tetanus Vaccinations (1) A nurse shall complete the DC- 486, Inmate Imm unization Record (Attachment 8-Q), whenever an inmate is immunized. (2) If the inmate is known to be allergic to the tetanus vaccine, no vaccine shall be administered and the inmate' s allergy to the vaccine shall be documented in the progress notes. In addition, documentation must be provided on the DC -445, Drug Sensitivity Label , which is affixed to the front of the inmate's medical record. (3) Administration of the tetanus/diphtheria vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy. In the event an inmate is pregnant, the nurse conducting the tetanus history review shall document the inmate's condition and progress in the Progress Notes Section of the inmate's medical record. (4) The physic ian or nurse administrating the vaccines shall record on the DC- 486, the following information for all tetanus/diphtheria immunizations given: (a) date and time; (b) vaccine lot number; (c) manufacturer; and (d) initials of the health care provider administering the immunization. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-32 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (5) Tetanus/diphtheria (Td) vaccination shall be administered as follows: (a) 0.5 ml, IM on intake to the Department. This shall be documented on the DC-486, in the inmate's medical records. (b) A booster dose, 0.5 ml, IM shall be administered every 10 years. This shall also be documented on the DC- 486. (c) In the event of a wound, a booster dose of Td vaccine shall be administered in the following amounts: i. minor wound and not contaminated - Td 0.5 ml, IM given only every 10 years; and ii. other wounds - Td 0.5 ml, IM is appropriate if the inmate has not received tetanus toxoid within the preceding five years. (d) Tetanus Immunization: If the inmate has not received any immunization, the recommended schedule for children equal to or greater than seven year s of age and adults is a primary vaccination with Td to include three doses: i. initial dose - Td 0.5 ml, IM; ii. second dose - Td 0.5 ml, IM four to eight weeks after first dose; and iii. third dose - Td 0.5 ml, IM six to 12 months after second dose; NOTE: Td ra ther than DT (Diphtheria/tetanus) is the preparation of choice for vaccination of all persons greater than or equal to seven years of age because side effects from higher doses of diphtheria toxoid are more common. (e) progress notes shall only be written if the inmate experiences an allergic reaction or other complications as a result of the immunization; and (f) after completing the Tetanus History/Tetanus Vaccinations review, the nurse shall file the DC- 486, under the TB/Immunization Section of the inmate's medical record. E. Sexually Transmissible Diseases Treatment (STD) 1. Identification of STDs Upon Reception a. The BHCS has identified the need to expand testing of our inmates to include testing for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea. Risk factors for an inmate are: (1) below 33 years old; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-33 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (2) multiple sexual partners; and (3) past history of other STDs. b. Every inmate shall be tested on intake (parole violators and new receptions) to identify these organisms and appropriately treat them. c. The importance of this testing is based on the fact that the presence of both ulcerative and suppurative disease (areas that are open and draining) places the inmate at increased risk of HIV transmission and acquisition. d. The Leukocyte Esterase (LE) shall be performed in accordance with Section 3, Physical Examinations of this procedures manual. 2. Staff Responsibilities a. Facility Medical Director The facility Medical Director/designee shall ensure that all physicians and clinical staff are familiar with the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines. Please refer to the \"U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guidelines for Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases\" that was sent to the ICNs. b. Corrections Health Care Administrator (CHCA) The CHCA/designee shall ensure: (1) that all physicians and clinical staff are familiar with the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines; and (2) that all confirmed cases of sexually transmissible diseases diagnosed within the facility are repor ted to the appropriate State DOH District Office. F. Management of Hepatitis A, B, and C 10 1. Inmates shall be tested for Hepatitis C (HCV) antibodies upon arrival at the home facility rather than at reception, but no later than four months after reception into the Department. Inmates already known to have HCV antibodies need not be retested but may be entered directly into the Hepatitis C protocol (refer to 13.2.1, Section 16, QI Plan, Appendix 16- B, Chapter 01 ). Testing for HCV at any time remains an option at the clinician's discretion. 2. Testing for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg) can be offered at the same time as HCV testing, and testing for HIV should be offered. Inmates immunized against HBV may 10 4-4356 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-34 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 nevertheless be infected and should not be considered un infected unless a previous HBSAg is negative. 3. Hepatitis A a. Transmission Hepatitis A virus is transmitted via fecal to oral route. b. Identification - Symptoms of Acute Hepatitis A (1) jaundice; (2) fever; (3) malaise; (4) anorexia; and/or (5) nausea. c. Surveillance (1) When the inmate presents to the Medical Department with the above symptoms, he/she shall be placed in contact isolation. Blood testing to confirm the diagnosis will be at a minimum: (a) liver function tests; (b) HAV antibody (HAV IgM); and (c) HB sAg unless known positive. NOTE: Positive IgM indicates recent infection. (2) The ICN shall investigate the inmate's cellmate(s) and workplace to determine the source of the infection. This investigation may also identify any other cases. (3) If the index c ase works in Food Service, the ICN shall notify the BHCS/ICC and receive direction on further action. (4) The BHCS/ICC and DOH will review the Hepatitis A situation by an inspection of Food Services, hand wash stations, etc. A report will be presented with the findings and the action follow -up to the BHCS and DOH. d. Immunization (Hepatitis A Vaccine) 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-35 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (1) This Hepatitis A vaccine will be given without antibody testing for past infection (HAV IgG). (2) Every Hepatitis B and C positive inmate, as well as those who have chronic liver disease are offered Hepatitis A vaccine, if not already immune or vaccinated. e. Treatment The DOH shall be notified by the BHCS/ICC. The DOH will advise/direct if immune globulin will be indicated for the treatment of an exposed inmate or staff. Treatment for acute Hepatitis A is supportive. This is based on the inmate's clinical assessment. f. Follow -up There is no further follow -up after the acute case of Hepatitis A has resolved. g. Isolation An inmate who is a suspected or confirmed case of Acute Hepatitis A shall be placed in contact isolation precautions. h. Every inmate designated for Food Service shall be evaluated for symptoms of Hepatitis A. If the inmate has acute Hepatitis A, he/she shall not work in Food Service. 4. Hepatitis B a. Transmission Hepatitis B virus is transmitted via infected blood and body fluids. b. Identification - Symptoms (1) jaundice; (2) fever; (3) flu-like illness; (4) malaise; (5) arthralgias; and/or (6) nausea. c. Surveillance 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-36 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 In most cases the patient does not know he/she is infected with Hepatitis B. When the inmate presents to the Medical Department with the above symptoms, blood testing to confirm the diagnosis will be as follows: (1) Acute Hepatitis B (a) Hepatitis B Surface Antigen - HbsAG positive indicates t he presence of the virus: i. chronic active; or ii. persistent uncleared. (b) Hepatitis B Surface Antibody - HB sAb positive - past infection and protective antibodies; (c) Hepatitis B e Antigen - HB eAg positive - acute infection, highly contagious; (d) Hepatitis B core Antibody - HbcAb positive - past infection, protective antibodies; (e) Presence of IgM antibodies - new infection; or (f) Presence of IgG antibodies - previous infection of any duration. (2) Chronic Hepatitis B is defined as the patient who is Hepatitis B surfac e antigen (Hb sAg) positive for greater than six months. d. Risk Reduction (1) The physician/PA/ICN shall review the inmate's risk factors/behaviors. (2) The inmate shall receive education concerning Hepatitis B transmission and prevention. e. Immunization - Hepatitis B vaccine is offered to: (1) every staff member and inmate, unless medically contraindicated, already vaccinated or immune; and (2) a Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) positive inmate as part of the HCV protocol is highly encouraged to receive the Hepatitis B vaccine series. f. Treatment and Follow -Up Questions concerning Hepatitis B treatment will be directed to the Department Infectious Disease (ID) Specialist. They will be reviewed on a case- by-case basis. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-37 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 g. Isolation The precautions to be taken shall be Un iversal/Standard Precautions. h. An inmate with chronic Hepatitis B is cleared to work in Food Service. An inmate with acute Hepatitis B cannot work in Food Service until he/she is medically stable and cleared to work by his/her treating physician. An inmat e working in Food Service is not contagious to others unless he/she has the symptoms of the disease. 5. Hepatitis C a. Transmission Hepatitis C virus is transmitted via infected blood and body fluids. b. Identification/Surveillance Every inmate is tested for Hepatitis C virus upon arrival at the home facility . Every HCV -positive inmate shall be evaluated and treated in accordance with the HCV protocol as outlined in 13.2.1, Section 16 - QI Plan Appendix 16- B Chapter 01 and evaluated periodically in chronic cl inic. c. Immunization There are no vaccines for Hepatitis C; however, Hepatitis A and B immunizations are encouraged. d. Treatment Inmates with HCV infection are evaluated as part of the HCV protocol to determine need for drug treatment. e. Follow -up A Hepati tis C positive inmate shall be seen in Hepatitis C clinic according to the Hepatitis C protocol. f. Isolation The precautions to be taken shall be Universal/Standard Precautions. g. An inmate with Hepatitis C is cleared to work in Food Service. An inmate work ing in Food Service is not contagious to others. G.

Transmission of HIV a. There is no evidence that HIV is transmitted by casual social contact with infected individuals. While HIV has been isolated in many body fluids, only blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk have been implicated in its transmiss ion. Therefore, the routes of transmission are via: (1) intimate sexual contact; (2) sharing of needles and syringes contaminated with blood; (3) blood and blood products containing HIV; (4) prenatal transmission from mother to neonate (mother -to-newborn) transmission; and (5) possible transmission through mother's milk to infant. b. HIV is transmitted primarily through direct sexual contact involving exchange of implicated body fluids or through the exchange of blood from a person who is infected with HIV. HIV in fection is also transmitted by shared needles contaminated with blood. Other evidence for transmission through blood products has been found in the occurrence of AIDS in hemophilia patients receiving clotting factors made from infected blood. Although HIV has occasionally been found in very small quantities in the saliva, urine, feces, and tears of a few people with HIV infection, current evidence indicates that these body fluids are not vehicles of transmission unless they contain visible blood. c. There is no evidence that HIV has been transmitted by casual, non- sexual, person- to-person social contacts as would occur in normal business or household 16 4-ACRS -4C-10 17 4-ACRS -4C-10 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-43 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 settings with people who are infected with HIV, who are diagnosed as having AIDS, or who participate in high ri sk activities. Persons who do not engage in high -risk behavior are not at risk of acquiring the virus. d. Significant exposure consists of exposure of blood or potentially infectious body fluids from a source individual to the blood (needle stick), mucous me mbranes (eye, mouth, genital, rectal), or non -intact skin (lacerations, open sores) of another individual. e. Potentially infectious human body fluids include semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, saliva contaminated with blood, and al l body fluids where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between the types of body fluids involved. f. An HCW with AIDS, as an HCW with any disease, shall continue his/her normal work duties unless his/her medical condition, as determined by his/he r physician, precludes it or his/her presence in an area with inmates presents a security or safety concern. HCWs are not at risk of contracting HIV from infected co -workers or inmates, or in the absence of shared needles contaminated with blood, or direct sexual contact involving the exchange of body fluids. Talking to people with AIDS or to persons infected with the HIV or being in close proximity is no cause for concern. g. There is no evidence that HIV is spread by: (1) biting, sneezing, coughing, or spitt ing; (2) contact with urine or feces, unless there is visible blood; (3) handshakes or other non- sexual physical contact; (4) toilet seats, bathtubs, or showers; (5) utensils, dishes, or linens used by an infected person; (6) food prepared or served by an infected person; (7) articles handled or worn by an infected person; and (8) being around an infected person, even on a daily basis over a long period. 3. Inmate Confidentiality 18 a. Any HIV-related inmate information of a medical nature may not be revealed by a HCW or volunteer of the Department, unless authorized by the Confidentiality of HIV-Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq., or other state or federal statute or regulation. Any written consent to disclosure of confidential HIV -related 18 4-ACRS -4C-10 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-44 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 informati on shall include the various items and requirements as enumerated in Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 \u00a77601 et seq . b. Communication within the correctional facility shall not divulge a patient's HIV/AIDS diagnosis or medical conditi on, except to those who are authorized by Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq . If written, such information is to be maintained in locked file drawers, compartments, or other secure space in accordance with Health Care Wor ker Confidentiality, Subsection F. 8.b. below . c. As a matter of policy, Universal/Standard Precautions shall be applied to every individual treated by the medical staff/Department HCW. The CDC recommends the use of Universal/Standard Precautions. Public hea lth policy indicates that knowledge of an individual's antibody status is not helpful for infection control and protection of either patients or staff. The basic tenets of this procedure manual are to treat everyone as if he/she is infected. 19 d. An inmate request for voluntary HIV testing shall be ordered by a physician/PA. e. A list of inmates with AIDS or those infected with HIV shall not be posted, in accordance with this procedures manual. f. The Department's rules, regulations, and directives governing conf identiality shall apply in accordance with Department policy DC -ADM 003, \"Release of Information,\" and the Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq. g. If an inmate is paroled or released before the test results are known, when the test results do return , a notation must be made in the medical record by the physician reviewing the test results. The test results shall be forwarded to the Pennsylvania DOH who shall, in turn, notify the inmate and provide proper counseling and servi ces. 4. Diagnosis/Assessment/Treatment a. Department programs serving those with AIDS or HIV infection address the special needs of this population. The inmate may face stigma and discrimination. He/She may be coping with physical deterioration and the psychological and social impact of having a fatal disease. The Department has an obligation to provide adequate medical care for every inmate including those with AIDS or HIV infection, including following the latest CDC and other federal guidelines and protocols, where available, for patient diagnosis and treatment. b. There shall be no involuntary HIV testing of an inmate of the Department except as provided in Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq. the Act establishes criteria for r outine and mandated testing. See Department policy 13.1.1, Section 5. 19 4-ACRS -4C-10 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-45 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 c. HIV testing shall be offered at the hom e facility in conjunction with H epatitis C testing. Otherwise, HIV testing shall only be ordered by a physician. The order must be based upon t he inmate's current medical history and clinical signs and symptoms. Inmate requests for testing shall be routinely approved, even if the inmate does not admit to high-risk behavior , but testing more frequently than every six months shall be performed only in exceptional circumstances . A program is to be instituted at each Corrections facility to encourage an inmate to voluntarily be tested for HIV so that those who are infected can receive appropriate early counseling and treatment. If an inmate does not r equest an HIV test but has exhibited early symptoms of HIV illness or high- risk behavior, the physician may order an HIV test with consent of the inmate. The Physician/PA shall provide pre- test counseling. A nurse may provide this counseling after completi on of training for HIV counseling from the Department.20 d. The inmate shall receive pre- test counseling prior to the HIV test. He/She shall be offered an interpreter if needed and given ample time to ask questions. The Language Line Services (through the Bus iness Office) will be used for interpretation. The inmate must sign the HIV Consent before the blood is drawn. e. The physician shall complete his/her assessment using professional judgment and current HIV diagnostic procedures. Past and present historical data from the inmate and from the inmate medical record shall be consulted. Information that the physician shall consider includes: (1) demographic data; (2) risk factors (IV drug abuser, homosexual and heterosexual high risk sex, hemophilia transfusions, other transfusion history, infections: hepatitis, TB, gonorrhea syphilis, etc); symptoms: fever, anorexia, malaise, depression, dyspnea, persistent diarrhea, night sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and shortness of breath; (4) particular attention shall be paid to history and/or current evidence of: (a) drug abuse; (b) assaultive behavior; (c) indiscriminate sexual behavior; and/or (d) victimization. (5) unless clinically contraindicated, it is recommended that the customary testing protocols recommended by the CDC shall be followed; that is, if the first ELISA 20 4-4357, 4 -ACRS -4C-10 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-46 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 test for HIV is positive, a second test shall be done to verify the results of the first test. If the second test is also positive, a third test, the Western Blot, which is more specific for antibody shall be done. Persons with a repeatedly reactive HIV ELISA test and positive Western Blot shall be considered HIV infected, and the physician may order additional tests to determine the proper staging and classificati on of infection; 21 (6) the physician performing a physical exam shall give special attention to: (a) Lymphadenopathy; (b) oral changes; (c) Candidiasis; (d) mental status changes; (e) rashes and/or skin changes; (f) rales in lungs; (g) weight loss; (h) fever; (i) jaundice; and (j) track ma rks. (7) post test counseling: (a) The test and its results shall be discussed with the inmate by the physician/ PA/designee. In any case, when testing is ordered, the physician shall document the rationale for testing, discussions with the inmate and plans for management of the condition. 22 (b) The physician or trained medical staff is to provide counseling to all inmates prior to and after results are received for HIV antibody testing. Counseling shall be in compliance with all CDC and Pennsylvania DOH guidelines and protocols, as well as requirements outlined in the Confidentiality of HIV - Related Information Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq . A nurse may provide this counseling after completion of the HIV counseling training from the Department.23 21 4-4357 22 4-4357 23 4-ACRS -4C-10 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-47 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (c) Housing plans for an inmate having a positive test result shall be handled on a case -by-case basis, using medical and security considerations . Under ordinary circumstances, an inmate that is known to be HIV positive shall be housed with general population. (d) Determination of housing is based upon comprehensive evaluations and medical judgment as to the appropriate level of care for the inmate's physical status and security considerations. Housing determination shall be made on the following criteria:24 i. isolation or physical condition such as weakness, incontinence, diarrhea , etc; ii. psychiatric diagnosis and treatment (uncontrolled behavior); iii. the inmate's inability to abstain from intimate sexual contact; iv. the inmate's inability to follow blood/body fluid precautions due to inability to comprehend and/or unable to follow good infection control measures such as good personal hygiene habits; and/or v. victimization. (e) The inmate's management plan shall be updated based on positive HIV test results or diagnosis with AIDS. (f) The management plan shall outline the methods to be used, encompassing the medical, psychiatric, and psychological needs of the patient. 25 (g) If an inmate is paroled or released before the test results are known, when the test results do return, a notation must be made in the medical record by the physician documenting the results of the tests. The lab report must be initialed by the physician and filed in the record. The test results shall be forwarded to the Pennsylvania DOH who shall, in turn, notify the inmate and provide p roper counseling and services. (h) Transfers between correctional facilities and CCCs of the Department and Forensic Treatment Centers (FTC) shall have updated medical summaries that include HIV information if that information is pertinent to the future care of the transferee. 5. Inmate Care Statement 24 4-4357, 4 -ACRS -4C-10 25 4-4357 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-48 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 a. There is no evidence that the risks in providing direct care to an inmate infected with HIV are any greater than those associated with caring for any other sick person. Therefore, a healthy HCW shall not be excused, on his/her own request, from providing care to these inmates. An HCW, who believes he/she may be at increased risk because he/she is immunosuppressed or have other clinical conditions that may confer an increased risk of acquiring an infection, shall di scuss his/her concerns with his/her supervisor. These cases shall be evaluated on an individual basis in consul - tation with correctional administration and the HCW's physician. Claims by the HCW must be supported by written medical documentation. b. Specific guidelines for the care of an inmate infected with HIV are outlined in the procedures section of this document. 6. AIDS and HIV Infection in the Workplace a. The provisions of this section are in accordance with Management Directive 505.26. If more detailed i nformation is needed, the Directive may be referenced. b. A Department HCW and a job applicant with AIDS or HIV infection, or those perceived to have these conditions, shall not be discriminated against with regard to appointment, transfer, promotion, or any other employment or personnel action. Under no circumstance can an appointing authority require a current or prospective state HCW to receive an HIV antibody test, or reveal the results of a previous test or diagnosis, as a condition of employment. Should the Department learn of a current or prospective state HCW's AIDS or HIV infection that information shall not be used regarding employment or personnel actions except where the HCW concurs. c. In the event a Department HCW with AIDS or HIV is unable to phys ically carry out his/her job duties, the HCW shall be afforded the same considerations as any other HCW whose illnesses prevent him/her from fully performing his/her job. Because of the episodic nature of the secondary illnesses which affect persons with A IDS, an HCW may request reasonable accommodations which shall allow him/her to work with his/her handicap. Such requests shall be supported by appropriate documen- tation from the HCW's physician. These requests are to be honored where operationally feasib le, based on the job setting involved and the resources of the facility. An HCW with AIDS or HIV infection who request a transfer or a lateral or downward reclassification because of his/her medical condition shall have these requests considered, consistent with facility needs, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Management Directive 505.7. d. An HCW who refuses or objects to working with a co- worker, inmate, client, or member of the public with or perceived to have AIDS or HIV infection shall be counsel ed and educated in: (1) how the virus is, and is not, transmitted in the workplace; and 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-49 Issued: 2017 (2) the Commonwealth's Management Directive 505.26 and this procedure manual on AIDS in the workplace. e. Should the HCW continue to refuse to work with those individuals, the HCW may be subject to appropriate progressive discipline, up to and including dismissal. f. Department policy prohibits discrimination against persons with or perceived to have AIDS or HIV infection. Complaints about alleged discrimination against a HCW and prospective HCW may be addressed to the agency Equal Employment Officer. g. In addition, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act 43 P.S. \u00a7951 et seq . has been interpreted to cover discrimination against individuals with or perceived to have AIDS or HIV infe ction. Discrimination based on AIDS or HIV infection is prohibited in employment in Pennsylvania. Any person wishing to file discrimination complaints with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) should contact the PHRC regional office in his/her geographical area. 7. Health Care Worker Confidentiality a. Because of the nature of the disease, an HIV infected HCW shall have understandable concerns over confidentiality and privacy in connection with medical documentation and other information about his/her condition. Officials who have access to such information are required to maintain the confidentiality of that information. Supervisors, managers, and others included in making and implementing personnel management decisions involving HCWs with AIDS or HIV shall strictly observe applicable privacy and confidentiality requirements as noted in Management Directive 505.26. b. The following procedures are to be adhered to regarding AIDS related information on a state HCW or his/her dependents: (1) If this i nformation exists in a written form, it is not to be maintained in the HCW's Official Personnel Folder (Form STD -301). It is to be maintained in a separate, locked file drawer, compartment, or other secure place with restricted access, under jurisdiction of the party who received the information (medical officer, health care coordinator, supervisor, etc.) or in the personnel office. If maintained in the personnel office, access is to be limited to the personnel officer and a designated custodian of sensitiv e personnel records. In all cases, the HCW in question shall be informed of what written information is being maintained, where it is kept, and security provisions for its release in accordance with the Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act, 35 P. S. \u00a7\u00a77601 et seq . (2) Access to AIDS related information in HCW records is to be limited to only those parties who are the original recipients of that information, those designated individuals in the personnel office, and those who have been pre- approved through written consent by the affected HCW, unless there is a medical 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-50 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 emergency that requires an immediate response. Copies shall not be made of records, which identify a Department employee's AIDS or HIV status. (3) AIDS or HIV related information is not t o be forwarded to future employers should the health care worker change jobs, unless the release of such information has been pre- approved in writing by the affected HCW. (4) Paperwork containing AIDS related information on an HCW that must be processed through a chain of parties , such as work related disability forms, are to be handled with strict confidentiality. The HCW in question must be informed of how these forms are processed. If possible, agencies shall restrict the routing of these forms, processi ng them directly from the HCW's immediate supervisor to the personnel office. (5) Confidentiality restrictions on written AIDS or HIV related information also apply to the verbal communication of that information. If a supervisor, co- worker, or other state employee learns information on a Department employee's possible AIDS/HIV condition, that information is not to be communicated to other state employees or members of the public. Unless there is a specific need to do so, verbally communicated information on a state employee's AIDS or HIV status shall not be converted to a written record. 8. Case Reporting a. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, both HIV and AIDS are DOH reportable diseases. b. For purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, any inmate who is HIV posit ive and/or has a medical diagnosis of AIDS shall be reported to the Division of Epidemiology, DOH, in accordance with the Commonwealth's Regulations of Communicable and Non-communicable Disease reporting of AIDS and HIV. The CHCA/designee is responsible for this function. c. In addition to these requirements, the CHCA/designee shall maintain a cumulative listing of every inmate who tests positive for HIV. This list shall consist of the following information: (1) inmate name; (2) inmate number; (3) diagnosis; (4) date of diagnosis; (5) housing location; and 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-51 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (6) disposition. d. Strict confidentiality of all information related to these cases shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements identified in this procedures manual. 9. HIV/AIDS Discharge Care a. The purpos e of HIV/AIDS Discharge Care is as follows: (1) coordinate effective care and access supportive services for HIV positive individuals as they transition out of correctional facilities back to their communities; (2) prepare HIV positive inmates for community reintegration and conversely prepare communities (AIDS service organizations, social workers, healthcare workers, housing, etc.) for transitioning these inmates into needed services; and (3) the transition shall be achieved through a collaborative relations hip between the following agencies but not limited to: Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH), Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (DPW), and seven Regional AIDS Planning Coalitions. b. The procedures below shall be followed regarding HIV/AIDS Discharge Care: (1) The ICN/designee shall serve as the point of contact between the Department, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (PBPP), and the seven Regional AIDS Planning Coalitions. (2) The ICN/designee shall notify HIV/AIDS positive inmates of the existence of the Discharge Care Initiative Program and eligibility. The ICN/designee shall confirm the inmate's anticipated release date and explain the Discharge Care Initiative to the inmate six months prior to his/her release. Inmate education shal l include the following: (a) the completion of a DC- 108 (refer to DC- ADM 003, Attachment A ) is required prior to inmate contact with Case Manager (telephone or telemedicine); (b) the completion of the DC- 108 is also necessary prior to completion of the DC-584, Relea se Planning Form (Attachment 8- S); (c) the DC-108 signed by the inmate, carries a timeframe of 30 days (Mental Health) and 90 days (Medical information). The inmate in the six month Discharge Planning Program may need to sign several DC- 108 forms to comp ly with the timeframes and if updates in his/her care are to be recorded on the DC- 584; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-52 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (d) upon completion of the DC- 584, the form shall be filed under the TB/Immunizations Section of the medical record; (e) the inmate agreement to participate in teleconferenc ing to communicate with the Case Manager; (f) an explanation of the DC- 584; (g) ongoing education - prevention, treatment, good health habits; and (h) discharge with 30 days of medication. (3) If the inmate refuses to communicate via teleconferencing or videoconf erencing with the Case Manager, the ICN/designee shall notify the Regional AIDS Planning Coalition of the inmate's refusal. The ICN/designee shall document the refusal on the DC- 462, Inmate Health Care Plan, and on the DC -472. (4) When the inmate agrees to participate in the Discharge Care Initiative, the ICN/designee shall notify the Regional AIDS Planning Coalition representative in the appropriate inmate discharge area. (5) The Regional AIDS Planning Coalition representative shall send the Regional Agency' s discharge planning forms to the ICN/designee for the inmate's signature. The physician must sign the Employability Form. The signed Discharge Planning Form shall be faxed or e- mailed to the Regional Agency. (6) ICN/designee facilitates contact with the Regional AIDS Planning Coalition's Case Manager. This contact may be by phone or teleconferencing, as feasible. (7) The ICN/designee shall confirm with the Regional AIDS Planning Coalition's Case Manager that all forms and service care plans are in place for each inmate. (8) The ICN/designee shall complete the Discharge Planning Checklist (for HIV positive inmates) (Attachment 8 -T). (9) On the day of discharge, the inmate receives 30 days of HIV medications and a copy of the final DC- 584. c. The following is a Summ ary of the Referral Process: (1) The ICN/designee shall initiate the outcome report of the referral process. (2) The Regional AIDS Planning Coalition Case Manager assigned to each inmate shall provide the facility's ICN with a summary report of the placement activities for the respective inmate 30 days after discharge. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-53 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 H. Infection Control26 1. Infection Control Program Authority and Responsibility The Department's Infection Control Program is designed to provide a plan for the surveillance, prevention, and contro l of infection.27 a. Authority Overseeing the Infection Control Program and Responsibility is the Department's BHCS. 28 Chief, Clinical Services, BHCS Infection Control Coordinator (ICC), BHCS Facility Corrections Health Care Administrat or (CHCA) Facility Infection Control Nurse (ICN) The BHCS Chief of Clinical Services has the authority to institute any surveillance prevention or control measures or initiate studies when an inmate or staff member might be at risk. The ICC shall comm unicate/coordinate any directions from the Chief of Clinical Services to the facilities. b. Procedures Each facility shall maintain a current copy of the Department's Infection Control Manual. It shall be the responsibility of the ICC to ensure that the manual is reviewed annually and remains current. 2. Universal/Standard Precautions Universal/Standard Precautions shall be used in all patient care practices, regardless of the known infection status of the inmate. a. Under circumstances in which differentiation between body fluid types is difficult or impossible, all body fluids shall be considered potentially infectious materials. b. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) shall be provided for any employee and/or inmate who perform jobs that expose him/her to blood and body fluids. c. PPE includes, but is not limited to: 26 4-ACRS -4C-09 27 4-4354 28 1-ABC -4E-43 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection 2017 (1) gown, apron, lab coat - shall be worn when there is a possibility the HCW could contaminate his/her clothing with blood and body fluids; (2) goggles, full -face shield - shall be worn when an eye splas h is anticipated; (3) gloves (latex, vinyl, reusable rubber ) - shall be worn anytime the HCW could contaminate his/her hands with blood and body fluids; and (4) mask - shall be worn to prevent a splash in the HCW's mouth. 3.

Any worker (employee and inmate) must wash his/her hands immediately, or as soon as possible:29 (1) after removal of gloves or other PPE; (2) after caring for a patient (HCW) or after situations in which there has been contact with mucous membranes, blood, and other potentially infectious materials; (3) after using the restroom; (4) prior to performing invasive procedures; and (5) before meals; NOTE : The facility may choose either an antimicrobial agent or plain lotion soap as the type of hand cleaner to be used. b. Recommended hand wash procedures shall be performed for a minimum of 15 seconds: (1) wet hands under running water and apply liquid antimicrobial (pump dispenser ) soap; (2) scrub vigorously using running water and creating a lather. Scrub all areas of your hands (knuckles, cuticles, both sides of fingers, and under nails). Move or remove rings to clean underneath; 29 4-4354 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-55 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (3) rinse hands with fingers pointing downward to m ake sure contaminants go down the drain, not up the arms; (4) dry hands completely with a clean paper towel or under hot air; and (5) turn off faucet with a dry paper towel. 4. Housekeeping, Medical Department The Department/BHCS shall provide a clean medic al department for both inmates and staff.30 a. Cleaning Goal Regular cleaning with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved disinfectant removes the organisms from the surface, therefore decreases the environmental load.31 b. Procedures (1) All cleaning shall be performed using protective equipment. (a) gloves - at all times (latex, vinyl, or reusable rubber gloves); NOTE: If the reusable rubber gloves are cracked or have holes they shall be disposed of in the trash. A biohazard waste bag (Red Bag) shall be used only if the gloves are visibly contaminated with blood. (b) gown/apron - optional; and (c) mask and goggles - optional. (2) An EPA approved disinfectant shall be used for hard surfaces, but not limited to: (a) counter tops; (b) examination tables; (c) goose necked 31 4-4354 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-56 back boards; and (i) kick buckets. NOTE: The surface being disinfected must remain wet with the disinfectant solution for at least 10 minutes for full disinfectant action to occur. (3) Special e lectronic equipment shall be disinfected according to the manufacturer's directions, (electronic thermometer, glucometer, etc.). (4) Each facility shall develop a regular cleaning schedule for the medical department in accordance with this procedures manual . (5) Attention shall be paid to high areas where dust may accumulate. This is particularly important in an area where suturing or trauma care is provided. (6) If medical equipment needs repaired, it must be decontaminated prior to being shipped, or it must be labeled with a biohazard sign as to which parts remain contaminated. 5. Blood and Body Fluid Spills Department staff, as well as inmates, must use Universal/Standard Precautions whenever there is a risk of exposure to blood and/or body fluids. ALL blood and certain body fluids have the potential of transmitting one or more communicable disease. a. Staff Responsibilities (1) The Facility Manager will ensure at least six inmates are properly trained and assigned to an Inmate Blood and Body Fluid Detail to cleanup significant blood and body fluid spills within the facility. (2) Based on the size and complexity of the facility, additional Inmate Blood and Body Fluid Details may be needed. Determination will be by the Facility Manager and CHCA. (3) Requests for the Inmate Blood and Body Fluid Detail will be through the Shift Commander, who will activate the detail. (4) Upon activation of the Inmate Blood and Body Fluid Detail, the Department Head/Unit Manager/designee of the affected area will have the responsibility for supervising the Inmate Blood and Body Fluid Detail and any documentation required. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-57 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (5) Until the blood and body fluid spill area is cleaned up, the area will be secured, to the extent possible, to reduce potential exposure to staff and inmates. b. Infecti on Control Nurse (1) The ICN or Shift Nursing Supervisor shall monitor all blood and body fluid incidents via the following reports: (a) the Blood and Body Fluid Clean -up Report (Attachment 8 -U); and (b) the Employer's Report of Occupational Injury or Illness. (2) The ICN will also act as a resource or a consultant to Department Heads/Unit Managers and Shift Commanders in a blood and body fluid spill. c. Reporting (1) The Shift Commander will be contacted for all significant blood and body fluid spills immediately by the Department Head/Supervisor of the affected area. (2) The Department Head/Unit Manager or Supervisor will complete the Blood and Body Fluid Clean -up Report when any staff or inmate is required to clean up blood and body fluids. The completed form must be submitted to the ICN/designee by the end of his/her shift that day. (3) Blood and Body Fluid Reports will be maintained and filed by the ICN in the Medical Records area. (4) If cleanup does not result in exposure, blood and body fluid forms will be filed and maintained by the ICN for seven years or 30 years if exposure occurs. d. Blood and Body Fluid Waste (1) Handling and transporting of blood and body fluid waste will be in accordance with, at a minimum, the OSHA Standards, 29 CFR, \u00a71910.1030 Occupational Exposure to Blood Borne Pathogens. (2) The following is a summary of OSHA Standards, 29 CFR, \u00a71910.1030 Occupational Exposure to Blood Borne Pathogens: (a) Universal/Standard Precautions shall be observed to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infect ious materials. Under circumstances in which differentiation between body fluid types is difficult or impossible, all body fluids will be considered potentially infectious materials. (b) Appropriate PPE includes, but is not limited to, gloves, gowns, face shi elds or masks, mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, pocket masks, or other 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-58 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 ventilation devices. PPE will be considered \"appropriate\" only if it does not permit blood or other potentially infectious materials to pass through to or reach work clothes, street clothes, undergarments, skin, eyes, mouth or other mucous membranes under normal conditions of use and for the duration of time which the protective equipment will be used. (c) Appropriate PPE in the appropriate sizes is readily accessible at the work site. (d) If blood or other potentially infectious materials penetrate a garment, the garment shall be removed immediately or as soon as feasible and the area of the skin in contact with the potentially infectious material should be washed thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible. (e) All personal protective equipment shall be removed and bagged appropriately prior to leaving the work area. (f) Affected surfaces shall be decontaminated with disinfectant after completion of procedures immediately or as soon as feasib le when surfaces are subject to any spill of blood or other potentially infectious materials. (g) Universal/Standard Precautions shall be practiced when transporting blood and body fluid soiled laundry. (3) Adult Disposable Briefs and Colostomy Bags (a) Pennsyl vania Code, Title 25 Environmental Protection, under certain conditions considers adult disposable briefs and colostomy bags an exception to infectious waste. The items can have feces and no visible blood and be an exception to infectious waste. Title 25 defines infectious waste as human blood and body fluid waste. Body fluid waste includes semen, vaginal secretions, and amniotic fluid. It may also include the following items if blood is visible: feces, sputum, urine, and vomitus. (b) Inmates will not be issued infectious waste bags for colostomy bags or adult disposable briefs disposal. These items are to be placed in the regular trash for disposal and not in the Biohazard Waste Freezer , however, if a soiled disposable brief or colostomy bag contains visible blood, it is to be considered infectious waste and the inmate must report to the Medical Department with the item for proper infectious waste disposal and for an appropriate medical review/exam. (c) Inmates' adult disposable briefs or colostomy bags should be handled using universal precautions. e. Equipment/Materials 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-59 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 To provide consistency throughout the Department, labeled Blood and Body Fluid Clean -up Kits and equipment are to be provided.

(3) Hepatitis vaccines shall be offered to an inmate who is required to clean blood and body fluids. (4) Length of commitment to be served should be a consideration for the selection of an inmate for cleaning of blood and body fluids due to training requirements and the need for hepatitis vaccinations. 6. Transmission Based Isolation Precautions There are two tiers of the isolation precautions. In the first and most i mportant tier are precautions designed for the care of all patients in general population or in the infirmary. This is regardless of his/her diagnosis or presumed infection status. Implementation of these Universal/Standard Precautions is the primary strat egy for successful nosocomial infection control. The second tier precautions are designed only for the care of specified inmates who may be housed in isolation. These additional Transmission Based Precautions are for patients known or suspected to be infec ted by epidemiologically important pathogens spread by airborne or droplet transmission or by contact with dry skin or contaminated surfaces. 32 a. Universal/Standard Precautions (1) Synthesize the major features of Universal/Standard Precautions (designed to reduce the risk of transmission of blood -borne pathogens) and Body Substance Isolation (designed to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens from moist body substances). It then applies them to any inmate in general population or receiving care in the i nfirmary regardless of his/her diagnosis or presumed infection status. (2) Universal/Standard Precautions apply to: (a) blood; (b) all body fluids, except sweat and tears, regardless of whether or not they contain visible blood; 32 4-4354 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection (3) Universal/Standard Precautions are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection in the infirmary or in the facility. b. Transmission Based Precautions (1) Transmission base d precautions are designed for patients documented or suspected to be infected with highly transmissible or epidemiologically important pathogens for which additional precautions beyond Universal/Standard Precautions are needed to interrupt transmission in the infirmary. There are three types of Transmission Based Precautions: Airborne Precautions, Droplet Precautions, and Contact Precautions. They may be combined for diseases that have multiple routes of transmission. When used either singularly or in comb ination, they are to be used in addition to universal/standard precautions. (2) Transmission Based Isolation Precautions shall be used in the care of any inmate with a known or suspected infection. Accommodations shall be provided for any inmate requiring t ransmission -based precautions with the intent to prevent the spread of infection. The inmate may be housed in isolation or his/her own cell based on physician discretion. A color -coded card system, as recommended by the CDC is used to facilitate the barrier patient care procedures as an enhancement to the use of Universal/Standard Precautions. c. Isolation Procedures (1) The physician/PA may order the following types of precautions: (a) contact; (b) airborne; and/or (c) droplet (2) The inmate may be placed into the desi gnated isolation room and the appropriate isolation sign shall be placed on the room door. 33 (3) Every medical staff, physician, nurse, technician and others, are responsible for complying with isolation precautions and for tactfully calling observed infract ions to the attention of the offenders. A physician shall observe the proper isolation precautions at all times; he/she must teach by example. The responsibilities of the medical staff carrying out isolation precautions cannot be effectively dictated 33 4-4354 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-63 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 but m ust arise from a personal sense of responsibility. An inmate also has a responsibility for complying with isolation precautions. A physician and nurse shall explain the appropriate measures to the inmate. An important general inmate responsibility is hand washing after touching infective material and potentially contaminated articles. (4) Fundamentals of Isolation Precautions. (5) Rationale and Responsibilities for Isolation Precautions. d. Synopsis of Types of Precautions and Patients Requiring the Precautions (1) Universal/Standard Precautions Universal/Standard Precautions shall be used for the care of every inmate. (2) Airborne Precautions (a) Airborne Precautions are designed to reduce the risk of airborne trans - mission of infectious agents. Airborne transmis sion occurs by dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei (small particle residue two to five microns in size), evaporated droplets that may remain suspended in the air for long periods, or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganism s carried in this manner can be widely dispersed by air currents and may become inhaled by or deposited on a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient, depending on environmental factors; therefore, special air handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Airborne Precautions apply to an inmate known or suspected to be infected with epidemiologically important pathogens that can be transmitted by the airborne route. (b) In addition to Uni versal/Standard Precautions, use Airborne Precautions for an inmate known or suspected to have a serious illness transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei. Examples of such an illness include: i. Measles; ii. Varicella (including disseminated Zoster); and/or iii. Tuberculosis. (3) Droplet Precautions (a) Droplet precautions are designed to reduce the risk of droplet transmission of infectious agents. Droplet transmission involves contact of the conjunc - tivae or the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth of a susceptible person with large particle droplets (larger than five microns in size) 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-64 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 containing microorganisms generated from a person who has a clinical disease or is a carrier of the microorganism. Droplets are generated from the source person primarily during coughing, sneezing, or suctioning and bronchoscopy. Transmission via large particle droplets requires close contact between source and recipient persons. Droplets do not remain suspended in the air and generally travel only short distances (three feet or less) throu gh the air. Because droplets do not remain suspended in the air, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission. Droplet precautions apply to any patient known or suspected to be infected with epidemiologically import ant pathogens that can be transmitted by infectious droplets. (b) In addition to Universal/Standard Precautions, use droplet precautions for an inmate known or suspected to have a serious illness transmitted by large particle droplets. Examples of such an ill ness includes: i. Invasive Haemophilus Influenzae Type B disease, including Meningitis, Pneumonia, and Sepsis; ii. Invasive Neisseria meningitidis disease, including Meningitis, Pneumonia, and Sepsis; iii. other serious bacterial respiratory infections spread by dr oplet transmission include: (i) Diphtheria (pharyngeal); (ii) Mycoplasma pneumonia; (iii) Pertussis; and/or (iv) Pneumonic plague. iv. serious viral infections spread by droplet transmission include: (i) Adenovirus; (ii) Influenza; (iii) and/or (v) Rubella. (4) Cont act Precautions 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-65 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (a) Contact precautions are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of epidemiologically important microorganisms by direct or indirect contact. Direct contact transmission involves skin to skin contact and physical transfer of microorgani sms to a susceptible host from an infected or colonized person, such as occurs when personnel turn a patient, give a bath, or perform other patient care activities that require physical contact. Direct contact transmission can also occur between two patients (by hand contact) with one serving as the source of infectious microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host with a contaminated inanimate object usually in the patient's environment. Contact precautions apply to patients known or suspected to be i nfected or colonized with an epidemiologically important microorganism that can be transmitted by direct or indirect contact. (b) In addition to Universal/Standard Precautions, use contact precautions for an inmate known or suspected to have a serious illness easily transmitted by direct inmate contact or by contact wit h items in the inmate's environment. Examples of such an illness includes: i. gastrointestinal, respiratory, skin, or wound infections or colonization with multiple resistant organisms that have s pecial clinical and epidemiologic significance; ii. enteric infections with a low infectious dose or prolonged environmental survival include: (i) clostridium dificile; and Coli 0157:H7, Shigel la, or Hepatitis A. iii. skin infections that are highly contagious or that may occur on dry skin including: (i) impetigo; (ii) major (non- contained) abscesses, cellulitis, or decubiti; (iii) pediculosis; (iv) scabies; (v) zoster (disseminated immuno- compromised host); and (vi) viral/hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-66 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 NOTE : For further to Clinical Syndromes or Conditions Warranting Additional Empiric Precautions; Key to Types of Precautions and Isolation Precautions Needed for Selected Infections and Conditions maintained by the BHCS. 7. Simple Protective Isolation This particular type of precaution shall be initiated for the immuno- compromised patient. The patient is generally at increased risk for bacterial, fungal, parasitic and viral infections. The majority of the time the patient is infected with his/her own organisms. The following procedures shall be followed: a. Universal/Standard Precautions shall be used for all patients. b. Transmission -based precautions are recommended for specific patients as follows: (1) contact - wounds, etc.; (2) airborne - airborne organisms two - five microns in size; (3) droplet - airborne organisms five microns or larger; (4) staff and the patient shall practice hand washing; (a) teach the patient good hygiene to include: i. wash hands after us ing the toilet; and ii. wash hands before eating. (b) staff shall perform good hand washing (recommended time is 15 seconds) to include: i. after removing gloves; ii. after using the restroom; iii. between patient care; iv. before eating; and v. hands shall be washed frequent ly; therefore shall not be limited to the situations listed above. (5) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE); (a) Mask 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-67 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 Guidelines for wearing a mask include, but are not limited to, the following: i. a mask is not needed by everyone entering the patient's room; ii. a mask shall be worn by anyone entering the patient's room who has a minor sore throat or upper respiratory infection; iii. a mask is required by all staff if the patient is in either airborne or droplet precautions; and iv. the patient shall wear a mask when t ransported out of his/her room. (b) Gown, Gloves and Goggles As per Universal/Standard Precautions. NOTE: Hair covers and shoe covers on the staff do not contribute to any protection for the patient. There is no need for their use. (6) Patient care (a) Bath - A daily bath shall be provided. The patient may take his/her own bath. Special attention shall be paid to the axilla, groin, and rectal areas. (b) Oral care i. The nurse shall inspect the patient's mouth daily for open areas or bleeding. ii. The patient shall c lean his/her mouth twice a day with a soft toothbrush or a soft swab and toothpaste. iii. A gentle mouth rinse may be used (water or saline solution). iv. DO NOT FLOSS. (c) Nutrition i. Patient shall not receive fresh fruit or raw vegetables. NOTE: Organisms can be c arried to the patient on these foods. ii. Avoid foods with acid (juices, tomatoes) if the patient has sores in his/her mouth. 8. Specimen Collection 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-68 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 The facility shall collect and send specimens safely, and in compliance with community standards. The following procedures shall be followed: a. Every employee involved in specimen collection and processing shall follow Universal/Standard Precautions. b. Appropriate PPE shall be utilized as follows: (1) gloves - 100% of the time; (2) gown/apron - if clothing may be contaminated; and (3) mask/goggles - if splashing is anticipated. c. The specimen is collected from the inmate maintaining safety for both the patient and the staff. (1) Used needles shall be disposed of into a puncture resistant container. (2) When collecting sputum for AFB, the HCW shall wear an N -95 mask; and the procedures contained in this procedures manual shall be followed. (3) If the specimen is sent out to a laboratory, it shall be placed in an appropriate container. The specimen shall be correctly labeled with at least the inmate's name and number. In the case of HIV testing, the laboratory slip will be completed as directed by the DOH reporting of AIDS and HIV. A special laboratory plastic bag with a biohazard symbol shall be used for transporting the specimen. (4) You may double bag the specimen using the same type of laboratory plastic bag if there is a possibility the specimen may spill and put other people at risk. 9. Sterilization of Reusable Medical Items The Department/BHCS shall provide sterile equipment for use duri ng treatment or procedures as appropriate. Please note there is a separate Dental Infection Control Manual that differs slightly from this procedure manual. Please refer to Section 4, Dental Services of this procedures manual. a. There are three categories of medical items based on the degree of risk of infection. (1) Critical items Objects that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system and present high risk of infection if contaminated with any organism. They must be sterile (surgical instruments, cardiac and urinary catheters, implants and needles). 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-69 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (2) Semi come in contact with mucous membranes or with non- intact skin. These items must be free of all microorganisms with exception of spores. Semi - critical items require high- level disinfection (gluteraldehydes, other chemical germicides). Semi -critical items are respirator therapy equipment, anesthesia equipment, endoscopes, and hydrotherapy tanks. (3) Non-critical items Objects that come in contact with intact skin. They can be cleaned with a low - level disinfectant where they are used. Examples of non -critical items are blood pressure cuffs, crutches, bed rails, bedside tables, etc. b. There are three methods of decontamination.34 (1) Mechanical Wear gloves and hand scrub the item with s oap, water, and a brush. (2) Ultrasonic washer Removal of soil from the item by the generation of vibrations (ultrasonic waves) in the water. (3) Enzyme use Enzymes developed specifically for decontaminating instruments; this chemical aids in liberating protei n from the surface of the item, (crevices, rough areas, etc.). c. There are two types of sterilization used within the Department.35 (1) Steam Autoclave (tabletop sterilizer) (2) Chemical Use of a gluteraldehyde for 24 hours exposure time to achieve sterilizat ion. These chemicals are toxic and must be used following the manufacturer's directions. d. Every employee shall use PPE during the cleaning process. 34 4-4358 35 4-4358 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-70 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 NOTE: a surgical mask be worn under the full -face shield. e. Decontamination can be achieved by the use of any one or combination of the following:36 (1) scrub brush, soap and water; (2) soaking in the ultra sound cleaner; and (3) soaking in the ultra sound cleaner with an enzyme in the water. f. Visual inspection of the items while rinsing well under cool running water. If soil is found, repeat the decontamination process. g. When the items are free of all soil or debris, they are dried and packaged for steam sterilization. Scissors and hemostats shall be sterilized in an open position to facilitate steam exposure to all surfaces. h. Wrapping instruments. (1) The guidelines for the wrapping of instruments include the following: (a) instruments can be placed into special autoclave bags; (b) wrap instrument sets with special autoclave paper wrap. Secure the wrapped instruments with tw o pieces of sterilizer indicator tape; (c) all instrument packs shall be tagged with a date and load number; and (d) a log shall be kept of all sterilization loads. (2) Sterilizer indicators can be tape, colored strip on pouch, or indicator placed inside the pack. The indicator verifies the steam has penetrated the package or pack. i. Place the items into the sterilizer. DO NOT OVERFILL. Follow the manufacturer's directions for your autoclave. Steam sterilizer temperature should achieve 250F. Follow manufacturer's d irections for pressure and time. j. When cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer's directions for opening the autoclave. Allow bagged items to dry before removing. k. If the items are wet, they are not sterile. They shall be rewrapped and re- sterilized. 36 4-4358 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-71 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 l. Sterile items must be stored in a clean, dry area with attention to rotation of items, (first in, first out). Items are considered sterile as long as the wrap is intact. The procedures contained in Department policy 6.3.1 shall be followed. m. The facility too l control policy shall be followed. Care shall be taken by security during instruments search not to compromise the sterile packs. n. Biological Monitoring (1) Proper functioning of the sterilizer is verified by the use of biological indicators (attest, kill it). (a) A weekly spore test shall be performed on each autoclave and sent to an outside provider. (b) A record of this weekly monitor is maintained. It shall be available for inspection at any time. This record shall contain date/time/result/initials of staff con ducting test. (c) The manufacturer's directions shall be followed concerning the spore test. (2) Preventive Maintenance on the Autoclave Consult with the facility engineer or manufacturer's recommendations concerning preventive maintenance and establi sh a schedule for autoclave maintenance. Reference: (a) APIC - Infection Control and Applied Epidemiology (b) Asepsis, The Right Touch o. Biological Monitoring Procedure when the Autoclave Fails The Department/BHCS shall establish procedures to be used when inst ruments are not sterilized due to equipment failure. (1) A weekly spore test shall be sent to an outside provider. The ICN must maintain a log of test results and action follow -up. (2) If the spore test result is positive, this means the spore was not killed i n the sterilizer. Repeat the spore test to confirm the result. (3) The ICN notifies the ICC at the BHCS of the problem. If the second spore test is positive, shut down the autoclave. Notify the manufacturer of the autoclave for 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control CC at the BHCS of the shutdown and plans for a backup autoclave. (4) Every item that has been processed since the last failure shall be re- wrapped or repackaged and re- sterilized. There is no need to rewash these items. (5) If the facility has a second autoclave, it shall be used for the reprocessing. However, if this autoclave is not in regular use, a spore test shall be run to assure the back up autoclave is operating correctly. (6) A report shall be made by the ICN describing the incident and the recommended action follow -up. This report shall be kept on- site and available for inspection by Department Administrative staff. The incident shall be reported at the local monthly QI meeting on the monthly CHCA report, and reported at the Quarterly State QI meeting. A co py of the ICN report shall be sent to the ICC at the BHCS. 10. Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Procedure The facility shall collect, investigate, trend, and report the presence of nosocomial infections on an ongoing basis. a. Specific facilities shall be inv olved in monthly surveillance as determined by the ICC. However, if any facility identifies a nosocomial infection, they shall report it to the ICC. b. The ICN shall either begin by checking culture results or investigate the patients who have been placed on antibiotics. c. The ICN shall conduct chart reviews based on the culture report or antibiotic usage. Inmate interviews may also be helpful, along with visual inspection of the infection when possible (decubiti). d. Other sources of reference to facilitate the determination of a Nosocomial Infection are the ICC/BHCS and the facility Medical Director. e. Upon confirmation that the infection is nosocomial, the ICN shall ensure that the appropriate therapy has been initiated. If the appropriate therapy has not been initiated, the ICN shall bring this to the attention of the Medical Director. Appropriate therapy - an antibiotic that the organism is susceptible to as documented by culture. f. If a problem or trend is noted, the ICN notifies the ICC/BHCS. The problem is dealt with and the BHCS receives a report of the action taken at the next Regional Quarterly QI Meeting. g. Statistics are collected and reported by the ICN and sent to the ICC on a monthly basis. The report is due to the BHCS by the last working day of the next month (July report due by the end of August).

The DOH Program Analyst may assist in t his process when appropriate. (d) The results of the study shall be reported to the BHCS and other appropriate departments or facilities. 12. Varicella and Herpes Zoster The Department/BHCS shall provide guidance on the etiology, transmission, clinical management, and housing of inmates with Varicella (chicken pox) and Herpes Zoster (shingles). a. Varicella Varicella (chicken pox) is an acute viral disease most common during late winter and early spring. An inmate may present with sudden onset of fever and skin eruptions, which are maculopapular, vesicular, and leave a granular scab. Lesions occur in stages. Transmission occurs via direct contact, droplet, or airborne spread of secretions. Incubation period is as early as ten or as late as 21 days after exposure. Inmates are most contagious for one day before and five days after onset of lesions. (1) Isolation shall include: (a) place index case (inmate with diagnosed Varicella) into airborne and contact isolation until the lesions are dried and crusted; (b) staff with prio r history of Varicella shall care for the inmate; (c) pregnant staff shall be restricted from the isolation room unless cleared by the Medical Director; and (d) verification testing includes Antibody - IgM, IgG; and Direct - Immuno- fluorescence Antibody and Cultu re. (2) Methods of Control (a) Varicella contact investigation shall include: i. interview source case to discover contacts at risk and to determine possible source of infection; ii. interview the contact to determine if he/she is at risk (no previous history of infection); iii. assess if signs or symptoms are present. Varicella vaccine is useful if given within 72 hours post exposure. Varicella -Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG) is not very useful in this situation; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-77 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 iv. educate the contact concerning signs or symptoms so that he/she can report and be evaluated; v. special attention to susceptible contacts who are immuno- compromised; vi. restrict movement of the inmate; vii. monitor his/her status as he/she may be incubating disease and exposing others; viii. an inmate may not recreate, eat, s hower, or participate in school activities with the general population; and ix. this identified group shall not come in contact with other inmates for 10 - 21 days. (b) Action plan after identification of more than one case shall include: i. second verified case of Varicella on same block - quarantine (no movement in or out of block) the block and follow #1 (two weeks); ii. staff (or inmate) verified outside of block - curb movement in and out of site (but allow movement within the site) for two weeks; iii. protect immuno- compromised inmates (HIV) by initiating quarantine in a separate unit (infirmary, intake blocks, etc.); iv. test every HIV inmate with serology (antibody IgG, IgM); v. a HIV inmate with no serological evidence of past infection shall be offered acyclovir, valt rex, or famivir for two weeks; vi. a HIV inmate with recent infection shall be quarantined in the infirmary; vii. Varicella vaccine shall not be given to HIV inmates; viii. evaluate any immuno- compromised inmates for signs and symptoms. Pneumonia in these inmates can be serious; and ix. an inmate worker in the infirmary who is immuno- compromised shall be moved to another job until the index case has recovered and sent back to his/her cell. (c) Pregnant contacts (no history of Varicella) i. The Medical Director shall assess female inmate contacts that are or may be pregnant. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-78 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 ii. Any female employee who is or may be pregnant shall contact his/her physician. (d) Plan for employee protection i. Provide education concerning Varicella's mode of transmission and communicability. ii. If an employee has no history of Varicella, immunization against it, or immunity to it, he/she will be tested on site at the Department's expense for the antibodies against Varicella- Zoster virus (IgG); iii. Each employee is to maintain his/her scheduled work assignment pending the results of the blood test. iv. Notification of the results of their blood work will be provided to the employee by the Infection Control Nurse (ICN). v. If antibodies are absent, the employee will be restricted from inmate- contact work from day eight to day twenty -one exposure, in order to prevent the employee from exposing other inmates should he/she develop the illness. vi. Should the employee develop the disease, he/she shall be restricted from work until all skin lesions have dried and crusted. vii. Employees demonstrated to be non- immune (absent antibodies and no history of disease) shall be offered immunization at Department expense. NOTE: As a condition of employment, all future contact employee candidates, as of November 20, 2006, must demonstrate i mmunity to Varicella -Zoster virus, either by history of chicken pox, by history of immunization against it, or by demonstrating a serum antibody titer. (e) Reporting Every case of Varicella must be reported to the ICC at the BHCS. b. Herpes Zoster Herpes Zost er (shingles) is a local manifestation of recurrent or reactivated infection with Herpes varicella- zoster, which causes chicken pox. Vesicles with an erythematous base occur in crops along nerve pathways (dermatomes). They are usually unilateral. Severe pa in is common. The vesicles contain live virus and can transmit infection to non -immune contacts (i.e., people who have not previously had chicken pox). Virus is present in the lesions and the fluid that weeps from them until the lesions have dried- up. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-79 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (1) Isolation (a) patient who has localized or disseminated Herpes Zoster Place the patient in Airborne and Contact isolation precautions for the duration of the illness. (b) Normal patient with disseminated Zoster Place the patient in Airborne and Contact isolation precautions for the duration of the illness. (c) Normal patient with localized Zoster Follow Universal/Standard precautions until all lesions are crusted. (d) Staff with prior history of Varicella shall care for this inmate. (2) Methods of Control (a) Source is a normal patient and lesions are localized - transmission requires touching the lesions. i. Lesions that are covered pose little risk to a susceptible individual. ii. The patient shall be instructed in proper hand washing procedures if he/she touch the lesions. iii. The Medical Director shall determine the patient's ability to work. (b) Source is immuno- compromised with localized or disseminated Zoster (shingles), transmission is possible via airborne and contact (touching lesions). i. The source shal l be placed into Airborne and Contact precautions for the duration of the illness. ii. The medical department shall interview any contact to determine if he/she is at risk. The procedures for the control of Varicella shall be referred to when dealing with Her pes Zoster. 13. Resistant Organisms a. The goal of the Department/BHCS is to control the transmission of multiple resistant organisms. The following resistant organisms are discussed in this policy: (1) Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcal Aureus (MRSA); 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-80 Staphylococcal Epidermidis (MRSE) (coagulase- negative Staphylococcus). This is usually a skin contaminant not a pathogen. Contact precautions are required for an inmate known or suspected to be infected by pathogens transmitted by direct skin- to-skin contact (refer to 13. b. (5) and (6) below. b. The BHCS program to control the transmission of resistant organisms consists of the following: (1) educational resources (staff and inmates): (a) BHCS/ICC; and (b) CDC. (2) Identification, isolation (when appropriate), and treatment of infected cases; (3) documentation and tracking of infections system -wide; (4) reporting trends for resolution; (5) Universal/Standard Precautions is an approach to infection control. According to the concept of Universal/Standard Precautions, all human blood and body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and other bloodborne pathogens. Universal/ Standard Precautions shall be observed to prevent contact w ith blood or other potentially infectious materials. Under circumstances where fluid is difficult or impossible to identify (mixture of oil and body fluids), this fluid shall be considered potentially infectious material; and (6) contact precautions is the us e of barriers (gown and/or gloves) to reduce the risk of transmission of epidemiologically important microorganisms by direct or indirect contact (skin -to-skin contact). c. Hand Washing Hand washing is the best method for control of infections (refer to Su bsection H.3. above ). d. Housekeeping/Cleaning (refer to Subsection H.4. above) (1) An EPA approved environmental disinfectant shall be used. The active ingredient of this disinfectant will be either a quaternary ammonium compound or ammonium compound. It shoul d have a bacteria, tuberculosis, virus, and fungal kill. The following areas shall be cleaned: 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-81 Issued: 2017 rooms; and (c) the inmate's cell when he/she has been diagnosed with a resistant organism. (2) Regular cleaning will be directed to areas the inmate has touched (door knobs, soap dispenser, towel containers, faucets, etc.). The goal is to decrease the environmental load. (3) An EPA approved disinfectant will be used when cleaning equipment designated for use in contact isolation (stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, etc.). This cleaning/disinfection shall be as follows: (a) put on gloves; (b) wipe off blood pressure cuff; and (c) lay stethoscope on a clean paper towel and spray with the disinfectant. Allow stethoscope to remain wet with disinfectant for 10 minutes. (4) Terminal cleaning when the inmate is discharged from the infirmary or moved from his/her cell shall be done as follows: (a) use the environmental disinfectant on all surfaces; (b) walls are cleaned only if you see drainage on the walls; (c) curtains a round the bed or a privacy screen shall be removed and cleaned as appropriate; (d) discard all disposable items that are open; and (e) sterile items that are not opened can be placed in a large paper bag ( do not use a plastic bag). The date shall be written on t he bag and stored in the infirmary. These items can be used in seven days from the time they are place in the bag. Remember - if there is a concern that the package has been compromised, discard it . e. Laundry (1) Resistant organisms, like sensitive organism, are destroyed with normal washing. (2) All laundry will be handled with Universal/Standard Precautions. (3) No special processing needs to be followed. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-82 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (4) Red biohazard bags are not necessary. Red bags go to disposal. (5) Every inmate with a skin infection or draining wounds should receive clean clothing daily or as needed. (6) After an inmate has been successfully treated, he/she will be instructed to launder any soiled clothing in his/her personal property. f. Transportation of inmates infected with resistant organism (1) Universal/Standard Precautions shall be followed when transporting an inmate in accordance with Department policy 13.1.1. (2) There is NO need to disinfect the transport vehicle. (3) If there is a contamination with drainage, follow the blood/body fluid spill clean up procedures located in Subsection H. 5. above . g. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) (1) MRSA is the most common resistant organism. (2) Staphylococcus Aureus, a colonizer of humans, can easily become a pathogen under the correct conditions suc h as disrupted skin or mucosal barriers (central line access, endotracheal tube placement, boils, picking at skin, etc.). (3) Staphylococcus Aureus can be MRSA or Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus ( MSSA). MRSA has not demonstrated the ability to spontaneously evolve from MSSA during the course of therapy. (4) MRSA is not easily distinguished from MSSA; therefore, the initial antibiotic should be chosen to cover MRSA. (5) Colonization - The organism is present on skin or environmental surfaces, but without tissue invasion or damage. No treatment for colonization. (6) Infection - The organism has penetrated into skin or other tissue, now causing tissue breakdown, redness, purulence, and possible invasion into adjacent tissue or the blood stream. Treatment is needed for infection control. h. Inmate presenting with skin eruptions (eczema, seborrhea, spider bites, etc.) (1) The patient is at risk for staphylococcal infections (resistant or sensitive to antibiotics) because the integrity of his/her skin is compromised by the underlying condition. Any wounds that are draining pose the risk of skin -to-skin transmission of Staphylococcal infection. The inmate shall be place in contact isolation and Universal/Standard Precaution guidelines are followed. In addition: 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-83 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 2017 (a) wear glov es when entering the room; (b) change gloves after contact with wound drainage or potentially infected material; (c) remove gloves before leaving the patient area and place in contaminated trash (red bag); (d) immediately wash hands with an antimicrobial soap; and (e) avoid touching contaminated surfaces. (2) The patient should be identified promptly and referred to the facility physician/PA. (3) Inmate education must be provided to minimize scratching of lesions and to alert the inmate to seek medical attention as soon as abscesses or furuncles (boils) are detected. (4) The physician/PA should manage skin eruptions and should be alert to the presence of early abscesses. i. An inmate presenting with abscesses or other draining skin lesions (1) Skin infections are most commonly caused by MRSA or MSSA. (2) Any inmate with a draining skin lesion or abscess must be identified and referred to the facility physician/PA as soon as possible. (3) If uncertain whether incision and drainage (I&D) is necessary, the physician/PA may aspirate any questi onable abscess or draining skin lesion, and perform I&D if pus is present and/or the lesion is too large to manage with moist heat. If I&D is performed, administration of prophylactic antibiotics one hour before the procedure is recommended for patients under specific conditions (valvular heart disease, prosthetic joints, etc.) located in Subsection H.13. M. below. (4) A culture and sensitivity (C&S) should not be obtained routinely, but only if the lesion does not respond to initial therapy or for potentially difficult infections (large or involving deeper structures, or in the presence of prosthetic joints or valves, etc.). Surgical wound infections shall be cultured. (5) The inmate will not be charged a co- pay. j. An inmate presenting with other skin infections us ually caused by other organisms when Staphylococcal Aureus must be considered a possible cause (cellulites or impetigo). 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-84 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (1) If a Staphylococcal infection is a possibility when choosing the use of an antibiotic, the antibiotic choice should be effective for both Streptococci and Staphylococci. (2) Up to 30% of community -acquired Staphylococcus infections are MRSA; antibiotics should be chosen accordingly. k. Opportunities for identification of skin infections. (1) Reception (a) the nurse shall ask the inmate if he/she has any open draining area on his/her skin, or any rash; (b) the nurse shall inspect these areas and direct the inmate promptly to the physician/PA, as necessary; and (c) the initial reception screening shall be documented on the DC -471, Initial Reception Screeni ng/PV Returns Greater Than 90 Days. (2) Sick Call (a) an inmate is encouraged to report any rash or open areas on his/her skin to the Medical Department; and (b) any staff member who is aware of an inmate with a rash, or open areas, on his/her skin shall direct the inmate to the Medical Department. (3) Identification and reporting of resistant organisms (a) When the inmate presents to the Medical Department with an early abscess, or open draining skin lesion, the physician/PA shall evaluate the need for I&D and appropriate treatment. (b) Surface cultures will be performed only: i. when the knowledge of this culture result will impact the inmate's health and treatment; and ii. when cleared with the BHCS Assistant Medical Director, the contracted health care provider Regional Medic al Director, or the ICC. (c) The inmate shall be placed in contact isolation if simply covering the wound is not expected to provide effective isolation. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-85 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (d) All cultures are reported monthly to the BHCS on the Resistant Organism Monthly Report (Attachmen t 8-W). In addition, a copy of every culture report shall be forwarded to the BHCS from the lab. (e) MRSA cases shall be reported to the BHCS ICC on the Resistant Organism Monthly Report. This form must be sent to the BHCS ICC on the last working day of the month. l. Contact isolation (1) Contact isolation shall be followed when giving care to a patient with Staphylococcus aureus in accordance with Subsections H.13.h. 1. above and H. 13. L. 6. below . Contact isolation precautions are designed to reduce the risk of transmi ssion of microorganisms by direct or indirect contact. For example: (a) skin-to-skin physical contact; (b) hand- to-hand contact; and/or (c) contaminated inanimate objects in the inmate's environment. (2) Contact isolation (single cell or housed with another patient(s ) with like condition and sensitivity) shall be instituted under the following circumstances for any inmate: (a) unwilling/unable to understand follow -up management or who is non - compliant with antibiotic treatment or therapy; (b) with a large abscess or draining skin lesion that cannot be adequately covered and kept clean and dry (scalp, decubitus, etc.); and/or (c) who is immunocompromised or who has cellulites, lymphangitis, or sepsis as a complication. The patient should be hospitalized or placed in an infirmary setting as his/her level of care warrants. (3) Designated medical equipment The patient in contact isolation shall have a designated sphygmomanometer (blood pressure machine) and stethoscope. These items shall be used on one particular patent. (4) Cleaning of designated equipment All medical equipment (blood pressure machine, stethoscope, thermometer, etc.) shall be disinfected before removal from a contact isolation room. The procedure for disinfecting equipment is as follows: 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-86 Issued: 1/9/2017 disinfec tant on the piece of equipment; (c) 10 minute contact time with disinfectant; (d) wipe dry as appropriate (thermometer, stethoscope, etc.); (e) remove gloves; and (f) wash hands. (5) Contact isolation is not necessary when the infected lesion is: (a) small; (b) easily covered; and (c) the inmate voices understanding of the treatment regimen and is compliant. (6) An inmate on contact isolation should be assigned to a designated shower rather than showering with the general population. This is not necessarily a separate shower facility . Designated infection showers are differentiated from standard showers in that: (a) an inmate on contact isolation does not shower at the same time as the general population; (b) an inmate on contact isolation shall shower alone or with an inmate with like conditions and sensitivity. This shall be determined by the Medical Department; (c) the shower and dressing areas are cleaned with a EPA approved disinfectant before the general population uses the shower again; (d) an inmate is issued two towels and is instructed t o use one to sit upon as a barrier when using the bench in the dressing area; and (e) if the inmate is physically able, he/she shall disinfect the shower using the EPA approved disinfectant. (7) PPE used in contact isolation (a) wear gloves when you touch the pat ient; (b) wash hands after glove removal; 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-87 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (c) wear a gown to protect clothes from contamination; (d) masks are not necessary. These organisms are not airborne. However, when suctioning any patient with pneumonia, or when within three feet of a patient who is active ly/productively coughing, the use of a surgical mask would be understood as Universal/ Standard Precautions; (e) soiled/contaminated dressings shall be disposed of in a red biohazard bag; and (f) provisions shall be made for biohazard/red bag disposal if the dr essings are changed in the infirmary or by the inmate. (8) Contact isolation may be discontinued when: (a) the infection has responded to the antibiotic; and (b) there is no longer cellulites, lymphangitis, or drainage from a clinically open lesion (decubitus). (9) When contact isolation procedures are discontinued the inmate may return to the general population with education concerning: (a) personal hygiene/hand washing; (b) the need to notify the Medical Department if he/she has a repeat infection; (c) terminal cleaning of h is/her cell in accordance with Subsection H.13. d. above ; and (d) laundry in accordance with Subsection H.13. e. above . (10) Transfer of an inmate with skin infections to another facility. (a) The sending facility shall call the receiving facility and provide a detail ed report of the inmate's care. (b) The inmate shall be evaluated by the receiving facility for any skin problems (rash open draining areas on his/her skin). (c) If there is a skin problem present, the inmate shall be seen by the physician/PA for clearance or appropriate treatment. (d) Inter-facility transfer screening shall be documented on the DC-479, (refer to Section 2 - Initial intake and Screening and Medical Clearance for Transfer, Attachment 2- A). 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-88 Issued: 1/9/2017 2017 m. Treatment For treatment with antibiotics is planned: (1) TMP/SMX (Bactrim -DS\u00ae, one BID) is recommended for initial empiric therapy. If the patient is allergic to sulfa or trimethoprim, clindamycin is the suggested alternative for initial therapy. (2) Because of the prevalence of resistance t o these drugs, treatment of suspected S. aureus infections with a cephalosporin or erythromycin is not recommended. (3) Antibiotic ointments can be used to prevent the wound from becoming infected, but are ineffective in the treatment established infection. (4) If prophylactic antibiotics are used before I&D, the patient should be given one dose of TM/SMX (Bactrim -DS\u00ae or Clindamycin 300 mg orally) if he/she has no known allergies to these drugs. (5) Anti-Staphylococcal antibiotics may be kept on person or distribute d at the pill window at the discretion of the physician/PA. (6) Duration of therapy is based on clinical judgment, but generally should not be less than seven days, and should extend several days past clinical resolution, once the decision to start antibiotic s has been made. (7) Consultation with the BHCS ICC and the Assistant Medical Director(s) can be sought in select cases. n. Management of patients with treatment failure or recurrent Staphylococcus skin and soft tissue infections (1) Recurrent Staphylococcus skin infection (a) An inmate may be prone to develop repeated skin infections. This may be due to poor personal hygiene. The ICN shall provide education in personal hygiene to every inmate. This education shall be reviewed with the inmate when MRSA is diagnosed. (b) An inmate/patient shall be considered to have recurrent skin and soft tissue infection when he/she has three or more infections in a six month period. (c) The current infections shall be reported to the BHCS, ICC. (d) The recurrent infections should be cultured and treated as per culture and sensitivity report. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-89 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (2) Other factors to consider in the management of a patient with recurrent Staphylococcus skin and soft tissue infections. Evaluation of personal hygiene includes: (a) An inmate/patient should be evaluated for adequacy of showering and bathing; a patient should generally have a daily bath or shower with soap and water. (b) During therapy, all clothing, including socks, underwear, towels, bath clothes, and items including bedding, should be replaced with clean item s daily. (c) An obese inmate/patient with skin folds needs to keep the skin in these folds dry to prevent maceration of the skin. This may require use of powder applied after bathing. Caution that the overuse of powder may increase the problem with obese pati ents and skin folds. (3) Evaluation of an inmate/patient for underlying systemic disease/condition (a) Staphylococcus skin and soft tissue infections are associated with underlying diseases including diabetes mellitus, obesity, HIV infection, and other diseases and/or drugs causing immunosuppression. (b) An inmate/patient with recurrent infection should be evaluated for underlying predisposing diseases and conditions as indicated. i. history and physical exam; ii. urine glucose, fasting blood sugar; iii. HIV test; iv. referral to specialty clinics as indicated; and v. principles of hygiene should be re -emphasized. (c) Control underlying disease. i. obtain good control of blood glucose for diabetics; ii. encourage weight reduction for obese patients; iii. optimize therapy for patients with HI V infections/AIDS; and iv. use alternate drugs in place of glucocorticoids where possible. (d) Evaluate and treat any existing dermatological diseases. 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-90 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 i. diagnose and treat any underlying skin disease; and ii. refer to dermatology clinic as indicated. (e) The Site Medical Director shall consider an infectious disease consultation if an inmate has three or more documented skin infections in a six month period. The BHCS Medical Director and the Contracted Health Care Provider State Medical Director shall be notified pri or to requesting this consult. (f) A one- on-one education counseling session should be conducted with the inmate to minimize the dissemination (spread) of microorganisms by colonized patients. o. Job assignment considerations for patients with recurrent Staphy lococcus skin and soft tissue infection. An inmate who experiences three or more of these infections in six months shall not be assigned to work in the following areas in accordance with Section 3 of this procedures manual: (1) Medical Department; (2) Barber Shop; and (3) Food Services. p. Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (Coag- Negative Staph) or Multiple Resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) The common everyday variety of this organism results in a culture/sensitivity report that is multiply resistant. (1) This organism is normal skin flora. (2) Pathogenicity: (a) Coagulase Negative Staph becomes a pathogen when there is a prosthetic device in the patient (heart valve, total knee replacement, total hip replacement); and (b) the organism has established the infection on t he device. (3) Transmission occurs through: (a) the hands of the care giver; and/or (b) medical devices (IV catheter, etc.). 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 8 - Communicable Disease s and Infection Control 8-91 Issued: 1/9/2017 Effective: 1/17/ 2017 (4) Universal/Standard Precautions shall be followed at all times. No isolation is necessary. (5) Treatment shall include: (a) wound care; and (b) antibiotic use based on the culture/sensitivity report. (6) Reporting This organism shall be reported to the BHCS ICC when the infection involves a medical device such as, but not limited to: (a) heart valve; (b) total hip replacement; and (c) total knee replacement. q. Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) (1) Organism normally found in stool. (2) The organism becomes resistant when Vancomycin is widely used (when treating MRSA).

Background 1. This Hepatitis C Protocol for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (PA DOC) provides clinical guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of inmate patients with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). 2 2. Introduction a. HCV is a slowly progressive disease, usually requiring decades to progress to cirrhosis; however, the natural history of HCV is variable and not all patients with chronic HCV will develop cirrhosis during their lifetime. Of every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately: 15- 25 will clear the virus from their body and be naturally cured with no risk of future liver disease; 75- 85 will develop chronic infection; 60- 70 with chronic infection will develop chronic liver disease; 5- 20 with chronic infection will develop cirrhosis of the liver over a period of 20- 30 year s; and 1- 5 will die from the consequences of chronic infection, such as end- stage cirrhosis or liver cancer (for content references, please see Subsection G.1. below ). b. The goal of Hepatitis C anti -viral treatment is to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV virus in the blood , 12 or more weeks after completing anti -viral treatment. B. Screening 1. All new intakes will be screened at their home institutions utilizing the Hepatitis C Antibody test. 3 Anyone may refuse testing by signing a DC- 462, R elease from Responsibility f or Medical Treatment Form. 2. The Infection Control Nurse (ICN) will review positive antibody results with all inmates , whether it be at intake or later during incarceration. The Medical Director/designee will order a confirmatory Hepatitis C Ribonucleic Acid ( RNA ) Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR) test (viral load). Recommended immunizations (Hepatitis A and B) , counseling /education regarding this disease, and literatur e explaining transmission of Hepatitis C will be provided during that encounter. The patient wil l be placed on the annual Influenza vaccination list maintained by the ICN. 3. Inmate patients with documented (+) Hepatitis C Antibody test should not be retested, but entered into tracking. 1 to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 20 - Hepatitis C Protocol 20-2 Issued: 2/16/2021 Effective: 2/23/2021 4. Inmate patients who have a documented undetectable Hepatitis C Quantitative PCR may become re- infected while out on parole. If they return to the PA DOC, the Medical Director/designee shall order a repeat viral load on intake. C. Tracking For all patients wi th a positive HCV antibody test , the ICN will maintain a current Hepatitis C Tracking Spreadsheet (Attachment 20-A) in Excel format. This spreadsheet will be maintained on the Infection Control SharePoint Site . D. Chronic Care Clinic4 1. All patients who have chronic Hepatitis C (confirmed by a detectable viral load) will be entered into the Liver Disease Chronic Care Clinic. Initial screening will utilize the APRI (AST [Aspartate Aminotransferase] to Platelet Ratio Index) . The ICN will confer with the Site Medical Director to determine if the patient's diagnosis is : a. F0-F2 (no fibrosis, mild fibrosis, or moderate fibrosis) . APRI < 1.5 unless otherwise documented ; b. F3 (advanced fibrosis). APRI 1.5 -2.0 unless otherwise documented ; and/or c. F4 (cirrhosis). APRI > 2.0 unless otherwise documented. 2. Patients who are antibody positive only (confirmed by an undetectable viral load) do not have chronic Hepatitis C and will be followed in Chronic Care Clinic at the discretion of the Site Medical Director, if the patient exhibits signs or symptoms of liver disease. Patients wh o have been treated with medication will continue to be followed in Chronic Care Clinic, whe ther or not t hey achieved an SVR. 3. At a minimum , the following will be documented in a Progress Note during the Chronic Care C linic encounter : a. Subjective: (1) symptoms of cirrhosis or liver failure; (2) history of ascites, encephalopathy, or esophageal varices (bleeding or not) ; (3) estimated date of contracting the disease; and (4) any recent admissions to the Infirmary, emergency room ( ER), or hospital. 4 5-6A-4350 (5-ACI-6A-07), 5-6A-4359 (5-ACI-6A-18) 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 20 - Hepatitis C Protocol 20-3 Issued: 2/16/2021 Effective: 2/23/2021 b.

Evaluation for Treatment with Anti -Viral Medication 6 1. The PA DOC will utilize the Federal Bureau of Prisons ( FBOP ) Priorit y Criteria as listed in the \"Evaluation and Management of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection Clinical Practice Guidelines, January 2018.\" (please refer to S ubsection G.2. below ) 2. Determining whether PA DOC p riority criteria for treatment are met is an important part of the initial evaluation and ongoing management of inmates with chronic HCV infection. Although all patients with chronic HCV infection may benefit from treatment, certain cases are at higher risk for complications or disease progression and require more urgent consideration for treatment. 3. The PA DOC will use Fibrosure to determine fibrosis scoring for patients without a diagnosis of cirrhosis who have an APRI > 0. 5, FIB-4 > 1.45 , or select patients as clinically indicated . 4. The DOC has established priority criteria to ensure that those with the greatest need are identified and treated first (for content reference, please see Subsection G.2. below ). The DOC Chief of Clinical Services will provide periodic guidance on specific strategies for implementing these priority levels: a. Priority Level 1 - High Priority for Treatment (1) Advanced hepatic fibrosis : (a) APRI > 2.0; (b) Metavir or Batts/Ludwig stage 3 or 4 on liver biopsy, Elastography, or Fibrosure; or (c) known or suspected cirrhosis. (2) Liver Transplant Recipients (3) HCC (4) Comorbid Medical Conditions Associated with HCV, i ncluding: 6 5-6A-4359 (5-ACI-6A-18) 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 20 - Hepatitis C Protocol 20-6 Issued: 2/16/2021 Effective: 2/23/2021 (a) Cryoglobulinemia with renal (b) certain types of lymphomas or hematologic malignancies; and/or Porphyria cutanea tarda. (5) Immunosuppressant Medication for a Comorbid Medical Condition For example, certain chemotherapy agents and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors . Such cases will be considered for prioritized treatment on an individual basis. (6) Continuity of Care for those already started on t reatment , including inmates who are newly incarcerated in the PA DOC. b. Priority Level 2 - Intermediate Priority for Treatment (1) Evidence of progressive fibrosis . (a) APRI > 0.5. (b) Stage 2 fibrosis on liver biopsy, Elastography, or Fibrosure. (2) Comorbid medical conditions associated with more rapid progression of fibrosis. (a) Coinfection with Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). (b) Comorbid liver disease (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, steatohepatitis). (c) Diabetes Mellitus. (3) Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) with Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR) < 59 mL/min per 1.73 m squared . c. Priority Level 3 - Low Priority for Treatment (1) Stage 0 to stage 1 fibrosis on liver biopsy, Elastography, or Fibrosure. (2) APRI < 0.5. (3) All other cases of HCV infection meeting criteria for treatment, as noted below under Other Criteria for Treatment . 13.2.1, Access to Health Care Procedures Manual Section 20 - Hepatitis C Protocol 20-7 Issued: 2/16/2021 Effective: 2/23/2021 5.

Inmates with Priority Level 1 criteria who are outside these parameters may be considered on an individual basis ; e. have a life expectancy > 12 months; f. demonstrate a willingness and an ability to adhere to a rigorous treatment regimen. Inmates with a history of non- compliance may be offered a one month trial of taking a multi -vitamin daily under direct observation. If successful, they may be considered for treatment on an individual basis ; and g. demonstrate a willingness and an ability to abstain from high- risk activities while incarcerated. Inmates with evidence for ongoing high- risk behavior, e.g. misconducts for illicit drug use or tattoos, will be considered for treatment on an individual basis. Referral for evaluation and treatment of substance abuse is required. 6. The first level of screening patients for treatment with anti -viral medications will occur at the patient's home site , during Chronic Care Clinics . The review will be conducted utilizing the Hepatitis C Treatment Referral Form in the electronic health record and will be conducted by the Corrections Health Care Administrator ( CHCA), ICN, and Site Medical Director , who will look for the presence of any exclusionary indications list ed above. 7. If the CHCA deter mines that there are no exclusionary indications to anti-viral treatment (see Subsection E.4. above ), and the APRI > 0.5 or F IB-4 > 1.45, a Fibrosure test needs to be ordered by on -site providers .
