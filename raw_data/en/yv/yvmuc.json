In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Liver is the organ that holds the anger and irritability, which are associated emotions for this organ. Somebody who has a lot of inappropriate anger will develop some kind of Liver pattern and/or pathology. At the same time, weakened Liver can expressed itself in these feelings. Chicken or egg, don't be angry - visit there but don't stay there J - Avoid toxic chemicals. This is self-explanatory concept; avoid all that your overworked Liver cannot process easily. Here are only a few environmental \"offenders\" to your Liver - chemical cleaners, medications, anything and everything artificial (our ancestors did not have to worry about this one!), flavorings, drinking and eating from plastic dishes/bottles. Containers and/or eating from canned food. - Avoid drugs and alcohol. Really. - Eat healthy breakfast. Skipping your breakfast will do a number on your Liver - it will slow down your metabolism, lower your energy levels leading to sluggish Liver. Eating foods rich in saturated fats will, in fact, benefit your Liver - they will restore your glycogen levels, which help your Liver function properly throughout the day. - Go to bed at the same time every night, preferably 10pm (I know, right!). The liver is most active between 1 am - 3 am and needs your cooperation - if you're not getting enough sleep you're not allowing your Liver to be at it's best during peak hours (1-3). - Take herbs - Milk Thistle, Dandelion, Reishi Mushrooom and Turmeric. - sprouts, beets, carrots, parsley, dandelion leaves, and artichoke hearts. - Stop over exercising. You may not know this, but - too long/extensive work out causes the production of free radicals that your Liver may not have resources to deal with in timely manner. Take a little break and love thy Liver.
