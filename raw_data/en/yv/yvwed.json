METHODS: A two-year follow-up clinical study was conducted. Patients with asthma were treated by applyingaherbalpasteontotheFeishu(BL13)andFengmen (BL 12) acupoints on the three hottestdays of summer, according to the traditional Chi-nese calendar, from 2008 to 2010. During atwo-year follow-up, these patients were asked tofill out a questionnaire evaluating asthma degree,exacerbation frequency, concomitant medicationsand self-satisfaction. The self-rate and doctor-re-port outcomes obtained in parallel were evaluatedtoassesstheefficacyofSAAT. RESULTS: A total of 527 asthma patients were ini- tially enrolled in this study, of which 97 elderly pa- tients and those with more severe cases of asthmawere lost to follow-up. Thus, a total of 430 patients were valid for analysis using self-rate data. Never-theless, occasional negative returns were obtained;almost all of the outcomes were rated as \"Nochange\", \"Moderate effective\", or \"Very effective\". Inaddition, 391 (91.4% ) patientswere somewhat improved after SAAT in 2009, andfurther improvement was observed in 2010. AfterSAAT, the average asthma-degree score decreasedfrom 5.3 in 2008 to 4 in 2009 and, subsequently to3.5in2010. CONCLUSION: With pronounced patient satisfac- tion, SAAT can reduce the exacerbation severity and frequency, concomitant medications and asth-ma degree. Prolonging the treatment course mightenhancetheefficacyofSAAT. \u00a92015JTCM.Allrightsreserved. Key sticking Asthma; Chinese medicine, tradi- tional INTRODUCTION Asthma is one of the most prevalent diseases, affecting 21JTCM|www.journaltcm.com February15,2015 |Volume35 |Issue1|WuXQetal./ClinicalStudy as many as 300 million people and accounting for ap- proximately 250 000 annual deaths worldwide.1De- spite improvements in the quality of care, there is no overall global downward trend in the prevalence ofasthma. 2The number of asthmatic patients was estimat- ed to increase by 100 million individuals by 2025.1In the United States, the prevalence of asthma was 8.5%of the population in 2012, 3and both the period preva- lence and the current prevalence of asthma have consis- tently increased during the last decade.4The prevalence of asthma in China is much lower than that in Westerncountries and varies between different regions in thecountry. 5In large cities, the asthma prevalence is 11 percent and rising.6A literature survey indicated that the current average prevalence of asthma for childrenin China had increased from 0.9% in 1990 to 1.5% in2000. 7It was also estimated that the rates of asthma prevalence have increased as much as 40 percent over the last five years in China.6 Asthma affects the lives of patients and their families,including their quality of life, productivity at work andschool, and health care use, and this disease can evenresult in death. An estimated 15 million disability-ad-justed life years have been lost per year worldwide dueto asthma. 1Treating patients with severe asthma would be a heavy burden on healthcare resources and econom-ics. For instance, the financial burden on patients withasthma in different Western countries ranges from$300 to $1300 per patient per year. 8In 2007, in the United States, the total incremental cost of asthma tosociety was $56 billion, where the productivity lossesdue to morbidity and mortality accounted for $3.8 and $2.1 billion, respectively. 9Prescription drugs have typi- cally been used to treat chronic pulmonary disease, po-tentially creating heavy economic burden for asthmaticpatients. This burden is particularly heavy in develop-ing countries due to limited health care. Complementa-ry treatment methods have emerged due to their lowercost and lighter side effects. Several complementarytreatment methods have been developed, such as acu-puncture, moxibustion (direct and indirect), herbalremedies, inspiratory muscle training, and massage andchiropractic therapy. In China, acupuncture and moxi-bustion are the common treatment methods. Summeracupoint application treatment (SAAT), also known asSanfujiu 10is one type of direct moxibustion adminis- tered in the summer through the direct application ofan irritating herbal paste to acupuncture points. 11Un- like normal direct moxibustion, SAAT substitutes theuse of moxa with herbal paste during disease treat-ment. Several clinical studies have shown a favorableeffect of SAAT for asthma. 12Due to the cheap price and fast and convenient application, SAAT has been ex-tensively used in Chinese hospitals and clinics. Moreimportantly, there is almost no risk of burns for pa-tients with SAAT compared with other moxibustiontreatments.Despite the extensive use of SAAT on asthmatic pa- tients in China, the therapeutic effects of SAAT re-mains insufficiently understood. Thus, we conducted aclinical observation two-year follow-up. MATERIALSANDMETHODS StudypopulationWe conducted a two-year follow-up study based on pa-tients from 3 clinical centers in China. They were Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of ChineseMedical Science (Beijing), The First Hospital of Hu-nan University of Chinese Medicine (Changsha, Hu-nan), The Second Hospital of Anhui University of Chi-nese Medicine (Hefei, Anhui). Patients diagnosed withasthma according to previously established guidelines 13 were consecutively recruited during July 19th to Au-gust 18th in 2008. We excluded patients (a) aged < 2years; (b) during pregnancy or lactation; (c) with aller-gies to the herb or accessories; (d) temperature 37.5Celsius degree; (e) producing yellow and thick sputum;(f) exhibiting bronchiectasis, endobronchial tuberculo-sis, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, and uncontrolleddiabetes; or (g) previously diagnosed with severe heart,liver or kidney disease, mental disease, or cancer. Acomplete description of the patient selection criteriahas been reported elsewhere. 14This study protocol (Registration No. ChiCTR-OCH-10001292), for allclinical centers, was approved through the Ethics Com-mittees of the Institution of Basic Research in ClinicalMedicine, China Academy of Chinese Medicine. Writ-ten informed consent was provided by each study par-ticipants or his/her guardian. Treatmentmethod The patients were treated with SAAT at each clinic.The into a powder, mixed and made into pasteusing old ginger juice. The resulting paste was cut intosmall cubes of 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm in size and glued onto amedical tap for SAAT. For clinical treatment, the medi-cal taps with herbal pastes were placed onto the select-ed acupuncture points, remaining at least 2 h. Thestandard acupoints included Feishu (BL (BL 12) are impor-tant acupoints in the pathway of meridian.The appealing associations between Feishu (BL 13)and/or Fengmen (BL 12) with asthma have been previ-ously reported. 15,16The treatments were conducted from July 19th to August 18th (3 times, 10 days per time), the hottest days in summer, according to the lu-nar calendar, in 2008, 2009 and 2010. 22JTCM|www.journaltcm.com February15,2015 |Volume35 |Issue1|WuXQetal./ClinicalStudy Datacollection The patients were enrolled and initially treated at thescreening centers by well-trained doctors during the Ju-ly 19th to August 18th in 2008. The information col-lected before treatment included age, gender, diseaseand treatment (SAAT) history. In subsequent (2009and 2010), all patients were invited for return visits toreceive continued treatment. An assessment of the effi-cacy of the last period treatment was obtained usingsynthetic indicators. Because neither active nor shamacupuncture treatments significantly affected pulmo-nary function, according to Choi et al 17using pulmo- nary function as a primary outcome would be inappro-priate in clinical investigation. Instead, doctor-reportoutcomes were used in this study. At the return visits,the patients completed a questionnaire, assessing exac-erbation severity and frequency, concomitant medica-tions and self-satisfaction. After each treatment period,the outcomes assessed us-ing a visual analog scale, from 0 (mildest) to 10 (sever- est). 18The treatment procedure, follow-up and data col- lection are schematically illustrated in Figure 1. Dataanalysis Descriptive statistics were generated to examine the de-mographic and disease characteristics of the patients.Figures showing the changes in the severity, exacerba-tion frequency, concomitant medications and self-satis-faction were constructed. Differences between groupswere tested using the ttest orChi-squared test, depend-ing on the nature of the variables. P< 0.05 was consid- ered statistically significant. The data were analyzed us-ing the \"epicalc\" package of software R, version 2.12.1(R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS GeneraldescriptionA total of 527 asthma patients were initially enrolled inthis study, of which 97 patients were lost to follow up.Thus, the 430 remaining patients were valid for analy- sis. Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical charac-teristics of the patients who completed the study andthose patients who were lost to follow up. No signifi-cant differences were observed between sex, and diseaseand SAAT history in these two groups. In addition, thepatients lost to follow up were older, with a lesser de-gree, severity and frequency of exacerbations than pa-tients included in this study. A total of 245 (57.0%)study participants were female, with a mean [standarddeviation ( SD)] age of 43 (23) years. The participants exhibited a moderate disease condition at baseline,with a mean (SD) degree score of 5 (2). 246 (57.6%)patients were diagnosed with moderate severity of asth-ma, and 283 (66.9% ) individuals reported less than one exacerbation per month, with a mean ( SD) disease history of 11 (11) years. A total of 174 (48.2%) pa-tients had received SAAT before this study. Efficacyevaluation Except for some individual negative returns, almost all Figure1Procedurediagramofthisstudy SAAT:summeracupointapplicationtreatment. 23JTCM|www.journaltcm.com February15,2015 |Volume35 effective\", \"Very effective\". These results suggest of asthma relief after SAAT, i.e., the se-verity and frequency of exacerbations, were reduced,and the concomitant medications were substantially re-duced (Figure 2A-2C). In addition, 80% of the pa- tients were more less satisfied with this treatment(Figure 391 (91.4% ) patients were in 2009, and further improvement(93% ) was observed in 2010 according to the doc-tor-report outcome (Table 2). This result suggests thatthe efficacy of this treatment is enhanced with pro-longed treatment time.After SAAT, the average value for the asthma degreescores was substantially reduced from 5.2 \u00b1 2.0 in 2008 to 4.0 \u00b1 1.6 in 2009, and subsequently to 3.5 \u00b1 1.3 in 2010. This result confirms the therapeutic efficacyof SAAT on asthma and the benefit of enduring treat-ment. DISCUSSION Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized byepisodes or attacks of impaired breathing. The inflam-mation and narrowing of small airways can cause short-ness of breath, coughing, wheezing, chest pain, etc.Large efforts have been made to control and preventthe development of asthma. The well-established treat-ment of asthma includes the use of medication forshort-term relief to decrease inflammation and avert at-tack and the daily use of preventive medication to con-trol inflammation and airway hyperreactivity. In addi-tion, doctors typically recommend the establishment ofsufficient health care measures, such as monitoring earlysymptoms, avoiding factors that trigger attacks, and re-moving risks. However, concomitant medications formorbidity and direct/indirect health care costs due toasthma continue to pose a high burden for patientsand their families. The use of complementary and alter-native treatment could provide an option to controlthe symptoms of asthma and lower the economic bur-den of health care and therapy. As a typical and conven-tional treatment method for pulmonary disease, SAAThas demonstrated promising effects. 17-26Most clinical re- ports have suggested that SAAT substantially improvesthe life quality of patients. Yet the mechanisms ofSAAT for the treatment of asthma remain elusive.The action of hydrogel herbal paste used in SAAT onacupoint meridian can be triggered through the perme-ation of active medicines through the skin. 27According to the Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, peoplewith an imbalanced flow of energy (so called \" Qi\") along the meridians will suffer chronic pulmonary dis-eases, and the herbal paste in SAAT could regulate theflow of \"Qi\". 28,29The stimulation 12) and Feishu (BL 13)] for an or- gan might affect the meridian (lung meridian) associat-ed with that organ through an enhancement of theflow ofQi. With functions to dredge and activate the lung meridian, the stimulation of Fengmen (BL 12)could regulate the flow of the meridian \" Qi\". 16The the- ory of energy flow within the meridian system hasbeen explained in Western Medicine by the semicon-ducting properties of the skeletal and connective tissuesystems. 30Carneitro et al31demonstrated the effect of asthma therapy on asthmatic rats through the stimula-tion of the acupoint Feishu (BL 13), showing that bothlung inflammation and cellular in thebronchoalveolar lavage was significantly reducedthrough acupoint stimulation.

In addition, stimulating meridian acupoints indicating nerve responses have al-so been directly evidenced through functional magnet-ic resonance imaging. 33Ultrasonic imaging supports an association between acupoints, muscular connective tis-sue, bands35and blood laser also demonstrated thestrengthening of blood flow after acupoint stimulation,likely reflecting the activated circulation of tissue fluidinside the meridian. 37In the neural hypothesis, the clin- ical influence of acupoint stimulation provides signalsto the brain through sensory nerves, causing clinicalchanges associated with treatment. 38 From the point view of immunomodulation, acupointstimulation might improve immunity. Numerous stud-ies of general immune parameters (IgA, IgM, IgG andIgE, etc.) have shown a statistically significant enhance-ment of immunity through SAAT. 21Significant chang- es in cytokine concentrations (e.g., IL-6 and IL-10,IL-8) under acupoint stimulation were also observed. 39 Drugs used for asthma treatment, such as steroids andb2-agonists, shift the balance of Th1/Th2 towardsTh1. 40The effect of restoring balance to the Th1/Th2 responses through acupoint stimulation has also beenextensively reported. 41,42 However, numerous have suggested that the effects of re-al and/or sham acupoint treatment on pulmonary func-tion in asthmatic patients remain insignificant. 17,23,24 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on asthmatic pa-tients using acu-TENs have also confirmed that thereare no obvious effects on the improvement of pulmo-nary function, 25while some clinical studies have report- ed the positive effect of acupoint treatment on pulmo-nary function in asthmatic patients. 22,43Literature sur- veying suggests that the treatment of stimulating acu-points, using needles, paste or acu-Tens, is a placebo.However, clinical observations from a large amount ofpatients in different hospitals in China have shown 70 60 50 40 3020 10 0 Marked improved Moderate improvedNo changeWorse2009 2010 SeverityFrequency (%)A 80 7060 50 4030 0 Much SatisfiedSatisfiedNo feeling unsatisfied2009 2010 much unsatisfiedSelf-satisfaction 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Very effectiveNo changeWorse20092010 Moderate improvedConcomitant medicationsFrequency (%) 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Very effective Moderate improvedNo changeWorse20092010 Frequency (21.2) 22 (5.1) 2 (0.5)0 (0.0) 115 (26.8)Moderate effective 29 (6.7) 235 (54.7) 14 (3.3) 0 (0.0) 278 (64.8)No change 3 (0.7) 16 (3.7)15 (3.5) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0)3 (0.7)0 (0.0)0 (0.0)3 (0.7)Total February15,2015 |Volume35 |Issue1|WuXQetal./ClinicalStudy that SAAT can and remarkably improve the quality of life of patients.18,19,21Moreover, the apparent efficacy of SAAT on patients with asthma is substantial-ly high (> 80%, Table 3). Moreover, Chen et al 44con- ducted a comparative study, showing that therapeuticeffect of SAAT is superior to that of routine needle acu-puncture (SAAT vs needle acupuncture: 94% vs76%). More rigorous studies (i.e., RCTs, long time follow-up,pulmonary function tests) are needed to further under-stand the mechanisms and the factors that influencethe therapeutic efficacy of SAAT.Herein, we presented a two-year follow-up study to in-vestigate the therapeutic effects of SAAT in 430 valid patients in China. Younger patients and those withmore severe symptoms are more likely to complete atwo-year or more treatment course. Based on self-rateand doctor-report outcomes, SAAT can reduce the se-verity and frequency of asthma exacerbations and con-comitant medications with plausible satisfaction. Theefficacy of this treatment is enhanced with a prolongedtreatment course. REFERENCES 1Jean B , Nikolai K.
