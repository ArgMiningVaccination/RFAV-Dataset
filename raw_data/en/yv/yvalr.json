The BioEnergetic Synchronization Technique (B.E.S.T.) is a gentle, hands-on energy balancing procedure that utilizes the body's innate potential to heal itself. Widely used by health care professionals who recognize that the body is more than the sum of its parts, B.E.S.T. is a state-of-the-art modality that entails holding specific pressure points on the body to remove energy blocks and stimulate energy flow. Mind/body healing practitioners all over the world use B.E.S.T. to balance the energy fields of their clients' body, mind, memory, and soul. What is KST? KST is a gentle, low force system of correcting body imbalances via a fast, accurate 3-step protocol: - Analysis of the body's entire structural system using bioenergetic communication with the body - Accurate determination of the exact location of the interference pattern - Specific adjustments using the FDA-approved ArthroStim adjusting instrument, which realigns the identified segment and removes nerve pressure with gentle \"taps\" to the focus area KST treatments are unique in that they are usually given to patients in the standing position. However, when the problem is reproduced only in a certain position, such as when the patient is seated, he/she will be asked to assume the particular position while the analysis and adjustment is made. Interference patterns or imbalances may be structural, visceral, emotional, energetic, or spiritual. What is Quantum Alignment Process (QAP) QAP is a technique developed by Dr. Gertonson to balance the body's energy system aligning body, mind, and spirit through bioenergetic and intuitive communication with the biofield. The therapy may also involve the use of therapeutic grade essential oils and nutritional supplements. "}
