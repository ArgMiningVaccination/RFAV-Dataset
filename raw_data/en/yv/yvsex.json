Hindus perform pujas as formal acts of meditation upon God. The usage of particular food items in these acts is a way to prepare one's mind towards meditation. Offering certain foods or using them as material props is believed to help put one's mind in the frame of devotion. Have you ever noticed that there are many vegetarian food items that tend to make a reoccurring appearance in Hindu pujas and Vedantic traditions? These are not trivial coincidences\u2014rather, the presence of these foods is steeped in symbolism and tradition. Below, we share descriptions of some commonly found foods in pujas and their significance. In Vedantic tradition, it is believed that the coconut resembles the human skull, where the brain resides\u2014and within that, our thoughts and ego. For this reason, coconuts are ceremonially broken during a puja\u2014the devotee is symbolically shattering his or her ego and surrendering themselves to God. Additionally, the coconut water represents our worldly desires. When the coconut breaks, it is believed that the outpouring of the water represents the dispelling of vasana, or desires. Half of the coconut remains with the priest and another half is given back to the people as a prasad\u2014a small amount of food which is first served to the deity and then to the worshiper. Panchamrita is a mixture of five ingredients: honey, sugar, curd, ghee, and Ganga jal\u2014water from the sacred river called Ganga. According to ancient scripture, panchamrita is Amrit, or immortal\u2014meaning one who drinks it will become immortal. As per mythology, all the ingredients of panchamrita have unique benefits, with the sum of its parts being spiritually potent. Honey has antibacterial properties, sugar represents sweetness and energy, the curd is for healthy stomach, ghee is for strength and knowledge, and Ganga jal is for purity. These nutritional and spiritual properties are believed to be vital to the worshipper's overall mental, physical, and spiritual health. Fruits carry a number of symbolic references. Many people believe that in giving up something sweet, like fruits, one is training his or herself in self-control and self-sacrifice\u2014thus cultivating mental strength. Think of this as purposely giving up something sweet or enjoyable in life to attain a greater good, or more specifically, spiritual maturity. Some devotees give up their favourite fruit as a sacrifice. Still others offer fruits to deities so their hearts become as \"sweet\" as the very fruits they offer. Essentially, fruits are hallmarks of detachment, self-sacrifice, and a pure, \"sweet\" surrender to God. Foods such as suji, halwa and malpua are also common amongst puja foods. They are generally distributed after puja for consumption by devotees, after it has been offered to the deity. It is said that when you fast during pujas, your energy decreases so in order to provide instant energy, foods as such are distributed. These foods are considered as a symbol of positivity and prosperity.
