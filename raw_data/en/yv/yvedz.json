Then Anthroposophy itself increasingly appears to us as a living being. And then we become aware that something is knocking at the portal of our hearts and saying, 'Let me in, for I am you yourself; I am your true human nature.\" \u2014 Rudolf Steiner, Nov. 18,1923 Based on the author's experience of the suprasensory being behind spiritual science (Anthroposophy), this volume is the culmination of Sergei Prokofieff's twenty-five years of work on Rudolf Steiner's spiritual impulse. He shows that the being Anthroposophia is not merely a poetic image or an abstract concept, but an actual spiritual entity who works in the higher worlds to benefit earthly evolution and bring to humanity \"the new revelation of the heavenly Sophia, the divine wisdom.\" In the first part of the book, Prokofieff describes the path that led him to experience the being Anthroposophia\u2014a path that is clearly outlined so that it can be followed by the reader as well. In the second part, beginning with Steiner's relatively few statements on the subject, the author considers the position of the living Anthroposophia in the cosmic hierarchy\u2014specifically her relationship to Christ, to the heavenly Sophia, and the to Archangel Michael. Finally available in paperback, this work will be of special interest to all those who have a close connection to Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy. \"The small number of anthroposophists will be unable to go forward as a vanguard until Anthroposophy is received as a living being who moves invisibly among us and to whom people feel themselves responsible. And it is important that the small number of anthorposophists do indeed serve as a vanguard.... But then things must be taken with great seriousness, for in every moment of one's life one must feel that one is united with the invisible essence of Anthroposophy.\" \u2014 Rudolf Steiner, June 17, 1923 C O N T E N T S: Foreword Part I: The Study of Spiritual Science as a Meeting with the Living Being Anthroposophia Part II: The Heavenly Sophia and the Being Anthroposophia 1.
