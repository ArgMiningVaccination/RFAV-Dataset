Some serious effects are possible but they are extremely rare (Centers for Disease Control and prevention 2). Any illness a person gets after vaccinations can be caused from it, but normally it is unrelated to the vaccine and just happens by coincidence (Naff 128). Others are against what the vaccines are made of. Such as in the Hemophilius Influenza Type B vaccine there is less than 0.5 micrograms of formaldehyde.

If she said yes, I would start crying, begging her not to take me and saying why are you doing this to me.
