Such services shall maintain a high standard of quality and shall be provided within the limitations and exclusions hereinafter specified. All providers participating in the Medicaid program must furnish services in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Medicaid program. Conditions of participation are available from Provider Services. This Chapter describes covered services, service limitations and general reimbursement methodology. This manual obsoletes all previous policy and procedure manuals, bulletins and policy news. All Medicaid policies and requirements (such as prior authorizations, etc.) are the same for Nevada Check Up (NCU) , with the exception of the four areas where Medicaid and NCU policies differ as documented in the NCU Manual Chapte r 1000. 1201 AUTHORITY A. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 42, Public Health, Chapter IV , Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) , Subchapter C Medical Assistance Programs, Parts 430 through 456, states prescription drug coverage is an op tional service under Title XIX. B. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989 mandates additional preventive health care services for infants, children and young adults (newborn through age 20) eligible for Medicaid. These mandates provide that chi ldren and adolescents under age 21 receive follow -up services for a medically necessary condition discovered in a screening examination Early Preventative Screening and Diagnostic Testing (EPS DT), see Medicaid Services Manual (MSM) Chapter 1500; this includes prescription services. C. CFR Title 42 and Section 1927 of the Social Security Act, require states to provide for a Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program for covered outpatient drugs in order to assure that prescriptions are appropriate, medically necessary and not likely to result in adverse medical results ( Social Security Administration ( SSA), Title 19, (g)(1)(A)). D. Section 1927 of the Social Security Act allows a state to require a prior auth orization on any covered outpatient drug, providing the prior authorization program complies with the requirements outlined in the act. The Social Security Act requires the establishment of a DUR board to monitor therapeutic MTL 24/16 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY November 14, 2016 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 2 appropriateness, use of generi c products, overutilization and underutilization of drugs and quality of care consistent with protecting the health of program beneficiaries. E. Chapter 422 of Nevada Revised Statute ( NRS ) amended by AB 384 to require the Department of Health and Human Servi ces (DHHS) to: 1. develop a list of preferred prescription drugs ; 2. manage prescription drug use through the use of prior authorization and step therapy ; and 3. create the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. F. U.S. Troop Readiness, Veteran's Health Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act 2007, Section 7002(b) of the act requires Medicaid outpatient drugs (defined in Section 1927(k)(2) of the Social Security Act) will be reimbursable only if non - electronic written prescriptio ns are executed on a tamper -resistant prescription pad. G. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires Fee-for-Service (FFS) State Medicaid programs to capture and report National Drug Codes (NDC) for outpatient drugs in order for the state to receive federal financial participation . MTL 24/16 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY November 14, 2016 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 3 1202 RESERVED MTL 18/17 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY August 1, 2017 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 1 1203 POLICY The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP), Nevada Medicaid , reimburses pharmacies and practitioners for legend ( prescription ) and non -legend (over the counter) pharmaceuticals dispensed or admi nistered to Medicaid recipient s. All prescribers must have a license as a healthcare practitioner, such as a physician, podiatrist, osteopath, dentist, Advanced Practice Registered Nurs e (APRN), physici an's assistant, etc., keeping within the scope of thei r practice. The DHCFP requires that p harmaceuticals are written , dispensed and prescribed in accordance with the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy regulations and enforcement. 1203.1 COVERAGE AND LIMITATIONS 1. Covered drugs are subject to prior authorization and/or quantity limits and the following: a. Section 1927(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act (SSA) allows Medicaid to restrict coverage for an outpatient drug if the prescribed drug is not for a medically accepte d indication. Section 1927(k)(6) defines a medically accepted indication as any use for a covered outpatient drug which is approved under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the use of which is supported by one or more citations included or approve d for inclusion in any of the compendia: 1.

Pharmaceuticals may require prior authorization due to step therapy protocols regardless of inclusion in the PDL. 4. If the P&T Committee determines that there are no significant differences between drugs within specific classes based on clinical efficacy and safety, the DHCFP or its Quality Improvement Organization ( QIO)-like vendor may consider cost in determining whic h drugs are selected for inclusion on the PDL. 5. Due to the 76th Special Session and in accordance with Senate Bill (SB) 4, every therapeutic prescription drug that is classified as an anticonvulsant medication or antidiabetic medication that was covered by the Medicaid program on June 30, 2010 must be included on the PDL as a preferred drug. If a therapeutic prescription drug that is included on the list of preferred prescription drugs is prescribed for a clinical indication other than the indication for wh ich it was approved as of June 30, 2010, the Committee shall review the new clinical indication for that drug in accordance with Section 1203 of this chapter . 6. Due to the 76th Special Session and in accordance with SB 4, the P&T Committee must prefer atypical and typical antipsychotic medications that are prescribed for the treatment of a mental illness, anticonvulsant medications and antidiabetic medications for a patient who is receiving services pursuant to Medicaid if the patient: a. was prescribed the prescription drug on or before June 30, 2010, and takes the prescription drug continuously, as prescribed, on and after that date ; and b. maintains conti nuous eligibility for Medicaid.

Even if \"no other insurance\" is indicated o n the eligibility file, the claim will be processed as a Third Party Liability ( TPL) claim if the pharmacy submits. f. If other insurance is indicated on the eligibility file, the claim will be processed as a TPL regardless of what TPL codes the pharmacy sub mits. g. In all cases, the Nevada Medicaid \"allowed amount\" will be used when calculating payment. In some cases, this may result in a \"0\" payment, when the insurance carrier pays more than the Medicaid \"allowable amount .\" h. In order to facilitate the TPL/COB process, Nevada Medicaid will allow providers to override \"days supply limits\" and/or \"Drug Requires PA\" co nditions by entering a value of \"5\" (exemption from prescription limits) in the PA/MC CODE field (NCPCP #416DG) if there are no prior authorization requirements on these drugs from the primary insurer. 6. Pharmacy Billing Process a. NCPDP Standard Billing Units Nevada Medicaid reimburses for outpatient pharmaceuticals according to NCPDP \"Billing Unit Standard Format\" guidelines. The standard provides for the billing of pharmaceuticals in one of three billing units for all drug products. These units are \"each ,\" \"milliliter (ml) ,\" and \"gram (g) .\" The following guidelines are to be used when billing Nevada Medicaid for pharmaceuticals: Tablets, Capsules, Suppositories, Pre -filled Syringes: must be billed by \"each\" or by \"mls .\" For example, if 30 tablets of Metformin are dispensed, the quantity will be 30. Liquids, Liquid Orals, Suspensions, Solutions, Opthalmic/Otic Solutions: must be billed by milliliters (mls). For example, if 560ml of guiafenesin is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 560. PLEASE NOTE: Ounces must be converted to ml (1 ounce = 30ml). Liters must be converted to ml (1L = 1000ml). Ointments, Bulk Powders: must be billed by grams. For example, if a two ounce tube of oxiconazole nitrate is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 60. MTL 09/17 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY April 27, 2017 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 16 PLEASE NOTE: Ounces must be converted to grams (1 ounce = 30g, \u00bd ounce = 15g). Oral Contraceptives/Therapy packs: must be billed per \"each\" tablet dispensed, not the number of packages. For example, Ortho Tri -Cyclen is a 28 -day dial pack, the quantity entered will be 28. Transdermal Patches/Powder Packets: must be billed per \"each\" patch/packet dispensed, regardless of whether they are pre -packaged in a box or come in individual pouches/packets. For example, Catapress -TTS comes in a box of four patches. If two of these boxes are dispensed, the quantity entered will be eight. Inhalers and Aerosols: must be billed as either grams or ml, as spec ified by the manufacturer on the labeling. For example a 90mcg(microgram)/inh Albuterol Inhaler has a total of 17gm in the canister. If one of these is dispensed, 17 will be quantity entered. Topical Products: must be billed as either grams or ml, as spec ified by the manufacturer on the labeling. PLEASE NOTE: Ounces must be converted to grams or ml. 1 ounce = 30ml 1 ounce = 30g Reconstitutables (oral, otic, ophthalmic): must be billed per ml that are/will be in the bottle after reconstitution according to the manufacturer 's instructions. Liquid Injectables (vials, ampoules): must be billed by milliliters (ml). For example, if a 10ml vial of Novolin 70/30 is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 10. Powdered Injectables (vials): must be billed by \"each\" vial given per d ose. For example if the recipient receives Ampicillin 1g every six hours for one week, the quantity entered will be 1, as only one vial is used per dose (assuming a 1gm vial is used), and the # of doses entered will be 28 (four per day x seven days). PLEASE NOTE: If the product is supplied with a diluent, the quantity entered is only the number of powdered vials dispensed, the diluent is not factored in. Intravenous Solutions: must be billed in ml administered per dose. For example, if a recipient receives 250ml of Normal Saline four times per day, the quantity entered will be 250, as that is the quantity per dose. Blood Derived Products: products may vary in potency from batch to batch.
