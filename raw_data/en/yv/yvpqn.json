Meredyth Warren, CPhT Questions doubling technician fee JUNE 2019 / A From: Brainard Brauer To: PHARMACY RULEMAKING * BOP Cc: Subject: Oregon Board of Pharmacy Rule Making Date: Monday, April 29, 2019 3:01:30 PM To Whom It May Concern, I am a small gas station that sells a few packs of convenience items and find the existing Fee to be to much and in appropriate for a small establishment like myself. Please consider that if a business sells less than lets say $5,000 or perhaps $10,000 per year in pharmacy typeproducts that they should be exempt. I do so propose if there is any question. Costs should be for services and this is a TAX without services. This year I also pay a state wide transit tax that costs me more to prepare then the tax itself so do we raise the tax simply to justify for a small/micro business likemyself. Oregon State Government needs to consider the burden on business. There is a place for regulation like in the case of OLCC which likely undercharges and due to the structure is the fundamental reason for our craft brewing industry and diversity in hard spirit companies plus winery distribution. OLCC provides a foundation for a huge part of our economy and convenience of citizens and tourists for Oregon. I do believe in a place for agencies but YOUR reach to the small or micro business is disturbing at best. Thank you for informing us of the rule making. Please remove small business from the pharmacy program and definitely do not increase fees since it will hurt consumers. We likely do not even sell enough per year to make a profit enough to offset the cost of your existing fee plus overhead. We do it due to a sense of service to our community. Should someone need to drive another 6 miles to get a simple over the counter medicine and then for that matter a small dosage. Sincerely,Brainard Brauer Owner/MemberRedland Station, LLC18150 S.

JUNE 2019 / A From: Michael Letsky To: PHARMACY RULEMAKING * BOP Subject: Division 110 - Fees Date: Tuesday, April 30, 2019 8:49:39 PM The fees registered pharmacists will need to pay every 2 years is proposed to be more than double what is currently active. This is unacceptable as drug manufacturers who make millions, if not billions of dollars every year on profitsdo not see their increases >25%. Registered pharmacists should not be burdened with funding the board more thancurrent and the manufacturers should be billed this difference.Thank you.Mike JUNE 2019 / A From: Lawrence LaJoie To: RULEMAKING * BOP Subject: Div 110 Fees testimony Date: Tuesday, April 23, 2019 1:02:11 PM I'm writing for consideration regarding the fee structure proposed: As a college store institutionally owned, I'm asking for consideration in eliminating therenewal fee structure for government institutions only. We supply a small amount ofover the counter medicines for resale like Tylenol, Advil, etc. to help serve thestudents and staff who are in need, and really only see this as a necessary service tothe college. Increasing an already high fee structure jeopardizes our ability to recoupthose fees through resale and impacts the future service we can provide. The natureof the fee structure is intended for larger volume \"true\" retail outlets, which caneasily be absorbed in the profitability of the store, but for a non-profit institution, itimpacts us dramatically. I'm requesting a fee \"freeze\" or elimination of the feealtogether for non-profit and government institutions.Thank you for your consideration. -- Lawrence LaJoie Director of Enterprise Services Linn-Bento n Community College lajoiel@linnbenton.edu (541) 917-4953 Office (541) 917-4954 Fax JUNE 2019 / A From: PHARMACY BOARD * BOP To: MACLEAN Karen S * BOP Subject: FW: Notice of Proposed Fee Increases Date: Tuesday, November 13, 2018 4:20:13 PM From: Bill Booth <bbooth@medstarnw.com> Sent: Tuesday, November 13, 2018 4:10 PM To: PHARMACY BOARD * BOP <PHARMACY.BOARD@oregon.gov> Subject: RE: Notice of Proposed Fee Increases In a time when our reimbursement is dropping by over 30% you choose to charge a 30% increase.

Us techs are paid so little, and are charged for all of our CE's anymore. Where I am employed I have to be licensed by the state and nationally. Thanks to President Trump we cant even use these fee's as a tax deduction next year. We very rarely get a raise in our pay. Yet the price of everything just keeps going up. I just cant make more money appear! I understand you have operational needs, but is it really necessary to take it out on the pharmacy techs? How about charging the pharmacists for there CE's they have mostly free ones? My property taxes went up $300 this year thanks to a local school bond passing. Gas has gone up, but not my wages. I no I am not the only one in this situation. Us tech's are hurting. Please dont do this to us! Karen Nguyen Cpht Oregon State Hospital Pharmacy Department.

DATE: 05/22/2019 TIME: 9:30 AM OFFICER: Karen MacLean ADDRESS: Portland State Office Building 800 NE Oregon St. Conference Room 1E Portland, OR 97232 NEED FOR THE RULE(S): Implements fee increases included in the Board of Pharmacy Legislatively Approved Budget for 2019-21. DOCUMENTS RELIED UPON, AND WHERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE: 2019 SB 5529 - https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/SB5529/Enrolled Notice to Licensee - Proposed Fee Increases - November 13, 2018 Email sent to all licensees and registrants with email address on file 11/13/18 or sent via USPS and posted to the agency website home page at https://www.oregon.gov/pharmacy/Imports/Memos/2019ProposedFeeIncreaseNoticeToLicensees.pdf All new licensees or registrants since 11/13/18 received this notice with license/registration. FISCAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT: These rules reflect fee increases in 24 license/registration categories that generate $2,411,800 of Other Fund revenue. Note, approximately $1,350,670 of this increase is related to the adjustment for biennial licensure for pharmacists and certified pharmacy technicians. Page 1 of 6 JUNE 2019 / A1COST OF COMPLIANCE: (1) Identify any state agencies, units of local government, and members of the public likely to be economically affected by the rule(s). (2) Effect on Small Businesses: (a) Estimate the number and type of small businesses subject to the rule(s); (b) Describe the expected reporting, recordkeeping and administrative activities and cost required to comply with the rule(s); (c) Estimate the cost of professional services, equipment supplies, labor and increased administration required to comply with the rule(s). Fee increases for various drug outlet registrations and personnel licensure include some county health departments, correctional facilities and state run institutional facilities. There are currently 899 facilities that have identified as small businesses. These rules do not generate any minimal reporting, recordkeeping and other administrative activities required for compliance for small businesses. DESCRIBE HOW SMALL BUSINESSES WERE INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE RULE(S): None. WAS AN ADMINISTRATIVE RULE ADVISORY COMMITTEE CONSULTED? NO IF NOT, WHY NOT? Fees updates to be effective 7/1/19 for new applicants. The Board of Pharmacy's operating budget is largely dependent on licensing fees.

This RAC provides thestructure for stakeholder and industry insights. Pharmacist Consultant Fiona Karbowicz presented an informational set of slides, defining a rule, providing background of agency promulgation of rules, and outlining the purpose of a RAC, in alignment with the Board's mission. The presentationdescribed the objectives of the revisions to the compounding rules, as well as thecontext and considerations for the RAC. (see pg. --- of this document for slides) The current revisions to Division 045 - Drug Compounding include: oArticulation of the Board's intent for full compliance with USP Chapterstandards (versus \"in the spirit of\") for patient and personnel safety. Alldrug compounding must adhere to guidelines of the curr ent edition of the USP Chapters 795, 797 and 800, as well as all Chapters related to thecomp ounding practices at a location; and JUNE 2019 / A2 Oregon Board of Pharmacy - 5.8.2019 o Express ion of the Board's expectations for : Registration requirem ents, including accreditation. A 503B Outsourcing Facility must register as an Oregon Manufacturer. All compounding pharmacies must either pass an inspection by a Board approved entity or m ust receive accreditation by a B oard approved entity every 3 years at a minimum, in order to dis tribute or dispense compounding preparations into and within Oregon. Personnel responsibilities, including required P&P . The PIC and drug outlet shall establish, maintain and enforce policies and procedures in accordance with the standards in USP Chapters for all aspects and categories of the compounding operation of non -sterile, sterile and parenteral product preparation. Items are outlined in rule by a list of required P& P, which must be aligned with applicable USP directives. Labeling and documentation r equirements . All compounding records, including training documents, master formulation records, compounded preparation records, individual prescription records, and dispensing or transfer of all compounded preparations must be maintained electronically or manually, stored in an organized manner, retained for a minimum of 3 years and be made readily available for inspection by the Board. Items are outlined in rule by a list of required documentation of proces ses related to drug compounding. o The existing rule s no longer meet the acceptable minimum standards for safety. The federal landscape for compounding has been informing this rules revision for a number of years, particularly as a result of the major safety implications exhibited by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) tragedy. Major stakeholders include Federal legislators (authors of the DQSA), the FDA, NABP, USP, other regulators, healthcare professionals, and, of course, patients. Committee Dialogue Committee M embers shared concerns, opinions and personal insights related to this topic, addressing compliance challenges, timeframes, and the fiscal impact to various stakeholders. As a way to invoke as much dialogue as possible, M embers took additional turns to speak, as often the sharing by one memb er inspired another's thoughts. Overall, Members were supportive of the rule changes, to ensure patient and worker safety. Broad topic p oints shared by committee dialogue included : FDA: Years' worth of regulatory guidance, many items such as guidance documents and regu lations are still under development; FDA agents are performing proactive inspections and issuing 483s, which provide insight to their compliance and enforcement initiatives and policy prerogatives. FDA activities are having a major impact to the compounding industry. USP: All stakeholders (including the Board) are awaiting the release of the final revisions to the compounding Chapters; major concern among most stakeholders is that the time to comply with the \"Intended Of ficial Date\" of 12/1/2019 gives the pharma cies only 6 months to align all P&Ps, staff training, JUNE 2019 / A2 Oregon Board of Pharmacy - 5.8.2019 facility updates, etc. for compliance; Members seeking insights related to the Board's expectations for compliance in Oregon. Staff anticipates this may be similar to other rule/policy changes in the past - the Board allows a reasonable timeframe for a pharmacy to achieve compliance with new rules and plans to create an updated Self -Inspection Form for compounding to help with understanding and compliance expectations. Oregon Shared Services: General understanding related to the historic and current role that shared services for compounded products services (compounding batches of non -patient specific drug products), and the need to phase out shared service for human compounded drug products however , Members shared concerns related to ongoing confusion among some Oregon pharmacies and Oregon clinicians; agreement that streamlined Board processes for shared services allowance is needed, as well as a necessity for a consistent communication to impacted clinicians; current overall landscape permits the use of Oregon shared services for veterinary compounding for batches of non - patient specific drug products Patient Impacts: It is anticipated that compliance with USP standards will have a positive impact on the safety and quality of the drugs compounded for patients. It is assumed that at least some of the increased costs of doing business in the compounding realm may ultimately passed along to patients, estimated increase of 25% , though hospitals cannot pass along increases to patients due to primarily fixed reimbursements. Additionally, patients and clinicians may notice that certain drugs will have shorter expiration dates (BUDs) depending on the final language put forth by USP for dating standards. Some pharmacies may choose to stop compounding all together, though there may be an increase in FDA- approved kits to replace some frequently compounded items (i.e. magic mouthwash). Fiscal Impacts: The majority of the Committee's discussion directly or indirectly related to the costs to comply with USP Standards (and therefore also with Board rule). Compliance costs can be placed into two major categories: initial costs, such as facility remodels and ongoing costs, such as gowning/garbing items needed for daily compounding activities. It is anticipated that the costs to comply are high, ranging anywhere from an estimated $50,000 to more than $2,000,000 per location, depending on the current facility specifications and the type of compoundi ng being performed. The Committee had a robust discussion related to the Board's proposed requirement to for a compounding pharmacy to be accredited by a Board approved entity, every three years at a minimum, and the related costs; not all accreditors are 'created equally' and the Board may not ultimately get the safety assurances they seek from this policy directive. Good of the Order The meeting concluded with general consensus related to the overall high fiscal realities of compliance with USP standards, and therefore with the Board's proposed rules. General agreement that Committee M embers are willing to meet again, particularly if the USP standards published in June include unanticipated additional costs . Otherwise, the group may continue to meet, n ot as a RAC, but rather as a formal stakeholder group, to continue providing ongoing expertise and professional insights to the Board. JUNE 2019 / A2 JUNE 2019 / A3JUNE 2019 / A3JUNE 2019 / A3JUNE 2019 / A3JUNE 2019 / A3JUNE 2019 / A3JUNE 2019 / A3JUNE 2019 / A3JUNE 2019 / A31 Oregon Board of Pharmacy February 2019 Updates to Division 045 - Drug Compounding are provided. This is a rules revision; this is not a 1 re-write. 2 Current regulations (adopted in February 2008) are written in \"the spirit\" of USP Chapters 795 3 and 797. They were drafted prior to the publication of USP <800> (February 2016). On 4 2/26/2018, the Pew Charitable Trusts published their research on State Oversight of Drug 5 Compounding . For safety assurances aligned with national standards, in 2013 the Board stated 6 that the rules needed to be upda ted to full compliance with USP (Resources available: USP 7 website ). Efforts to strengthen compounding rules are needed due to the critical safety 8 implications for patients. 9 Changes to the se rules include: (1) Expectation of full compliance with all USP Chapter 10 standards commensurate with the compounding performed; (2) Registration, including the 11 requirement for compounding pharmacies to be accredited by a Board approved entity every 3 12 years at a minimum; this does not replace the Board's annual inspections; (3) Personnel 13 responsibilities, including required policies and procedures (P&Ps); (4) Labeling; and (5) 14 Documentation. 15 Note: There is a distinction between compl iance with safety standards and compliance wit h 16 law/rule . The Oregon Board of Pharmacy is committed to Compliance Through Education and 17 one way that is achieved is through clear rules that articulate compliance expectat ions. 18 Therefore, these rules provide for the broad directive to \"Comply with all USP Chapters\" as well 19 as provide structure and clarity to licensees who compound drugs by specifying required P&Ps 20 and documentation. 21 22 Division 45 23 STERILE AND NON -STERILE DRUG COMPOUNDING 24 855-045-0200 25 Application 26 (1) These rules (OAR 855-045-0200 to 855-045-0270) apply to any person, including any 27 business entity, located in or outside Oregon that engages in the practice of compounding a 28 drugs, for use or distribution in Oregon. or any person, including any business entity, located 29 in any other state that compounds drugs for the use of patients located in Oregon.

Statutory and Legal Scope Review: o ORS 689.649 states that the Committee shall recommend a formulary of drugs and devices that a pharmacist may prescribe and dispense to a patient : Items must be pursuant to a diagnosis by a health care practitioner qualified to make the diagnosis and who has prescriptive authority ( ORS 689. 645) The Board may adopt the recommendations by rule The Committee shall periodically review the formulary and recommend revisions to the board ORS 689.645(6) states \"The formulary may include post- diagnostic drugs and devices such as diabetic testing supplies, emergency refills of insulin, albuterol inhalers, epinephrine autoinjectors, smoking cessation aids, discharge medications for transitions of care, rapid strep tests and spacers.\" o ORS 679.64 5 states that a pharmacist may provide approved patient care services pursuant to a statewide drug therapy management pr otocol: PH&PFAC Meeting Minutes 5.3.19 Developed by the Public Health and Pharmacy Formulary Advisory Committee; and; Adopted by rule of the Board . Patient care services include smoking cessation and travel health services are mentioned in statute Pharmacist to establish 'P&Ps/protocols' for the prescription and administration of vaccines and the provision of patient care services [under sub (1) which allows a pharmacis t to provide patient care services via statewide drug therapy management protocols developed by the Committee ] Note: For the purposes of the conversation and past minutes (10/26/2018) , a statewide protocol consists of a standardized patient assessment process and treatment care plan under which a pharmacist may prescribe and dispense a drug or device to a patient, pursuant to legal scope articulated in ORS 689. o Board Rules overview: Division 019 - added a rule to establish an Oregon pharmacist's authority to prescribe pursuant to scope authorized by 2017 HB 2397 Division 020 - Codify recommendations of items added to the Formulary and Protocol Compendia; Codify the \"core elements\" that all prescribing processes must adhere to, including: Oregon pharmacist, located and licensed in Oregon only; responsibility to recognize limits of own knowledge and experience - refer when necessary Utilize drug therapy management protocol based on curren t clinical guidelines, including inclusion, exclusion and referral criteria Collect subjective and objective info about patient's health history and clinical status Evaluate and develop individualized patient care plan, within parameters (when defined) Implement care plan, including treatment goals, monitoring and follow -up Notify patient's care provider(s) within 5 days of issuing prescription Maintain records (visit summary, dispensing files, etc.) Check and adjust\": Rule edits need to be drafted - need to align processes with statute, in particular OAR 855 -020-0110(3) will need to be re -written to make it clear that a pharmacist may prescribe via post -diagnostic drugs and devices adopted by Board rules on the Formulary Compendia or via statewide drug therapy management protocols developed by the Committee and adopted by Board rules on the Protocol Compendia. The statute does not permit a pharmacist to create his/her own protocol; rather, a pharmacist may provide approved patient care se rvices pursuant to the statewide drug therapy management protocol that is developed by the Committee and adopted by rule of the Board. A pharmacist may develop policies and procedures to implement and document the provision of patient care services pursuan t to the statewide drug therapy management protocol. The Committee and staff had a robust discussion about what a \"sample\" statewide drug therapy management protocol will look like, particularly regarding the level of detail needed. Is this still considered \"pharmacist prescribing\"? Yes, due to scope of practice articulated by Oregon law; the scope and risk are connected to the pharmacist. PH&PFAC Meeting Minutes 5.3.19 3. Committee Business, Expectations and Processes: o Pharmacist Consultant Karbowicz outlined the roles and responsibilities for Committee members, Board members and the staff that works to integrate each. Committee members meet regularly to develop, rec ommend and review items on the formulary and statewide drug therapy management p rotocols. They discuss and provide unified recommendations and revisions, via formal vote, to the Board's Formulary and Protocol lists. A focus is on assessment of clinical elements and are tasked with anticipating patient safety \"boundaries\" such as pharmacist education, assessment details (i.e. inclusion/exclusion criteria), and required care plan elements, etc. Board members focus on patient safety and legal scope by promulgation of rules and/or policy , including interpretation of laws defining Oregon pharmacist scope of practice. They review Committee recommendations and create rules for addition to the Formulary and Protocol lists. They remain aware of and help facilitate implementation, for patient access to safe provision of pharmacy services. Additionally, they direct compliance and enforcement. Staff is tasked with legal scope review, as defined in statute, rules and policy, at direction from the Executive Director, Legal Counsel, etc. Staff is also tasked with general process, including monitoring and preparing concepts submitted, acquiring SMEs, meeting facilitation and creating draft agendas/minutes. Additionally, staff is to facilitate all communications between the Board, Committee and stakeholders (including pharmacists, pharmacies, the public, etc.) ; all com munications are subject to public record which must be managed appropriately pursuant to state agency requirements. o Regarding expectations and processes: For Committee business and communications, we must utilize the formulary email (cc'd correspondence). It is pharmacy.formulary@oregon.gov Outreach is created by staff and speaker(s) determined by Executive Director ; any inquiries, such as from the pharmacy associations to be directed to Executive Director If Committee and Board members receive inquiries related to the regulations, implementation, etc. please pass along to Executive Director for prompt attention by appropriate staff member - legal scope is not discretionary We will be scheduling an annual (or semi- annual) meeting devoted to review of prior items added for clinical appropriateness ; Any Committee member may make a request for a n item to be reviewed fo r Formulary/Protocol recommendation - make request via form and cc the formulary email 4. Committee Business, Reviewing Recommendations We are continuing development of a clear and consistent methodology for Committee to utilize for reviewing items, in order for a consistent review process which can help properly \"build\" each concept/recommendation. We will continue to work through the process for the management and distribution of the protocols, particularly pursuant to Board direction. Additionally, the Committee plans to utilize the 'minutes review' meeting s to assess any new concepts, to essentially determine the first analysis question, \"Is this a concept the Committee wants to consider?\" It is anticipated the phone call may take longer by incorpo rating this preliminary review; this may adjust the timing of the phone call meetings - staff to evaluate and bring back for further discussion and scheduling, PH&PFAC Meeting Minutes 5.3.19 though some is a \"wait and see\", depending on the number of concepts that continue to be submitt ed, or not. o Analysis questions include: Is this a post -diagnostic drug or device? Or, is this suited for a statewide drug therapy management protocol? Are clinical parameters needed? This includes the development of standardized patient assessment process and treatment care plan, with defined inclusion, exclusion and referral criteria, based on current and referenced clinical guidelines, and articulating any prescribing parameters, monitoring requirements and follow -up. Is a Subject Matter Expert (SME) need ed? Is there a specific clinical guideline or other mandated resource required? Does the Committee want to recommend an additional mandated education requirement? o The Committee proceeded to re- review the concepts discussed at the January 11, 2019 meeting, considering them as statewide drug therapy management protocols. Fiona entered the January discussion elements in to a slide for each item, to engage Committee dialogue. The g eneral plan is to request SMEs to return to future meeting(s) to continue work on level of depth required. Legal counsel and Board direction will be needed. Smoking Cessation - non-NRT Pre-Travel Consult Medications Non-Occupational Post Exposure Prophylaxis (nPEP) o Additional points shared during Committee dialogue included: Updates should be made to the Concept Intake Form, to provide additional clarity to what the Committee and Board are seeking when a concept is submitted. Regarding new items received, staff will shift from a general \"pass along\" to a more detailed \"work -up\" moving forward, in attempt to bring forth solid \"packages\" of items for Committee and Board review. This will require additional staff resources; the 0.5FTE pharmacist position is envisioned to assist.

There were amendments made in 2014 and 2017, to add waiver language to certain regulations as implementation realities created challenges for some charitable pharmacies. Waiver History Over the years, the Board has approved waiver requests for a number of different charitable pharmacies (including Central City Concern, Outside In, Providence Charitable and Volunteers in Medicine) particularly for the following rules: OAR 855 -044-0030(2)(a) lot numbers OAR 855 -044-0050(1)(a), (1)(d) and (1)(j) general, exp date <9mo, refrigeration OAR 855 -044-0070(1)(b) and (2)(d) lot numbers Regardin g the requested rule clarification, the following items are provided for the Board: Related FAQs: Q: Who can bring in drugs for donation? A: Anyone, but donated drugs must meet the criteria laid out in the rules and the pharmacist may always use their discretion as to whether or not the drug is safe and appropriate for re - dispensing. Q: Will prescription drugs that were dispensed in a standard prescription vial, to an individual patient who manages their own medications, be accepted for re -dispensing? A: No. JUNE 2019 / C1NABP's Position Statement on the Return and Reuse of Prescription Medications in the Community Pharmacy Setting. Highlights include: Returned and reused medications refer to those medications that have been removed from the pharmacy for delivery by pharmacy staff, a pharmacy contracted deliveryservice, or an approved common carrier and returned because the product is notdeliverable or the patient refuses delivery and such medications have not left the control of the pharmacy staff, pharmacy contracted delivery service, or approved common carrier. Medications that have been delivered to the patient cannot bereturned and reused. The return and reuse of prescription drugs in instituti onal pharmacy settings is legal in most, if not all, states and is a very common and safe practice. In the communitypharmacy setting, however, this has not been the case. In recent years, a number ofstates began legalizing and even implementing a charitable form of return and reuse\"prescription drug repository\" or \"prescription drug donation\" programs. These programs, however, are contrary to most state pharmacy practice acts andregulations, as well as laws, regulations, and policies enacted at the fede ral level. In fact, FDA's Compliance Policy Guide on the Return of Unused Prescription Drugs toPharmacy Stock directly states that \"[a] pharmacist should not return drug products tohis stock once they have been out of his possession\" because of the inabi lity to assure drug \"strength, quality, purity or identity.\" In an attempt to determine consensus on this issue, NABP convened the Task Force onMedication Collection Programs in December 2008. The charge of the task force wasto evaluate the status of med ication collection programs throughout the country; review state and federal laws and regulations, including those administered by theUnited States Drug Enforcement Administration, applicable to medication collectionprograms; suggest possible medication collection program protocols compliant with current, applicable state and federal laws and regulations; and recommend revisions, if necessary, to the Model Act Task force members acknowledged that medications dispensed in institutional settingswithin a closed distribution system may be appropriate for reuse; however, membersconcluded that, because the medications leave the closed distribution system,programs based in the community pharmacy setting necessitate differentrequirements to ensure patient safety. Members concurred that any medication reuseprogram must comply with all state and federal regulations, including standards of theUSP R Recommendation s: Staff recommendation for waiver requests: Grant (5 year; traditional language ) Staff recommendation Inq uiry Date: 4/19 /2019 Board review: June 2019 meeting JUNE 2019 / C1Oregon Board of Pharmacy June 2019 Date: 4/19/2019 Wai ver Request: The Diabetes Community Care Team (DCCT), a recently opened charitable pharmacy (CP -000015, issued 3/19/2019) specializing in treating individuals with diabetes in Eugene and the surrounding areas, is requesting waiver of several of the Oregon Administrative Rules regarding the acceptance and distribution of certain drugs by charitable pharmacies. Spec ifically, DCCT is requesting waiver of the requirements in OAR 855 -044-0050(1)(d) and (j) stating that: A charitable pharmacy may not distribute a donated prescription drug that: (d) Bears an expiration date that is less than nine months from the date the drug is donated; [or](j) Requires refrigeration. DCC T is also requesting clarification on 855 -044-0030 (5)(a). DCCT was told on licensure that they could not accept donations from individuals. The OAR(s) currently state: (5) A charitable pharmacy may accept a drug from:(a) An individual; DCCT 's request is for a permanent waiver of these requirements, as they would be unduly burdensome to the goals of DCCT and detrimental to the health of the community, as documented below. Rel ated (Include need, how this will further public health, scale of impact on patients, impact on staff) DCCT requires the wavier of these requirements in order to achieve its goals of providing assistance and medication to the diabetic community of Eugene and the surrounding area. The primary medication required to treat diabetes is insulin. One of the main purposes of DCCT obtaining a license to act as a charitable pharmacy is to provide a means for diabetic s to obtain the insulin they need, even if they do not have access to insurance or sufficient financial resources to purchase the insulin themselves. As shown by the recent surge in news stories, congressional hearings and other well- publicized events, there is a great deal of concern regarding the high price of insulin. For diabetics, access to insulin is a matter of life and death, in a very literal sense. Unfortunately, even with the high level of interest in the subject of insulin prices, there are s till many people who do not have access to the insulin they need to live. As noted before, addressing this issue is one of the primary purposes of DCCT. The r egulations at issue here prohibit DCCT from distributing insulin entirely, since 855 -044-0050(1) (j) specifically prohibits distribution of drugs requiring refrigeration. Although there are still a few other things DCCT could do through its charitable pharmacy work, the inability to distribute insulin is a severe impediment to DCCT's work. Since nearly all forms of insulin require refrigeration, this requirement effectively prohibits DCCT from providing the one thing its patients need most. The scale of the impact JUNE 2019 / C1Oregon Board of Pharmacy June 2019 on the patients who cannot receive the insulin they need is difficult to overstate. C omplications from high blood sugar can include loss of eyesight, loss of limbs, brain damage and even death if left untreated. DCCT's goal is to provide a way for individuals who need insulin but cannot afford it to get it, but that goal is not possible w ithout a waiver of the refrigeration requirement. DCCT is requesting waiver for all diabetes medications that require refrigeration, with insulin being the top priority. OAR 855 -044-0050(1)(d) prohibits distribution of drugs that were donated less than nine months from their listed expiration date. This requirement would also create a substantial hardship for DCCT to fulfill its goal of providing life -saving insulin to those who need it. As with all medications, insulin has a limited shelf -life. If stored properly in the refrigerator, it can last many months. Once it is removed from the refrigerator, it must be used within a few weeks. For most diabetics, using one vial or pen of insulin within a few weeks is not a problem, as they will often require multiple vials or pens per month to properly manage their blood sugars. Assuming these waivers are granted, DCCT expects to cycle through the insulin it receives very quickly \u2014far more quickly than that nine -month window. And for the individuals receiving the insulin, they will use it almost immediately. Insulin is not the type of drug that sits around on the shelf and rarely gets used. Most diabetics use it multiple times a day, every single day. The risk of the insulin not being used prior to its ex piration date is very small and DCCT will carefully monitor expiration dates to ensure it stays that way. If DCC T is required to abide by the requirements of 855 -044-0050(1)(d), it will greatly reduce the amount of insulin DCCT is able to accept from donors and distribute to its patients. Most individuals or entities who would have insulin available to donate will do so either with no regard to the expiration date or with the thought that they should donate because it will expire soon and it should be use d by someone. DCCT will likely have to refuse or destroy a significant amount of insulin because of this rule, which would be detrimental to the health of the community. It is difficult to estimate exactly how much insulin would be unavailable to the com munity and the impact that would have, but if even one person cannot get the insulin he or she needs because of this rule, that is one too many. Of course, if the rule is waived, DCCT will implement procedures to ensure that any insulin it receives is dis tributed with sufficient time to allow the patient to use the insulin well before the expiration date. If D CCT does not receive a waiver of these rules, it will have a real and significant impact on the health of the diabetic community in and around Eugene. Under the current rules, DCCT cannot distribute insulin through its charitable pharmacy program. There are many people out there struggling to pay for their insulin and DCCT could offer a way for them to get the medication they desperately need. In o rder to make that happen, however, DCCT needs to be able to receive and distribute insulin through its charitable pharmacy operations, which requires a waiver of the rules.

JUNE 2019 / C1Providence Specialty Pharmacy Services - LTC Pharmacy (IP-0001899) : Auto Refill Policy Discussion S Situation : Inquiry Providence Specialty Pharmacy Services - LTC (IP -0001899) is asking the Board to review their processes with regard to the Board's auto -refill rule OAR 855 -041-1120(6) for their Independent ElderPlace program participants. Per the regulation, a pharmacy is required to have the patient/caregiver authorize automatic fill with each new medication start. Nurses with the program are questioning this requirement (and are resistant) and consider this an unnecessary barrier for their provision of patient care. B Background: Rules: OAR 855 -041-1120(6) Auto -Refill Programs . A mail order or retail pharmacy, excluding cycle -fill for long term care , may use a program that automatically refills non - controlled prescription medications, that have existing refills available and are consistent with the patient's current medication therapy only when the following conditions are met: (a) A patient or patient's agent must enroll each prescription medication in an auto -refill program before a pharmacy can include the pre scription medication as part of the auto -refill program; and (b) The prescription is not a controlled substance; and (c) The pharmacy must discontinue auto -refill program enrollment when requested by the patient or patient's agent; and (d) Pick-up notification to a patient or patient's agent may be generated upon completion of a prescription refill; and (e) When an auto -refill prescription is returned to stock or when delivery is refused that prescription medication is removed from the auto -refill program for that patient. Description, as provided by PIC Breier : ElderPlace is a PACE (Program of All- inclusive Care for the Elderly) recognized by CMS as one of the most robust models of care for seniors with significant comorbidities. ElderPlace serv es patients age 55 or older certified by individual state to need nursing home care. Based on its status as a PACE program and the nature of care provided by PACE, ElderPlace is a closed system which naturally contains all of our participants in a medical bubble under close scrutiny of an interdisciplinary team. ElderPlace and other PACE programs are able to provide the same level of care in the community by offering adult day center services, home healthcare visits, social services, and medical care that is provided by a medical team that includes MD/NP, RN, SW, RD, PharmD, PT/OT, SLP, CNA/CMA, PMHNP and drivers. Most ElderPlace patients live in licensed facilities and less than 10% live independently at home or with families. The oversight of the independ ently living participants is significantly different from a typical community based patient who receives their medications from a typical retail pharmacy. Our Pharmacy is the only dispensing pharmacy that is used for and by ElderPlace patients. Participants are unable to receive prescription orders from outside providers or pharmacies because Providence ElderPlace is also their Medicare Part D coverage. Also, given that our pharmacy is a related party under the same parent organization, Providence Healt h & Services, we have complete access to the EPIC EHR system. All medication orders and changes JUNE 2019 / D1are sent to the pharmacy both as a standard E -Script for filling and as an internally routed message in the EHR. This means that our pharmacy is in the unique p osition of having a real- time picture of every independently living participant's medication list. This allows the dispensing pharmacist to reach out more effectively to the medical team to reconcile discrepancies and ensure that no unnecessary or old medications are being sent to our participants. The intention of our pharmacy is to fill routine, non -control medications in synchronization each month for these Independent participants per ElderPlace request. We want to ensure that the residents do not mi ss necessary medication fills and maintain adherence to their medication regimen. Upon enrollment in the ElderPlace program, each independent patient, their caregiver and their family is made aware of our automated, synchronized monthly fill and medication delivery system. Given the PACE program's care model and closed system of medication management, we believe requesting authorization at each medication start would not be needed. A Assessment : Waiver assessment: There is no waiver provision in this rule set ; rather, the Board is asked to review the scenario/model described and make a determination whether it is permitted (rule interpretation) Rule language assessment: The pharmacy's program is not exactly \"cycle -fill\"; They are a long term care pharmacy but the 10% of the patients they are serving from PACE program are home bound - and don't meet care facility definition for LTC. Trend in healthcare is to keep the aging population at home to receive care, as it is a lower cos t and systems are in place to provide safe patient care and positive outcomes Considerations: o This could meet the intent of the rule, but the languages does not reflect- meaning this is the cycle fill for LTC language being to prescriptive and unintentio nally prohibitive o The intent of the auto -refill regulation is to prevent the excessive automated processes from inundating patients with medications they do not need or that have been discontinued. This model works to ensure intentional dispensing to align with patient safety and has safeguards in place to prevent abuse of auto refills by the pharmacy for a financial g ain. The pharmacy proactively monitors the medication profile. o These patients are under routine medical care, with coordinated care oversight by a team of healthcare providers, including visiting nurses. o Uniquely situated federal designation - According to CMS: The PACE program is a unique capitated managed care benefit for the frail elderly provided by a not -for- profit or public entity. The PACE program features a comprehensive medical and social service delivery system using an interdisciplinary team approach in an adult day health center that is supplemented by in -home and referral services in accordance with participants' needs. JUNE 2019 / D1R Recommendation : Patient safety assessment: M eets Board criteria for \"as safe, or safer\" Staff recommendation: Based on the rules intent, this process meets the criteria to be 'excepted' per the long term care cycle-fill component. As described, o ngoing proactive oversight by pharmacy staff and collaborative care team ensures that the patient is receiving the correct medications . Therefore a patient or patient's agent does not have to enroll each prescription into the Providence Specialty - LTC Pharmacy prescription filling and dispensing program. Inquiry Date: 4/25/19 Author: RPH Chris Breier Prepared by OBOP staff Board review: June 2019 meeting JUNE 2019 / D1SBAR: e-Verification S Situation: There will be a new e-Verification system which will be implemented in the fall . The Board has the op portunity to take advantage of a one time import into the new MyLicense Office database and import all available public documents. B Background: In 2007, public documents became available via the Board's license verification. All p ublic documents associated with actions for 2007 to present are available online. All public documents prior to 2007 continue to be available by written request to the Board of Pharmacy . A Assessment : Currently, there are an additional 439 public records that are formatted for the web and are available to be imported during the one time import into the e - Verification system by System Automation. Year Records Available Year Records Available Year Records Available Year Records Available 1983 1 1992 3 1997 10 2002 34 1988 3 1993 7 1998 29 2003 47 1989 1 1994 4 1999 44 2004 45 1990 0 1995 5 2000 44 2005 57 1991 2 1996 3 2001 41 2006 59 The majority , if not all , of the public records were prepared and formatted for previous written records requests. By importing the 439 public records, the Board increases tra nsparency and reduces staff resources spent providing public records. Because the records prior to 2007 are not available online, staff resources are used to provide credentialing agencies the same records annually. R Recommendation s: The staff recommends the importing of the additional available records into the new eVerification system. Date: 5/17/19 Author: Chrisy Hennigan Or egon Board of Pharmacy June 2019 Oregon Retail Sale of Cannabidiol (CBD) Products FAQ BACKGROUND In the U.S., the 2018 Farm Bill removed industrial hemp (and its extracts) from the Controlled Substances Act and legalized hemp to be considered as an agricultural product. It has had a wide range of practical uses including the production of fibers, textiles, cosmetics , food s, beverages, oils and more. Lik e marijuana, hemp is a variety of the Cannabis sativa plant species. However, it is typically distinguished by its lower concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is the main psychoactive compo cann contain >0.3% THC on a dry weight basis . With its fast -growing popularity, hemp has also become a primary source of CBD which like THC is a major component of cannabinoids but has no psychoactive (\"high\") effects. In Oregon, cannabis is divided into 2 categories: industrial hemp and marijuana. If hemp -made, a license or registration is not required for a business to sell CBD products under the state's Hemp Program as long as the product has <0.3% THC and is not advertised as a dietary supplement . Testing requirements are implemented and enforced by the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) to ensure growers and handlers are in compliance prior to sale or transfer to consumers. Overall, there is no legal prohibition against the sale of CBD products to individuals who are <21 years of age (unless it is used for the sale of inhalant delivery systems and their components) or limitations on purchases from retail locations. Per the Oregon Board of Pharmacy, CBD products can be sold at the pharmacy regis ter by any staff, but all questions related to CBD products must be directed to the pharmacist. CBD products should not be stored in the pharmacy or ordered through the pharmacy. (source: April 2019 Board meeting minutes) FAQs The following FAQs are provided to address pharmacy involvement in the sales of CBD products. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy does not have jurisdictional oversight over the regulation of industrial hemp and CBD products in Oregon. Q. A. Are pharmacy locations permitted to sell CBD products at the retail (front -end) of the store and if so does this require registration with a regulatory body? Per the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized industrial hemp (including its extracted products such as CBD), it is legal to sell hemp derived CBD pr oducts at a retail location as long as they are: 1) not advertised as a dietary supplement, and 2) provided that their THC concentration is <0.3%. Cu rrently, there is no requirement for a license or registration for a business to sell CBD products under ODA's Hemp Program . Q. A. Who regulates CBD products and verifies that the amount of THC is within legal concentrations, per 2018 Farm Bill, THC level <0.3%? In Oregon, testing requirements are implemented and enforced by the ODA to ensure growers and processors of industrial hemp are in compliance prior to sale or transfer to consumers. Q. A. Are there any restrictions to sale; age restriction, limit in quantity, d elivery mechanism? No, as long as the CBD product is derived from industrial hemp and meets federal requirements. Q. A. Can CBD be sold as a dietary supplement? No. According to the FDA, under the FD&C Act, it is illegal to market CBD as a dietary supplement. JUNE 2019 / E Oregon Board of Pharmacy June 2019 Q. A. Can CBD product s be sold at the pharmacy register? Yes. Q. A. Who can answer health -related questions about CBD? Pharmacists , when the pharmacy is open . Q. A. Can a CBD product user test positive for a marijuana drug screen ? Yes, it is possible. The test does not distinguish between THC derived from hemp product or marijuana product. The test may be dependent on how much individuals take, when they use it and the frequency in which they consume it. (Note: Drug tests do not tes t for CBD, but do detect THC. The test cannot distinguish whether detectable THC metabolites is the result of CBD use or the use of marijuana. ) OREGON LAWS AND RULES The laws and rules applicable to the retail sales of CBD in Oregon include: 2018 OR SB 1544 . Requires that products sold in an Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) retailer (recreational marijuana) must have a label that clearly identifies the source of the CBD - hemp vs marijuana. ORS 571.303 . Industrial hemp is an agricultural product that is subject to regulation by ODA . ORS 571.333 . ODA may enter an agreement with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to ensure that hemp crops contain THC concentrations <0.3% on a dry weight basis and are tested by a laboratory licensed by OLCC and accredited by OHA. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT Medical Marijuana Recreational Marijuana Industrial Hemp Product Marijuana Marijuana products products derived from marijuana or industrial hemp.

Dear Karen, I am interested in applying to serve on the Naturopathic Formulary Council. For the last 3 years I have worked part-time as a clinical pharmacist for BHS pharmacy, a long-term care pharmacy in Eugene that services facilities all over Oregon and Washington. During the rest of my time I manage a small fruit farm south of Eugene near Lorane. Although my professional career began in pharmacy in Oregon, I have conducted formal and informal research on a variety of traditional herbal and natural medicine practices in several different countries (my cv has more details). My interest in herbal products began with training as a teenager from my grandmother who was an herbalist in Arizona, and continued at OSU with training by Marine Natural Product chemist, Bill Gerwick and natural product pharmacognosist, George Constantine. As a graduate student I studied traditional medicine with healers on the island of Rotuma, Fiji. For 15 years I was a professor with the University of Hawaii at Manoa with appointments in several departments, primarily Botany, and the Cancer Research Center, Natural Products Program. During this time I taught courses on plant-based medicines for graduate students, pre-medical, and medical students. Throughout most of my career I have been a very active member and leader in the Society for Economic Botany which is the world's largest eclectic collection of people interested in how plants and humans interact. For over 20 years I have also participated in the American Botanical Council and currently am a member of the Advisory Board. In 2010, I moved to Texas to lead the research program transition of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT) from a small- scale program to a program with a wide range of research projects in 10 countries and a large permanent, temporary, and adjunct staff of scientists and educators. In 2015, my wife's health began to fail, I resigned as head of research, and we moved home to Oregon to be close to family and to set up a small farm to grow fruit trees and berries. I plan to live out my days in Oregon and therefore hope to be able to contribute what I can to see our community develop. Please find attached my cv and consider the message above as my letter. I am happy to address any questions you may have and look forward to being of service to Oregon in this or some other fashion.

I oversaw budgeting, with staff assigned to purchases, local and international logistics, and grants management. The organizational budget annually is approximately 5 million with ~2 million from endowments, <2 million from donors, and >1 million from grants and contracts. During the five years I worked with BRIT the endowment was tripled to about 45 million based primarily on our expanding research and educational reputations, and the diversity and increase of competitive federal and private funding sources received. In particular, I worked with ranchers in Texas and Brazil to both produce new research on their lands and to address general conservation issues that impact their production efforts. The most important lasting success in this regard was a change in members of our non-profit board of directors to include several ranchers with strong conservation values and abilities to help raise funding for local and international research on human interactions with environments. The research director's role has been one of facilitating communication between staff and a wide range of constituents, funding agencies, donors, and community members. I strongly believe that effective communication is the key to successful project and program management, and is critical for pharmacist interactions with patients and other professionals. Effective communication involves thoughtful development of substantive plans and actions that are shared in ways that can empower people to get their primary jobs done with a minimum of interruption. Texas Christian University Affiliate Professor, Institute for Environmental Studies 2011 - 2015 Although I more or less left academia when I moved to Texas, TCU offered the opportunity to continue to mentor graduate students and to help teach courses in conservation of natural resources. University of North Texas, Health Science Center Affiliate Graduate Faculty, Biomedical Sciences 2012 - 2015 When the decision was made to move to Texas, I still was supervising several students from UH and working collaboratively with graduate students from Thailand. UNT provided laboratory space and collaboration opportunities through a prior agreement with BRIT so my students were able to continue their work.

I was hired to produce the world's first undergraduate degree in Ethnobotany, which happened in 2002. Since then the program has been copied in variations at five other U.S. universities. I supervised more than 30 graduate students, hundreds of undergraduates in botany and biology, and at times up to 5 staff members and multiple federal grants and private contracts for research.

With few exceptions, I have avoided using translators when working in a community for more than a few months. While I have usually easily picked up languages (Thai being a notable exception that was very difficult), I have also made little effort to maintain them so do not feel I am currently fluent in any other languages. The following are languages that I have used for completing work and in formal publications: Babatana, Fijian, German, Rotuman, Spanish, Thai. I am also familiar with geographical, mythical, and biological terms that are common to many Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian, Samoan, and Tongan. Languages and linguistics are something I have long enjoyed dabbling in and therefore look forward to new opportunities to learn and practice. I have been working to relearn Spanish, particularly for communication with pharmacy patients. JUNE 2019 / #F1 5 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT and APPLIED ETHNOBOTANY EXPERIENCE During my PhD research, I was fortunate to receive funding for a series of small field research projects in several Pacific island countries. In the second one of these, in Samoa, we worked quite closely within the traditional community structure. The research took less time than we had planned, and produced results that could not have been achieved without the community participation. This lesson was then carried over in subsequent projects where I specifically engaged local communities and spent growing amounts of time and energy working toward their objectives without any degradation of the primary research mission. After beginning as a faculty member at University of Hawai`i, that work history began to pay off as people from different island groups began to approach me and my department for work based on the good reputation developed with prior projects. The net result was that most of my work during 15 years at University of Hawai`i was conducted with communities and there was never a shortage of opportunities to address interesting research questions and for high quality student projects. Because of these relationships the only resource we really lacked was time. E.U. (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, & United Kingdom) Various small-scale orchards. Studies with local apple orchard managers and cider producers focusing on two aspects: 1) How is knowledge developed and passed-on, and how can this be used to develop practical instructional curriculum in science, and 2) What are the elements of orchards as artificial ecosystems that have been engineered to produce cider, and are these resilient in the face of climate change?

Be sure to include your term and meeting frequency. I h ave been on the OBNM Formulary Council since August 2011, with my current term ending June 2019. We meet every six months, typically in March and September or early October. I would like to express my interest at remaining on this Council for another term and provi de a summary of my activity on the council over the last year. In this last year, we finished clarifying the suggested changes to the formulary rule 850 -60-223 to ensure the best wording and inclusion or exclusion of all prescribed medications intended, including a review of abortifacients. We also continued our discussion on ketamine prescribing and safety. As far as my role on the council, I think the most critical piece is my knowledge and involvement with compounding. There are many changes happening in compounding this year. At the last meeting, I provided a review of the changes at a federal and state level and how these changes may impact naturopathic physicians and patients. We discussed the status of office -use compounding (compounded products th at are ordered by a physician to administer at their office without a prescription for one specific patient) and how the upcoming USP chapter regulation changes regarding sterile compounding would also impact naturopathic physicians preparing IVs and other injectables in their offices. In addition, many substances that naturopathic physicians prescribe (including natural substances approved as supplements but requiring a prescription to compound) are currently under review federally and may be restricted fr om use by compounding pharmacies in the future and we discussed that as well. I b elieve it is important especially this year and next to have a pharmacist familiar with compounding on the Formulary Council due to these significant issues. A couple weeks ago I participated in the Drug Compounding Rules Advisory Committee for the Oregon Board of Pharmacy as they are in the process of writing a major revision of Division 45 compounding rules in Oregon. These changes will almost certainly be finalized by the end of the year, in time for the changes to USP Chapter <795>, <797> and <800> regarding nonsterile and sterile compounding practice requirements that go into effect December 1, 2019. I have attended regulatory conferences to stay apprised of the current legal landscape federally as well so am well versed in those areas as well. Th ank you for your consideration.
