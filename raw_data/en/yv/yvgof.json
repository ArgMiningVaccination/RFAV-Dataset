Introduction During our current era, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) has drawn the attention of every one all over the globe. In April 6th 2020, glob- ally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), CoVID -19 affected 1,210,956 confirmed cases with 67,594 deaths , with its unprecedented challenges to the global public health system [1] . This pandemic has disrupted the flow of everyday life as we know it. Healthcare systems started to experience some fai l- ure which led to reallocation of its resource in a new setting because of this crisis with a great difficulties for both healthcare personals and patients. Of course, people with comorbid diseases like diabetes mellitus are at a great risk for the hazardous consequences of this pandemic.

Diabetes Mellitus and COVID- 19 2.1. Diabetes Mellitus and COVID -19 Morbidity and Mortality Diabetes promotes severe progression in COVID -19 patients, the presence of coexisting diabetes was more common among COVID -19 patients with severe disease than among those with non -severe disease (16.2% vs. 5.7%), ( Figure 1 ). Data was extracted regarding 1099 patients with laboratory -confirmed Covid -19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29th, 2020 [2]. Another nationwide analysis of comorbid- ity and its impact on 1,590 patients with COVID -19 in China, also, revealed thatCOVID- 19 patients with diabetes had a worse prognosis ( Figure 2 ) [3]. Diabetes is considered as a risk factor for mortality in cases with COVID -19. A large national study showed that the mortality of patients with diabetes was significantly higher than that of non- diabetic patients, (10% vs 2.5% P <0.001) [3]. In addition, WHO Joint Mission claimed that patients who reported no comorbid conditions had a CFR of 1.4%, patients with comorbid conditions had Figure 1 . COVID- 19 patients with comorbidities [2]. Figure 2 . The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints and disease severity among patients with COVID -19 [3]. A. Alshaikh et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115020 201 International Journal of Clinical Medicine much higher ra tes\u20149.2% f or diabetes [4]. Also, Chinese CDC declared that pa- tients who reported no comorbid conditions had a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.9%, while patients with comorbid conditions had much higher rates \u20147.3% for diabetes [5]. A research about clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID- 19 found that diabetic ketoacidosis is one of the causes of mortality [6]. 2.2. How Does Diabetes Accentuate COVID- 19 Morbidity? High level IL -6, TNF - and other inflammatory cytokines are expressed in the serum of individuals with diabet es [7]. Moreover, animal models suggested that diabetes significantly promoted the production of TLR4 -induced IL -6 [8]. Also, studies have shown that coronavirus, including SARS, is highly likely to activate TLR3 and TLR4, leading to a runaway immune response [8] , which in turn leads to Il-6- dominated cytokine storms, which have also been shown to be one of the leading causes of death from coronavirus pneumonia [9] . In addition, IL -6 were associated with death of COVID -19 patients , univariate regression showed in- creasing odds of in- hospital death associated with IL -6 (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.23, Per 1 unit increase; p = 0. 0080) [10]. Therefore, it can be speculated that over activation of TLR4 signaling ( Figure 3 ) in individuals with diabetes may contribute to the progression of the severity of the disease and even morta l- ity. Moreover, patients with diabetes may have bad glycemic control after viral Figure 3 . The potential mechanism of high severe/died risk in diabe tic patients [10] . A. Alshaikh et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115020 202 International Journal of Clinical Medicine infection. It was suggested that SARS- CoV may cause pancreatic islets pathology because of the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the fun c- tional receptor of SARS -CoV, in th e exocrine and endocrine tissues of the pa n- creas [11]. In addition, a recent study in China have found that SARS -CoV -2 is able to efficiently use human ACE2 as a rece ptor for cellular entry, which could potentially facilitate human -to-human transmission [12]. 2.3. Glucose Level Fluctuation in Patients with COVID- 19 Glucose level is fluctuating in patients with diabetes and COVID -19 because of irregular diet, reduced exercise, increased glucocorti coids secretion due to stress, the use of glucocorticoids in treatment, the interruption or non -standard trea t- ment with oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) in isolation wards. Also, COVID- 19 can cause human body to produce a large number of inflammatory cytokines and lead to extreme stress in some severe and critical patients [13]. 3. Management of Diabetes Mellitus in Patients with COVID- 19 3.1. Glycemia Target in Patients with COVID- 19 Stratification of cases with COVID- 19 according to severity is the first step for better glucose management. For mild and moderate non- elderly COVID -19 pa- tients, stick with strict high control target ( Table 1 ). For mild and moderate el- derly patients, or patients who have been using glucocorticoid, set up a low or strict control target. For severe and critical patients, elderly patients, hypoglyc e- mia intolerable patients, or patients who have organ dysfunction or se rious ca r- diovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, set up a low control target ( Table 1 ). Also, hypoglycemia occurrence should be minimized during glucose manag e- ment in diabetes patients with COVID- 19. Medical care should be performed i n time if hypoglycemia occurs [13]. 3.2. Therapeutic Principle of Glucose Management in Patients with COVID -19 Insulin treatment is the first choice if diabetes combined with severe infection . For non -critical patients, insulin sc. injection is recommended, and basic dosage can refer to the out -of-hospital dosage. For critical patients, CSII is reco m- mended. In case of serious glucose metabolism disorder with water and electro- lyte and acid -base disorders, IV insulin treatment should be started, in combina- tion w ith aggressive fluid infusion. If the clinical condition is stable and eating Table 1 . Target stratification of glucose management in hospitalized patients. High Medium Low FPG/PPG, (mmol/L) 4.4 - 6.1 6.1 - 7.8 7.8 - 10.0 2hPPG/GLU, (mmol/L) 6.1 - 7.8 7.8 - 10.0 7.8 - 13.9 A. Alshaikh et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115020 203 International Journal of Clinical Medicine pattern is regular, patients can continue OAD treatment as before admission. Using NPH and long- acting insulin is recommended during glucocorticoid treatment to control the glucose level. Also, measure 7 point glucose (if neces-sary, plus nocturnal glucose) during insulin treatment [13] . Antidiabetic drugs and their use are shown in Table 2 . 3.3. Management Plan of Diabetes in Patients with COVID -19 according to Disease Severity Severity of COVID -19 can b e based on the clinical classification released by the National Health Commission of China as shown in Table 3 [14]. 1) Mild cases There is no need to adjust the original regime too much. Both OAD and i n- sulin treatment can be maintained. The progress of COVID- 19 can be rapidly, Table 2 . Anti -diabetic drugs and COVID-19. Class Comment Metformin Not recommended in severe/critical patients; patients with gastrointestinal symptoms or lack of oxygen. Secretagogue Mild/moderate patients using glucocorticoid: Short- acting agents can be used in early stage; Middle/long -acting agents if FPG and/or PPG increased or in advanced stage. -glucosidase inhibitor Can be used to control PPG. Not recommended in severe/critical patients; or in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. TZD Can be used during the process of glucocorticoid treatment. Regime should be adjusted according to treatment effect. DPP -4i Not recommended SGLT -2i Not recommended for COVID -19 patients having stress reaction at different levels. Table 3 . Severity classification of COVID -19. Mild Mild clinical manifestation None Imaging Performance Moderate Fever, respiratory symptoms, pneumonia performance on X -ray or CT Severe Meet any of the followings: 1. Respiratory distress, RR 30/min; 2. Oxygen saturation 93% at rest state; 3. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2)/Fraction of inspiration O 2 (FiO 2) 300 mnHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa Critically severe Meet any of the followings: 1. Respiratory failure needs mechanical ventilation; 2. Shock; 3. Combined with other organ failure, patients need ICU monitoring and treatment A. Alshaikh et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115020 204 International Journal of Clinical Medicine and can be worsen with hyperglycemia, thus, it is strongly recommend to in- crease the frequency of glucose monitoring, and consult with physicians to adjust treatment regime whenever needed even in diabetes patients with mild COVID- 19. 2) Moderate cases Original treatment regime is to be maintainedif patient's cognitive condition, appetite and glucose control are within normal range. In patients with obvious COVID- 19 symptoms who cannot eat regularly, OAD is to be switched to ins u- lin. Premix insulin regime is to be switched to basal -bolus regime or insulin pump for better flexibility of glucose management. 3) Severe and critical cases Intravenous insul in injection should be the first- line treatment. For patients who are in process of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), the pro-portion of glucose and insulin in the replacement solution should be increased or decreased according to glucose monitoring result to avoid hypoglycemia and severe glucose fluctuations. 3.4. Management Plan of for Different Types of Diabetes in Patients with COVID- 19 1) Type 1DM Insulin pump or basal plus bolus insulin treatment is the optimal regimen. Insulin analogues ar e recommended as first choice. Insulin treatment regimenis to be individualized according to individual's profile. 2) Type 2DM For mild COVID- 19 patients with low -moderate glucose increase, non -insulin diabetes drugs can be used. For patients with fever or treated by glucocorticoid, insulin treatment is the first choice. For critical patients, insulin IV injection is recommended. 3) Glucocorticoid -associated diabetes Glucocorticoids -induced glucose increase often occurs between after- lunch and before- sleep. Therefore, it is important to monitor blood glucose after lunch and before dinner. Insulinisthe first choice. 3.5. Glucose Management of COVID -19 and Diabetes Treat ed with Glucocorticoids Effect of glucocorti coids in COVID -19 is uncertain. However, some centers r e- ported that glucocorticoids can be used in critical patients, or patients with fever and sporadic lesion in lungs, to reduce inflammatory lung injury. Thus , special consideration should be taken in management of glucose level in those cases [13]. 3.6. Glucose Management of Children and Adolescents In children, strengthen blood glucose monitoring (4 - 7 times /day) and indivi- dualize the exercise program. The total energy requirement in kcal/day = (Age * A. Alshaikh et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115020 205 International Journal of Clinical Medicine 70 - 100) + 1000 with carbohydrate: 50% - 55%, fat: 25% - 35% and protein: 15% - 20%. It is to be adjusted by nutrition, physical activity and stress of the child- ren. Identify DKA and hypoglycemia in time. Target of blood glucose control is HbA1c < 7.5% [15] [16]. 4. Recommendations Because of the more fluctuations of blood glucose level, strengthened d y- nam ic glucose monitoring is necessary. As disease conditions of COVID- 19 and diabetes can change rapidly, it is recommend to apply insulin therapy as soon as possible according to glucose level, and actively adjust treatment regime, to control glucose to a re latively ideal level. Insulin IV injection should be the first- line treatment in severe and critical patients. For fasting patients, the suggested ratio of glucose to insulin in IV infusion fluid is 2 - 4 G glucose: 1U insulin. Too much and too long course of glucocorticoid treatment are main risk factor for glucose deterioration. When gradually reduce glucocorticoid treatment, we should also pay atten-tion to glucose fluctuation, and adjust insulin dosage according to glucose level. In principle, it i s recommended to measure blood glucose 7 times a day. Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this p a- per.

Recent studies have shown that C-peptide has many potential cell targets and has biological effects on a variety of tissue systems in humans and other animals. In this paper, the effects of C -peptide on diabetic complications, reproductive endocrine system, blood system, ti s- sue repair, and neoplastic diseases were reviewed to provide references for further clarification of c -peptide related problems. Keywords C-Peptide , Physiological Functions , Review 1. Introduction C-peptide is a polypeptide composed of 31 amino acids; it is a key substance connecting proinsulin alpha chain and beta chain, and plays an important role in the correct folding of proinsulin and the formation of disulfide bonds. Endo- genous or exogenous substances such as glucose, amino acids, glucagon, etc. stimulate cells to release equal amounts of insulin and C- peptide from their secretory vesicles. The regulation of insulin on blood glucose, fat and protein metabolism has been very clear, and has long been used clinically as a hypogl y- cemic drug. As a homologous acti ve substance secreted by insulin, C -peptide has not been paid enough attention for a long time, and its physiological function is still not very clear. C -peptide was previously considered to be inert, but now more and more studies have shown that C -peptide is a physiologically active molecule with many potential cellular targets [1] ; it can play an important role in diabetic complications, reproductive endocrine system, blood system, tissue r e- *Corresponding author.

Effect of C -Peptide on Kidney Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious diabetic microvascular complication; it is the main cause of end -stage renal disease and the leading cause of death in T1DM patients. The appearance of urinary protein and the gradual decline of renal function are the signs of the development of DN. Studies have shown that C -peptide has the effect of i mproving DN, and its protective effect on the kidney is reflected in two aspects of structure and fun c- tion. A study in rats showed that physiological dose of C -peptide treatment can reduce urinary protein, improve glomerular sclerosis and podocyte morpholo gy, reduce the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, and inhibit the synth e- sis of glomerular mesangin [2]. Another Meta analysis showed that C -peptide can reduce glomerular hyperfiltration and reduce urine protein in T1DM p a- tients with normal renal function or early renal disease; C -peptide can reduce urine protein, diminish glomerular volume and mesangial matrix area in diabe t- ic animals [ 3]. However, research by Nakamoto et al. showed that C -peptide did not improve the glomerular filtration membrane structure of early T1DM rats, and believed that the protective effect of C -peptide on reducing glomerular fi l- tration rate was functional, not Structural [4] ; but the duration of this study is short (only 1 day of C -peptide injection), and it s long -term effect is unknown, so the conclusion is open to question. Evaluation of the effect of pancreatic tran s- plantation surgery further supports the beneficial effect of C -peptide on DN, because renal function in patients with T1DM can be partially im proved after transplantation, which is considered to be due to the supplementation of C- peptide [5]. Research by Li et al . showed that C -peptide hardly enters glomerular cells when blood glucose levels are normal, but C- peptide can be dynamically loc a- lized in the nucleus after high glucose stimulation, which provides a basis for elucidating the mechanism of C -peptide on DN [6] . The protective mechanism of on is as follows: a) C-peptide stimulates gene transcri p- tion, inhibits iNOS expression, down -regulates RAGE and up- regulates PKA, and prevents and delays microangiopathy in the kidney [2] b) Matrix metallo- proteinases (MMPs) are zinc- dependent can degrade many types of extracellular matrix components.C -peptides may reduce the accumula- extracellul thus re versing DN [7]. c) C-peptide may be used as a natural antioxidant to protect the fun c- tion of islet cells and delay DN [8]. d) C- peptide can play a protective role in the kidney by reducing the inflammatory response [9]. 2.2. Effect of C -Peptide on Retina Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of R. Zeng et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115021 209 International Journal of Clinical Medicine diabetes and one of the main causes of blindness in adults, which greatly reduces the quality of life of diabetic patients. 45% of T2DM patients with a disease course of more than 10 years are associated with varying degrees of DR [10]. A large number of studies have shown that C- peptide can reduce the occu r- rence of DR. A retrospective analysis of the Diabetes Control and Complications Test showed that the residual secretion of serum C -peptide reduced the inc i- dence of DR in T1DM pa tients. Studies have shown that serum C- peptide levels are negatively correlated with the prevalence of DR in patients with T2DM; DR patients show lower levels of fasting C- peptide, 2 h postprandial C -peptide, and C -peptide) [11]. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a layer of epithelial cells containing pigment be-tween the neural retina and the choroid; RPE cells hav e the potential to differe n- tiate into photoreceptors and ganglion cells. The main cause of DR is damage to RPE, which leads to the destruction of the blood- retinal barrier and macular edema [12]. An animal experiment (STZ -induced T1DM mouse showed that C- peptide can improve retinal vascular permeability and prevent vascular leakage [13]. The mechanism by which C -peptide protects the retina is as follows: a) C- peptide improves retinal vascular permeability and prevents retinal neovascula-rization by affecting various effector proteins and transcription factors of RPE [13]. b) C-peptide normalizes Na+-K+-ATPase activity [14], on the one hand pre- vents RPE into fibroblasts and myofibroblasts [15], on the other hand inhibits the activity of retinal vascular endothelial growth factor dependent signaling pathway recovery [13], thereby preventing retinal detachment. 2.3. Effect of C -Peptide on Nervous System Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most common neurological co m- plication of diabetic patients. DPN greatly increases the risk of diabetic patients suffering from foot ulcers, ankle fractures and lower limb amputations, leading to a significant decline in the quality of life of patients. It also causes a huge so- cio-economic burden. C-peptide may have a potential inhibitory effect on the occurrence of DPN. A study of Chinese people showed that serum C- peptide was negatively correlat ed with the prevalence of DPN in T2DM patients; the serum concentration of fas t- ing C -peptide, 2 h postprandial C -peptide and C -peptide in the non -DPN group was significantly higher than that in the clinical DPN group and the co n- firmed DPN group [16]. Jolivalt et al. research showed that exogenous C -peptide can delay and prevent STZ -induced T1DM mice from experiencing movement, pain, temperature, and tactile dysfuncti on [17]. Clinical studies have shown that exogenous C -peptide can improve the ability of lower limb vibration perception in T1DM patients [18]. The mechanism by which C -peptide delays the occurrence of DPN is that C-peptide stimulates eNOS gene expression, enhances Na+-K+-ATPase activity, R. Zeng et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115021 210 International Journal of Clinical Medicine and increases the secretion of neurotrophic factors, thereby protecting nerve cells and nerve fibers from high glucose toxicity damage [19]. 2.4. Effect of C -Peptide on Macrovascular Disease Diabetic macroangiopathy mainly includes coronary arteriosclerosis, cervical vascular and cerebral vascular sclerosis, renal arteriosclerosis, extremity arterio s- clerosis, etc., which is the main cause of death in T2DM patients. Studies have shown that serum C -peptide can promote arteriosclerosis. Pi k- kemaat et al. showed that increased baseline serum C -peptide concentration was associated with increased risk of all -cause death and cardiovascular death in newly diagnosed T2DM patients [20] . Further research shows that for all T2DM patients (regardless of whether they are newly diagnosed or not, regardless of whether they have atherosclerotic disease), C -peptide is positively correlated with cardiovascular mortality risk [21] [22]. The mechanism by which C -peptide promotes the occurrence of macrovasc u- lar complications is that C -peptide increases the lipid deposition on the vascular wall by increasing triglycerides or reducing high -density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; Increased risk of cardiovascular disease by promoting proliferation of vascular wall macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells [23] [24]. 3. Th e Role of C -Peptide in Other Aspects 3.1. Effect of C -Peptide on Reproductive Endocrine System Non -alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a wide range and varying degrees of liver damage, from steatosis to steatohepatitis, advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. C -peptide may promote the development of NAFLD. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that fasting C-peptide is a risk factor for NAFLD in the general population of the United States [25]. Studies have shown that C -peptide is independently associated with liver fibrosis in T2DM patients [26] . The mechanism by which C -peptide pr o- motes NAFLD is that C -peptide increases leptin by activating PI3K or PKB pathway es hepatic steatosi s [28]. C-peptide has a positive effect on the increase of bone mineral density (BMD). Studies have shown that C -peptide levels are positively correlated with lumbar BMD in postmenopausal women [29] . A study of postmenopausal women with diabetes has similar conclusions [30] . The mechanism by which C -peptide i n- creases BMD may be through t he ERK 1/2 pathway acting on osteoblasts, in- creasing collagen biosynthesis, and inhibiting osteoclasts by reducing RANKL expression [30]. C-peptide can maintain the reproductive system function of diabetic animals. Studies have shown that C -peptide can be combined with insulin (or even r e- place insulin) to prevent or delay mouse testicular dysfunction caused by di-abetes [31]. The mechanism is as follows: a) The antioxidant effect of C -peptide reduces DN A breakage and apoptosis [32]; b) C-peptide can activate protein k i-R. Zeng et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115021 211 International Journal of Clinical Medicine nase , inhibit the generation of reactive oxygen species by mitochondrial NADPH oxidase, thereby preventing the apoptosis of endothelial cells [33]. 3.2. C- Peptide Levels Are Associated with Hematological Diseases C-peptide has a positive effect on the increase of hemoglobin. A cross- sectional study of T2DM patients showed that the concentrations of fasting C peptide, 2 h postprandial C -peptide, and C-peptide in anemia patients were lower than those without anemia, indicating that the degree of anemia was negatively co r- related with serum C -peptide concentrations in T 2DM patients (fasting C pe p- tide: r = 0.057, p = 0.032; 2 h postprandial C -peptide: r = 0.098, p 0.001; C-peptide: r = 0.095, p < 0.001) [34]. Hemoglobin is used as an indicator to evaluate the degree of anemia. The lower the hemoglobin, the more severe the anemia. At present, the mechanism of C -peptide on hemoglobin is not clear; it is considered that C -peptide may have the effect of anti -oxidation and mainte n- ance of Na+-k+-ATPase activity, so as to prolong the life of red blood cells. 3.3. Effect of C -Peptide on Tissue Repair C-peptide may have a potential role in promoting the repair of tissue damage. Studies have shown that C -peptide can significantly promote skin wound hea l- ing in diabetic mice [35]. A study of T1DM mice showed that when simvastatin induces skeletal muscle apoptosis, C- peptide can effectively inhibit ap optos is [36]. Tauber et al . study has shown that angiogenesis and granulation tissue formation in the early healing stage of non- diabeticrabbit skeletal muscle tissu e samples are positively correlated with the level of C -peptide in peripheral blood [37], so it is believed that C -peptide can also be used to monitor the healing process of tissues without diabetes. The mechanism of C -peptide to promote tissue healing is as follows: a) C- peptide inhibits apoptosis through pertussis toxin sensitive pathway [36]. b) C-peptide induces endothelial cell migration and mediates activating signal -related kinases and inducing nitric oxide production [35]. 3.4. The Role of C -Peptide in Neoplastic Diseases C-peptide plays an important role in a variety of neoplastic diseases. C -peptide may have different effects on tumors in different parts. C -peptide can promote the occurrence and development of various tumors. A large prospective study showed that high levels of C -peptide increased the risk of de veloping cancer in the colon (OR = 1.73), liver (3.23), kidney, renal pelvis, and ureteral cancer (2.47) [38]. Another study showed that high levels of C -peptide may be ass o- ciated with high- risk prostate cancer. The mechanism by which C -peptide pr o- motes the occurrence of these tumors is not clear [39]. C-peptide may have an inhibitory effect on tumor formation and metastasis in certain parts. Studies have shown that C -peptide can prevent vascular leakage and metastasis of melanoma cells in the lungs of diabetic mice caused by hype r-R. Zeng et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115021 212 International Journal of Clinical Medicine glycemia [40]. The mechanism may be that C -peptide reduces the damage of adhesion molecules to the vascular endothelium by inhibiting the induced intracellular events of vascular endothelial growth factor (including the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen levels, TGase2 activation, etc.), thereby preven t- ing vascular leakage [40] . Research by Nogueira et al. Showed that C -peptide le- vels are inversely related to pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma in current smoking patients [41]. 4. Outlook In summary, C- peptide can play an active role in multiple systems, including chronic microvascular complications of diabetes, bone mineral density, repr o- ductive system, anemia, tissue repair, and the occurrence of some tumors; ho w- ever, it has adverse effects on diabetic macrovascular complications, fatty liver, and other tumors. At present, the many mechanisms of C- peptide are still un- clear. At present, many mechanisms of action of C -peptide are still unclear; as a small molecule peptide, it is unclear whether it can cooperate with other su b- stances to exert physiological and biochemical functions. With the deepening of research, C -peptide may be used as a breakthrough in diabetes treatment.

Methods : The hemorrhage pati ents with carniocervial CTA from January 2018 to August 2019 in Puren Hospital of Wuhan were analyzed re- trospectively. The correlation and risk factors between hypertensive intrac e- rebral hemorrhage and internal carotid atherosclerosis were studied by l o- gistic regression and descriptive analysis, at the same time, the application value of carniocervial CTA in patients with cerebral hemorrhage was ev a- luated. Results : There was a between hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage and internal carotid atherosclerosis ( 2 P = 0.021 < 0.05, OR = 2.70 > 1), which indicated that internal carotid atherosclerosis was the risk factor of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, and there was no si g- nificant correlation between the location of internal carotid atheroscler o- sis, multiple atherosclerosis of internal carotid artery and hypertensive intra- cerebral hemorrhage. Monofactor analysis showed that the of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage with internal carotid atherosclerosis were sex , age, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. According to the logistic regre s- sion analysis, hyperlipidemia and diabetes were independent risk factors for hypertensive. Conclusion: The occurrence of hypertensive intracereb ral h e- morrhage is related to internal carotid atherosclerosis and is affected b y many factors. Carniocervial CTA is helpful to the diagnosis of cerebral h emorr- hage. *Corresponding author. How to cite this paper: Wu, B . and Zhou , C.Z.

As the problem of aging population becomes more and more prominent, the incidence of the disease is also increasing year by year. It has the characterist ics of disability rate, mortality rate, high recurrence rate and is one of the biggest threats to human health in the 21st century [1] . Studies have shown that carotid atherosclerosis exists of patients with intracerebral hemor r- hage [2]. This paper uses head and neck CTA, to further explore the relationship between the characteristics of carotid atherosclerotic plaque in internal carotid artery and hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, and expounds the application value of CTA in intracerebral hemorrhage disease. 2. Objects and Methods 2.1. Object of Study From January 2018 to August 2019, 50 patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage who were admitted to Puren Hospital of Wuhan City were selected as the experimental group and 50 patients with non -cranial hemorrhage were selected as the control gro up, including 9 patients with mild craniocerebral tra u- ma, 20 patients with dizziness and headache, 21 patients with transient ischemic attack. All patients underwent CTA examination. Inclusion criteria: 1) consistent with the clinical diagnostic guidelines related to hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage [3] ; 2) confirmed by MRI , CT and other imaging examinations; 3) initial onset. Exclusion criteria: 1) patients with secondary intracerebral hemorrhage, such as aneurysm rupture, cerebrovascular malformation, pa-tients hypertensive with hemorrha gic cerebral infarction; 4 ) patients with head and neck CTA with poor imaging and incomplete clinical data.

Basic Information Record the pat ient's age, gender, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, drinking history and other data. Carotid atherosclerotic plaque is defined as local bulge thickening, protruding into the lumen, thickness 1.3 mm [4]. According to carniocervial CTA imaging data and the 7 -segment method of internal carotid artery proposed by Bouthillieretal in 1996 [5], the intracranial atherosclerosis. 4. Statistical Processing SPSS17.0 was used for statistical analysis. Counting data is expressed in (n%), using 2 test. The measurement data is expressed by (X \u00b1 S), and t test is used. Multivariate correlation analysis was performed using binary classification L o- gistic regression analysis. P < 0.05 is a significant difference, with statistical si g- nificance. 5. Resul t 5.1.

There was no difference in age between the two groups. Chi -square test was conducted on the gender composition of the two groups, and their 2 value was 1.478 and p value was 0.224. There was no difference in gender composition between the two groups. There was no statistically significant difference in age and gender between the two groups, and they were comparable. 5.2. Analysis of the Incidence of Internal Carotid Atherosclerosis in Patients with Hypertensive Cerebral Hemorrhage between Internal Carotid Atherosclerosis and Hypertensive Cerebral Hemorrhage According to the imaging data of the patient 's head and neck CTA, the statistics of internal carotid atherosclerotic plaque sclerosis. Among the 50 patients with hyperten sive cerebral hemorrhage, 38 patients (76.0%) with internal carotid including 11 patients (28.9%) with internal carotid artery intra-cranial segment alone There were 6 patients (15.8%) with plaque in the extra-cranial segment of arteries, an d 21 patients (55.3%) had both; in the control group, there were 27 patients (54%) with internal carotid atherosclerosis. Among them, 13 patients (48.1%) had plaque in the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery alone, and 3 patients (11.1%) ha d plaque in the extr a- cranial segment of the internal carotid artery (11.40%). The formation of inter-nal carotid atherosclerosis is a risk factor for hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage (P < 0.05, OR == 2.70 > 1). There is no difference in the probability of plaques in the intracranial and extracranial segments of the internal carotid artery leading to cerebral hemorrhage (P > 0.05). Not relevant (p > 0.05). See Tables 1 -3 for details. 5.3.

There are 38 people in group A and 12 people in group B. Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage were gender, age, diabetes, s moking, hyperlipidemia and so on. The specific situation is shown in Table 4 . 5.4.

Hyperlipidemia and diabetes are independent risk factors for hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. The specific si t- uation is shown in Table 5 . 6. Discussion Atherosclerosis is a common cause of cerebrovascular disease. 70% to 80% of blood in the brain is supplied by the internal carotid artery. Previous studies have pointed out that carotid atherosclerotic plaque is a high facto r for cerebral infarction. However, regarding carotid artery, there are few studies on the corr e- lation between atherosclerosis and cerebral hemorrhage. This article uses the head and neck CTA to explain the correlation and risk factors of internal carotid atherosclerotic plaque with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. This study found that the formation of internal carotid atherosclerotic plaques is a risk factor for hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, but it has no signifi-cant correlation with whether the plaques are in the intracranial or extracranial segment of the internal carotid artery. Hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage is based on hypertension, and various types of hypertension can cause cerebral hemorrhage under certain circumstances. At the same tim e, studies have shown that the incidence of atherosclerosis in patients with hypertension is significantly increased. Patients with hypertension have atherosclerosis 3 - 4 times higher than those with normal blood pressure. May be due to high blood pressur e, the arterial wall is under high pressure, increasing the excitability of its sympathetic B. Wu, C. Z.

In this study, it was found that in the hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage group and the control group, the incidence of atherosclerosis in the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery was higher than that in the extracranial segment, respectively, 64% and 48%. The specific reason is not clear, and it may be caused by the relatively tortuous blood vessels of the internal carotid artery from the rock section to the communication sectio n in the cranial, resulting in relatively unstable hemod y- namics. Multivariate analysis of whether patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorr- hage have internal carotid atherosclerosis found that age greater than 60 years B. Wu, C. Z. Zhou DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115023 234 International Journal of Clinical Medicine old, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and gender are all influencing factors. And multivariate Logistic regression analysis of hypertensive cerebral hemorr-hage pointed out hyperlipidemia (OR CI: 1.037 - 95% CI: 1.276 - 9.010, P = 0.014) is ind e- pendent risk factor for hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. Therefore, for hyper-tensive patients over 60 years old, in addition to actively controlling blood pre s- sure, blood lipid and blood sugar levels should also be paid attention t o. It has positive significance for preventing hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. With the development of CT angiography (Computed tomography angio- gram, CTA) technology, we can use CTA image data to observe and measure the plaque in the blood vessels of the head and neck and related data. Some research results show that in detecting the number of internal carotid artery plaques, the results of ultrasound examination are significantly lower than the results of CTA examinations. The relationship between the characteristics of plaque and hyper-tensive cerebral hemorrhage. CT angiography of the head and neck is one of the important examination methods of cerebrovascular disease. Its operation is si m- ple, the result is faster, safe and efficient, and it can accurately display the posi-tion, size, and shape of the examiner's blood vessel and surrounding tissue. The doctor provides a reliable basis for the diagnosis of the disease [7] . For patients with cerebral hemorrhage, CTA examination can further investigate cerebral hemorrhage caused by aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation. Compared with ultrasound, the imaging of blood vessels by CTA is clearer, especially for the examination of intracranial blood vessels. 7. Conclusion In summary, patients with high blood pressure and diabetes who are over 60 years old are actively controlling blood lipid levels and quitting smoking, which is one of the important measures to prevent hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. Reducing the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis has certain significance for controlling hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. As an auxiliary examination m e- thod of cerebrovascular disease, CTA is conducive to improving the accur acy of diagnosis and is worthy of promotion in the clinic.

At present, there is no uniform standard for dietary preparation methods before CE at home and abroad, and there are few systematic comparative studies on the choice of dietary me- thods. Objective : To explore the best method of preparing diet for capsule endoscopy (CE) examination. Methods : 93 Patients who underwent CE ex- amination in the digestive endoscopy center of Wuhan union medical college hospital in October 2019 were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group A (n = 31): 1 day before the examination; a diet with low- residue was given, and 1 day before the examination, fasting was started at 8 p.m. until the examina-tion was completed. Group B (n = 30): a clear liquid diet was followed 1 day before the examination, and fasting was started at 8 p.m. 1 day before the examination until the examination was completed. Group C (n = 32): fo l- lowed a n ordinary diet 1 day before the examination, and began fasting at 8 p.m. 1 day before the examination until the examination was completed. I n- testinal preparation of the same drug was performed in 3 groups, and the i n- cidence of side effects and intestinal cleanliness of each group were co m- pared. Results : There was no significant difference in cleanliness be tween the three groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of side effects in the three groups was 28.13%, 70.00% and 21.88%, respectively . The difference between group A and group B, group C and group B is statistically significant (P < 0.05). Con- clusion : The three diet preparation methods of low -residue diet, clear liquid diet and ordinary diet can all achieve good intestinal cleansing effect. Clear liquid diet can not obviously improve the cleanliness of the small intestine, and there are relatively many side effe cts. *Corresponding author .

Introduction Capsule endoscopy (CE) examination has the advantages of no pain, simple o p- eration, safety, non-invasiveness, and no cross infection, which greatly expands the field of vision of digestive tract examination. With the rapid development of gastrointestinal endoscopy technology, small intestine capsule endoscopy has become the preferred method for diagnosing small intestinal diseases in the field of digestive diseases. However, there are still some shortcomings in the endo s- copy of small intestine capsules. Intestinal contents play a decisive rol e in the accuracy of diagnosis. Intestinal preparation is a key element that affects the quality of CE examin a- tion [1] [2] [3]. If the gastrointestinal tract is not cleaned thoroughly, and the contents of the intestinal tract remain, it may result in unsatisfactory captured images, which may affect the examination results and even cause misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Therefore, thorough gastrointestinal cleansing before ca p- sule endoscopy is performed to improve the clarity of the captured images, which is helpful to improve the accuracy of small bowel disease detection. Dietary preparation is an important auxiliary measure for intestinal prepar a- tion [4] [5]. According to the amount of residue generated, dietary preparation can be divided into clear diet, less residue diet and ordinary diet. At pre sent, there is no uniform standard for dietary preparation methods before CE at home and abroad, and there are few systematic comparative studies on the choice of dietary methods. In order to find out the best diet preparation methods before CE examination, this article compares and studies the differences in the effect of different diet preparation protocols on capsule endoscopic bowel preparation. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. General Information The case data were included in 93 patients who underwent capsule endoscopy in the digestive endoscopy center of wuhan union medical college hospital in O c- tober 2019, including 60 males and 33 females aged 15 - 89 years. Exclusion cr i- teria: (1) failure of total intestinal examination caused by device factor; (2) the capsule lens did not reach the small intestine and the capsule lens did not co m- plete the examination; (3) gastrointestinal bleeding, eating in advance and other factors interfere with the examination of small intestine cleanliness. 2.2. Methods of Exam ination (1) Inform the subjects and their families of the precautions for CE examination, S. Z. Zhang, J. P. Cheng DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115024 238 International Journal of Clinical Medicine and sign the informed consent. (2) Preparation of intestinal tract: Before the examination, group A (n = 31), group B (n = 30) and group C (n = 32) were given a slag -free diet, a clear -liquid diet and a normal diet, and the rest were the same. That is to say, fasting will be started at 8:00 p .m. before the inspection un- til the inspection is completed; at 9:0 0 p.m. bef ore the inspection on the 1st be- fore inspection, one packet of compound polyethylene glycol (PEG, Fujingqing) will be dissolved in the morning at 5:00 and 6:00 on the inspection day . Put it in 1 L of warm water and finish it in 1 hour. On the day of the inspection at 7:00, a bottle of simethicone is dissolved in 200ml of cold water and finished in 5 mi-nutes. (3) Inspection: After swallowing CE with a small amount of water, the subjects are instructed to fast and not to stay away from the inspection site. The doctor monitors the operation of the capsules in real time and informs them to eat according to the monitoring results. 2.3. Evaluation Method Observe the cleanliness of the small intestine, calculatethe incidence of side e f- fects. Small intestine cleanliness is evaluated by a single -blind method, which is scored by CE readers based on the cleanliness of the intestinal tract of the CE image and the overall observation effect. Intestinal cleaning grading: Level 1: there are very few bubbles in the small intestine, no residue and turbid liquid. The observation effect is good; Level 2: there is a small amount of air bubbles or turbid liquid in the small intestine, no residue, which has little impact on the observation effect; Level 3: a large amount of air bubbles or turbid liquid is found in the small intestine, and a little residue, which affects the observation effect; Level 4: a large amount bubbles and turbid liquid, more residue gathered in the small intestine , which seriously affect the observation. Side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, as well as general malaise such as dizziness and palpitation. The incidence of side reac-tions is the percentage of people with side reactions in the total number of people. 2.4. Statistical Methods SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis. The small intestine cleanliness was measured by the rank sum test, the measurement data were e x- pressed by mean \u00b1 standard deviation (x \u00b1 s), and the incidence of side reactions was measured by chi -square test of line and column list data, with the test sta n- dard = 0.05. 3. Results 3.1. Comparison of General Conditions of Patients General statistics of gender and age of patients in the three groups: there was no significant difference in gender and age among the three groups, and the groups were comparable ( Table 1 ).

Comparison of the Three Groups Related Indicators There was no significant difference in cleanliness of small intestine between groups A, B and C (P > 0.05). The results showed that during CE examination, taking a sufficient amount of laxatives, most can achieve good intestinal prep a- ration, but the relationship with dieting seems not so close. Among the 37 pa- tients, 11 had abdominal pain and distension, 7 had nausea and vomiting, and 19 had palpitation, dizziness and chills. The inciden ces of side effects in groups A, B, and C were 28.13%, 70.00%, and 21.88%, respectively , with statistically si g- nificant differences between group A and B , C and B (P < 0.05). The results showed that there were significant differences in side effects such a s abdominal pain, nausea, or dizziness in the normal diet group and the low -residue diet group compared with th e clear liquid diet group. See Table 2. 4. Conclusion The three diet preparation methods of low- residue diet, clear liquid diet and o r- dinary diet can all achieve good intestinal cleansing effect. Clear liquid diet can not obviously improve the cleanliness of the small intestine, and there are rel a- tively more side effects. The key part of intestinal preparation before capsule endoscopy is cleaning the intestines. Taking a sufficient amount of laxatives strictly according to doctor 's instructions until clear liquid is excreted, most can achieve good intestinal preparation effects. And the relationship between clean-liness and diet ing seems not so close. Furthermore, patients ha ve fewer side ef- fects after eating, and will be more tolerant to capsule endoscopy examination. 5. Discussion Since the capsule endoscopy was introduced in 1999, the clinical application of capsule endoscopy has developed rapidly [6], and capsule endoscopy has now become the preferred diagnostic method for small bowel diseases [7] . However, due to the lack of water injection, gas injection, suction, and controllable func-tions of the capsule endoscope, the real -time intervention of the shooting field cannot be performed, so the CE examination has higher requirements for clea n- liness of the small intestine [8] [9]. In addition to the quality of intestinal prep a- ration and oral laxatives, it is closely related to diet preparation programs [10] [11]. There are few systematic comparisons of diet preparation methods before the CE examination. At present, it is generally believed that the effect of a clear liquid diet is better, but it is un clear whether the clear liquid diet before the test S. Z. Zhang, J. P. Cheng DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115024 240 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Table 2 . Comparison of the three groups related indicators . Groups Cleanliness of small intestine/case The incidence of side reactions/case (%) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Group A (n = 31) 5 14 8 2 9 (29.03 ) Group B (n = 30) 7 14 6 3 21 (70.00 ) Group C (n = 32) 4 15 10 3 7 (21.88 ) has sufficient benefits to patients compared with low -residue diet and the no r- maldiet [12] [13] [14] [15] . Intestinal preparation is one of the key aspects of capsule endoscopy. At present, it mainly focuses on cleaning the intestines and preparing food. We use 3 L PEG electrolyte intestinal lavage liquid for intestinal preparation, and the ef- fect is satisfact ory [16]. As for diet preparation, some are accustomed to r e- stricting their diet 1 d before the examination and fasting from 8:00 p.m. the day before the examination. Due to lack of energy and nutritional supplements, the tolerance of the testers is significantly decreased, especially in poor health or with basic diseases. The elderly , or outpatients from afar, are more likely to have hypoglycemia- like reactions, aggravate discomfort, and directly affect the e x- amination results. We observed the intestinal cleanliness of the three groups with different dietary conditions, and the results were statistically analyzed, with P > 0.05. There was no statistical difference in intestinal cleanliness among the thre e groups. The three diets had little effect on capsule endoscopy. A clear liq uid diet cannot significantly improve the cleanliness of the small intestine, and there are relatively more side effects. There are still some deficiencies in this study, we need to expand the sample size and do more detailed researches. And it's nece s- sary to do systematic comparative studies on the choice of dietary methods in the following time.

According to the statistics of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), it is estimated that 380 million people will b e diagnosed with diabetes by 2025 [1]. A survey conducted by the Diabetes Bran ch of the Chinese Medical Association, published in the New England Journal in March 2010, shows that the number of patients with diabetes in China has exceeded 92 million [2] , making it a major diabetic country. In order to cope with the growing popul a- tion of diabetic patients and the resulting economic and medical burdens, d i- abetes sp ecialist nurses have been trained throughout the country [3] . However, there is no uniform standard for the selection, training, assessment and certific a- tion of diabetes nurses in China so far [4] [5]. In this study, the Delphi method was used to establish an evaluation index for the first certification of diabetes specialist nurses, which is expected to provide a reference basis for the certific a- tion of diabetes specialist nurses. 2. Steps and Methods 2.1. Set up a Research Team and Select Consulting Experts The research team consisted of 5 people, including 1 director of nursing depar t- ment, 1 head nurse, and 3 graduate students. 30 clinical experts, involving nur s- ing management, nursing education, clinical nursing, community nursing, me d- icine, were selected from 10 provinces in East China, South China, West China, North China, and Central China. Every expert is either from Class A First Class Hospital or from college of advanced nursing with the technical title of deputy senior or above (except the experts from clinical nursing, whose minimal title is intermediate level) . The experts with bachelor degree or above have more than 10 years of experience in diabetes or related majors. 2.2. Research Tools After the research team has determined th e theme, it will consult the develo p- ment of A) specialist nursing through the library, Internet and electronic liter a- ture database; B ) the history of the development of specialist nurses in diabetes and other fields; C ) the selection criteria of specialist nurses; D ) the training of specialist nurses System, assessment method; E) specialist nurse certification body, evaluation standards and certification standards and other related doc u- ments, literature, books and report materials. The author established the pr e- liminary index system through literature review, specialist interview and group discussion and used Delphi method to organize three rounds of 30 experts' co n- sultations. Key words of database retrieval include: diabetes specialist nurses, current situation and development of specialist nursing, selection criteria, sy s- tem specifications, assessment methods, certification bodies, evaluation criteria, etc. Review the collected literature content (see Figure 1 for the selection proc ess of literature data and Table 1 for the selection content).

The questionnaire contains three parts: the basic information of the expert, the text of the questionnaire comprising of the importance of indicators and the recommended modification by the expert as well as the familiarity of the expert with the question and the main basis for the expert to judge. The importance of indicators is b ased on the Likert scoring method, which is from very important to unimportant ( 1 - 5 points, respectiv e- ly) [6]. Experts ' familiarit y with various indicators is divid ed into 5 levels: unf a- miliar, not very familiar, general, relatively familiar, very familiar . Three rounds of questionnaires were distributed and received by email. H. H. Zou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115025 246 International Journal of Clinical Medicine 2.3. Statistical Methods The results were processed and analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2003 and SPSS17.0 to establish a database. The questionnaire response rate (%) is used to reflect the enthusiasm of experts. The degree of coordination of expert opinions is e x- pressed by the coefficient of variation (Vj) of the evaluation results of vari ous indicators and the Kendall's W coefficient of expert opinions and its significance test, where Vj represents the degree of fluctuation of the relative imp ortance of the indicators, and the smaller the Vj, the higher degree of coordination of ex- pert opinions; The coordination coefficient (W) ranging between 0 - 1 is used to test whether the opinions of experts on the indicators are consistent, the larger the value, the higher the coordination of the opinions of the experts. Significance test was performed on W, if P < 0.05, it means that the experts have consistent scores on the indicators, indicating the results are desirable. The selection of r e- search indicators is based on the criteria of satisfying both the mean value of importance value > 3.50 and the coeff icient of variation 0.25. At the same time, combined with expert opinions, the indicators are screened by the collective r e- view of the research team. 3. Results 3.1. Basic Situation of Consulting Experts A total of 30 consulting experts participated, 17 of them aged 40 - 49 years old, accounting for 56.7%. 90% of the experts had more than 20 -year working expe- rience and had professional titl es as deputy senior or higher. All of them had bachelor's degree or above including 11 professors (36.7%). There were 15 ex- perts major in clinical nursing (50%) and 8 experts major in nursing manag e- ment (26.7%). Except for one from nursing colleges, the remaining 29 were from the Class A First Class Hospitals. 3.2. The Questionnaire Recall Situation 30 questionnaires wer e distributed each round, and the first round had the effe c- tive response rate 100%; the second round, 86.7%; the third round, 100%. 3.3. The Degree of Authority of Experts The degree of expert authority is reflected by the basis of experts ' judgment on indicators and the familiarity of experts with indicators [7] [8] [9]. The average authoritative degree of experts in three rounds of consultation were 0.77 - 0.94, 0.87, 0.87, respectively. It is generally considered that the degree of expert a u- thority 0.7 is acceptable [7] . Thus, the degree of expert authority in this study is relatively high. 3.4. The Degree of Concentration of Expert Opinions The degree of concentration of expert opinions is expressed by the mean and standard deviation of importance assignment. The larger the mean, the more H. H. Zou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115025 247 International Journal of Clinical Medicine important the indicator is. The average values of the indicators in the three rounds of investigation were: 3.38 - 4.93, 2.67 - 5.00, 2.90 - 5.00; and corre s- ponding standard deviations were: 0.13 - 0.91, 0.10 - 1.06, 0.00 - 1.01, respe c- tively. 3.5. Degree of Coordination of Expert Opinio ns After three rounds of consultation, the coefficient of variation of the third round of index assignment was 0.00 - 0.38. The Kendall harmony coefficients W of e x- perts in the three rounds of consultation were 0.366, 0.374, and 0.382, respe c- tively, and th e significance test P < 0.01 indicated that the experts' opinions were well coordinated, and the results were desirable. 3.6. Expert Consultation Results According to the selection criteria of the indicators and discussion by the r e- search group, the indica tors that failed both directions were deleted, and the in- dicators that failed one way were included in the next round of continued di s- cussion. Due to space limitations, only the first two rounds of results were a t- tached ( Table 2). 4. Discussion 4.1. Representativeness of Experts and Reliability of Prediction The selection of experts plays a key role in the Delphi method. In the study, we fully considered the professional representativeness, academic authority and geographical represent ation of experts. The selected experts include East China, West China, South China, North China, and Central China; their research areas include clinical nursing, nursing management, nursing education, community nursing and clinical medicine. The experts h ave a high level of knowledge and years of working experience in their professional fields. Many experts serve as Master or PhD supervisor. Moreover, the average authoritative coefficient, coo r- dination coefficient and consistency of experts are relatively high; therefore, the representativeness and predictability of experts in this study are satisfied. 4.2. Analysis of the Evaluation Index System for the First Certification of Diabetes Specialist Nurses Diabetes specialist nurses are nursing experts, and thus it requires that they should have certain professional abilities. Educational background and profe s- sional title are important factors that r eflect the theoretical knowledge level and clinical professional skills of clinical nurses [8] . The years of working experience as a diabetes specialist can indirectly reflect the accumulated experience of the diabetes specialist nurses. The computer skill is a necessary part of the kno w- ledge structure of expert talents. Nursing scientific research is an important means to promote the development of nursing science and to improve the qual-ity of clinical nursing [9] [10] [11].

H. H. Zou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115025 249 International Journal of Clinical Medicine nursing research on new evidence found to continuously improve nursing prac- tice [12] . However, according to the actual situation in China, the overall English level and scientific research level are limited. Even graduated from the nursing department, they have difficulties in communication in English resulting in that they can only obtain the latest foreign knowledge and information indirectly [13]. Thus, treating \"Funded research\" and \" English proficiency \" as fundamental indicators is not desirable, but in view of their importance, we decided to include the \"annual average paper publication status \", which is relatively easier, and the \"English proficiency \" is listed as one of the first -level indicators. The construction of this research indicator framework is guided by the \" Atti- tude Skill Knowledge \" (ASK) theory. The ASK theory [14] [15] was proposed by professor Mayo from Harvard University in the 1860s and he pointed out that there is a progressive relationship among knowledge, attitudes and skills, in which knowledge is the foundation of skills; attitude is the motivation to acquire skills, and acquisition of skills is the goal. The first -level indicators of this study not only cover professional attitudes, professional knowledge, professional skills, and core competencies, but also consider personal characteristics; in the second -level indicators, there are specific requirements for each item, which can be used to systematically and comprehensively evaluate diabetes specialist nurses. In terms of professional attitude, nursing is the most humanized profession. Only people with love and service consciousness can be qualified for this noble profession. In terms of professional knowledge, diabetes specialist nurses are nursing experts in the field of diabetes, and they are required not only to master precise and speci a- lized nursing theory, basic knowledge, and specialist knowledge, but also to be familiar with the frontier knowledge in the field of diabetes, health policies, o r- ganizational management, health economics and social sciences. IN terms of professional technology, a diabetes speci alist nurse should not only master the nursing skills of this specialty, but also master the use of diabetes related instr u- ments and the skills of cooperation with other medical personnel to provide sy s- tematic, comprehensive and holistic care for patients. In terms of core competence, in order to enable diabetes specialist nurses to be competent for different tasks, including disease prevention, health promotion, and nursing of acute and chronic diseases, it is necessary to cultivate the profe s- sional attitude, professional knowledge and technology of diabetes specialist nurses. As for personal characteristics, nursing tasks are heavy, and only a nurse with a healthy body can be competent. When dealing with pressure from work and life, they should reasonably control their emotions, adjust themselves, fully understand themselves and make appropriate evaluations of themselves. 4.3. Suggestions on the Implementation of the First Certification Evaluation Index System for Diabetes Specialist Nurses 1) It is necess ary to establish relevant systems and legal regulations for the certification of diabetes specialist nurses. At present, the current status of the practice of diabetes specialist nurses in our country is neither compliant nor H. H. Zou et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115025 250 International Journal of Clinical Medicine rule-based [16]. Only by guaranteeing the legal certification of diabetic specialist nurses and having the law to be able to guarantee the healthy operation of the diabetic nurse certification mechanism, should the government be given full play to standardize the management of diabetic nurses and ensure the quality and control of diabetic nurses. 2) It is also necessary to encourage the establishment of statutory social i n- termediar y institutions, which are entrusted or authorized by the government to certify diabetes specialist nurses and other specialist nurses. It is an independent non- profit organization between the government, society and medical units. The organization can be scientific groups or professional associations. The legal s o- cial intermediary organization can guarantee the objectivity and fairness of the certification and evaluation of diabetes nurses. 3) It is recommended to formulate the first certification procedure for diabetic specialist nurses according to the following procedures: a) An individual submits a certification application to the relevant certification organization with corre s- ponding application materials; b) The certification organization conducts the qualification review of the applicant according to the certification standards; c) Applicants are required to conduct theoretical assessment; d) Interview; e) Com- prehensiv e evaluation of clinical ability; f) Issue of diabetes specialist nurse ce r- tificate. Standardized first -time certification procedure of diabetes specialty nurses can make the certification of nurses more convenient and standardized. The government should strengthen the selection of certified experts, closely connect academic experts. In additional to management authorities and indu s- try, other parties should participate and cooperate with one another in order to give full play to their respective advantages. To strengthen the combination of certification and the practice registration system, we must not only allow prac- tice registration to promote the development of professional certification, but also reflect that certification is the basis for the effective implementation of the practice registration system.

International Journal of Clinical 2020 252 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Positional Changes of the Hyoid Bone after Correction of the Glosso-Larynx \u2014Hyoid Susumu Kanagawa, Japan Abstract Human hyoid bone floats in the neck. Downwards of an amount of about half vertebra and 0.3 cm forward following the correction of the glosso- larynx (CGL) was observed by simple XP. Disappearance of symptoms of the anky- loglossia with deviation of the epiglottis a nd larynx (ADEL) and increased of body temperature were observed after CGL. The results suggest that hyoid bone makes a complex that controls not only respiration and swallowing but also controls metabolism. It might be called hyoid bone complex (HBC). Keywords Respiration, Swallowing, Metabolism, Homo Neanderthalensis 1. Introduction Symptoms and signs of ankyloglossia with deviation of the epiglottis and larynx (ADEL) are caused by respiratory insufficiencies. Correction of the glosso- larynx (CGL) is a surgery for ADEL, consisting in cutting the frontal bundles of g e- nioglossus muscles. Following CGL, the deviated epiglottis and larynx move downwards aligned with the choanae, and improved respiratory rate and pu l- monary function and increased body tempera ture are observed. The possible mechanisms leading to improved respiratory rate and increased body temper a- ture cannot be explained by the cut of the bundles of genioglossus muscle alone and additional factors are likely to play a role, for example position al changes of the hyoid bone occurring after CGL [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. The aim of this study was to assess the positional changes of the hyoid bone following GCL by using simple X- ray photographs (XPs) in order to assess the possible mechanisms at the level of the hyoid bone that may be related to the How to cite this paper: Mukai , S.

Method A total of 232 patients (138 females, 94 males; 17 to 78 years old (yr), average 40.1 yr) that underwent CGL from 2013 to 2016 were studied by taking XPs b e- fore and after CGL ( Figure 1 ). To assess possible positional changes in the hyoid bone, two measures were extracted from XPs and compared before and after CGL. Specifically, we mea s- ured the height of point V and the length of segment VH, defined in the follo w- ings. A horizontal line was drawn to connect th e outermost part of the hyoid bone (point H) to the vertebrae (point V) and the distance between the two points was computed (length of segment VH), as shown in Figure 1 . To define the height of point V along the vertebrae, four possibl e positions were considered on each vertebra: the upper part (e.g., IIIup), the central part (e.g., III) the lower part (e.g., IIIdn) and the joint between two vertebrae (e.g., III/IV). The following two measures were assessed and compared before and after CGL: 1) The height of point V. 2) The length of segment VH. For the sake of comparing the length of segment VH before and after CGL, calibrations on the XPs were performed to each film according to the scale on film. Possible differences in mean height of point V in the study sample before and after CGL were assessed by using a contingency table test (StatView 4.5) and possible differences in mean length of segment VH before and after CGL were addressed by using Student t -tests (Microsoft Exel Mc2011). 3. Results 3.1. Distribution of Height of Point V The height of point V before CGL ranged from the third vertebra (III) to the Figure 1 . XPs in one of the participants before and after CGL. S. Mukai DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115026 254 International Journal of Clinical Medicine upper part of the fifth vertebra (Vup). After CGL the heights of point V shifted, on average, towards lower vertebrae and ranged from the third (III) to the fifth vertebra (V). The median value of the height of point V before and after CGL was IV up and IV, respectively, suggesting a trend towards a downward shift (Figure 2 ). Statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference between two distributions (p < 0.0001), suggesting a tendency to a downward shift in the height of point V following CGL. 3.2. Length of Segment VH The average length of segment VH before and after CGL was 4.4 cm (s.d. 0.63) and 4.7 cm (s.d. 0.64), respectively (Female: 4.1 cm and 4.4 cm; Male: 4.9 cm and 5.2 cm) (Figure 3 ). There was significant difference between the distribution of length V H before and after CGL (p < 0.0001), suggesting a trend towards an in- crease in distance between the hyoid bone and the vertebrae following the pro- cedure.

Discussion Phylogenetically, the tongue appeared later. In fishes, the hyoid bones are in the inner margin of the mouth bones [6] . Fishes are able to eat and breathe with the composite of visceral skeleton. They don't need the tongue as mammals. The tongue muscles are attached at the top of the hyoid bone in humans by the hy oglossal membrane. The tongue muscles are attached to the mandibular bone ventrally. The bottom edge of the hyoid bone the larynx is attached to the thyrohyoid ligament. In turn, the larynx is connected with the trachea, bronchi and lungs. These structures constitute a complex that is called the hyoid bone complex (HBC). The hyoid bone floats in the neck but a nd the mandibular bone is stable. As the hyoid bone is able to move upwards and downwards via the muscles that are attached to its top and bottom edge, the HBC is able to move upwards and downwards too [7] . As a result, the HBC in humans is pulled up and forward by the tongue. The CGL is a procedure that cuts the frontal bundles of genioglossus muscles and therefore the HBC can rotate downward and for- ward following CGL . This study showed that the hyoid bone tended to move downwards of about half vertebra and about 0.3 cm ventrally following CGL. These outcomes may be interpreted in light of the observed improvements following CGL in individuals with ADEL. In fact, disappearance of symptoms and signs of ADEL following CGL (for example, improvement in respiratory function and increase in body temperature) may be related to downward and ventral movements of the hyoid bone that might accelerate respiration [8] [9] [10]. The improvement of symptoms of ADEL and the increas e in respiratory fun c- tion and body temperature observed after CGL may be related to downward and forward movements of the HBC that, in turn, may accelerate physiological fun c- tions and may, as such, have further implications in terms of not only respir a- tion and swallowing but also circulation, metabolism, and immune function. The observed improvements are likely to be related to the function of the HBC, a complex structure that regulates respiration and various human functions such as drinking, laughing, singing, swallowing, vomiting , crying, and breathing. It was reported that the hyoid bone of Homo Neanderthalensis is higher than that of Homo Sapiens [11] [12]. The stylohyoid bone of Homo Neanderthalensis was shorter than that of Homo Sapiens. Therefore t he HBC of Homo Neande r- thalensis might be shorter and it might have had more limited movements. R e- lated to this, the metabolisms of Homo Neanderthalensis might have been lower than that of Homo Sapiens, possibly contributing to a higher mortality rate, thus suggesting that positional changes of the HBC, such as the ones induced by CGL and demonstrated by this study, may play a role in an evolutionary perspective. 5. Conclusion s The tongue p ulled HBC upwards. The improvements in symptoms and signs of ADEL obs erved following CGL as downward and forward movement of the S. Mukai DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115026 256 International Journal of Clinical Medicine hyoid bone could improve respiration and, in turn, contribute to improved ph y- siological function. There might exist a system that control respiration and swallowing as well as metabolism by the hyoid bone that is hyoid bone complex (HBC).

Background Breast diseases make up several conditions. The majority of breast diseases are noncancerous [1] [2]. Breast lesions are mainly recorded among females. The most recorded cause of breast problems in females is a benign breast disease , which is 10 times more common than breast cancer in most countries [3] . Some of these lesions are clinically unremarkable , which needed minimal inter vention. However, some symptoms may be of clinical value and attract the attention of both the patient and the attending physician , especially when they become per- sistent. The main item behind that concern is the possibility of the occurrence of breast cancer, which is usually asymptomatic in the early stages during which it is curable [4] . Benign breast diseases are mainly prevalent during the reprodu c- tive age as the incidence is common mainly in the second decade with realiz a- tion on its peak at fourth and fifth life year's dec ade [5]. Benign breast diseases include many and variable histological patterns categorized into non- proliferative breast lesions, proliferative breast lesions without atypia, lesions with atypia [6] besides fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change , and breast ab- scess are the most recorded benign lesions in the literature [7]. Certain types of benign breast lesions were recorded as a significant risk factor for developing breast cancer [8] . Women with benign proliferative or atypica l breast lesions consume a two -fold risk of developing breast cancer in western populations [9] . The literatures covered the histopathological pattern of breast diseases with less attention for the clinical perspectives [10] [11] [12]. Surgical evaluation of the symptomatic patients by triple assessment, namely, clinical examination of the breast, mammography, and breast biopsy for definitive histological diagnosis is required in many patients [13] . The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, pattern, types, and clinical profile of breast diseases among females in the South -western region, during the period from 2018 -2020. 2. Methodology Retrospective record -based descriptive approach was used through reviewing medical records of all cases that were admitted and have breast disease (benign or malignant breast masses) in King Khalid Hospital during the period from January 2018 to January 20 20. Records with missing data were included . Data extracted through pre -structured questionnaire including patient's bio -clinical data, initial clinical presentation of the breast disease, radiological assessment findings. Also, the final pathological find ings were extracted besides the nature A. M. Alamri et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115027 259 International Journal of Clinical Medicine of the assigned pathology. Data also included the type of surgery and post oper a- tive outcome. 3. Statistical Analysis After data were extracted, it was revised, coded , and fed to statistical software IBM SPSS version 22 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL). All statistical analysis was done using the two-tailed test. A P- value of less than 0.05 is considered bei ng statist i- cally significant. Descriptive analysis based on frequency and percent distrib u- tion was done for all variables, including demographic data, breast disease na- ture, and types, clinical presentation, and surgery outcome. 4. Results The study included 211 cases whose ages ranged from 18 to 58 years old with a mean age of 28.9 \u00b1 12.8 years. Exact of 59 (72%) of the females were married , and all of the sampled females started menstruation at the age of 18 years with regular menstrual cycle. Ten (67%) of the females are still menstruating. Only one (10%) of the study females had the first pregnancy before the age of 20 years and 10% above the age of 30 years. As for gravidity, 3 (10.3 %) of the females had no pregnancy , while 31% had four pregnancies or more. Considering co -morbidity , diabetes mellitus was recorded among 5 (9.6%) of the females and 8 females (15.4%) had hypothyroidism ( Table 1 ). Table 2 demonstrates the determinants of having breast disease. Oral contr a- ceptive pills were received by 8 (40%) of the study females , and 30.8% of them had hormonal therapy. A family history of breast disease , including breast ca n- cer, was recorded for 4 females (23.5%). Only 8 (44.4%) of the females know about breast screening for early detection of breast lesions, while 23 females (85.2%) do breast examination regularly. Only one case recorded that she per- forms regular breast scree ning after the age of 40 years. Concerning clinical data of recorded breast diseases ( Table 3 ), breast mass was the most recorded complaint as recorded for 196 females (95.1%) followed with breast pain which was among 66 females (32%), skin changes (11; 5.3%), and nipple discharge (8; 3.9%). The symptoms = appeared for less than one month among 23.5% of the cases while lasted for more than 6 months among 52 females (39.4%). As for the affec ted side, the right side was dominant among 84 females (41.2%) of the cases while it was bilateral among 19 (9.3%). The breast mass measured less than 2 cm among 60 (37.5%) of the cases while it was more than 5 cm among 21 females (13.1%) of them. Margins of the breast mass were irregular among 46.2% of the cases, and the mass was soft among 59 of the p a- tients (54.1%). Skin changes were recorded for 28 (22.2%) of the cases , and 53 cases (34.9%) had positive Axillary lymph nodes on physical examination. Considering radiological and biopsy fin dings among the cases, Table 4 illustrates that the most recorded US finding was Fibrocystic disease (64; 49.6%) followed with cancer related features breast and fibroadenoma A.

Breast diseases more recorded among women than men, the prevalence rate in males ranging from 0% to 5.8% in most series, and the majority of male breast lesions are benign with gynaecomastia [17]. As for females, the pattern of pathology had high variability based on age and geographical location. Benign lesions are prevalent at all ages, constituting 48.9% to 57% with the main age of occurrence below the 30 years [18] [19] . Benign breast l esions are more presented than cancer [20] [21] [22]. Benign breast diseases, howeve r, formed a heterogeneous group of disorders , including developmental abnormalities, epithelial and stromal proliferation , inflammatory lesions, and neoplasms [23] . Breast cancer incidence increased from 12.7 million A. M. Alamri et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115027 265 International Journal of Clinical Medicine in 2008 to 14.1 million in 2012, and this trend is predicted to increase in the f u- ture [24] [25]. It was estimated that worldwide over 508 ,000 women died in 2011 due to breast cancer [26] . Breast cancer survival rates vary greatly worldwide, ranging from 80% or over in North America, Sweden, and Japan to around 60% in middle -income countries and below 40% in low -income countr ies [27] . The current study aimed to assess the pattern of different breast diseases rec- orded for females in the south -western region, Saudi Arabia, during the period from January 2018 to January 2020. Also, the study aimed to assess the type of diagnostic and management methods with the clinical outcome. The study r e- vealed that the majority of cases aged below 30 years and were married and still menstruating. Many risk factors for having breast diseases were recorded , in- cluding receiving oral contraceptive pills, hormonal therapy, positive family his- tory, and irregular breast examination, especially at the age above 40 years. Breast mass was the most frequent complaint with breast pain with its size ranging from 2 - 5 cm in most cases and irregular margins in nearly half of the cases associated with Axillary lymph nodes in about 1 out of each 3 cases. Final pathology after a biopsy revealed that lesion s were benign among two -thirds of the cases especially fibroadenoma, which is the most benign breast lesion. R e- garding surgical intervention, modified radical mastectomy was needed for 1 out of each 5 cases, while only 11% of the cases undergone lumpectomy as the l e- sions were benign. Most of the cases had no post -operative complication s less than 10% had seroma. Generally, these findings were consist ent with most of the literature . A study was conducted to assess benign breast lesions (BBD) in an African po pulation [28] and recorded an increasing incidence of these benign lesions. The overall mean age for BBD was 27.5 years, SD \u00b1 11.3, with an age range of 9 - 84 years and a peak age occurrence in the third decade. The single most common lesion was fibroad e- noma accounting for 43.1% of cases, followed by fibrocystic change (23.8%). A second study was conducted by Ayoade BA et al. 2012 [29] to Clinical Features and Pattern of Presentation of Breast Diseases in Surgical Outpatient Clinic of a Suburban Tertiary Hospital in South -West , Nigeria. The researchers reported that the commonest symptoms were breast lump in 91.7% patients, and breast pain in 23.1% patients. Forty four patients (36.3%) had a malignant disease, seventy p a- tients (57.8%) had benign breast diseases, and seven were normal. Fifty nine of the 70 benign diseases were fibro adenoma. In India, Hatim K et al. 2017 [30] con- ducted a research to assess Patterns and prevalence of benign breast disease in Western India. The reported that the commonest benign breast lesion was fibro a- fibrocystic disease (4.3%) and gynaecomastia (4.3%). Locally, Samir S et al. 1995 conducted a study to the spectrum of breast di s- eases in Saudi females [31] . The researchers reported that fibroadenoma was the most common lesion encountered 30.7%, followed papilloma (2.6%), galactocele (2.4%) and several less frequent lesions. A second study was conducted to assess histopathological pa t- terns of breast lesions in Northern Saudi Arabia, 2017 [32 ]. The study revealed that 23.2% of the lesions were ductal carcinoma, 4.4% were lobular carcinoma, 1.9% w ere mixed tumours, while 64.6% were fibroadenoma. When local breast disease distribution patterns are known, skills related to diagnosis and management can be made with a sound degree of certainty. In ad- dition, resource allocation and planning can be better allied. This is true mainly in low income countries where a large population of individuals may not afford diagnostic and management cost s. 6. Conclusion and Recommendations In conclusion, benign breast diseases (BBD) were the most recorded among N a- jran females, especially fibroadenoma , with low post surgical complications. T he better reporting system should be initiated , and well training for the physicians is mandatory to improve the quality of available data, and research based on these data and achieve better and more real istic conclusions for pla nning and resource allocation. Ethical Considerations The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the College of Medicine of Najran University . Limitations of the Study Irrespective of the variety of collected clinical data in the current study , but there were two main limitation s. The first is the sample size , which was due to r e- viewing only 2 years' cases , but this was due to a poor recording system , which somewhat primitive. The secon d was the high missing rate in the data for the cases, which also related to the primitive recording system and lack of physi- cian's experience regarding these cases management guidelines.

International Journal of Clinical Medicine 5, 2020 270 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Full Length Spine CT and CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Republic of Korea 2Vertebra Spine Unit, Polyclinique Bordeaux Nord Aquitaine, Bordeaux, France Abstract Spine is a complex and long structure in the human body. Visualization of the spine is essential to treat and manage spine disease and commonly requires further imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In most clinical fields, spine CT and MRI exam i- nations are focused on the region of interest. However, spine is composed of cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacrum and coccyx and sometimes demands e x- aminati on of entire structure as well as regional spine depending on disease, patient's state and physician's decision. This review considers the available l i- terature to describe when and how full length spine evaluation by CT and MRI is applied according to each spinal disease such as spinal trauma, defo r- mity, infection, axial spondyloarthropathy and metastatic tumor. Keywords Full Length Spine CT, Full Length Spine MRI, Trauma, Deformity, Infection, Axial Spondyloarthropathy, Metastasis 1. Introduction There are multiple imaging modalities to evaluate the spine. The type of imaging tool for the spine depends on the type of disease, the amount of radiation h a- zard, contraindications and any allergy to contrast. Among the multiple imaging strategies, computed tom ography (CT) is a rel i- able method to evaluate the spine and has better sensitivity for bony abnormality than radiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [1]. In the past, the time factor limited the use of CT. However, owing to the development of fast spiral CT and multidirectional CT (MDCT), the whole spine can be examined in very short time [2]. CT is less sensitive to patient's movement than MRI [3]. Now, it is widely used to assess trauma, deformity, metastasis, pre and post -operative How to cite this paper: Ahn, T .-K., Bour- S ., Thompson, T. Huec (2020) Full Length Spine CT and MRI .

Furthermore, there are no risks of radiation hazard. It provides information about the spinal neural structures including cord, cauda equina and roots, the vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc. Multiple sequences can be obtained in different planes and each sequence helps in evaluating various changes of the spine. The most commonly using sequences include sagittal and a xial T1 and T2, and sagittal STIR (short tau inversion recovery). Post -contrast T1 weighted images are useful for evaluating spinal infections, postoperative complications, vascular malformation, primary spinal tumors, and metastases. STIR sequences are beneficial in assessing marrow edema, which demonstrates an increased si g- nal on these sequences [4]. In most cases, spine CT and MR images are taken focusing on the region of interest where the pathology exists. However, full length spine examination is more helpful in detailed evaluation and early detection of disease and trauma being able to involve the entire spine ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, the aim of this r e- view was to describe when and how full length spine evaluation through CT and MRI is applied. Figure 1 .

Methodology A literature review using PubMed and Google Scholar was performed. To ide n- tify relevant studies, search was conducted on studies in English published b e- tween 2000 and Februa ry, 2020 using various combinations of the on this search, 127 studies were initially detected. After excluding articles about rare disease, technical a s- pect of CT and MRI, measurement and imaging protocol, 56 articles were s e- lected. After an internal peer review with all the authors of this article and a su p- plementary search that involved bibliographic screening and citation tracking associated with individual spine pathology, 2 4 articles of interest were finally s e- lected (Figure 2). Those articles are categorized as \"Deformity\", \"Infection\", \"Axial spondyloarthropathy\" of Full Length Spine CT and MRI 3.1. Trauma When trauma to the spine occurs, according to the findings of physical exam i- nation and simple radiography, targeted CT and/or MRI is usually performe d on the suspected spine as a further imaging work up. However, if the patient sustains Figure 2 . Methods of relavant study selection. T.-K. Ahn et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115028 273 International Journal of Clinical Medicine high energy trauma or multiple trauma, those spine imaging can be insufficient. In high energy or multiple trauma patients, after the patient's condition is stab i- lized , unforeseen injuries to the spine should be delineated accurately because the symptoms of a spinal fracture may be masked by concomitant injuries, p a- tient's state of consciousness ( Figure 3), spinal cord injury or shock [5] [6]. In these situations, it requires full length spine evaluations with CT and/or MRI rather than simple r adiographs, targeted CT or MRI. In the patients with high energy blunt trauma, Deunk et al. reported that the non- targeted CT detected 8.2% more spine injuries unrevealed by simple radi o- graphs than the targeted CT [7]. In a prospective study, spinal fractures were prevalent in 30.2% of cases of high- energy trauma. Among patients with a ce r- vical fracture, 37.5% had a fracture that unrevealed on radiographs of the cervi c- al spine but were first diagnose d by a CT scan. Patients with a thoracolumbar fracture did not have clinical symptoms of a fracture in 14%, but had a fracture revealed by CT. Therefore, Takami et al. postulated that the full length spine CT should be taken to evaluate high energy trauma patients [6]. Figure 3 .

The patient was un cons- cious in the emergency room. T.-K. Ahn et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115028 274 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Using full length MRI in spine trauma patients remains controversial. Atsina et al. described that full length MRI is not usually recommended in patients with spine trauma. When the full length MRI is performed in patients with blunt trauma after full length spinal CT, most additional spinal injuries detected on MRI were bone contusions and mild compression fractures. These additional spinal diagnoses are unlikely to change the management or treatment [8]. Ther e- fore, the targeted MRI is more useful in patients with high energy blunt trauma. However, Kanna et al. reported that full length sagittal T2 weighted images help diagnose multi -level non -contiguous spinal injuries in spinal trauma patients and can be performed in approximately 4 minutes withou t radiation hazard [9]. 3.2. Deformity Spinal deformity is a complex disease with different three- dimensional abno r- malities that often involve the entire spine [10]. In cases with a complex or s e- vere spinal deformity, full length spine CT should be taken of the entire area of spine including the involvement segment of the spine deformity because radi o- graphy alone is insufficient to visualize complicated abnormalities of spinal d e- formity [11]. Furthermore, in comparison with radiography, full length spine CT scanning provides additional information about extent of rotation of the spine, segmentation defects, three- dimensional reconstruction and detection of bony spur in diastomatomyelia and associated congenital anomalies of ribs, scapula, and pelvis [1 2]. Full length spine CT is also useful for surgical planning. Current surgical tech- niques for deformity correction is making surgeons capable of correcting the coronal, sagittal and rotational aspects by the 3D assessment of spinal deformity [13]. Multiplanar reconstruction of the axial CT images is important, especially when trying to understan d the anatomy of deformity and allows visualizing l e- vels where osteotomies or resections are planned. The CT scan allows surgeons to understand the pedicle anatomy including the width, depth, and trajectory of the pedicles. During a deformity surgery, caut ion must be placed when placing screws in the pedicles, especially on the concave side of curvature where pedicles are extremely narrow and the spinal cord is vulnerable to the iatrogenic injuries due to restricted epidural space [14]. Preoperative full length spine CT in this context has been recommended because of the high probability of the presence of narrow pedicles. It also allows surgeons to identify pseudarthr oses if the p a- tients underwent previous fusion surgery. Postoperative full length spine CT is considered for patients with a new neurologic deficit after surgery. Postoperative CT helps to find the malposition of pedicle screws that develops postoperative neurological symptoms [15]. Full length spine MRI usually is obtained in patients with spinal deformity who develop neurologic symptoms or are planned to be operated. MRI provides good visualization of neurological structures, and helps determine appropriate levels of surgery, and can assist in the evaluation of disc degeneration when f u-T.-K. Ahn et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115028 275 International Journal of Clinical Medicine sion extension is considered [16]. MR imaging is also essential for the patients with an unusual curve pattern and for those patients who should be assessed on the neural axis. It is important to understand whether syrinx, tethering of the spinal cord, intramedullary tumors or Chiari malformations are present. The presence of those intraspinal anomalies without neurological findings in id i- opathic scoliosis has been estimated between 4% and 26% and associated with neurological complications r esulted from correction surgery [17]. Stenosis or cord impingement secondary to severe deformity can be visualized by full length MRI. In kyphoscoliosis, the level of cord compression should be identified preo- peratively and always on the concave pedicle. Those compressions may require a resection of that pedicle with the remaining body during deformity surgery [11] [15]. 3.3. Infection The diagnosis of spinal infection can be difficult, and even delayed because cli n- ical manifestations can be varied and equivocal. Clinical physicians have relied heavily on imaging modalities due to difficulty in detecting spinal infection. Among imaging modalities, MRI plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and ma n- agement of spinal infection with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy above 90% and the ability to evaluate the spine neural structures [18]. If disease process of spinal infection is strictly localized, it is not necessary that the entire spine is examined. However, identification of one infected site in the spine cannot rule out the infection in multiple region of the spine. The areas a d- jacent to anterolateral vertebral endplates has abundant vascular supply and are most common regions where pyogenic, tuberculous, and other spinal infections occur primarily. Associated edema is commonly pronounced and affects the e n- tire vertebral body and intervertebral disc [19]. If there is epidural involvement associated with neurologic symptoms, it is recommended to take full length spine images under these circumstances because epidural abscesses can spread extensively [20]. Among spinal infections caused by various organisms, myc o- bacterium tuberculosis are notorious for multifocality, and subligamentous spread of infection to multiple levels is one of the imaging hallmarks of the di s- ease. The infection typically starts in the anterior aspect of the vertebral body adjacent to the intervertebral disc and then spreads to the vertebral bodies under the anterior longitudinal ligaments involving multiple adjacent vertebrae. Through valveless vein system, it can also make non -contiguous lesion in another spine levels other than where the infection started [21]. The incidence of multifocal spinal infection has varied from around 4% to 23%. Mann et al . evaluated 24 patients with spondylitis and found 21 patients had single level infections , while 1 (4%) had multi -segmental infection [22]. Le- dermann et al. found 7 (16%) out of 44 of patients with disc infection had i n- volvement at several spinal levels [23]. Cox et al. reported that 82 patients with single -level infection performed full length MRI examination and 19 (23%) p a-T.-K. Ahn et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115028 276 International Journal of Clinical Medicine tients had additional non- continuous sites of infection. Remote levels of spon- dylodiscitis we re also present in 11 patients (13%) [20]. In cases of multifocal spinal tuberculosis, the reported incidence is variable, ranging from 1.1% to 71.4%. Kaila et al. reported a very high incidence of 71.4% [24], but their data is likely overestimated due to the small number of cases presented. According to a retrospective study, 47 (25.1%) of 187 patients with spinal tuberculosis had mu l- tifocal spina l tuberculosis [25]. In the spinal infection, full length spine MRI can be used as a diagnostic screening test to detect multifocal lesions even if patients do not ha ve clinical symptoms and provides early detection of spinal infection preventing progre s- sion of osteomyelitis. In regard to the management and treatment of spinal i n- fection, the detection of an epidural abscess or other infective lesions remote from the si te of known uncomplicated spinal infection will likely result in a change of management and treatment from conservative to surgical [26]. 3.4. Axial Spondyloarthropathy In the management and treatment of axial -spondyloarthropathy (SpA), the be n- efit of early detection before structural damage begins is of importance. Howe v- er, clinical findings of early axial -SpA are not specific and assessment can be challenging as the structural components of the spine is not easy to assess due to the deep location. Furthermore, current imaging modalities such as radiographs, CT, and bone scintigraphy have shown limitations for use in early detection of axial- SpA. Both CT and bone scintigraphy expose the patient to high levels of ionizing radiation; bone scintigraphy showed low specificity and CT cannot detect until structural bone changes ha ve progressed [27]. On the other hand, MRI has shown high sensitivity and specificity of imaging tools to pre -structural early inflammatory changes taking the presentation of bone marrow edema a d- jacent to joints and discs, entheses, and ligaments [28] . Although MRI of the sacroiliac (SI) joints has traditionally been used in su s- pected axial -SpA, this may be inadequate. Infl ammatory lesions in the spine have been found most commonly in the thoracic spine besides SI joints. Full length spine MRI highlighted the frequent involvement of the thoracic spine, with emphasis on the most lateral sagittal aspects of vertebral endplates and costovertebral junctions. About 23% of ankylosing spondylitis patients with clinically active disease only have inflammatory spinal lesions and no evidence of active inflammatory sacroiliitis, even in very early disease. Cervical spine i n- volvement is also common in ankylosing spondylitis. For these reasons, full length spine MRI of the whole spine including SI joints is an essential tool in the diagnosis, management and prognosis of axial -SpA [29]. Full length spine MRI has been integrated into recommendations for the staging and therapeutic response evaluation in ankylosing spondylitis. It has been used to evaluate the therapeutic response showing the transition from a c- tive enthesitis with bone marrow edema to quiescent fatty infiltration of the T.-K. Ahn et al.

Spine Metastasis Plain radiography, CT, and MRI comprise the core imaging modalities for p a- tients with vertebral metastases. CT provides cross sectional images, allows for entire spine imaging, is suitable to visualize cortical and trabecular bone, and is more sensitive than conventional radiography. CT scans ca n detect a bony m e- tastatic lesion up to 6 months earlier than an X -ray. However, when compared to MRI, Buhmann et al. found the diagnostic accuracy of MRI (98.7%) to be signi f- icantly superior to MDCT (88.8%) for the detection of osseous metastases. Se n- sitivity was significantly lower for MDCT (66.2%) than for MRI (98.5%) [31]. Moreover, cortical destruction may be difficult to be detected in CT exam when osteoporosis or degenerative changes occur. There is also an inherent associated risk of radiation exposure. Changes in bone -marrow are fundamental to the se n- sitivity of MRI in the detection of sites of skeletal metastases in the spine. The combination of unenhanced T1 -weighted spin echo and STIR sequences have shown to be most useful for the detection of bone marrow abnormalities and are able to discriminate benign from malignant bone marrow changes [32]. Therefore, contrast -enhanced MRI of the entire spinal axis is the current standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of spinal column metastases. If the MRI examination is limited to the spine region of interest, and bone marrow metastases outside the image volume can be missed. Full length spine MRI is of- ten imperative to visualize multiple levels of spinal involvement with asympt o- matic disease or the large amount of bone destruction on plain radiography. Full length spine MRI inclu ding pelvis has been used to detect bone metastases and hematologic malignancies. In prostate cancer, full length spine MRI including pelvis is highly sensitive for the detection of metastases in the axial skeleton ( Figure 4). In multiple myeloma, the axial skeleton approach with entire spine and pelvis is recommended in the staging system [33] . After radiation therapy, MRI appears to b e a powerful tool for differentiating post-therapeutic changes from tumor recurrence. CT is not used routinely du r- ing follow -up, but may be necessary for surveying osteoblastic, osteolytic or mixed lesions. MRI is also useful for evaluation of paravertebral masses and epidural extension [34]. 4. Summary Full length spine CT and MRI plays a significant role in diagnosis and ma n- agement in spinal trauma and disease. Full length spine CT helps diagnose unforeseen injuries to the spine that may be missed due to concomitant or p a- tient conditions in high energy and multiple trauma patients. In the patient with complex or severe deformity, full length spine CT facilitates to analyze d e- formed anatomy and establish preoperative plan. Neurological structures and intraspinal anomalies can be visualized by full length MRI, thereby can prevent T.-K. Ahn et al.

Sagittal full length spine T1 weighted (A), T2 weighted (B) and STIR (C) MR images shows multiple spinal metastasis originating from a prostate cancer. neurological complica tions after deformity surgery. In multifocal spinal infe c- tions, entire spine should be visualized through MRI to evaluate the extension of infection and plan for the treatment. Axial SpA can be detected in early disease course with help of full spine MRI including SI joints. Metastasis to the spine is probably the most common indication for full length imaging as it allows eval u- ation by bone marrow change through whole spine MRI, especially in metastasis from prostate cancer and multiple myeloma. Due to the development of tec h- nology, taking time for CT and MRI of entire spine is being shorter and the res- olution is increasing, and in particular, in the case of CT, the radiation exposure is gradually reducing. These changes will expand the indications for examining full length and help to diagnose, treat and follow up the patients with spine trauma and disease.

Garth L. Nicolson1*, Gonzalo Ferreira de Mattos2 1Department of Molecular Pathology, The Institute for Molecular Medicine, Huntington Beach, USA 2Laboratory of Ion Channels, Biological Membranes and Cell Signaling, Department of Biophysics, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, Montevideo, Uruguay Abstract Most patients with COVID -19 disease caused by the SARS -CoV -2 virus r e- cover from this infection, but a significant fraction progress to a fatal ou t- come. As with some other RNA viruses, co- infection or activation of latent bacterial infections along with pre -existing health conditions in COVID -19 disease may be important in determining a fatal disease course. Mycoplasma spp. (M. pneumonaie , M. fermentans , etc.) have been routinely found as co-infections in a wide number of clinical conditions, and in some cases this has progressed to a fatal disease. Althoug h preliminary, Mycoplasma pneu- moniae has been identified in COVID -19 disease, and the severity of some signs and symptoms in progressive COVID -19 patients could be due, in part, to Mycoplasma or other bacterial infections. Moreover, the presence of p a- thoge nic Mycoplasma species or other pathogenic bacteria in COVID -19 di s- ease may confer a perfect storm of cytokine and hemodynamic dysfunction, autoimmune activation, mitochondrial dysfunction and other complications that together cannot be easily corrected in patients with pre -existing health conditions. The positive responses of only some COVID -19 patients to anti- biotic and anti -malaria therapy could have been the result of suppression of Mycoplasma species and other bacterial co -infections in subsets of pati ents. Thus it may be useful to use molecular tests to determine the presence of p a- thogenic Mycoplasma species and other pathogenic bacteria that are co m- monly found in atypical pneumonia in all hospitalized COVID -19 patients, and when positive results are o btained, these patients should treated acco r- dingly in order to improve clinical responses and patient outcomes.

Introduction The appearance of an outbreak of unexplainable pneumonia in Hubei province, China in 2019 revealed that a new coronavirus name d 2019- nCoV (renamed SARS -CoV -2 coronavirus) was the cause [1] [2]. Patients presented with resp i- ratory and other symptoms, such as cough, fever, and lung damage, along with fatigue, myalgia, dyspnoea, arthralgia, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, among other symptoms [2] [3]. Outcomes of COVID -19 vary from mild, self -limiting disease with respiratory symptoms to more seve re manifestations and death [3] [4]. Patients with COVID - 19 that progressed to death generally were older and had other underlying health conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pul- monary d isease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, or other con ditions [4] [5]. The severe complications associated with non -survival from COVID -19 were primarily acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, met a- bolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction and multiple organ failure [5] [6] [7]. Amo ng the most common organ failures were lung, heart and kidney [7] . Rarely mentioned in these articles was the possibility that other bacterial or viral co - infections could be contributing to either the pathogenesis of SARS -CoV -2 or to the lethal phase of the disease. This contribution will focus on a possible role for intracellular bacterial infe c- tions, such as Mycoplasma possible intracellular bacteria (Chla- mydia pneumoniae , among other possible infections), in the progression and non- survival of COVID -19 patients. Such infections, if present, could contribute to the lethality of the SARS -CoV -2 virus in COVID -19 patients. 2. Mycoplasma Species One of the most commonly found co- infections in a variety of chronic health conditions and diseases are various pathogenic Mycoplasma species [8] [9] [10]. Pathogenic Mycoplasma species infections are usually community -acquired i n- fections that are non- fatal, but some patients can progress to a fulminant, sy s- temic disease that results in death [11] [12]. Mycoplasma l infections are often associated with other bacterial and viral i n- fections [8] [9] [10] [13] [14] [15], Mycoplasma species (and other bact eria and viruses) has been statistically associated with more severe signs and symptoms in chronic illnesses [14] . An example is tick - borne Lyme disease where several co -infections are involved in causing complex clinical presentations, and in this example Mycoplasma was usually the most G. L. Nicolson, G . F. de Mattos DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115029 284 International Journal of Clinical Medicine common Lyme disease co- infection found with Borrelia species and other infec- tions [15] [16]. Also, mycoplasma infections are often found in communi- ty-acquired pneumonia as co -infections with [18] [19] [20] [21]. Co-infections of mycoplasma have been previously in patients with SARS virus infections [22] . Pathogenic mycoplasma s are often found as respiratory tract infections that induce airway inflammation and bronchial hyper -responsiveness (BHR) [23] M. pneu moniae -specific IgE and IgA is likely to play an important role in exacerbating BHR and asthma. Indeed, elevations of IgE antibodies specific to M. pneumoniae have been detected in the serum of p a- tients with M. pneumoniae -induced pneumonia. The serum level s of specific IgE and IgA followed infection with M. pneumoniae, and this was especially true in patients with pre -existing asthma -BHR [24]. M. pneumo niae was found in 24.7% of patients with asthma -BHR but in only 5.7% of control subjects [25] . Mycoplasma pneumoniae has recently been identified in COVID -19 disease [26]. This communication [26] , along with a different case report [27] , suggested that Mycoplasma should be considered as a possible co -infection in progressive COVID- 19 disease. In a separate study with 138 patients with COVID -19, 26.5% of COVID -19 patients were found to have Mycoplasma species infections [28] . This percentage may be low due to the insensitivity of the testing procedures used [28]. Other related bacteria, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and other Chlamydia species were also found at similar levels, but it was not clear from this contribution whether this occurred in the sa me patients that were positive for mycoplasma or in different patients [28] . COVID -19 patients are rarely ex- mycoplasma [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. In the pneu- monia Candida albicans have been found, usually in individual patients. When these bacterial infections were found in COVID -19 patients, they were considered hospital -acquired and unrelated to patient mo r- tality [7]. 3. Oxygen Deprivation and Mitochondria The usual clinical course for patients with fatal COVID -19 disease has been found to be progression to critical ARDS requiring oxygen and mechanical ven tilation [1] [2] [3] [7]. In the severe cases of SARS -CoV -2 infections the most significant difference between surviving patients and non -surviving patients was the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2, from a r- terial blood gas analysis)or acu te hypoxemia [7] . The ratios of PaO2 to FiO2 were found to be significantly lower in non -survivors, consistent with se- vere ARDS [7] vasodilators [20] , critical COVID -19 patients failed to survive. L. Nicolson, G . F. de Mattos DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115029 285 International Journal of Clinical Medicine This suggests that oxygen is not being taken in, utilized effectively and passed into the circulation by lung tissues, possibly because cells infected with SARS - CoV -2 virus and other intracellular bacterial co -infections have lost their abil i- ties to maintain proper cellular and circulato ry oxygen levels. In cells oxygen is utilized by mitochondria to produce high -energy molecules through oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria are also required for other critical functions, such as regulation of ion and redox homeostasis, biosynthesis of lipid and other metabolites, innate immunity, autophagy, cell signaling, reg u- lation of cell death, and other cellular functions [30] [31]. Mitochondria can be affected negatively by several types of infections, including coronaviruses (see below) and mycoplasma example, Mycoplasma infection results in the excess production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) that can damage mitochondrial membranes and mitochondrial DNA. ROS have also bee n found to interfere with mitochondrial metabolism and stress responses in human lung cells [35] . Infections like mycoplasma also steal i m- portant mitochondrial metab olites that are needed for mitochondrial function and produce toxic molecules that damage mitochondria and cells and affect m i- tochondrial function (see below). In COVID -19 patients compromised oxygen exchange in the air sacs of the lungs could be the cause of dyspnea or hypoxia [36]. However, the problem is likely to be more systemic, involving widespread mitochondrial dysfunction in endothelial cells and in various ti ssues and organs affected by SARS -CoV -2 and other co -infections. Possible co -infections include various mycoplasma s and other intracellular bacteria that can cause mitochondrial dysfunction [32] -[37]. In a d- dition to lungs, organ damage can also occur in other tissues, such as hea rt and kidney, and cause their failure [2] [3] [7]. 4. Suppression of Host and Mitochondrial Responses Mitochondria have an impact on the pathogenesi s of many common diseases and disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases, card i- ovascular diseases, fatiguing illnesses, among others, and importantly for this discussion, infectious diseases [31] [32] [33] [37] [38]. Some infections alter m i- tochondrial dynamics and promote pathog enesis that benefits the infectious process [33]. For example, SARS coronaviruses interfere with mitochondrial mitophagy and innate immunity against infections [34] . This will be discussed in more detail in the next section. In acute COVID -19 cases with severe respiratory complications (ARDS) the patients who died had severe mass ive alveolar damage and progressive respir a- tory failure [7] [36], even in cases where antiviral and corticosteroid therapies were given in an effort to attenuate pulmonary inflammation [36] . Lymphoc y- topenia has been a common finding in COVID- 19 patients [29] , but this finding has not been useful in identifying whether a patient w ill survive or not [7] . When mononuclear cells were examined in COVID -19 patients, their status was G. L. Nicolson, G . F. de Mattos DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115029 286 International Journal of Clinical Medicine concluded to be hyper -activated, with high proportions of CD4, CD 8 and CD38 cells, increased numbers of proinflammatory cells, and high concentrations of cytotoxic granules inside cells [36] . Pathogenic mycoplasma s, such as M. pneumoniae , known to cause co with immunological manifestations [12] [24] [39]. These infections are typified by reactions immune suppression [12] [24] [40] [41] [42]. However, mycoplasma s do not ical bacterial cell walls that contain inflammation -inducing endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharides [12] [41]. Instead, mycoplasma s contain lipoproteins that can induce inflammatory responses through Toll -like (TLR) and other receptors, and they induce release of pro -inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the clinical problem [41] [42] [43]. This will be discussed further in Section 7. Since the populous has not been exposed previously to the SARS -CoV -2 virus, they generally do not possess immunity to this infection and thus adaptive im- mune responses are non -existent [44]. However, based on findings with other coronaviruses, such as SARS -CoV, host innate immune response systems that utilize pattern recognition and TLR receptors will likely be involved in initial responses [45]. Even when the adaptive immune responses are initiated, invol v- ing various T cell linages and B cell production of antibodies, SARS -CoV -2 may initiate immune suppression by inducing apoptosis of T cells. This type of B-cell humoral immunity is thought to be important in combating infections of SARS -CoV -2 [44]. 5. Blood and Coagulation Disturbances Patients with COVID -19 diseas e and atypical pneumonia tend to show blood disturbances, such as leukoctyopenia, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, along with rase, creatine kinase and related to severity of disease [2] [7] [46]. These latter serum markers are indicative of liver, kidney and heart i n- jury and are consistent with clinical findings on COVID -19 [2] [7] [44] [46]. Increased levels of C -reactive and erythrocyte sedimentation were also routinely found, suggesting endothelial cell damage in COVID -19 disease [44] [46] [47]. The COVID -19 patients requiring intensive care (ICU) also showed significant differences in prothrombin clotting time and increases in the pre s- ence of D -dimers (fibrin degradation fragments) [2]. There were differences also between surviving and non- surviving COVID -19 patients in ICUs [48] . Thro m- botic complications have been a co mmon finding in COVID -19 patients, with increases in acute pulmonary embolism, deep -vein thrombosis and systemic a r- terial embolism, despite intensive thromboprophylaxis [49]. It has been esp e- cially important to control blood hemodynamics in COVID -19 patients, esp e- cially in those patients requiring ventilation [47] [48] [49]. Similar to COVID -19 disease, patients with mycoplasma infections, especially M. pneumoniae infections, show significant increases in serum aspartate amin Nicolson, G . F. de International Journal of Clinical Medicine transferase, alanine aminotransferase as well as increases in lactate dehydrog e- nase [50]. As found in COVID -19 disease, this suggests that organ damage to liver and possibly other organs by the infectious process could be enhanced by the presence of mycoplasma or other bacteria. Also, high levels of C -reactive protein are typical in M. pneumoniae infections, and the ratios of C -reactive protein to procalcitonin were found to be predictive for mycoplasma -induced pneumonia [51]. Similar to COVID -19 patients, common findings in M. pne u- moniae infections thrombocytopenia, . 6. Biotoxins and Host Responses Various infective agents have evolved with different strategies to evade host non - immune and immune mechanisms that have been developed to inhibit infe c- tions. Simple RNA viruses use explosive replication to outpace host response mechanisms, but they have also evolved with particular strategies to deal with host responses, such as innate host responses and adaptive immune responses. SARS -CoV virus componen ts or their replication intermediates are first reco g- nized by host innate response systems using Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) present in the cytosol and on various cellular membranes. These PRRs recognize viral Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern s (PAMPs) or viral stru c- tures with unique structural characteristics and initiate anti- infective responses [53] [54]. While SARS -CoV viruses attempt to evade host innate recognition and r e- sponse systems, host cells that detect SARS -CoV viruses turn on production of cytokines, chemokines and interferon -stimulated gene (ISG)responses to cou n- ter SARS -CoV infections [54] [55]. This will be considered in the context of fatal infections in the next section. To counter innate immune signaling, SARS -CoV viruses encode several proteins that antagonize the host response to prevent a c- tivation of antiviral systems inside host cells and prevent host interferon re s- ponses [54]. Mycoplasma s use various virulence mechanisms to survive durin g their pa- thogenic development [56] [57]. Inside cells they compete for cellular nutrients and metabolites, and in this way they can depletehost precursor molecules and disrupthost metabolic and synthetic pathways [56] . They also secrete some of their own enzymes, such as lipases, proteases, nucleases and other enzymes, that can disrupt and interfere with host structures and metabolites [57] [58]. Myco p- lasma s can also stimulate the generation of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals that damage host cellular membranes, mitocho ndria and other stru c- tures [56]. Pathogenic mycoplasma s can synthesize degradative enzymes that can da m- age tissues and cause pathogenic changes, such as secondary necrosis [59]. They can also cause tissue damage with the morphological characteristics of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, as well as necrosis, with characteristic loss of G. L. Nicolson, G . F. de Mattos DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115029 288 International Journal of Clinical Medicine membrane integrity and organelle swelling [60]. Arginine deaminase is an e x- ample of a gro wth-inhibitory mycoplasma -produced enzyme that inhibits the growth of human T -cells. This enzyme can suppresses IL -2 production and r e- ceptor expression in T -cells stimulated by non -specific mitogens. It can also produce the morphologic features of dying ce lls, such as DNA fragmentation that is seen during apoptosis [42] . This enzyme has been followed in patients with community -acquired pneumonia as a possible marker fo r M. pneumoniae infections [61]. Some Mycoplasma species can directly cause host cell death, but a more com- mon feature of pathogenic mycoplasma infections is the induction of host cyt o- kines [62]. Indeed, cytokine -inducing activity is a general feature of most, if not all, pathogenic Mycoplasma species, and this important topic for COVID -19 disease will be discussed in the next section. The cell death effects of mycopla s- mas are usually mediated by lipid -associated molecules (lipoproteins), and they are not associated with decreases in mitochondri al trans -membrane potential or inhibited by pre -incubation with the drug N -acetylcysteine, which is typically found in TNF -mediated apoptosis. Rather, a non -lipid -associated protein (15 - 30 kDa) was found to cause mycoplasma -mediated cell death [63]. Similar to SARS -CoV viruses, pathogenic mycoplasma s cause cardiovascular and pulmonary manifestations that can result in extreme patient morbidity and death [57] [61] [62]. Several examples of cardiovascular and pulmonary tissue damage have been reported as due to vas cular occlusion via thrombosis and the formation of vascular immune complexes. Pathogenic mycoplasma -caused va s- cular occlusion has been reported for heart, lung, kidney, brain and other organs [60] [62]. Pathogenic mycoplasma s also release biotoxins that directly damage cells and tissues and stimulate host innate response systems [58] the community -acquired respiratory distress syndrome toxin (CARDS), has been isolated and found to bean ADP - and protein -ribosylating as well as a vacuole -causing cytotoxin [65]. The effects of this b iotoxin also include alterations of enzymes and other proteins of various metabolic pathways. As mentioned above, this biotoxin activates innate immu n- ity, and this is mediated through the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, which u l- timately causes cell -release of IL-1. It also stimulates hyper -inflammation and tissue damage, among other pathologic effects, and it appears to be responsible, in part, for pulmonary inflammation along with cytokine release. Clinically it causes significant airway dysfunction, which is usually seen as loss of ciliary function of the respiratory epithelium and includes lung cell vacuolization, lung cell rounding/distortion and disruption of pulmonary epithelial integrity. It may be responsible for respiratory failure and some of the fatal outcomes that have been found in acute M. pneumoniae infections [66]. 7. Cytokines and Cytokine Storms Excess inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and rele ase into the G. Nicolson, G . F. de Mattos DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115029 289 International Journal of Clinical Medicine surrounding tissue and the circulatory system ( \"cytokine storm \") can be seen during severe infectious disease progression, and it is often found in fatal cases of viral infections. It is caused by a severe and excessive immune response i n- itiated by a positive feedback cycle between various cytokines and immune cells. COVID- 19 disease progression to severe hypoxia, pulmonary edema, acc u- mulation of inflammatory cells in the lungs, ARDS and eventually organ failure often ends in a lethal outcome with high mortality rates [2] [3] [5] [6] [7]. Con- sistent with this lethal progression is the increasing induction and production of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin -1 (IL -1), IL -6, IL -7, IL -8, IL -10, tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF ) and other cytokines and chemokines, all of which have been found in SARS -CoV viral infections [54] [55]. Compared to healthy, non -symptomatic adults the levels of plasma cytokines (IL -1, IL-RA, IL-7, IL -8, IL -9, IL -10, TNF and other cytokines and chemokines) were higher in both non- ICU and ICU patients with COVID -19 disease compared to con- trols [2]. Importantly, recent studies have shown significantly higher levels of i n- flammatory cytokines (IL -2R, IL -6, IL -8, IL -10, TNF ) in ICU non- survivors compared to ICU survivors of COVID -19 disease [67] . This suggests that exce s- sive, multiple cytokines produced during progressive disease or 'cytokine storm' contributes to the fatal outcome seen in many COVID -19 patients. Cytokine/chemokine release at tissue sites, such as the inflammatory cytokines and chemokines found at exaggerated levels in lung tissue during RNA virus in-fections, is particularly difficult to deal with in animals and in humans [68] [69]. There are over 150 different pro -inflammatory and anti -inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, interferons, growth factors and other tissue factors that are synth e- sized and released into tissues and the blood during a vigorous immune system response , and these signaling molecules can cause high fever, redness, swelling, fatigue, nausea and other symptoms [68] [69] [70]. At the cellular and tissue levels SARS -CoV viruses and the virus -induced c y- tokine storms that are caused by these v iruses result in significant damage to tissues, especially lung tissue. This pulmonary damage can be observed as diffuse injury to alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblasts and alveolar macrophages. Specif i- cally, the damage has been characterized as hyaline membrane formation, de s- quamation of pneumocytes, edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, among other adverse effects [71] . During the infection process lung cells secrete various cytokines and chem o- kines that induce fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix deposition and al-veolar epithelial damage. Such aberrant response, along with excessive cytokine production, are not unique to RNA viruses; they have been assoc iated with the pathogenesis of a variety of non -infectious and infectious diseases, from viral infections to ne urodegenerative disorders [70]. Mycoplasma infections a lso result in the production of inflammatory cyt o- kines, including IL-1 , IL-2, IL -6, IL and TNF as interferons and leukocyte growth factors [57] [62] [63] [64]. In cases of M. Nicolson, G . F. de Mattos DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115029 290 International Journal of Clinical Medicine cytokines, such as IL -18 but not interferon, were found to be significantly higher in, for example, patients with fulminant pneumonia [12] . During infection by M. pneumonia the production of cytokines (IL -1, IL-6, IL -10, TNF , among ot h- ers) increases markedly, and this is thought to be an indication of tissue damage [72]. In th e case of M. pneumoniae such damage has been directly related to the release of various inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory molecules and the subsequent tissue and immune responses to these molecules [72]. 8. Antibiotics, Anti -Malarial and Other Treatments In describing some of the treatments used to fight COVID -19 disease, we will only discuss here those commonly used treatments that relate to possible ba c- terial co -infections or activated latent bacterial infections. Although the cons e- quences of SARS -CoV -2 coronavirus anti -viral and other treatments and general ICU supportive procedures are fundamentally important in caring for COVID - 19 patient s, that is not the purpose of our contribution. The use of anti -viral and other drugs and ICU supportive procedures have been extensively reviewed by others, and this discussion will not be repeated here. Thus the reader is referred to other recent article s for information on primary and ICU supportive trea t- ments useful in the management -19 Since mycoplasma s do not have cell walls, the antibiotics that act on cell wall synthesis, such as -lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins, among others),are [73] s are often treated with anti -microbials that act on their metabolism, replication, sy n- thetic machinery or other specific bacterial targets, even though the actions of these dr ugs are mainly bacterostatic [24] [62] [74]. Since most mycoplasma s among others) or macr o- [75] [76] [77], these are often used Myco p- lasma species, and quinolones (ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, among others), are often used as alternative treatments [62] [76]. In general viruses are not susceptible to antibiotics, but particular antibiotics have been used during viral infections to treat bacterial co -infections or latent infections. This is common in cases of adult community- acquired pneumonia where Mycoplasma species were often the most frequent type of bacterial infe c- tion found in cases identified as viral pneumonia [78] . In addition, some macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin, have anti -viral activities against specific viruses, such as rhinoviruses identified in virus -asso- ciated pulmonary conditions found fibrosis [ 79] and zika virus recov- human brain tissue [80] . In bronchial epithelial cells pre- G. L. Nicolson, G . F. de Mattos DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115029 291 International Journal of Clinical Medicine treatment with azithromycin reduced rhinovirus replication as well as asthma exacerbations and other complications, as estimated by the synthesis of pro- inflammatory cytokines, interferon - responses and increases in rhinovi rus-induced pattern recognition receptor [79] . Other macrolides may be useful in the treatment of respiratory viral infections due to their effects on pulmonary cells. In this situation the positive effects of macrolides have been attributed, in part, to their anti -inflammatory and imm u- nomodulatory effects [81] [82] [83]. Although ma crolides have been shown to be efficacious in treating some infections, their use comes with some possible risk of cardiac complications, such as QT prolongation [84] . In COVID -19 disease antibiotics have been used mainly as a part of suppo r- tive care and prevention of super -infection, without identification of possible bacterial co -infections or activation of latent bacterial infections [2] [7] [44] [47] [48]. In some treatment studies on COVID -19 disease an antibiotic (azit hrom y- cin) was used with an anti -malarial drug (hydroxychloroquine). For example, this combination was used in Marseille, France in an open label non- randomized clinical trial, but the azithromycin was added mainly as a part of supportive care [85]. The results of this preliminary study will be discussed in the next section. Another antibiotic active against mycoplasma s, doxycycline [62] [64] [73], might also be useful in COVID -19 because of its potential binding to rRNA and inhibition of microbial protein synthesis [86] . Indeed, doxycycline has proved to be an important option for ch ronic mycoplasma infections resistant to other treatments [62] [73], and its effectiveness in COVID -19 care might be more r e- lated to its suppression of bacterial gr owth than any anti -viral action. 8.2. Anti -Malarial Drugs and COVID -19 The interesting use of the anti -malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, in the trea t- ment of COVID -19 disease was reported by Gautret et al . [85]. This followed from an earlier study on the suppressive effects of chloroquine on SARS -CoV infection of Vero E6 cells in culture [87]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have many uses because of their anti -inflammatory and potential chemo -sensi - tization properties; they have been used widely to treat various human diseases, such as malaria and amoebiosis, without significant adverse effects [88] . The main anti-parasitic and anti -viral effects of the chloroquines are thought to o c- cur by the alkylization of cellular endosomes, Golgi and lysosomes, and possibly also by affecting phospholipid metabolism and zinc ion levels to modify parasite and virus entry [89] . In addition, chloroquines block BK channels that are esse n- tial in proinflammatory responses that can lead to cytokine storms [90]. In China chloroquine phosphate has been used to treat COVID -19 pneum o- nia patients. Although a recent preliminary report on this lacks detail and anal y- sis, it was stated that chloroquine could be a br eakthrough in COVID -19 trea t- ment [91]. In this study , patients receiving chloroquine phosphate showed less exacerbation of pneumonia, and they had improved lung imagi ng compared to G. L. Nicolson, G . F. de Mattos DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115029 292 International Journal of Clinical Medicine control treatment. In addition, severe adverse reactions to chloroquine pho s- phate were not found in these patients [91]. In the French study using hydro x- ychloroquine and azithromycin, viral carriage was reduced significantly over a 6-day study with hydroxychloroquine, and the addition of azithromycin was signif icantly better than hydroxychloroquine alone [85]. In a recent randomized clinical trial using low (450 mg) and high (600 mg) dose chloroquine as adjunct therapy for COVID -19 patients viral RNA was detected at about the same pr e- valence in both groups: 31/41 (low dose) and 31/40 (high dose). However, by day 13 fatalities in the high -dose group were higher (39%) than in the low -dose group (15%), most likely because of a higher incidence of heart problems in the high-dose group [92] . Thus use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID- 19 disease may come at a cost \u2014a higher incid ence of coronary problems [92] . Even with these limitations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have been proposed to be potentially useful experimental drugs for the treatment of some COVID -19 patients [93] . 8.3. Other Treatments in COVID- 19 In addition to anti -viral drugs that target SARS -CoV -2 viral replication, other treatment approaches for COVID -19 disease include methods to inhibit viral a t- tachment, fusion and entry into cells, suppression of inflammatory responses, vaccines and convalescent plasma treatments [94] as well as combinations of conventiona l and alternative medicine [37] [38] [94]. For example, various co m- binations of anti -viral, anti -inflammatory and other drugs along with an ti-oxidants, zinc ion, and other approaches, such as the use of molecular hydrogen to help control inflammation and oxidative damage , have been proposed [95]. For the most part, the current approaches used to develop new treatments for COVID -19 disease do not take into account the possibility of bacterial co -infections or act i- vation of latent bacterial infections. 9. Final Comments Our hypothesis has been that infections like Mycoplasma and other bacterial species ( Chlamydia pneumoniae , among others) could be contributing to the morbidity and mortality seen in COVID -19 disease. Infections like M. pneum o- niae, M. fermentans and other Mycoplasma species are known to cause lethal diseases on their own in some patients, so when present with SARS -CoV -2 in- fections, they could be significantly contributing to COVID -19 mortality. In other diseases caused by RNA viruses, such as HIV -1, M. fermentans and M. pene- trans co-infections have been proposed to be important co -factors in the devel- opment of fatal disease [96] [97]. This could also be, in part, the reason that some patients with COVID -19 progress to a fatal disease. Mycoplasma and other similar bacterial infections should be carefully ana- lyzed in critical COVID -19 patients. If such tests are positive, these patients should be treated accordingly [62] [64] [73]. In order to determine the possible G. Nicolson, G . F. de Mattos DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115029 293 International Journal of Clinical Medicine role of Mycoplasma species in the progression of COVID -19 disease to a fatal disease course, patients who are positive for such infections should be compared to patients that do not have these infections at various stages of the disease process to see if the SARS -CoV -2 virus can activate latent Mycoplasma species or enhance sub -clinical mycoplasma infections and promote COVID -19 disease morbidity and progression to a fatal outcome. Note Added in Proof Since we prepared this manuscript, there have been recent contributions, mo stly brief preprint reports or letters that support our hypothesis. Charkraborty and Das [98] discussed the possibility that anaerobic bacteria, including Mycoplasm a species, could be causing secondary infections in COVID -19 disease. They have proposed that such infections may be altering hemoglobin degradation and producing metabolites that affect hypoxia in Stricker [99] suggested that patients who have COVID -19 di s- ease should not progress to a fatal outcome, if their therapy includes combin a- tions of antibiotics (including minocycline or doxycycline) used for tick -borne infections [99]. As we discussed previously, Lyme disease patients often have mycoplasma co-infections that are sensitive to minocycline and doxycycline [62] [75].

Although the use of drugs or alternative approaches has improved symptom severity in some but not all patients, often these improveme nts were not sustainable. Objectives: An open label clinical study was initiated to d e- termine if oral capsules containing a dietary supplement of herbs and oils (GI RegenerateTM) could reduce self -reported gastrointestinal symptoms and i m- prove quality of l ife (QOL) indicators in patients with gastrointestinal cond i- tions. Methods: Participants included 50 patients (40 females and 10 males) of mean age of 51.1 \u00b1 12.7 years (range, 24 - 77 years) with a diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorder or gastrointesti nal symptoms . These patients co n- sumed five soft -gels containing the test supplement 30 minutes before each meal for 90 days. Symptoms were evaluated by medical staff, and patient health status was self-reported using a validated quality of life questionnaire (Quality of Life Digestive Survey) designed for functional digestive disorders. Exit interviews (Patient Global Impression of Change, PGIC) were conducted by the medical staff. Results: Particip ants in the study responded with i m- proved symptom severities and QOL scores to the test dietary supplement within the 90 day period; most improvements occurred within 20 days on the test dietary supplement. By the end of the study there were significant ov erall global improvements in the symptoms and QOL health surveys (p = 0.0183), How to - Smith, K ., Clark, J ., McLaren, C .E. and Ni- colson , G.L.

In contrast, there were insignif i- cant improvements in die t (p = 0.398), sleep (p = 0.136), health perception (p = 0.686), coping with the disease (p = 0.309) and impact of stress (p = 0.785). Using the PGIC exit interview that measured each patient's impression of overall global change in symptoms and QOL these data also indicated overall significant improvements in symptoms and in satisfaction with the test su p- plement (moderately better improvements in symptoms and QOL or score of 4.8 \u00b1 0.169, p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in the res- ponses b etween males and females, and no significant differences between older (>50 years) versus younger (<50 years) subjects. There were also no safety issues that arose during the trial. Conclusions: The GI RegenerateTM- natural dietary supplement safely and sign ificantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and improved quality of life in subjects with a broad spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders and symptoms.

Introduction There is a rather large burden to the United States population of morbidity, mortality and cost due to gastrointestinal (GI), liver and pancreatic diseases and disorders [1] [2], and this appears to be true in other nations as well [3]. With its aging population, the United States faces an increasing prevalence of digestive diseases over time [2] . This is likely to result in an overall worsening of the productivity and quality of life (QOL) in the aging population [4] [5]. Different treatments have been developed and used to control symptoms and improve QOL in digestive diseases and disorders [6] [7]. Among the pharm a- ceutical treatments that are commonly used, such as corticosteroids, aminosal i- cylates, antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs, improvements in symptoms have been found, but not in every patient, and often these improvements are not sustainable. Also, the drugs that are often prescribed can have adverse effects in some patients . Thus c omplementary or alternative medicine approaches have been used to avoid the adverse effects of drug treatments and improve treatment outcomes [6] [7]. Among the alternative medical approaches to the treatment of GI diseases and disorders is the use of herbal combinations, and this has proved beneficial for many patients [8] [9] [10]. There is a rich history that goes back thousands of years of using single and multiple herbal formulations to treat digestive di seases and disorders [8] [10]. In the United States , a large proportion of patients with digestive disorders have tried some form of herbal treatment [10] [11]. The most commonly used herbal treatments for digestive diseases and disorders in the US L. E. Connealy et al . DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115030 305 International Journal of Clinical Medicine have their origin in traditional Chinese medicine [10]. One such combination of herbs and oils that has been used for years in China to treat digestive disorders has been utilized in the current study. This same co m- bination dietary supplement has had different names (GIC, MEBO Ga strointe s- tinal Capsule, Dr. Xu's GI Formula, or more recently GI RegenerateTM), and it has been the subject of several scientific and clinical studies in China. These st u- dies include: survival and growth promotion of intestinal and stomach epithelial cells [12] [13], clinical treatment studies on ulcerative peptic ulcers [17], and repair of g a- strointestinal damage due to ethanol [18] or infection [19] . Using a validated QOL questionnaire for functional digestive disorders [20] and patient global impression of change scores (PGIC) taken during exit inte r- views by contributing physicians this same dietary supplement formulation, or GI RegenerateTM, has been examined for its use in treating digestive disorders and symptoms in North American patients. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials GI RegenerateTM is a patented natural supplement containing a mixture of herba l ingredients and edible oils. It c an edible wax [21] . This base mixture was placed (250 mg each) into soft gel capsules. The natural dietary supplement used in the clinical study was provided by MEBO Life Sciences, Brea, California. 2.2. Methods An open label, independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved study was initiated using subjects recruited from Southern California with formally diagnosed digestive disorders and diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, gastritis, esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Crohn's disease , irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or other digestive disorder s. The study recruitment was limited to patients attending the Center for New Medicine, Irvine, California who volunteered for the study. The number of subjects was determined by the number of pa tients who volunteered and could be adequately scheduled, ex- amined and treated by available staff during the trial period of January 2019 to January 2020. The 40 females and 10 males recruited to the study presented with a variety of signs and symptoms rel ated to digestive disorders ( Table 1 ). Exclusion ary crite- ria included subjects who were taking immunosuppressive drugs, or ha d cogn i- tive impairment, or were pregnant, lactating or below the age of 18 years. Each subject was directed to take 5 capsules of GI RegenerateTM 30 min before meals 3X per day for the 90 -day study period. Participants were advised not to change any of their daily medications, diet or routine during the study. L. E. Connealy et al .

DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115030 307 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Study subjects were monitored at various times using a validated patient que s- tionnaire for functional digestive disorders and QO L (Appendix Fig ure 1 in re f- erence [20]). The data were normalized to baseline and analyzed as : a) Overall Global Scores; and subsets of data were normalize d to baseline and analyzed as: b) Daily Activities Scores, c) Symptom Discomfort Sc ores, d) Anxiety Scores, e) Diet Scores, f) Sleep Scores, g) Coping with Disease Scores, h) Health Percep tion Scores, and i) Stress Impact Scores [20] . Subjects were also subjected to exit examination and surveys conducted by professional staff physicians of the Center for New Medicine of Irvine, Califo r- nia. In this (PGIC) analysis participants were asked whether their overall changes in symptom severity a nd QOL were very much better (score of 6), moderately better (score of 5), a little better (score of 4), no change (score of 3), a little worse (score of 2), moderately worse (score of 1) or very much worse (score of 0) (Appendix Fig ure A1 of this paper). The mean satisfaction scores were deter- mined and analyzed statistically. 2.3. Statistical Analysis For statistical analysis we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) for the regression parameters as introduced by Liang and Zeger as a method for estim a- tion of regression model parameters when dealing with correlated data [22] [23]. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are a convenient and general approach to the analysis of several kinds of correlated data. The main advantage of GEE resides in the unbiased estimation of population -averaged regression coefficients despite possible misspecification of the correlation structure. Our longitudinal research was aimed at describing the marginal expectations of the outcome as a function of the predictors [24] . The objective of analyses that we have done and performed were to examine: (1) whether the QOL scores differed over the study time points; (2) whether the QOL scores differed over t he study time points between males and females; and (3) whether the QOL scores differed over the study time points between age < 50 and age 50. Data were analyzed with significance defined as p < 0.05 and pr e- sented as mean data with 95% confidence levels . The exit survey (PGIC) was conducted with 28 subjects, and satisfaction scores were calculated and analyzed by a one -sided, one sample t -test. In this analysis a significant overall improvement in exit scores would be a composite satisfac tion score grea ter than 3.0. All of the statistical analyses were performed independently by the Statistical Unit of the Division of General Medicine, D e- partment of Medicine, University of California, Irvine. 2.4. Safety Issues The safety of patients was careful ly monitored during the trial. Any issues of a d- verse reactions to the test supplement were carefully recorded and monitored during the trial. Potential changes in blood chemistry were monitored each L. E. Connealy et al . DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115030 308 International Journal of Clinical Medicine month during the clinical study using the NutrEvalTM diagnostic blood evalu a- tion panel (Genova Diagnostics, A sheville, NC). In this panel standard blood chemistry and a panel of blood levels of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, esse n- tial fatty acids, probiotics, pancreatic enzymes, and amino acids were monitored at the beginning and each subsequent month during the trial period. 3. Results 3.1. Participants in the Study There were 50 participants in the IRB -approved clinical study (40 females, 10 males). They had a mean age of 51.1 \u00b1 12.7 years (range, 24 - 77 ye ars) and pr e- sented with a diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorder. A summary of the partic i- pants and their presentation with a variety of digestive disorders and diseases (with multiple gastrointestinal symptoms) is summarized in Table 1. 3.2. Quality of Life Determinations Using the validated digestive disorders questionnaire of Chassany, et al. [20] pa- tients were examined for their responses in each survey category every 10 days during th e 90-day test period ( Figure 1). After the 90 -day period, the analyzed results of the study indicated that there were significant overall global improv e- ments in the health surveys (p = 0.0183) ( Figure 1 (a)), with significant im- provements in symptom discomfort (p = 0.0004) ( Figure 1 (b)), daily activities (p = 0.029) ( Figure 1 (c)) and anxiety (p = 0.018) ( Figure 1 (d)). In contrast, there were insignificant improvements in diet (p = 0.398) ( Figure 1 (e)), sleep (p = 0.136) ( Figure 1 (f)), health perception (p = 0.686) ( Figure 1 (g)), coping with the disease (p = 0.309) ( Figure 1 (h)) and impact of stress (p = 0.785) ( Figure 1(i)). Most health response improvements over baseline occurred within 20 days from initiating the dietary supplement ( Figures 1 (a)-(d)). Based on the results from the GEE models, regression parameters indicated that the improvements in overall global symptoms and QOL scores were consi s- tent and occurred with a low degree of variance. The estimated changes from baseline of the eight dimensio n scores are shown in Table 2 . The dimension scores included: daily activities (DA), anxiety (AN), diet (DI ), sleep (SL), di s- comfort (DT), health perceptions (HP), coping with disease (CD), and impact of stress (IS). In addition, two overall measures, the estimated change from baseline in the global score (GS) and an alternative scoring of the global score (Alt GS) are also displayed. The Table illustrates the low degree of variance in estimated changes from baseline in dimension scores and global scores over the 10 survey time points. 3.3. Exit Interviews Exit interviews (PGIC) with each participant were conducted by the clinical study physician s (Appendix Fig ure A1). The exit interviews indicated that the L. E. Connealy et al .

Safety of the Study There were no safety issues tha t came up during the clinical trial. In support of this the NutrEvalTM diagnostic blood evaluation panels showed no significant changes in blood chemistry and levels of blood antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, probiotics, pancreatic enzymes, and amino acids during the study. 4. Discussion The dietary test supplement used in the present clinical study (now called GI RegenerateTM) has been used for years in China and other countries to treat p a- tients with a variety of gastrointestinal d isorders and diseases [14] -[19]. These clinical studies were dependent on this dietary supplement repairing gastrointes- tinal damage. To demonstrate the effects of the test dietary supplement on st i- mulating gastrointestinal epithelial cell survival, growth and regeneration , some L. E. Connealy et al . DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115030 311 International Journal of Clinical Medicine experimental studies were initiated. After excision and in vitro culture of organ explants of murine stomach and intestinal tissues in medium containing fetal bovine serum, addition of the test dietary supplement was shown to stimulate epithelial cell survival, growth and differentiation, whereas the cells in explant cultures without the dietary test supplement began to die and never formed vi a- ble cell colonies [12] [13]. Consistent with the findings in China on the clinical benefits of using the oral test dietary supplement to treat ulcerative colitis [14] , gastroesophageal damage due to ethanol [18] or infection [19] we found that North Amer i- can patients with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and symptoms ( Table 1 ) responded positively to the test dietary supplement GI RegenerateTM. These po s- itive responses were collected using the validated digestive disorders questio n- naire of Chassany, et al. [20] over a 90 -day period. The results indicated that male and female patients with IBS, GERD, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, ulce r- ative colitis, gastritis, and digestive symptoms, such as abdominal bloating and pain, gastric pain, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, flatulence, nausea, regurgit a- tion and food allergies and malabsorption, improved significantly during the test period (p = 0.0183), with significant QOL improvements in symptom discomfort (p = 0.0004), daily activities (p = 0.029) and anxiety (p = 0.018). Our results usin g the validated digestive disorders questionnaire were co n- firmed in the PGIC exit surveys where patients indicated moderately better i m- provements in symptoms and QOL (p < 0.0001) at the end of the study. Thus we have confirmed the benefits of taking oral capsules of GI RegenerateTM found in previous studies on the improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with digestive disorders and diseases [14] -[19]. There were no safety concerns that came up during the trial. Patients did not report issues with the GI RegenerateTM oral supplement, and blood chemistry analyses every month during the trial on every subject using the NutrEvalTM di- agnostic blood evaluation panel did not indicate any abnormalities in levels of blood antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, probiotics, pancre a- tic enzymes, or amino acids during the study. Thus w e concluded that the GI RegenerateTM oral supplement was safe and effective for use in treating gastroi n- testinal symptoms in early adults to the elderly. Although the results of our clinical study were positive and generally signif i- cant statistically, ther e were ob vious limitations of the trial. First, we note that although the numbers of females in our study were sufficient, we had less access to male patients. Thus the numbers of males in our study (10) were much lower than the numbers of females (40). Fu ture studies should contain more balanced numbers of males and females. Also, the study was a preliminary open label study, not a robust, randomized, controlled clinical trial. There are few ev i- dence -based clinical studies using randomized clinical trials on the use of Ch i- nese dietary herbal supplements to treat digestive disorders [25] [26]. The results L. E. Connealy et al . DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115030 312 International Journal of Clinical Medicine presented here should stimulate the organization of a randomized, controlled clinical trial using GI RegenerateTM to test for improvements in symptoms in p a- tients with di gestive disorders and diseases.

The cumulative Weibull distribution function (WF) is the primary choice to parametrize the KM. but some others (e.g. Gompertz, l o- gistic functions) are also widely applied. We show that the cumulative two - parametric Weibull function meets all requirements. The Weibull function is the consequence of the general self -organizing behavior of the survival, and consequently shows self- similar death -rate as a function of the time. The o n- togenic universality as well as the universality of tumor -growth fits to WF. WF parametrization needs two independent parameters, which could be o b- tained from the med ian and mean values of KM estimate, which makes an easy parametric approximation of the KM plot. The entropy of the distrib u- tion and the other entropy descriptions are supporting the parametrization validity well. The goal is to find the most appropriate m ining of the inherent information in KM -plots. The two- parameter WF fits to the non -parametric KM survival curve in a real study of 1180 cancer patients offering satisfactory description of the clinical results. Two of the 3 characteristic parameters of the KM plot (namely the points of median, mean or inflection) are enough to reconstruct the parametric fit, which gives support of the comparison of su r- vival curves of different patient's groups.

In this sense, life follows the basic thermodynamic laws: the living process continuously \"burns\" the incoming \"nutrition\". Only the energy -pump of the incoming sun -energy makes the difference: creates original gradients which are later divided into other inhomog eneities by spontaneous processes. Life process tries to diminish the working energy of the sunlight by increasing the overall entropy of the environment. Living process lowers the electron ene r- gy by the oxidation producing outgoing (waste) final \"products\". The gradual loss of electron energy of the \"nutrition\" molecules is the energy to sustain life. Simply speaking, the living process is a dissipative entropy producer. As the Nobel laureate physiologist A. Szentgyorgyi states \"Life is nothing but an elec tron look- ing for a place to rest\" [1] . Living objects are open systems among various environmental surroundings, adapting themselves to the conditions around, forming self -organized structures [2], and forcing evolution [3] . The approach of complexity becomes a useful tool for the description of nature [4] [5]. Self -organization appears in various scie n- tific problems [6]. The self -organization explains multiple structural and d y- namical challenges in biology [7] ; it is observed in broad range of research from the gene -regulatory networks [8], through the cells [9], to the general evolution of living objects [10] . The invariance of magnification (scale invariance, when the up or down ma g- nification shows similar structures) is the form of self- similarity, which is a typ i- cal consequence of the self -organizing processes, [11] [12]. It has developed a new the fractal physiology [13] [14] [15]; where stochastic processes are applied instead of the deterministic actions, so the predictions of the distant future always have random, unpredictable elements. Random stationary, stochastic, self- organizing processes form dynamic beh a- viors [16], define a spatiotemporal -fractal structure, which is self -similar both in space and time [17] . The spatiotemporal fractal structure is a fingerprint of the self-organizing [18], and especially characteristic for the living matter [19] . The basal metabolism as the energy consumption of the living objects has a central role in system biology [20] and describes the biosystems by definite properties [21]. According to the system biology: life is complexly organized in a wide range of magnification and different l e- vels of interactions, life is self -regulated with various feedback processes, the living systems are open, dissipative objects with multilevel interactions with the environment, the activity of life processes ha s intensive cross- talks of different levels of its organization, the specific forms and properties are complexly environment dependent These points are important for the universality of life, for the dynamic fluct u- ations and scaling too [22], and as a character of life, it could be used in its d i-O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 318 Medicine as well [23] . Dynamical interactions have a spatiotemporal fluctuation which also has a scaling behavior. Homeostatic time -fluctuation is the so -called pink noise [24] , that characterizes the noise of homeostasis. The above complex biological processes connect to the biological allometry, scaling, non -equilibrium, and non -linear thermodynamics. Special self -similarity characterizes the mass -allometry by universal scaling, and it appears in a large category of living structures and processes [25] , which rigorously optimizes the metabolic power in a universal frame, [26]. Scaling is a simple power function, (like ( )bP x ax= ), where a and b are constants, therefore the form of ( )Px remains the same during any magnification of x. This scaling condition chara c- terizes the biomaterials, which is indeed scaled universally on a very wide range of magnifications from the subcellular energy -consumption through mitoc hon- dria and respiratory complexes to the largest animals by scaling exponent = 3/4, [27]. The fingerprint of complexity can be found in various fields of biology, showing unified principles of self -organization [28]. Note, that mitochondria probably has a key -role in this complex behavior of living objects, because the non- mitochondrial respiration scaling factor is lower, ( = 2/3), characterizing the simple surface- volume ratio in these processes, [29] , however the robust ca t- egory of living systems is scaled by complex manner [30] . Different conditions modify the power function [31], forming various universality classes by self- simi- larity. Self-organized processes are widely investigated in reactions (pr e- cipitations, phase -transitions, aggregations, nucleation, growth, etc.). The theory of phase -transition involving simultaneous random nucleation and growth was pioneered by [32] , Johnson, Mehl [33] Johnson revised later by others, [35] , [36]. It describes the kinetics of phase transformation when nucleation is sp a- tially random. The JMAK theory and one of its formulation called Avra mi-func - tion (AF) were introduced for solids to serve as mathematical models of different biological processes, [37] [38] and even for DNA replication process, [39] too. Experimental data [40] [41] [42] [43], prove a certain universality of the Avr a- mi-equation to describe the real processes, which could be a useful tool for fu r- ther research, [44] . It is generally useful for studying different processes with no known special system parameters, similarly to the critical phenomena of the physical -laws near to the phase -transition [45]. The t At t = + = (1) where t is the elapsed time of the process, depends linearly on the nucleation rate and on the growth -rate by the power of three. The so called \"Avrami co n- stant\" ( n) was introduced in simple model n = 4, and so originally in solids it was considered an integer [47] . It is interesting, that the space -fractal dimension O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 Medicine dependens on AF [48] . Here n value is not necessarily a n integer and depends well on the processes that are described by it. The fractal dimension, and the power -law of self -similarity are tightly connected [49] . Experimental data show, that the progression of many reactions in biology also follow the A(t) AF with various, non -integer characteristic constants [40] . It was ob served universally in different processes from a wide range of structural and dynamical situations of living systems [44] [50] [51] [52]. The non- equilibrium thermodynamical formalism could be applied to a self - organized system of malignancy in space and time [53]. Cancer breaks the net- work of normal cells , while the cooperative tissue harmony changed to non- co- operative competitiveness forms a new complex structure non -linearly far from the thermodynamic equilibrium. Cancer could be described as a dynamical phase transition from healthy to cancerous [54] , described with a clear analogy with phase transitions in a lifeless nature. Starting with an avascular situation and forming a dormant microscopic cluster [55], it continues to develop new ang i- ogenetic formations by epithelial -mesenchymal cell transition, induced by bio - electromagnetic forces, [56] . Tumor leaves the dormant state by an allometric transformation [57], and the previously almost undetectable phase becomes tr a- ceable. An Avrami -like function in time describes its development [58] . This idea was used to show the validity of Avrami description [59] and extended to metastases while studying the transition of avascular appearance of tumorous clusters [60] to vascular phase, which bases the dissemination of malignant cells, [61]. Metastases are developed by a first order phase transition of cells from non- cancerous to metastatic ones [62] . The development of this new phase needs a great amount of energy. The energy dissipates in the system, produc es a high rate of entropy development. The general transport structure (blood -vessel network) of the tissues forms fractals by allometric scaling, including the angiogenetic processes in tumor formation [57]. In oncological applications, the available metabolic transport and the fractal dimensions of the angiogenetic network determine the average survival of a tumor. The average survival of the tumor -cells shortens by the growing fractal dimension of the transport network and modified by some kind of an alimentation of the tumor, [63] . The tumor -growth follows the universal law of scaling [64] , which can be used in cancer -research [65]. The dynamics of the evolution of cancer produces various phases of the growing structures due to the genetic instability, leading to phase transitions [66] . Tumor development operates near the threshold of phase transition, destabilizing the actual structure, making it highly heterogeneous [67] , producing a large variety of random mutations [68] , finding the most optimal conditions of the further proliferation. Their development is based on competition, a \"fight\" for the ind i- vidual survival. The optimal strategy is well known in the game -theory [69] where the mixed -strategy forms Nash equilibrium in the non -cooperative game by ran- dom variation behind [70] . This situation is typical Szasz, A . Szasz International Journal of Clinical Medicine tions [71], where the cooperation emerges despite the selfish, non -cooperative individual participating cells [72] . Our objective in this article is to find a parametric description of overall sur- vival, which fits the self -organized processes and able to show the inherent i n- formation of survival measuremen ts of cancer patients. 2. Method Most of the survival analyses in medical evaluations use the Kaplan -Meier (KM) non- parametric estimator [73] [74], used for incomplete observations. KM is useful to examine the probability of lifetime and effectivity of the chosen trea t- ment for such lethal diseases like cancer. The computed probab ility of an event in a definite point of time: Probability at actual time of observation Number of participants living Number of participants died or at the strat of observation censored during the of observation Number of participan =ts living at the strat of observation KM estimator is defined by multiplying the above described successive prob a- bilities by any earlier point of time obtaining the final estimate: ( ) 1 ii tt idKM tn = (2) where id is the number of deaths at the time it; it is a time when at least one death had happened in the examined cohort, and in is the number of individ u- als known to survive (not censored, exists in the study) at time it. Some mo d- ifications were done in tails (pessimistic approach when short -tailed) [75], and optimistic approach, a fat -tailed [76] is in use having a difference in survivals at the end of the trial. The best method for mining data could be when the non -parametric KM su r- vival plot can be parameterized. The description of s urvival curves by parametric distribution function is a long -term effort [77] allowing the optimization of the information from the measured dataset. For the correct parametrization, we have to take an overview on the scientific facts that we can use for the research of the optimal parametrization. The most important result available is the param e- tric solution that is connected to the spatiotemporal self- organization a nd the self-similarity of developed structures. The parametrization of survival measures we use to the universality of life consideres its self- organized self- similarity. The progression of life involves non - linear and non- equilibrium thermodynamical cons equences including the fractal description and similar processes of the phase transitions in non -living systems. For calculating the survival- time, let T be the stochastic variable defined on the set of individuals, (lifetime). The lifetime distribution function is the probability O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 321 International Journal of Clinical Medicine of the lifetime being less than or equal to t, namely ( ) { }Lp t PT t= (3) Thus, the survival probability distribution (survival function) can be defined by the probability of the T lifetime being higher than t, that can be expressed in the form of ( ) ( ) { } 1SLpt pt P T t= = > (4) The density function of the lifetime distribution function is the ( )( )d dLptftt= (5) probable density, therefore, the average lifetime is: ( ) ( )00ddS T t f tt ptt= = (6) Introducing the h(t)dt death rate is the probability that in case of a t length survival time, death occurs at ( t + t) and ( h(t) is the \"hazard function\" or \"death rate\"). Therefore, the probability is that in the case of a t length time su r- vival, death occurs at ( t S Spt pt p t t ftttht t t t tpt pt pt pt += = (9) or ( )( )eHt Spt= (10) Biological systems are strictly self- organized [78]. The inherent property of the living objects is the self -organizing and the consequent self -similarity of the living structures [11] , which could be the basis of the proper parameterization of survival. Taking the self -similarity into consideration, death -rate (failure rate in (8)) must be a self -similar time function [44], mirrored by a scaling like: ( )ht t= (11) Its self- similarity is obvious because it gives the same function mt mt m t m h t = = = (12) O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 322 International Journal of Clinical Medicine The survival probability distribution function from (9) and (10) is: ( )( )0deth Spt= (13) The ( )1 0d1t Ht t += =+ (14) survival (13), we get: ( )1 0d 1eet t Spt + + = = (15) Introducing 1 0 and 1nntn = = + (16) Hence: ( )0ent t Spt= (17) which has two parameters for one curve, 0t, is the scale parameter, which is the natural scale of the time -function variation, and n is the shape parameter. Co n- sequently, the lifetime distribution function ( )Lpt , by (3) and (4) is the well - known AF ( A(t)) or cumulative form of W t pt= = = = (18) with additional conditions 0t, ( ) ( ) 0 At W t= when 0t<. The inverse function, when the t-time is calculated from a given (19) There are various parameters characterizing the WF from the time of deve l- opment independently. The shape parameter of WF is usually 1n>, following a sigmoid curve, which form is a psychometric function [79] anyway. In cases when 1n the survival is a simple exponential function with rapid decrease by the decreasing of n. The cumulative Weibull distribution (Weibull function, WF) is highly un i- versal and represents all the features described in the introduction above. The formal identity of WF with the AF in JMAK inherently involves the phase tra n- sition approach, and the mechanics follow the tumor kinetics, [59] . The AF and WF have been used for a long time for survival/reliability descri p- tion. Originally Weibull 's statistics was developed to describe the fracture of brittle materials [80] , [81] and to calculate the probability of the damage -free survival of the given material. It can be derived from geometric scale invariance (fractal organized structures) by physical principles, [82] in mechanical mills. It is frequently applied in the study of mechanical fatigue and failure [83] . O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 323 International Journal of Clinical Medicine The fit of WF to the non- parametric K M is completely rigorous when a stric t- ly homogeneous cohort of patients is investigated, with unified equivalence of the participating individuals followed until the decease or censoring. This grou p- ing selection apparently limits the applicability of WF. T he parametrization of the aging and natural death has no such grouping selection, it is related to every human being and their survival. The epidemiological studies in gerontology r e- fer to the Gompertz -distribution, [84]. The Gompertz function (GF) is a fun c- tion of time. When G(t) represents the number of individuals in the given period of time, t, 0G is the number of subjects at the start of the counting bt= (20) The parameters a and b are positive and a is connected to the growth, while b is connected to the displacement in variable t. GF is also a double -parametric function, similarly to the n and 0t in WF. During the historical development of WF, it has started to characterize the aging of the non- living components and machineries (reliability) while the GF was initially developed for the ageing of living objects [85] . By developing the statistical methods, soon, both the Weibull and Gompertz distribution have started to be applied for description of tumor -development and cancer -death. The comparison of the two distributions shows that the best fit of GF is ( 9.03a= , 2.58b= 00.04t= ); (261 3.6 10r=\u00d7 , SE 0.002= ); where SE is the standard error of the regres- sion estimate minimizing the sum of squares of measured and estimated data - pairs. Due to their applicability, the Gompertz and Weibull distributions are both commonly used in biological and engineering reliabil ity investigations [86] , [87]. The study of Gompertzian distribution for tumors supports a hypothesis that the fractal structure weakens and, in the end, it disappears by the growth of the tumor [88]. In general, the tumor -growth follows a universality, [64] [89], which prefers to use the WF. The clear fitting of allometric scaling by the fractal stru c- ture of the tumor [64] shows not only the tumor growth but the validity of the allometry in the growth of the axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer [90]. In consequence, we choose to use the WF for modelling the KM plot of the overall survival. The Gompertz distribution could be obtained by the reduction of the gener a- lized exponential Weibull distribution [91], which formulated in a more general form, proposing to derive both distribution from one single [92] and it is applied for survival data with pretty good results. The GF does not satisfies the self -similarity (formulated in (11)), and ther e- fore, it is not in harmony with self- organizing biological dynamics, whic h is a certain character of the harmonized biological development, [2] . This might be the reason, why the WF describes the intrinsic causes of age- related mortality O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 324 International Journal of Clinical Medicine better (following the homeostasis in the healthy aging process) while the Gom- pertz distribution reflects the extrinsic factors [93]. Due to the self -similarity of WF, we expect, that the self -organized biological development of tumors intri n- sically developing in a healthy environment from where it derives, prefers the WF to describe the KM in malignant diseases accurately. It is a further support for the primary import ance of Weibull distribution, that it is derived from the ontological law, and so it is directly connected to the self- organized structure of the living matter [28]. The self -similarity, as the basic fingerprint of self-orga - nizing is not valid in Gompertz distribution. The \"mystery\" of Gompertz fun c- tion is probably the equilibrium between the predictable and unpredictable (cha o- tic) dynamisms, [94] . Contrary to the exponential origin of GF, the self -simi- larity (power function) of WF's origin hypothesizes some parallels with the op- posite pictures of fractal -like organizations an d general scale- free (small -words, [95]) large networks (exponential function). Despite the structural preference of WF, GF also fits well to allometry, represented by power -function [96], shown in the development of rats [97] . Although WF fits very well to the growth function of the general ontogenic model, using the data for rat [98] ( 20.99965 r= , SE 0.949= ); same result (20.99967 r= , SE 0.884= ) for the same allometric curve. The difference is negligible in this regime of d e- velopment. In the case of animals with larger masses, the difference is also not significant. It is subtle, favoring only the WF for the description of the best r e- gression fit to the allometric scaling result, using the available data from [98] . (The best WF and GF fits is successfully applied to the living processes as the psychological function [99], describing the sensing processes well in connection with Weber -Fechner law [100] , establishing psychometry by WF [86] and WF is also successfully used for clustering gene e x- pression [102] . WF describes the non -parametric KM plot with appropriate accuracy in ge r- ontol ogy [103] [104] . A mathematical link of natural death -rate, aging and co m- plexity is a fundamental tool of lifetime estimation lnn tt ) to describe the natural death at the end of life. Cancer -death was also described by WF with time -dependent shape -factor, using a similarity between the fracture survival of brittle materials and the spe- cific survival characteristics of a cohort of cancer patients [107] [108] . In this model the shape factor linearly depends on the time and gives surprisingly acc u- rate fit to the data from the cancer -registers. Due to its self -similar behavior, fractals could be used for modeling cancer [109] , and the KM survival plot divided significantly by fractal dimension shows the prognostic value of the fractal analysis well [110] . Consequently, it is possible to evaluate the various images in oncology by the fractal structure and these i m- ages can be characterized by Weibull distribution as well [111] . O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 325 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Due to the self -similarity, the parametric distribution generally fits well with the KM plot, and so it is successfully used in oncology [112] [113] . The applic a- tion of the parametric WF approximating the survival curve is a standard ap- proach for the evaluation of clinical trial data, and so it is established theoret i- cally and practically, [34] [86] [99] [114] . Comparing various parametric fits to KM survival plot, the WF was the most accurate [115] . The model was used to analyze the prognostic factors of the survival of c ancer patients, and it was proved in a large retrospective analysis with n = 746 gastric cancer cases, [116] . Summarizing the above, the self -organizing and the self -similarity are unive r- sal laws fingerprinted in the fractal description and can be described by cumul a- tive Weibull distribution. This un iversality of WF is applied to parametrize the KM plot. Due to the universality, the WF parametric regression fits the KM plot with sufficient accuracy and so determines the KM curve by two parameters ( 0t and n). On the regression, a considerable improvement could be made by smoo - thing the KM with the hazard data (patients at risk), [117] . Other improvements of the bivariant fit are also available [118] , but for simplicity we use the original WF fit to KM insisting on showing the roots that are the universality of WF in survival invest igations. Further smoothing and corrections are additional to the clearly established basis, due to the deviations in real cases. 3. Results The characterization of WF has four special points, the value at 0t, the mean, the median and the inflection point. The median, the mean and the mode (the maximum point in the distribution function is an inflection point in the cum u- lative curve) are calculable from the parametric formulas, ( ) ( 2 1mean e d 1 1modenS xn S n Spt t pt t xxtn npt tn= = = + = (21) The corresponding probabilities when 01t= and n = 2, are 0.5, 0.607 and 0.456 for the median, mode and mean, respectively. The quantile of this function is 0.632 and it independent from n value. Limit ( )0 lim 0nSpt= through a step-function at t = 0, while ( ) limnSpt is a step function at 0tt=, (Figure 2). All the noteworthy points are proportional to 0t, so the natural units of the elapsed time are 01t=, when the single n-parameter defines the function. The hazard function (9) is constant when n = 1 (or = 0, which means the parameter has no effect on the hazard), and it is increas ing and decreasing when n > 1 (meaning the event is more likely to occur) and n < 1, (meaning the event is less likely to occur), respectively. The limit ( )0 lim 0nHt= is a step -function at t = 0, and ( ) limnHt is a step function at O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 326 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Figure 1 .

The inflection point marks the mode of the distribution, which is the most fre- quent probability. When 01t= is chosen, it will be the unit of the elapsed time. (a) (b) Figure 2 . The limits of (a) survival ( ( )Spt ) and (b) hazard The various parameter -pairs of WF are shown in Figure 3 . The inflection point in the WF (cumulative Weibull distribution) is the mode of the probability distribution function. It is the most likely appearing value in the Weibull probability distribution function. The inflection in the WF of su r- vival divides the speed of developing death, which reaches its maximum at this point and the transfer of inflection is slowed by the elapsed time. Programming calculates the result or makes it graphical ( Figure 4). This makes it possible to generate the Weibull fit for the Kaplan -Meier routinely by knowing its median and mean values. O.

(a) example: 0at and 0bt are the time curves from median and mean expressions, respectively. Their common point (crossing) gives the 0t and n parameters of the WF, which \u2014in this case is when the mean is 130 and median is 100, the 0137t= and 1.16n= ; therefore, it looks like this: ( )1.16 0 137eent t tWt = = . (b) a few s o- lutions to show the trend of the graphical results. The data at the particular points vs. n are shown in ( Figure 5 ). The mode changes rapidly in the interval of n (1, 2), so reading accurately is difficult, therefore the median and mean are proposed to reestablish the entire WF. However, in a value of 3.35n at 01t= the values of mode, mean and m e- dian are practically identical, so the WF could be characterized with a single p a- rameter. Increasing 0t does not lead to a significant change of the situation, so in virtually every case, we may approach WF only with one parameter over 3.35n . In conclusion from the above, the parametric regression KM is universally determined by two parameters (the shape parameter ( n) and the scale parameter (0t) of WF), due to the basic behaviors of living processes: their self- organizing O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 328 International Journal of Clinical Medicine (a) (b) Figure 5 . Characteristics by shape- parameters at 01t=.

When a clinician tries to describe the main info of the KM survival curves, takes the median value of survival, as a significant parameter charact e- rizing the actual survival result into account. This is, in fact, an automatic ch a- racterization by a single parameter of the non -parametric estimation. However, the median alone cannot characterize the long tail of the KM plot; it does not consider the history of the patients in the remaining second half of the cohort, which could be essential for measuring the \"cured\" [119] anyway. Studying the median alone disregards the real measurable success at the end of the study. Correcting this \"mistake\" the average (mean) of the KM non -parametric distr i- bution is considered. The mean is affected more by the \"tail\" of the distribution, so it gives a m ore accurate idea on the cure rate. The median is more responsible O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 329 International Journal of Clinical Medicine for the information about the rapidity of the loss of the patients, while the mean has more part in the information about the length of the effect of the high -success patients, Figure 6 . Sometimes the inflection of KM is studied too, having the highest death -rate in the study at that point. All are important for characterization, but two of them are independent, and the third could be calculated from the chosen two. The distribution curve must be characterized by two parameters at least. Two of the three noteworthy points (median, mean, inflection) of the KM may parametrize the non -parametric plot. Measuring or guessing these charac- teristic points (mainly the med ian and mean) is a standard comparison of the KM-plots and usually accepted as the result of the actual study. These points r e- ally characterize the non -parametric distribution and give the possibility to p a- rametrize, so, in fact, this is a \"hidden\" paramet erization of the KM plot by WF. A simple approach of Weibull fit could be made on the KM plot by its deriv a- tive in the 0t reference point, which is proportional to -n. (The de rivative there is exactly ( )0 00d 10.368deWt nn t tt= .) Therefore, the parametric evaluation could be checked well at the 0tt= point, and the complete parametrization could be established approximately by the value of the 0t point and the value of its slope, Figure 7 . The regression could be simplified to linear by ntntt= = (22) The regression is shown in Figure 8 . Note, that this approach is less precise than the function fit, because the double logarithm suppresses the accuracy in real KM fit. However, the obvious deviation of the regressions from the measured OS is in Figure 6 . The mean and median changes according to the n and 0t parameters. Parab o- la fits rather well, which connects the two parameters ( n and 0t) at different medians and means. O. Szasz, A .

The universal WF idea offers regression fit to the KM for a group of patients who have had an event or have censored until the end of the study. This is, of course, limited in real trials. We consider any chosen cohorts inhomogeneous because of the huge variability of living conditions. A homogenous group of patients, which has identical individuals could never be selected. However, there is a possibility to divide the cohort to subgroups wi th very similar patients, and fit WF on these independently, while the measured KM is, of course, a sum of the results of all the subgroups.

Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 331 International Journal of Clinical Medicine By taking extra care to have a homogeneous cohort, at least the time- limit of the study forms a group from patients, who had no event (or are not cen sored). The \"remaining\" patients in the given treatment study have the highest benefit from the performed treatment or they were in a definitely different condition when they were selected into the cohort. We call this group \"remained group\" (RG) due to th e lack of proof of complete recovery. However, this group is sometimes regarded (incorrectly) as a cured fraction (according to the endpoints of the study). In a rigorous approach the disease -free survival (DFS) has to be compared with the matched healthy control group, and the cure -rate on this comparison must be decided [120] . An alternative way to determine the group of \"cured\" patients and the connected value of the \"cure\" time is when the hazard rate of the studied group corresponds to the hazard in the general population [121] . When it fits, we may talk about the real cure rate, which does not mean that an event cannot happen due to independent reasons from the investigated disease. The KM curve in an RG situation obviously does not fi t to the strict WF, which must be decreased to a zero cumulative probability. When the ratio of the remaining individuals is RG RGc nN= , the KM plot can be approximated with reasonable accuracy by the weighted sum of two WFs. In the RG frac tion, the time -parameter is longer than in the fraction of patients having an event RG R G Wt c c = + (24) In this case, the composition of the time -parameter of the long survival WF fit is practically infinite (compared to the time (25) In this case, the correction by a survived fraction of the patients is constant. Denoting the constant correction c, the plot will be c = + (26) The variation of c shows different fitting functions, Figure 9: Characterization of the curative effect of the treatment making a WF fit to the non- parametric KM survival could be done with the Shannon -entropy.

When an event has a lower probability to occur, it carries more information, so its Shannon- entropy is lower than the effects of the frequent occurrence. The expectation of a random variable is characterized by this entropy, so by this meaning it is a direct analog for the entropy definition in physics (statistical thermodynamics). When the informational entropy decreases, (its change becomes negative) it means that the probability distribution differs from the uniformed distribution, concentra t- ing to some data. The entropy growth in physics usually happens when the system approaches equilibrium, while in pdf the increase of entropy shows a lack of information when the average rate of information produced by the stochastic source of the O. Szasz, A . Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 333 International Journal of Clinical Medicine data decreases. The Shannon entropy (28) measures the diversity of probability distribution function (pd f) behind WF (in fact the derivative of WF).

The division of the entropy of a shape and scale (time) dependent part gives a possibility to define the role of these parameters. While the scale (time) parameter increases the Shannon -entropy monotonically, the shape parameter ( n) after a maximum at , decreases the entropy, showing an increasing amount of information about the death (decreasing info about being alive) of the participants in the cohort. The growing shape -factor n definitely worsens the survival over the value , while the growth of the scale (time) fa c- tor gives longer survival expectations. The Shannon entropy could be calculated real -time t (( )0,ShS nt ) and also could be relative to 0t time, meaning, that the time is measured in 0t units (( ) ( )0 ,1Sh Sh S ), estimating the self -time. A higher entropy value means a higher uncertainty of death (therefore, a lower certainty of being alive). We ex- pectthe gro wth of Shannon entropy of the parametric probability distribution function in cases of better results of the treatment. 4. Discussion To demonstrate the parametrization, we use a large number of patients (1180 individuals), with various tumors treated by n umerous standard therapies, but having one thing in common: they are treated by complementary modulated electro -hyperthermia (mEHT), when the standard treatment fail to deliver the desirable results, [123] [124] ; Figure 10 .

The obvious differ- ence is due to the different meaning of fit. The parameter SE minimizes the di f- ference between the curves, while the 2r minimizes the shape difference (maximizes the similarities) of the curves. A comparison with Shannon entropy shows more certainty (less uncertainty) by about 6% in the regression by min i- mizin g SE than maximizing 2r. In the following, when we do not note the o p- posite, we use the minimal SE regression. The fit is accurate, having no more difference in any compared points of the curves than 1%, but it is not accurate enough at the end of the observed time, due to the RG group of the patients. The deviation could be less with applying the RG principle of ( 26), Figure 13. The 4.543ShS= , which is 2.5% higher, mirrors the RG part of the patient distribution. The parametric decomposition gives better fit by two WFs according to (24), Figure 14, where the r2 has reduced drastically. The result shows the responding group (response rate (RR) 48%) and the non -responding one (52%). Note, that the less -responding group could be regarded as a non -responding control -arm. The long -survival part of KM- plot has a higher entropy and shows more u n- certainty of the death in both approaches. A better fit can be achieved when we O. Szasz, A .

For an easier calculation of the WF fractions (components) of the KM -plot, we may use the logarithmic evaluation of the survivals, which modifies the grou p- ing more than the above decomposition. A linearly fit function ( )( ) ln ln Wt by ( )lnt of KM is shown in Figure 10. According to (22) it shows rather large deviations at the start and at the end of the curve, Figure 15 . The original WF fit shown in Figure 12 (a), and the linear fit from the log a- rithmic approach of Figure 15 . differs from each other, Figure 16 . The deviation of the logarithmic fit is more than double in some intervals, so the direct fit of WF to KM is more accurate. Figure 15 . The logarithmic fits of WF to KM of Figure 10.

Szasz DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115031 338 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Despite the inaccuracy of the logarithmic evaluation, it has a great advantage of guessing the subgroups of the patients by an optimal decomposing of the KM plot. The logarithmic curve on Figure 15. shows three well distinguishable parts, for which the linear is accurate, and divides the original KM into three su b- groups, Figure 17 . The WF fit to Figure 17 of the three parts of the KM is shown on Figure 18 . The logarithmic fit by (22) shows different results than the direct fit. The re a- son is simply that the logarithmic fit considers only a part of the whole curve, and fits to that, consequently the accurate fit to that part of the KM will not fit to the other parts at all, if the logarithmic curve was approached in different parts. The observed KM is, of course, considers all the patients. The overlapping fits from the logarithmic approa ch modifies the KM plot. Consequently, only the fit for or iginal KM plot has a relevance. However, the logarithmic analysis is very useful for detecting the subgroups of the patients. It became clear that the survival contains three subgroups, Figure 17. Consequently, three partitions of the KM curve ( Figure 10 ) would give a Figure 17 . The various logarithmic fits to KM of Figure 10.

This fit to KM is very accurate, the deviation remains under 0.0005 in the complete fit, Figure 19. 5. Conclusion s We had shown the applicability of the two -paramete r cumulative Weibull di s- tribution for approximating the non -parametric Kaplan -Meier plot with a higher accuracy. We had shown the universality of the Weibull approach based on the general behaviors of the living organisms, including the cancer -tissue devel op- ment. The self -organizing and self -similarity with their consequences determine the strict connection of the parametric approach well with the experimental non- parametric observations. Informational entropy allows the distinguishing of the subgroups in a general set of patients by their overall survival. We have demonstrated that applying the two -parameter WF provides a suff i- cient fit to the non -parametric KM survival curve in a real case of 1180 patients suffering in various malignant diseases. Two of the 3 characteristic parameters of the KM plot (namely the points of median, mean or inflection) are enough to reconstruct the parametric fit. In summary, Weibull parametric distribution with satisfactory refinement can accurately approximate a KM survival plot with surviving individuals at the end - point of the study.

Szigeti2, Marcell A. Szasz3 Engineering, St. Istvan University, Budaors, Hungary 2Innovation Center, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary 3Cancer Center, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary Abstract In some clinical applications in oncology randomized, double armed, and double -blind trials are not possible. In case of device applications, double -blinded conditions are nonrealistic, a nd with many times the randomization also has complications due to the high -line treatments where the reference cohort is not available ; the active \"arm\" has mainly palliative initiative. Sometimes highly personalized therapies bl ock the collection of the homogeneous group and limit its double -arm randomization. Our objective is to discuss the situ a- tions of the single arm evaluation and to give methods for the mining of i n- formation from this to increase the level of evidence of the measured dat a- set. The basic idea of the data- separation is the appropriate parameteriz a- tion of the non -parametric Kaplan -Meier survival pattern by the poly -Weibu ll fit. Keywords Single -Arm Clinical Trial, Survival -Time, Decomposition of Survival Curves, Personalized Treatment, Observational Trial 1. Introduction Survival studies most frequently use the Kaplan -Meier ( KM) non- parametric e s- timate. The KM estimator is fixed by the duration of participation in the obse r- vation. Both the start of the observation time and the end of the observation of the individual by events (censored due to death or dropped out from the cohort) are not absolute and have inexplicit values. The precariousness flows from the differences betw een real lifetime to observ ational time. We summarize the charac- teristic points of the life of a cancer -patient in Figure 1.

The time -scale of the individual participant's lifetime (Periods out of observ a- tion could be zero in any actual case, while the start of the observation could be a group of dates: the routine screening or the first symptoms and/or the first diag nosis). could be zero in any actual case. One point (start of the disease) is elusive b e- cause the real symptoms of any disease could be later than the starting point of the disorder. This situation usually happens because the observation facilities of malignant diseases are technically limited. We could have only guessed the l a- tency period, which starts with an avascular situation, forming a dormant mi-croscopic cluster [1]. When the tumor leaves the dormant state by a scaling transformation [2] , growth becomes traceable. The real survival period in this content is blurry, so the definitions of the real survival points are the sum of the observation and the post -observation period. The evaluation may concentrate on disease -related death or any deaths in the observational period, irrespective of the cause. The observation period may only contain careful watch, then the treatment, and at the end, a long follow -up too. The observation period usuall y is evaluated statistically by the Kaplan -Meier non- parametric estimates ( Figure 2). The end of observation could be decided by the endpoint of the study ( e.g. 5 y survival), irrespective of the actual diagno- sis of the patients at the end; or could be determined when all involved individ u- als have been censored or dead. In case of survival, the end could be determined when the patients of the studied group were cured and their state was declared NED (no evidence of disease). However, long ( e.g. five years) survival does not necessarily mean a cured status [3] ; a relapse of new metastases could happen in the post -observation period when in most of the cases new treatment starts. The start of the observation could be after the routine screening when patients complain (about symptoms) and the statistically valuable period starts at the first diagnosis. The latent period can be long, even years before the discovery of ca n- cer [4] . Measuring the effect of the treatment has various approaches, since having complications of the bio -variability and personal sensitivity of the treated ind i- viduals as well as the variation of the results depend s on the social background and lifestyle of the patients. Randomized clinical trial (RCT) is a commonly used study design to measure lifetime. In an RCT, the active (investigated) arm can be statistically compared to the well -randomized control group in a carefully ch o- sen, unified cohort. To evaluate a clinical intervention with the optimal possibi l- ity of RCT has ethical issues [5] [6], justification problems [7] , and cohort -forming limitations. A crucial step of valid evaluation is, of course, selecting a group of patients who share common characteristics (cohort); otherwise, the variation of the results does not allow the estimation of the effect ; discrepan cies arise because of the patients' differences and not because of the therapy itself. Forming an A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 350 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Figure 2 . The time -scale of the group of participants' life -line (The lines for periods are naturally not definite; these are ranges of time -periods that could be overlapped too. The measured KM plot is the topic of interest for clinical trials ). appropriate cohort is a complex issue. Cohort forming sometimes uses forced conditions by reaching a definite toxicity predefined by the protocol (like in high- dose chemotherapy [8]), expecting the same (unified) reaction on the stage -selected patients. The RCT approach is devoted to the application of the most appropriate treatment update and for the reference control is used from the same cohort (called control -arm). The new therapy (active arm) must show its superiority over the control in comparison. The equipoise selection into both arms is mandatory, but the two treatments could be compared by not only their positive efficacy but their side effects as well, that m ay adversely affect the trea t- ment [9] . Sometimes, in cancer treatment, a misleading (or at least not complete) eval u- ation is practiced by measuring the local control of the tumor, instead of the systemic development of the malignancy in the whole body. The problem of the overall control of the system is complicated and not even possible with imaging because of micro -metastases and such adverse effects which cause comor bidities for the patient. Therefore, parametrization would only be effective if the end - point of the study is the overall survival and the quality of life combined. Before deciding on the RCT, both sides of the balance of measured efficacy and the adverse effects must be taken into account. In case of serious diseases or terminal cases, no curative treatment is available, or further curative therapy is simply not possible because of comorbidities like organ -failure, low -blood -count, etc. Note that some con ditions limit the RCT evaluation even in the double arm construction: the false inclusion and exclusion criteria (sometime \"cherry pick- ing\"); the missing normal distributions; or the changing time series that have the same statistical momentums but their time -fluctuations differ. The data- set in the last case is out of the applicability of the usual analysis of variance (ANOVA). Furthermore, the ethical selection issues oppose the randomization, so the trial must be solved in a simple non- randomiz ed design of single arm. Due to the possible problems of RCT, some prospective clinical trials register A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 351 International Journal of Clinical Medicine the data in the single arm only. The most frequent reason is the targeted far ad- vanced disease where the conventional curative therapies have failed, and no other treatment is available except for the newly tried one. In these cases, the best supportive care (BSC) could be applied [10], like a control group wh en an active curative or palliative therapy is under investigation, and retrospectively, a historical control of the same hospital or large databases are also frequently compared to the historical data- set of the same hospital or compares to other large databases, retrospectively. There are some situations where no suitable historical control is available because of the completely new approach of the therapy [11], or the disease is so rare, that no comparison could be found [12]. Of course, we know that the single arm without a reference cannot give inform a- tion about the changes that were achieved by the therapy involved. However, it is also obvious, that the data of the interesting changes are involved in the single arm spectrum as well but are well hidden without an orientation to measure the changes. The single arm design is popular in the Phase I process when safety data is collected. The goal in this phase of the study is to determine the toxicity, the side effects and the dose with dose -escalation process. The investigation of efficacy is not included in Phase I trials. The Phase II studies concentrate on efficacy of the applied safe process [13]. When the hypothesis to be proved is clearly defined and the \"null hypothesis\" could be th e zero response, the minimum of the clini- cally relevant response should define the size of the trial contrary to the simple design where the evaluation of the data can be rather complicated due to the di f- ficulty of the missing reference for comparison, whi ch is hard anyway because of the natural biological variability. The interpretation of the results of single arm distinguish es the placebo effect or the spontaneous natural history of the disease from the actual treatment efficacy. However, the single -arm trials may be the option when placebos are unethical, and opportunities of the controlled trial are limited, due to the vast variations of the patients. For example, the advanced diseases in oncology are frequent topics of single -arm trials, due to the massive, exhausting and mostly variant protocols of failed pretreatments. The reason of the failure is usually a progressive and refractory disease, or limitations in a p- plying the conventionally proven methods due to organ- failure or a dangerous level of bloo d damages. In these cases, forming appropriate cohorts is very diffi- cult or even not possible. When a single arm study is chosen due to the certain drawbacks of RCT, we mostly apply a palliative BSC additive to the active treat- ment. One of the most important condition of such single arm treatments is that it must not worsen the results of BSC, and its worst outcome must be the ine f- fectiveness. The best indicator of this condition is the combination of overall survival time and the quality of life. 2. Methods Lifetime studies have a surprising universality by the self- organizing [14] [15] A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 352 International Journal of Clinical Medicine and consequently by the self -similarity of the morphological structures and d y- namic processes in living objects. Self -similarity has a morphological conse- quence, showing the spatiotemporal fractal structure in biological objects [16]; [17]. These ideas are forming the similarities of the species [18], which directly leads to the expected lifetime universality of well -selected cohorts. The general allometry is as wide as the cover of the mass, ranging from respirator y comple x- es, through the mitochondria, to the animals with the largest mass [19] . Due to the self -similarity, most of the biological structures and processes can be descr ibed by a simple -power function (like ( )P x ax= ), where a and are constants, and so the form of ( )Px remains only multiplicated by the co n- stant during any x: ( ) ( ) ( ) P mx a mx m ax m P x = = = . This magnification process (scaling [20]), could be followed by a few orders of magnitudes (scale -free behavior) in biosystem s. In consequence of the widely applicable universality behavior, the general o n- togenic growth [21] allows the deduction of the Weibull distribution [22], which can be used to analytically describe the non -parametric Kaplan- Meier estimate for tumors. Self- similarity drives the tumor -development, which shows the un i- versal law of growth [23] [24]. This lays the foundation of our attempt to find the reason behind the universal parametric regression for the lifetime of the p a- tients, which is supporte d by the universal law of growth of the solid tumors [25]. The extension of the Weibull model allows us to estimate the tumor -latency too [26]. We had shown the self -similarity of bioprocesses in general [27], leading us to some well -defined mathematical formulas like the Avrami equation, which has a complete formal correspondence with the function of the cumulative Weibull distribution (WF) [28]. The t wo-parameter cumulative Weibull distr bution (WF) is a good candidate for the parametrization of the KM-plot [27]. It is both theoretically and practically established for clinical applications [29] . The real challenge is how we can reveal the hidden data in the single active arm in case of the missing randomization that forms reference in double arms. We have limited possibilities for mining the available information without a re f- erence set, even though we know it well, that the information is in the data. The general self -similar behavior of the various tumors has different parametrization and so can be distinguished from each other. Consequently, the fitting to survi v- al curves gives hints on how to extract information from the single arm alone. Experimental data fit well to the em pirical data in biology as well as it has been widely investigated and proven in solid -state reactions (precipitations, phase [33] [34]. Indeed, experimental data show that many biological reactions follow the Avrami equation. It is applied universally to different processes regardless of the structure and dynamics of the system. Avrami functions are self- similar, and various comparative functions characterize the exponents [35] . The considerations of Avrami function explain the parametric approximations of the non- parametric Kaplan -Meier survival distribution ( KM) [27] . The mortality can be approached by the fitting of different distributions [36] A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 353 International Journal of Clinical Medicine in epidemiologic modeling. The most popular descriptions are the Gompertz, Weibull and logistic distributions [37]. These methods are usually used for g e- rontologic, aging mortalities, modelling the statistics of the ages of death, do not consider any particular disease or clinical t herapy involvements [38] [39] [40] distr i- butions [42]. In demographic aging, the Gompertz and Weibull functions d e- scribe different bio logical causes [39] . The Gompertz model involves a multiplic a- tive aging mortality, while it is additive in Weibull description. The multiplicativity affects the extrinsic, while the additivity the intrinsic causes in older ages. Our present modeling does not deal with aging mortality and the connected epidem i- ologic consequences. Our considerations comprise the cancer -survival, which is strongly disease and therapy dependent, so it covers the intrinsic causes, on the actual parametrization of the probability of survival. This non- aging survival discussion prefers the Weibull distribution in comparison to Gompertz, de- scribing the intrinsic self -organiziat ion behaviour of the human living organ- ism. In such advanced situations, when the malignancy is double refractory, the WF provides the best fit to the KM [11]. The cancer incidences significantly fit Weibull distribution in 18 types of malignancies [43], and s o WF is justified to describe the driver events of the tumor -building process. Extending this idea, we expect that the best fit parametrization of the survival curve could lead to the information about the hidden facts in the actual non- parametric KM plot. The approximation with a simple WF function in real cases of the KM non- parametric survival curve is not precise enough. The missing preciosity ap par- ently contradicts the WF self -organized basis. When the survival is self -organized in the same way as we observed in all the biological processes, the fitting to the non- parametric KM has to show the self- similarity, because it is entirely rigo r- ous due to the universality of the lifetime of the living systems and the growth dynamics of the tumors. The contrad iction is due to the fact that the self -similar WF only fits to strictly homogeneous patients' cohorts. WF parameters charac- terize the group of generally equal participating individuals, which is of course not acceptable. The KM represents a cohort group of patients with the equipoise of individuals made as ideal as possible, choosing explicit inclusion and excl u- sion criteria. Nevertheless, the choosing criteria in the situation when we are not able to apply RCT cannot be fixed well. The only inclusion is the failure of co n- ventional curative treatments and the only exclusion is when the patient is in such terminal stage when any extra intervention could be fatal. Due to the enormous variability of the living conditions (like social, diet, h a- bits, etc.) and bio -variability of the individuals (like genetic variability, im- mune -variability, sensing -variability, etc.), any chosen cohort has inhomogene i- ties. However, it is possible to divide the cohort into more homogeneous su b- groups than the full set of individual s, expecting that the fitting of the self -similar WF will be better by the growing homogeneity of the subgroup to which it is a p- plied. A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 354 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Usually, the groups of local responses (complete response ( CR), partial r e- sponse ( PR), no change ( NC), or progression of the disease ( PD)) come into the center of the attention automatically at the finishing of the study. We could make similar subgrouping in systemic (lifetime, survival) measurements, and WF fit them individually. The measured data is the summary of the comp lete cohort with overlapping data in the experimental non- parametric KM estimates, containing the data of all the subgroups. For simplicity, using the same su b- grouping as in local response, the subgroup of those patients who could be r e- garded is introduced as \"cured\" ( CP), the subgroup for those whom the trea t- ments helped (they as responding patients (RP), and the patients who had no benefit from the therapy as non-responding patients ( NP). The KM in the real experiment measures is only the sum of these (in the same way as in the analysis of the local response). Fit WF for subgroups and sum it for fitting are the number of patients in CP, RP and NP groups, and N is the number of patients in the complete cohort. Note, that the difference b e- tween the CP and RP groups is only in the definition, just like in the local r e- sponse between the CR and PR categories. Usually CP can be defined to the lif e- time of the healthy group of patients in an age -normalized comparison. Conse- quently, for easy categorizing, usually the CP is the long, RP is the medium and NP is the short survival. Simpler and more roboust WF regression received, when the fitting is divided into only two di fferent functions [44]. Here we define two sub -cohorts co m- posed linearly [45] [46] [47], one that the treatment had no or minor influence on (NP) and one where the treatment was KM RP N P W tc c = + (2) where the Weibull parameters denoted by ( RP) and ( NP) superscripts, according to their sub- cohorts. Due to the complete set of patients, RP RP W tc c = + (3) Using the regression with division into only two subgroups by temperature development criteria was used by others [48] where the patients included in the hyperthermia cohort were divided into \"heatable\" and \"non -heatable\" sub -groups, where the end of the study was determined by the time when the last patient was proved to be unaffected by hyperthermia. Two (responding and non-responding) or more subgroups (including the stabilization, treating a chronic disease, or other), could be introduc ed this way as well. The two -subgroup division has five parameters to fit. Looking for the only A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 355 International Journal of Clinical Medicine concentration parameter (RP cc= ), some examples look like it is shown i n Fig- ure 3 . In that special case when the RP subgroup is cured, meaning no di s- ease-specific death happen in the whole observation period (including the available follow -up time too), the ( )( ) 0e1RPn RPt t , so the lowing form: ( )( )( )01ent t KM cure c ure W tc c= + (4) According to our general knowledge in oncology, the size of the malignant tumor certainly affects the lifespan of the cancerous individuals. The ratio of the actual basal metabolic rate (basal energy consumption) of the malignant lesion ( )Et to the healthy one 0E with the same volume modifies the survival di s- tribution ( ( )SPt ) which modifies the simple Weibull -related distribution as fol- lows [24] : (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 3 . Examples of the fitting curves at various c -values, where (a) equal by a 20% increase of the time -factor in Journal Clinical Medicine ( )( ) 00exp .n SEt tWtEt= (5) The modification of (5) can be interpreted as the change of the 0t, and the scale factor of the Weibull function: ( )( )1 0 00 0expn nEt tt t WtEt = = (6) Consequently, the scale -factor of WF (the time -factor of survival fit) contains the information about the tumor -growth in the way it was shown in (6). The original Weibull -based parametric approach of KM survival curve from the 0th stage gives a reference to the 0E value. On this basis we study the changes of the two Weibull -parameters by fitting the cumulative distribution curve to the hypothetical choice of the survival stu- dies in different stages of the disease, which is directly connected to the inclusion criteria of the study. Also, we follow the change of parameters by the endpoint of the studies fitting to the finishing conditions. The mathematical fit of the curves uses the least square method by digital stepping of the functions in large number ( n > 1000) steps and optimizing the square of Pearson parameter (maximize) and also the sum of squares of deviations (minimize). We used two software supports: the Excel (Microsoft 365) and the MathCad 15. 3. Results Using the hypothesis, that the self -similar WF follows the real bioprocesses in survival, the effect of the malignancy staging at the first diagnosis could be fo l- lowed with the Weibull fitting method, hypothesizing, that the staging strongly correlates with the time of the first actual diagnosis in the same cohort of p a- tients. Diseases discovered earlier have lower stages than the ones diagnosed lat- er. First, we are dealing with the survival curves of the patients in the control arm (reference arm, which in principle could be placebo as well), so the trea t- ment modific ation will be considered later. The start of the treatment is not immediate. Even the most accurate and modern detection methods do not allow the diagnosis in a latent state. The ear-liest time when the fi rst diagnosis can be made is only after the dormant (untr a- ceable) period of the disease. The traces of the disease cannot be detectable by imaging (due to its lower sensitivity), but some blood -test could detect the signal of disseminated circulation cance r cells or its parts. Overall Stage Grouping uses stages 0, I, II, III, and IV to characterize the progression of cancer [49]. Stage 0: when the cancerous cells are observed very locally without an observation any-where else ( carcinom a in situ); Stage I: cancers are well localized; Stage II: ca n- cers are locally advanced and affect the sentinel lymph node or nodes only in one side of the tumor; Stage III: cancers are regionally advanced, the affected lymph -nodes are around the tumor; Stage IV: cancers have distant metastases. WF function could extrapolate the undetectable period from the fittings to the A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 357 International Journal of Clinical Medicine actual clinical stage of the tumor [25]. The e xtrapolation of Weibull regression considers the time when the study starts, which is of course later (earliest detectable stage after dormancy) than the start of the tumor -process. The space -resolution of the most frequent imaging methods in clinical practice resolves the tumor in a 10 2 m range, which is about 1 cm3 volume, having already billions of tumor -cells. Supposing a cluster contains 30 cells (~3 cells in a diameter) and supposing it takes 100 days to dou ble its size, the tumor will be in the preclinical (latent) state for approx. 8 years, without the existing malignant tumor being observable, but we assume the self- organized grow th during this time- period too. Considering the basic survival curve from the start of the malignant behavior even from a single \"renegade cell\" [50], the WF describes the tumor develo p- ment including the dormant period until all the patients deceased or censored, (we obtain (7 ): ( )( ) 0enb bt t bWt = (7) Following the staging of the tumor status with WF when the diagnosis is based on the development of the malignant lesion stagesin i i S iEt tWt iE t== (8) Hence, according to (6), the measured ( ) in subsequent stages )1 00 0 0exp I, II, III, IV stagesi in n i i i iEt tt t Wt iE t = = = (9) Let us denote the time when the tumor is observed like in carcinoma in situ, by 0T. Due to the supposed continuity of the tumor -growth from the latent to the observable stage, the WF fit could follow triple parametrization to the KM non- parametric estimate. In this case a location parameter is added to the shape and scale parameters: ( )( )0 0 0 0 0 en tT tWt+= (10) This gives a \"truncation\" possibility of this basic (Eq uation (7), hypothetical) overall survival plot (Figure 4). Following the complete survival until the last event (or censoring) in the st u- died group of patients, the start of the study will be at the shifted time, which determines the truncations of the basic WF to its parts ( Figure 5). The survival studies of different stages could be regarded as studies in sh ifted time (iT), starting the observation of the patients (first diagnosis) a certain time later than the guessed start (stage 0) of the malignant process. The new start is of course regarded as a new study, considering again 100% of the patients who are involved in this stage, with a probability of 1. The truncated curves ( Figure 5) considered as the new studies, that could be WF fitted with modified parameters. A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 358 International Journal of Clinical Medicine (a) (b) Figure 4 . A hypothetical stage grouping of overall survival. 0: carcinoma in situ; I: well -localized lesions; II: -node; III: regi onally advanced, affected lymph -nodes; Stage IV: distant metastases. Parameters of the original WF are n = 2, t0 = 316. (a) cut by stages, (b) various parts are color ed. Screening could be misleading for survival evaluations because sometimes the elongation of overall survival with a certain time is an addition to the differences between the first diagnosis [51] and the overall survival. We expect that the ea r- lier discovery of the tumor extends the survival by more than the time difference between the first diagnosis and the discovery of the symptoms. Consequently, a certain change of the scale factor ( 0t) does not consider any treatment in the truncated periods due to the obvious shortening of the survival when we trun-cate the constant WF function. Of course, despite the unchanging type of the tumor, there is no guarantee for the constant shape -factor of survival in various stages. The change of the tumor -size changes the micro - and macroenvironment A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 359 International Journal of Clinical Medicine (a) (b) (c) A. Szasz et al.

Note, that normally different tumors can be detected in different stages. For example, most of the breast and cervical cancers are d e- tected in the stages 0 or I, while lung cancer is usually detected in stage III or IV, depending on the observed symptoms or the accident screening without ind i- cated complaints of the patient. Due to the developing technical conditions, the complete process depends on the hi storical time of the screening. Considering iT, the shift for the studies in subsequent stages, we get: ( )( ) 0eni i itT t iWt+= (11) 0T is the start of the observational period: optimally the immediate treatment, or at least the watchful waiting (watch and wait, WAW period); when the treatment cannot be decided yet. For simplicity we consider the studies as time -to-event (TTE) data, where time is denoted from a starting point to a ce r- tain event, such as death. When the end of the study fixed differently, we must use the fit shown in (2). All studies start as new one, of course, there is no kno w- ledge about the unmeasured early treatments; c onsequently, survival probability at the start of the treatment is 1, irrespective of when it started. We show the lat-er starting points in the time -line of the disease in Figure 6. We start counting the elapsing time from iT, by time- shift in (12). The com- plete time- scale is shifted by iT value. The number of patients at the starting of the trial is considered 100% for KM, consequently, the truncated \"remains\" must be normalize d to 1 to be able to fit with WF fitted. Usually the cancer in 0T does not cause symptoms for the patients. When the symptoms appear, and a A. Szasz et al.

(b) is the same as (a), but WF is optimally fitted to the new conditions, therefore the shape parameter decreases. patient recognizes the problem, it is usually in a later stage, when a higher nu m- ber of cancer cells are already present, or even when they have already been di s- seminated from the local site. The WF fittings to the truncated \"remains\" (not showing the carcinoma in situ 0th stage), are shown in Figure 7 . Calculation of the shape scale factors was made when the shape kept being constant (meaning the disease is the same in all the studies, irrespective of its starting time). Anot h- er calculation showed an optimal Weibull fit, when both th e scale and shape factors changed. The idea is that in spite of the same disease, the late start met different conditions of the disease from the in-time beginning. The curves in Figure 7 could be considered as the start of the treatment in various stages (or TNM state) of the disease. The in and ( ) 0it parameters have A. Szasz et al.

The logarithmic dependence on the iT late start time in Figure 8. In reality, the real KM curve could be decomposed to at least two components like it is shown in (2). An example is shown in Figure 9 , where the disease is characterized by the same shape factor, only the scale factor changes from 1 y (non- responding) to 10 y (responding) situations. When the later start of the study is linearly changed we assume linearity of the decomposition factor too. The form of Figure 9 shows the general figures of the comparison of studies started in different stages of the same malignant disease well. The late (at a more serious stage) start of the treatment is not the only chal- lenge in the evaluation. Another common challenge at the KM evaluation is the A. Szasz et al.

The actual decomposition factors the study. Most of the clinical studies have limited time for fo l- low-up, so they are usually finished before all invol ved patients are deceased or censored, and they do not force the TTE condition. At the end of the study, a certain group of patients remains (patients at further risk, PFR), or patients are completely cured (PCC). Identifying the PCC group in the practical applications is very unprecise, and by definition, the PFR at five years point regarded as PCC. However, there are doubts about this strict limit [3], so we use the PFR only, without declaring the PCC. The end -time -point of the study is the preplanned A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 364 International Journal of Clinical Medicine goal, and the patients in the PFR group are censored at this point. This time -limit causes a certain early truncation of the hypothetical overall -survival curve. The hypothetical curve fit to KM is WF when the study goal is TTE; so it would be continued to the complete end (all patients deceased or censored, no patients are at risk). The finish -times (iF) define the PFRs in actual points, when N patients were involved in the study: 0expn iiPFR F Nt= (1 2) where the iPFR values are patients that are alive (they are at risk, belonging to the actual PFR) at the early finish time when the actual study ends. When the study finishes before all events happen at iF, the patients at risk is iPFR , and the number of events (loss of patients due to death or censored) until this point will be: ( i N PFR ). The finish of the study (lastF) is when a single patient r e- mains at risk ( 1 PFR=), and censored from the initial set of N individuals, 1 01lnn lastFtN= (1 3) According biostatistical theory [52] [53], we expect the death of the last patient by the time of the average survival of the actual study is after the trial is closed. Consequently, the hypothetical comple te length of the study would be 1 011ln 1n endFtNn = + + (1 4) The early finished studies, when a certain number of patients remain in risk are shown by an example in Figure 10. The studies finishing early have a slight shift in 0t when elongating them and the number of patients at risk decrease ( Figure 11). 4. Discussion Both the two independent Weibull parameters change by inclusion criterial of staging. Both the shape and the scale factors are decreased when treatment starts later, which is natural. In case of an unchanged n shape -character, the decrease of the scale factor is less than in case of a changing n. Using (9) we get: ( )( )( )( ) 00I, II, III, IV stagesi in ni i i iEt tt t Et E iEt = = = (1 5) Expression (16) allows an approximating of the metabolic rate from the change of ( ) 0it by WF fit to various KM non- parametric estimates. Metabolic activity could be measured approximately by positron emission tomography (PET), evaluating the standardized uptake value ( SUV ) of the radiolabeled tracer A. Szasz et al.

The met a- bolic ratio, calculated by ( ) 0 0init t at the late start process above gives a quite A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 366 International Journal of Clinical Medicine accurate linear dependence from the iT late start time ( Figure 12). In this way we could also approximate the basic survival curve, when the PET is actually sensitive enough to measure cancer in situ lesions, supposing the time when the tumor starts to form in a microscopical region and its clusters are still undetectable with our present diagnostic methods. The treatment of the chosen patient cohort is expected to change the KM of the active arm compared to the control arm, which is untreated with the same protocol, and formed from the same cohort. The changes of KM in active arm will modify the WF fit, too. The measured change of metabolic rate by SUV in- dicates the effect of th e actual treatment. When the malignant tissue shows a lower metabolic rate (lo wer SUV ratio) the treatment regarded effective. The lower SUV has a longer scale parameter (0t) according to ( 17). In case of a su c- cessful treatment, the shape -parameter ( n) decreases, \" smooths\" the probability of event with a longer, heavier tail. The question is: how the situation changes by treatments in the study? The WF changes of course and the evaluation use this change to compare it to the reference (control arm) WF. There are different parametric estimations for the result. The first attempt is always the median survival, which looks undecided about the efficacy of the treatment in the measuring process. However, this si n- gle parameter is not nearly enough to see the complete picture. It is possible that the treatment is effective without the change of the median of the KM, while the distribution has a long tail; patients over the median lifetime live longer . for example Figure 13. It can happen when the mortality of the disease is very rapid, and the development of the resistance made by the treatment needs a longer time com pared to the median survival. For the decision of the efficacy we must use an information parameter from the WF, an important parameter the Shannon- entropy ( ShS) [54], as it is discussed in the first part of this series [27]. The SE parameter measures the diversity of probability density function (pdf), which is in th e case of Weibull distribution: ( ) ( ln 1Sh Sh ShtS nt S n S tnn = + += + (17) Figure 12 . The metabolic ratio (approximate SUV ratio) vs. T is late start time. A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 367 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Figure 13 . The two -survival function has the same median (=3.54). However, the survival curves are very different (11.1n= , 015 t=; 23 n=, 024 t=), which treatment is more effective? Sn n St tn= + = (18) The information source of ShS is produced by a stochastic data -source, like the probability distribution of the survival time. In the simple formulation, it refers to the amount of uncertainty about an event associated with a given probability distribution. At the probability of the survival, this directly means, that the decreasing entropy show s the increasing probability of death. The e a- siest way to decide the advantage of a treatment which changes the parameters of the WF, is with this parameter, because the survival is better when ShS is higher. It is due to the meaning of the entropy: a larger entropy means less i n- formation and a higher uncertainty of death. Visualizing it on the image of the pdf, it has more located peak when n grows, and its width is shrinking by 0t, therefore both make death more definite. The growing n and decreasing 0t both decrease the entropy, making the certainty of death higher. In the case of Figure 13, the entropies are 11.67ShS= and 22.58ShS= , consequently the survival with 2 023, 4 nt= = parameters is worse than the survival characterized by 1 011.1, 5nt= = . The entropy evaluation in the case shown in Figure 7 is presented i n Figure 14. The lower chance of survival is shown well by the decrease of the entropy with the late start times (iT). This is complete correspondence with the expect a- tions: the later cancer diagnosis decreases the prognosed survival. Interestingly, despite the more moderate decrease of the scale factor when the shape factor decreases in optimal fit, the Shannon entropy shows an advantage for these optimal WF sets, compared to the constantly fixed shape. The reason is that the patients with longer survival time are fit for the later start of the treat- ment and were selected by their other, less hazard ous conditions than the others. The Shannon entropy can be evaluated for late -start treatments (treatments in various stages of the tumo r) like that it is shown in Figure 9. The Shannon entropy A. Szasz et al.

(a) The scale factors, (b) Shannon entropy values . for non- responding patients (group A), and for responding ones (group B) is shown in Figure 15. The decrease of the entropy well shows the increasing ce r- tainty for events. The Shannon -entropy decreases the number of patients at risk linearly, due to the increasing certainty of death (Figure 16). We assume, that no extra comorbidity developed (or at least it is controlled) over the elapsed time, consequently, we kept the original two parameters (shape and scale) unchanged, regarding the same cohort of patients participated ; only their study started in different iF times. When we calculate with the developing comorbidities, then both parameters of WF will be changed in a direction that ShS decreases, indicating a higher certainty of the event. 5. Conclusion We discussed a method of data mining from the single -arm clinical study wit h- out a reference group. We studied the possibility to open the hidden information in the measured Kaplan-Meier non -parametric estimate by the composition of proper parametrization of cumulative Weibull functions. We had shown the A. Szasz et al. DOI: 10.4236/ijcm.2020.115032 369 International Journal of Clinical Medicine Figure 15 . Shannon- entro py decreases in both the non- responding (A) and responding (B) groups of the patients. The change is 10 times more rapid for non -responding group. The composite of the real overall survival (measured KM) from these components shows the entropy -change more characteristically (The evaluation is made for the KM curves in Figure 9). Figure 16 . Shannon- entropy decreases by the number WF: 2n=; 0100t= , 100N= ). changes of the parameters of the Weibull cumulative distrib u- tion by the study design, namely their dependence on the inclusion criteria (staging) and the intended end -point (finishing). We had shown that the various studies with different inclusion and exclusion criteria and different endpoints could be well descri bed by the decomposition method. The fit of these results to real studies in clinical applications will be shown in the next part of this series of articles.
