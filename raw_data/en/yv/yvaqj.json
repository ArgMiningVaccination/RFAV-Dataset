Have you ever done a detox for baby afterwards? My son was fussy and had a horrible reflux flare that we are still dealing with from his first set of shots and someone mentioned doing a detox to get rid of the nasty things in the vaccines. Just wondering if anyone has done it and what you did, did it help, etc. [Original poster's comments (1)](/post/a69515183/detox-after-vaccines?commentBy=ziM8bCGbk2NV0HTh) comments (11) - Posted 06-18-18Detox how? - Medically speaking your liver naturally detoxifies your body, that is it's purpose. Most detoxs are bogus and doing one for a baby to detox after vaccines is just plain ridiculous. Sorry. - Posted 06-18-18Get him a liver.Advertisement | page continues below - bPosted 06-18-18Absolutely not. It's not safe and would be torture. Please don't do that. Talk to your pediatrician for SAFE solutions. - Posted 06-18-18I always bathed my daughter with a small amount of Epsom salts after vaccines, and did the same with this lo. Not so much a detox, but to help them not have sore legs. It seems to help, neither of them were overly fussy afterwards and slept well that night. - p [proudtobehismommy]\u00b7 Original PosterPosted 06-18-18These are the types of things she said....

So based on this list we're left with Epsom salts bath and probiotics being the only two options for an infant. Neither will actually do any real harm so if you're really thinking of doing a 'detox' I'd go with those. I use probiotic drops to try and clear up thrush, the salts would mostly help with discomfort related to muscular pain from the injection like the PP said but can't hurt... Good luck - lPosted 02-24-20Mamamarns said:Medically speaking your liver naturally detoxifies your body, that is ...More ridiculous than injecting them with harmful neurotoxins to begin with? - lPosted 02-24-20Beanette3ontheway said:Absolutely not.

First, OP, thank you for vaccinating your child. Second, my cousin is a pediatrician and for fun, I sent him this article. Without using his exact words which were harsh, he said you can certainly dunk your kid in a salt bath and feed them yogurt if it makes YOU feel better. It won't do a thing for your child. What will, is preventing them from diseases. I think between snorts, he said something like \"just give 'em Tylenol and be happy you've made the educated choice\". To be honest, different people have different reactions to shots - any kind of shots - just like people have reactions to different things. If I do 7 shots of tequila now and so do the other ladies on this post, some of us might puke. Some might be okay. Some might sing karaoke. Some might get naked in public. Some might be hungover for two days. However, time will pass - and not much time is required - for everyone to be dandy again. "}
