Because Black Elderberry is high in flavonoid-rich compounds, it is believed to provide antioxidant protection to cells in your body that are vulnerable to free radicals and airborne elements.*3 Traditional health benefits of Black Elderberry include:* To maintain your well-being any time of the try Gaia Herbs [Black Elderberry Syrup](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/black-elderberry-syrup) or [Black Elderberry Adult Daily Gummies](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/black-elderberry-adult-daily-gummies) for immune support you can feel good about.* 3) Holy Basil As an herb for good health, [Holy Basil](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/holy-basil) has a history that traces back more than 3,000 years to ancient Ayurvedic texts.* Since then, it has been used for a variety of reasons, including to support a healthy response to stress, help maintain already-healthy blood sugar levels, promote longevity, nourish the mind, and elevate the spirit.* In addition, Holy Basil is classified as an [adaptogen](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/5-amazing-adaptogenic-herbs-for-adrenal-fatigue) \u2014 an herb or mushroom that helps balance and restore the body.*4 Traditional health benefits of Holy Basil well-being and support a positive mood.* 4) Ashwagandha [Ashwagandha](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/ashwagandha) \u2014 also known as Indian Ginseng and Winter Cherry \u2014 has traditional uses stretching back more than 4,000 years in its native India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In the Middle East, it is still used today to help promote normal sleep patterns and encourage a healthy inflammatory response.*5 In the U.S., Ashwagandha is more commonly known and used as an adaptogenic herb that can help promote balance in many different systems of the body and help the body cope with stress in a healthy way.* Traditional health benefits of busy professional or anyone dealing with ongoing stress, Gaia Herbs [Ashwagandha Root](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/ashwagandha-root) can provide the support you need to help you cope with whatever life throws at you.* 5) Oregano [Oregano](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/oregano) is native to Europe, the Mediterranean, and southern Asia, where it was \u2014 and still is \u2014 prized for the flavor it adds to many foods. Oregano was also used to preserve meat before refrigeration was available because it contains high amounts of volatile oils, including Carvacrol, Thymol, and Eugenol. Oregano has been used for medicinal purposes since ancient times.* As an herb for good health, Oregano is high in antioxidants and contains key constituents that function synergistically to support the body's natural resistance and a healthy immune response.* Traditional health benefits of Oregano include:* Experience beneficial antioxidant support with Gaia Oregano](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/oil-of-oregano).* Your well-being awaits. 6) Echinacea [Echinacea](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/echinacea-purpurea) \u2014 often referred to as Purple Coneflower \u2014 is closely related to the daisy and is a member of the Compositae family. The plant is scarce in the wild but is cultivated extensively in its native Arkansas and Missouri, as well as in North Carolina ( [home of Gaia Herbs 350-acre Certified Organic Farm](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/pages/our-farm)) and elsewhere in the United States. Echinacea is unique amongst herbs for good health in that different parts of the plant can be used to achieve different results. In fact, we've performed [extensive research](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/how-echinacea-works-making-sense-of-the-research) on the activity of the seeds, flowering tops (in several phases of development), and roots.*7 Traditional health benefits of Echinacea include:* For a harmonious blend of angustifolia, try Gaia Herbs support your immune defenses year-round.* 7) Kava It is believed that [Kava](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/kava) originated in the archipelago of Vanuatu and quickly spread to Fiji, Samoa, Tahiti, Tonga, and Hawaii (where it is called Awa). Although further research is needed, some clinical studies have shown great promise for Kava as an herb for good health that supports the healthy activity of lung tissue and the nervous system.* In regard to uses, Kava is known to have a calming and relaxing effect on the body, so it is especially helpful during periods of occasional stress.* Traditional benefits of Kava include:* If you're looking for a way to maintain a sense of calm and serenity at home, at the office, or while traveling, try Gaia Herbs [Kava Root](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/kava-root) to help restore balance to your body and mind.* 9) Rhodiola The fragrant [Rhodiola](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/rhodiola) rosea root \u2014 also known as roseroot \u2014 has been used throughout history in Iceland, Sweden, France, Russia, and Greece. This revered adaptogen became popular with the Vikings as a way to enhance mental and physical endurance and was even included in the first Swedish Pharmacopeia.* The respected Greek physician Dioscorides discussed the virtues of Rhodiola rosea root in his De Materia Medica discourse in the first century A.D., and the father of taxonomy, Linnaeus, also wrote about Rhodiola's medicinal properties in his Materia Medica (1749).*8 We use Siberian Rhodiola rosea to support adrenal gland function and to encourage a healthy response to physical, emotional, and mental stress.* Traditional health benefits of Rhodiola include:* Rhodiola is an excellent adaptogenic herb for good health and can help your body cope with stress in a healthy way.* Try Rhodiola for yourself with Gaia Maca [Maca](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/maca) is a tuberous root that grows in the high elevations of the Andes mountain range, where the native peoples use it as a staple and medicinal food.
