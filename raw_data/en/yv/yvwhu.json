Researchers in the U.K. conducted an observational study that looked at adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 947 healthcare workers across three hospitals participated in the study by self-reporting symptoms after vaccination. Of those, 265 participants had previously tested positive for the virus. Overall, those who previously contracted COVID-19 were more likely to report at least one moderate to severe symptom compared to those without a prior infection, at 56 percent and 47 percent, respectively. Specifically, those in the previous COVID-19 group were significantly more likely to experience lymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes, as well as fever, fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia. About 4 percent of participants with a COVID-19 history experienced lymphadenopathy, compared to less than 1 percent of those who weren't infected. \"This study of healthcare workers demonstrated that prior COVID-19 infection, but not long COVID-19, is associated with an increased risk of [adverse events] including lymphadenopathy following ... vaccination,\" researchers said.
