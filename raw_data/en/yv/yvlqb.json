I want so much to sleep, but my body has other plans. After a hot shower and multiple medications, my legs continue to dance. The constant ache, twitch, and kick are a rhythmic routine. But my body is [tired](http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/10/04/ms-related-insomnia-exhausting/) and has reached critical mass. Ache, twitch, kick. Ache, twitch, kick. It is a reminder that my body is not my own. As if on cue with this epiphany, I begin to cry. I am burdened by fatigue. I am weary. Yet three hours later, the rhythm continues. This is all part of my life with [secondary progressive multiple sclerosis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/ccf/media/files/Multiple_sclerosis_center/2%20Secondary%20Progressive%20MS.pdf). Large [active lesions](http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2015/12/21/ms-active-inactive-lesions-differ-levels-enzymes-drive-glucose-metabolism/) in areas that affect my legs exacerbate my [restless legs syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377168) (RLS). For those with MS, RLS, the uncontrollable urge to move one's arms or legs, is a nightmare. While it usually begins in the evening, I have RLS attacks all day. There are a few things I can do to mitigate an attack. [Prescription and over-the-counter medications](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/restless-legs-syndrome/what-is-rls/treatment.html) have been game changers. I take them around the clock, which helps to reduce the chance of an extreme attack. However, it's not a foolproof plan. In the event of an attack, I soak my legs in hot water by getting in the hot tub for 5-10 minutes. Heat isn't healthy for multiple sclerosis, but ongoing restless arms and legs are unbearable. I use a prescription compound cream along with [sedative medication](http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/klonopin-clonazepamklonopin-clonazepam/) to help me rest. I also do mild exercise and yoga. I am mindful of my [stress levels](http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/07/05/multiple-sclerosis-stress-time-choose-chill/) and lower them when needed. I dread this symptom more than any other. My legs, and sometimes my arms, are on autopilot. As I progress, so does the severity of the RLS. No amount of mental fortitude can combat the insanity. My worst episode lasted for three days. My arms and legs were caught in a rhythmic ritual. Long days on my feet often incite attacks. To mitigate them, I [create boundaries](http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/03/29/multiple-sclerosis-liberated-people-pleasing-habits/). But when I don't heed them, I pay a high price. Not everyone respects my limitations. They don't have to. However, it is incumbent upon me to abide by them. I can't always avoid an inevitable episode of RLS, but I can limit those I have. Unfortunately, I didn't succeed in doing that today. I must do better tomorrow. If you experience symptoms like what I've described, please speak with your neurologist. Those with MS need specific and continuous care. *** Note: [Multiple Sclerosis News Today](http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/) is strictly a news and information website about the disease.
