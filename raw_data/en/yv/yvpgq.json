Oxygen is absolutely critical to the life process of all living things. Oxygen E-Pure is a remarkable new product, that has a neutral pH of 7.1 and a concentration of stabilised oxygen of 150,000 ppm or 15!0 oxygen, where water has an oxygen content of 7 ppm.

Dn Hariy Goldblatt Journal of Experimental Medicine I Carbon Monoxide is so heavy in our air it robs our bodies of the ability to circulate oxygen and because we don't always effectively breath the Carbon Monoxide out, we remain tired and fatigued no matter what other supplements we take. The world is seeing a boost in oxygen products and oxygen therapy treatment centres. Also the cosmetic industry is realising the enormous value by brir io,;i0 it to the market. Oxygen E-Pure is the safest, most gentle and most effective oxygen supplement to help the body to reduce Carbon Monoxide from the blood, so one can breath back into the system oxygen levels required for abundant health. Low oxygen levels cause cells to ferment and is the forerunner to the body converting healthy cells to diseased cells. Biossential Oxygen E - Pure can be purchased at \"Fuiidies\" Fundamental Food Store 61 jonson St Byron Bay 6685 6429 / Oxygen E-Purc, it is safe to mucous nie,nbranes, it lie/ps raise the partial pressure of oxygen in the blooclf'aster than any other supplement and is more effective as little is lost to digestive processes. Average oxygen weight per volu:iie is over 15\u00b0 of oxygen that can be absorbed by mouth or stoniacii vety fast. Oxygen E-Pure helps remove Carbon Monoxide .frOm the blood fester than anything else, it enters into the conversion of Carbon Monoxide to Carbon Dioxide in 11500th of a second allowing the lungs to effectively cliniinate surplus CO 2 replacing it with the life giving oxygen to maintain good circulation and well being. Without Oxygeti E-Pure to he/p detoxij' Carbon Monoxide this molecule can continue to build up at a rate of 200 times greater than 02 until RBC dies. Low oxygen levels cause the body to ferment eile;gy and create chronic disease. ifa patient is fatigued they may iieed 5-10in/s 3 to 4 times daily in water in the first week to start the effective removal of Carbon Monoxide in earnest and kickstait recovery.

Peter Keil Peter Keil was one of the first students to complete the Southern Cross Univer- sky Naturopathy Degree in 1998, since then he's been the in-store naturopath at the Byron Plaza Amcal Chemist in the Woolies Plaza. Peter's view of wellbeing is reflected in his passionate lifestyle. He co-ordinates The Uncle Project, the Men's section of Byron Child magazine, teaches part-time at the university, does occasional stand-up comedy, is doing a research masters in self-care in depression - the list goes on. 'As a naturopath I like to take time, to get the whole story, it's the key that allows me to find the individual treatment that makes natur - opathy so successful. For a complex case I love to take the necessary time to research before I settle on the best course of treat- ment', he says. With a background in youth work, welfare, coun- selling, mental health and men's issues Peter offers a unique and rigorous health care perspective. Peter's philosophy? 'All things in moderation, including mod- eration.: Health is not a destination, it's a journey As a practising Chiro- practor for the last ten years, my own journey to achieve better health has made me assess my working concept of health care. Health care is not about 'not having pain or symp- toms' or being 'not sick'. There is a big difference between not sick and not healthy states, but both can be asymptomatic.The dis- tance between sickness and health is a person's 'adap- tive capacity'.The larger the adaptive capacity the better the prospect for health and the more external stresses the person may tolerate before becoming sympto- matic. The smaller the adaptive capacity usually means more symptoms and more treatment to get well again. Health care is often mistak- enly called 'preventative or Maintenance care', but real- isticallyit shouldn't be called maintenance until optimal health has been achieved. So what is optimal health? Is optimal health achievable for everyone? Is it the same for everyone? Whatis your level of opti- mal health, and how do you know? So next tith\u00eaSiou find yourself in pain and symp- tomatic, maybe you should contemplate these questions and decide whether you want to be pain-free or healthy. True health care is a continual process of seek- ing optimal function, bal- ance and awareness. There is no 'one right answer'. Health is a journey not a destination.

Colon Hydrotherapy The first step in any good health program should be to clean and strengthen the elimination organs. Colon hydrotherapy is the best place to begin, as the colon is the 'dumping ground' for toxins and waste from other organs of the body. The purpose of any detoxifica- tion is to remove waste and toxins that have accumu- lated over a period of years. This is how to prevent dis- ease.Toxins are absorbed back into the body when the colon is not cleansed regularly. If the elimination organs are not clean, you won't get the great results you want from your cleanse. Byron Bay Colon Hydrotherapy is here to help you do just that, in a safe, comfortable way.
