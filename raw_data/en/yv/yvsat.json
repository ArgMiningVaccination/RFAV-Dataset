IV drips at Pure Health consist of 500ml-1000ml of fluid. IV drips usually take 30-60min. IV pushes are approx. 30ml of fluid, vitamins, and glutathione with minimal hydration. These pushes take approximately 15-20min. Pure Health has four IV pushes available. Immunity Push, Executive Push, Detox Push, and Executive Plus Push. Vitamin boosters are additional vitamins added to your IV drip that you are about to receive. IV Vitamin Therapy works by the administration of vitamins and nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. It provides increased cell absorption and 100% bioavailability of vitamins via IV infusion. Booster shots get administered via intramuscular (IM) injection, so there is no GI metabolism, which also allows for increased absorption. With oral supplements, you only get about 20% absorption after filtering through your digestive system, which pales in comparison to IV vitamins. After an IV infusion, the vitamins remain in your system and maintain your levels for 2-3 weeks because it is absorbed directly into your bloodstream and bypasses the GI tract. One IM (intramuscular) vitamin booster shot is equivalent to taking one week's worth of oral vitamin supplements. At PURE HEALTH, registered nurses certified by the Board of Nursing administer our IV treatments. The frequency of IV Drip therapy is determined on a patient by patient basis and we take a customized approach to suit your individual needs. For preventative health and wellness, we recommend two to four IV drips per month to help balance out any vitamin deficiencies. "}
