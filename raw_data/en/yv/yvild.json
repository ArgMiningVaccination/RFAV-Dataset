Miasmas or evidence based research? Unsurprisingly, miasmas crumpled under heavy cross-examination and 200 years of scientific study. In a recent decision, the Federal Court considered the effectiveness and usefulness of whooping cough vaccines and accepted the scientific research over homeopathic treatments. Sometimes, the logic of our antiquated legal system actually makes sense. Justice Perry ordered a homeopathy website owner to jump through a few hoops after her Honour found that Homeopathy Plus! Pty Ltd and its director, Ms Sheffield, made false or misleading representations regarding the effectiveness of the whooping cough vaccine, and homeopathic remedies as an alternative method of prevention. Whooping cough is a highly infectious respiratory disease that is most serious in young children, particularly babies. The Australian Government Department of Health recommends children receive the whooping cough vaccine as part of routine childhood immunisation, and states that increasing vaccination coverage has dramatically reduced the incidence of whooping cough among Australian children. According to Ms Sheffield however, the vaccine is ineffective. The Homeopathy Plus! website contained statements to the effect that the whooping cough vaccine is \"unreliable at best\" and \"largely ineffective\" in preventing whooping cough, and that homeopathic remedies are a proven safe and effective alternative for the prevention of whooping cough. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) took Homeopathy Plus! Pty Limited and Ms Sheffield to court claiming they had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in breach of the Australian Consumer Law. It is a strange quirk of our bureaucracy that the ACCC was the government organisation to take the lead on this case. Surely this should be the domain of our health system, but it seems that the powers given to the ACCC have more bite. The Court agreed with the ACCC's submissions, finding that Homeopathy Plus! and Ms Sheffield engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct and made false or misleading representations by publishing these statements on the Homeopathy Plus website, as the whooping cough vaccine is in fact effective in protecting a significant majority of people from contracting whooping cough. The Court also found that Homeopathy Plus! and Ms Sheffield engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct and made false and misleading representations to the effect that there was an adequate foundation in medical science for the statement that homeopathic treatments are a safe and effective alternative to the whooping cough vaccine, when in fact no such foundation exists and the vaccine is the only treatment currently approved for use and accepted by medical practitioners for the prevention of whooping cough. \"Representations that may mislead consumers about the effectiveness of medical products or treatments are of significant concern to the ACCC,\" ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court said. \"In this case, there was a real risk that consumers might be influenced by the representations not to use the whooping cough vaccine and instead to rely solely on homeopathic products for the prevention of whooping cough. This is against the advice of medical professionals and the Commonwealth Department "}
