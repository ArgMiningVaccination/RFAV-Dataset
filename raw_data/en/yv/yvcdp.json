ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that often strikes people in the prime of their lives. The Center will bring together the Les Turner ALS Research Laboratories, the Les Turner/Lois Insolia ALS Center, the ALS tissue bank and other ALS research, clinical and education activities at Northwestern. \"The advantage of having all the research and clinical activities joined as part of the Center is to enhance collabora- tions between researchers and clinicians and, therefore, facilitate the development of new therapies for ALS,\" says Dimitri Krainc, MD, chair of the Ken and Ruth \u00bb A number of eminent scholars, educators, and clinicians have advanced from within or joined Feinberg to lead departments, centers, institutes, clinical divisions, or administrative units. \u00bb The rollout of the redesigned MD curriculum began with the Class of 2016. The goal is to make the curricu- lum more integrated and relevant to today's learners across the four-year experience while adding a degree of flexibility to address individual needs. \u00bb The now completed migration of our adult clinical practices, a major clinical arm of the medical school, to NMHC will allow us to operate more strategically. \u00bb The medical campus continues to grow with the opening of NMH's new out- patient care pavilion in October, the final acquisition of Cadence Health on Sept. 1, and the groundbreaking for the new Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital in August. \u00bb We have nearly completed a three-year, $55-million renovation of 100,000 sq. ft. of wet lab research space and have leased 70,000 sq. ft. for dry laboratories. \u00bb The school has substantially revamped the resources for clinicians to conduct clinical trials. \u00bb Northwestern University ranks 14th on a recent list of the most highly cited scientists worldwide, according to data compiled from Thomson Reuters. Of the 28 faculty on that list, six had primary appointments at Feinberg. \u00bb Numerous faculty members took on national leadership positions or received national and international awards, bringing Feinberg to the external world of academic medicine. \u00bb We launched an ambitious new Institute for Public Health and Medicine (IPHAM), a collaboration of ten centers that link scientists across Northwestern, integrating traditional medical disci- plines with public health. We have also launched a new Developmental Therapeutics Institute within the Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, re- launched the Asher Center for the Study and Treatment of Depressive Disorders in psychiatry, the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, a new Center for Rare Diseases and a Center for Sleep and Circadian Medicine in neurology, a Center for Aging and Molecular Senes- cence in medicine, and a Center for Pharmacogenomics in pharmacology. With all this progress thus far\u2014and with sustained focus, commitment, and passion\u2014I am confident in our continued quality improvement as an academic medical center. I am grateful for the thoughtful work by faculty, staff and health system employees each and every day in support of our mission. With warm regards, Eric G.

Davee Department of Neurology at Northwestern Medicine and the Aaron Montgomery Ward Professor at Feinberg. The Foundation, a partner with North- western for 35 years, has provided support that has led to significant advances from the Feinberg laboratories of Teepu Sid- dique, MD, the Les Turner ALS Foundation/Herbert C. Wenske Foundation Professor, and P. Hande Ozdinler, PhD, assistant professor of neurology. Dr. Siddique's lab has made several important discoveries in the field, including the identification of genetic causes of ALS. His work provides potential targets for drug therapy. Ozdinler's lab for the first time isolated the motor neurons in the brain's cortex that die in ALS and gave them fluorescent tags so that they can be tracked and studied. \"Northwestern scientists have made important advances in ALS research, and the foundation's generosity in the creation of the new Les Turner ALS Research and Patient Center will help generate even more significant discoveries related to this yet incurable disease,\" says Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro.Northwestern Medicine Leadership Campus News Given the complex and troublesome world of modern medical schools, the Feinberg School of Medicine can be thankful for our superb clinical partners, university support, and a strong faculty dedicated to our key missions of education, research, and clinical care. Together, we have elevated the stature of the medical school by recruiting out-standing clinical and research faculty, developing important new centers of excellence, implementing a new medical school curriculum, and migrating our adult clinical practice to Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC). Our new national brand, Northwestern Medicine, is evolving quickly and successfully as the health system continues to expand its outreach. Over the last three years we have witnessed many achievements, from breakthrough science to discoveries that advance new therapy, leadership contribu- tions to the larger world of medicine, and the extraordinary ways we are evolving patient care. With the close of the 2014 academic year, I had an opportunity to reflect on the remarkable progress we've made over these last few years, and I wanted to share some of the highlights: \u00bb 407 new faculty joined Feinberg as Clinician-Educators or Investigators - half of this group are women, and overall there are now 85 faculty from under-represented minority groups. $1.75 B $0$820 MILLION NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSLefkofsky Family Foundation Supports Innovative Studies in Cancer The Lefkofsky Family Foundation recently pledged to create the Liz and Eric Lefkofsky Innovation Research Awards at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. These awards will help to support promising investiga- tors, providing them with the resources and protected time needed to push the envelope, as they develop a research track record that will lead to National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for their basic, translational and clinical cancer studies. \"The lack of early-stage funding is a prevalent and difficult obstacle for promising treatments,\" says Liz Lefkofsky. \"Researchers at the Lurie Cancer Center are doing revolutionary work to eradicate a cruel disease that has affected everyone in some way. With these grants, we will ensure more potentially life-saving ideas get the development and investment they critically need.\" The Lefkofsky Family Foundation was established in 2006 by Liz and Eric Lefkofsky, and serves to advance high-impact programs, initiatives, and research that enhance the quality of human life in our community. One of its missions is to propel innovative medical research, which aligns directly with Northwestern Medi- cine's vision to transform health care. 2 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE FALL 2014 3Exposure to high levels of air pollution has been linked with increased risk for heart attacks and stroke, according to a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Scott Budinger, MD, associate professor in Medicine-Pulmonary and Cell and Molecular Biology, in collaboration with Gokhan Mutlu, MD, chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care at the University of Chicago, showed that exposure to air pollution causes an elevation in the levels of the stress hormone adrenaline. The scientists used mouse models to demonstrate how increased adrenaline activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors on immune cells and promotes lung inflammation and a tendency to form blood clots. Similar to the effects of adrenaline, inhalers called beta-2 agonists that are used for conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease further worsen these effects. \"Our findings show that stress can make existing lung inflam- mation worse and increase the tendency to form clots,\" says Dr. Budinger. He further explains that physicians still do not Air Pollution Shown to Increase Lung Inflammation and Blood Clots Stimulating a particular region in the brain via non-invasive delivery of electrical current using magnetic pulses, called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, improves memory, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study published August 29 in Science. The discovery opens a new field of possibilities for treating memory impairments caused by conditions such as stroke, early- stage Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, cardiac arrest and the memory problems that occur in healthy aging. The approach also has potential for treating mental disorders such as schizophrenia. \"We show for the first time that you can specifically change memory functions of the brain in adults without surgery or drugs, which have not proven effective,\" says senior author Joel Voss, PhD, assistant professor of Medical Social Sciences at the Feinberg School of Medicine. \"This noninvasive stimulation improves the ability to learn new things.\" The study also is the first to show that TMS improves memory long after treatment and is the first to demonstrate that remem- bering events requires a collection of many brain regions to work in concert with the hippocampus. The electrical stimulation helps the brain regions operate in closer synchrony. The hippocampus is too deep in the brain for the magnetic fields to penetrate, so the Voss lab identified a region one centimeter from the skull's surface with high connectivity to the hippocampus. He wanted to see if he could stimulate the hippocampus. \"I was astonished to see that it worked so specifically,\" Voss says. \"This opens up a whole new area for treatment studies where we will try to see if we can improve function in people who really need it,\" says Voss. \"For a person with brain damage or a memory disorder, those networks are disrupted so even a small change could translate into gains in their function.\" The research was supported by grants P50-MH094263 from the National Institute of Mental Health and F32-NS083340 from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the NIH.Electric Current to Brain May Help Treat Memory Disorders Depleting an enzyme called GM3 synthase with gene therapy may help diabetics heal wounds faster, according to recent research by Northwestern Medicine scientists published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. Nearly 21 million people in the United States have Type 2 diabetes. About 15 percent of them experience chronic wounds that heal poorly, especially in the feet. \"There are many factors that influence this poor wound healing, among them poor functioning of the nerves and blood vessels that supply the skin, poor sugar control, and resistance to the effects of insulin and other growth factors, which are important for how skin cells move and grow,\" says Amy Paller, MD, '81, '83 GME, Walter J. Hamlin Professor of Dermatology and chair of the Department of Dermatology. The Paller lab found that mice engineered to be deficient in GM3 synthase resist becoming diabetic on a high-fat diet and have no trouble with wound healing, despite becoming obese. GM3 synthase is a key enzyme in making GM3, a molecule impor- tant in the function of growth factors. \"The skin cells that lacked GM3 synthase grew faster, moved more quickly in wounds and showed greater responses to insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1,\" says Dr. Paller, who is also a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. When they fed the cells high concentrations of sugar to mimic poorly controlled diabetes, they found that the cells missing GM3 synthase actually grew and moved even more quickly to heal the wound. This direct effect suggests the possibility of topical treatment to decrease GM3 synthase levels at the wound site, a focus of ongoing research. This work was supported by NIH grants R01AR44619 and R21AR062898 and the Astellas Research Endowment and used Core resources provided by the NIH-funded Northwestern University Skin Disease Research Center.Accelerating Diabetic Wound Healing CAMPUS NEWS Research Briefs Delinquency in youth predicts a significantly higher rate of violent death in adulthood\u2014especially from firearms\u2014and females are among the most vulnerable, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study published June 16 in the journal Pediatrics. Delinquent females died violently at nearly five times the rate of those in the general population, while delinquent males died at three times' general population rates. Now the largest minority First Large-Scale Study to Look at Death Rates in Delinquent Youthunderstand some of the unexpected side effects of commonly used beta-agonists such as albuterol, formoterol and salmeterol. \"Our findings are reassuring for patients with heart disease who cannot avoid exposure to air pollution,\" says Dr. Mutlu. \"Our results suggest that beta blockers, commonly used to treat heart disease, might protect against the increased risk of heart attacks and strokes associated with air pollution exposure.\" The study was funded by NIH grants ES015024, ES013995, HL071643, the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute Center for Translational Innovation Pilot Award and the Veterans Administration. group in the U.S., Hispanic females and males experienced death rates nine and five times greater, respectively. \"Early violent death is a health disparity,\" says lead author Linda Teplin,'75 PhD, the Owen L. Coon Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Feinberg School of Medicine. \"Youth who get detained are disproportionately poor and racial and ethnic minorities. We need to reduce the likelihood that youth will become delinquent. And, if they are arrested and detained, we need interventions to reduce violence. Otherwise, perpetrators often become victims.\" The study used newly available data from the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1,829 youth who were detained at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center in Chicago between 1995 and 1998. The authors used official death records up to 16 years after the initial interviews were conducted. The study was supported in part by National Institute on Drug Abuse grants R01DA019380, R01DA022953 and R01DA028763, and National Institute of Mental Health grants R01MH54197 and R01MH59463, all of the NIH; 1999-JE- FX-1001, 2005-JL-FX-0288 and 2008-JF-FX-0068 from the Ofce of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 4 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE FALL 2014 5See the Founders' Day slideshow online at magazine.nm.org. will lead them into careers of life-long responsibility,\" he continued. \"Feinberg, as it always has, will prepare you well for whatever path you choose to follow.\" Following Dr. Neilson's remarks, University Provost Daniel I. Linzer, PhD, congratulated students and encouraged them to take advantage of all North- western has to offer during the course of their education. \"It is a tough life to get to medical school and it gets tougher,\" Linzer said. \"I salute you for your dedication, your commitment to work hard and to care for people.\" Keynote speaker, Douglas Vaughan, MD, the Irving S. Cutter Professor of Medicine, addressed the students. \"The white coat represents our acceptance of you as colleagues,\" said Dr. Vaughan, also chair of medicine. \"It also represents the honor and sanctity in our profession. The white coat does not provide you with the skills, the experience or judgment that will come with being a physician; that will take time and work.\" He concluded, \"The next four years should be one of the most exciting and challenging times of your life. Make the most of it\u2014learn everything you can and more. The world of science and medicine has never been as exciting. I wish you the most satisfying and successful journey.\" Led by Diane Wayne, MD, vice dean for education, faculty mentors Aaron Gilbert, MD, assistant professor in physical medicine and rehabilitation, Jessica Montalvo, MD, CAMPUS NEWS Incoming Medical Students Don their White Coats at Founders' Day WRITTEN BY: Sarah Plumridge PHOTOGRAPHY BY: Randy Belice assistant professor in medicine-hospital medicine, Boye Ogunseitan, MD, assistant professor in medicine-hospital medicine, and Angira Patel, MD/PhD, assistant professor in pediatrics-cardiology and medical education-medical humanities and bioethics, members of the Class of 2017 bestowed white coats upon the first-year medical students. Marking entry to the profession, the incoming class recited the Declaration of Geneva, the modern-day equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath, repeating after Dr. Wayne, that the health of their \"patient will be their first consideration\" and to maintain by all means in their power \"the honor and the noble traditions of the medical profession.\" Excited to receive her white coat and say the oath, Ayelet Cohen, a first-year medical student, said, \"Reciting the oath with distinguished faculty members\u2014and knowing the rich history behind the declaration\u2014was my favorite part of the day, especially knowing that they are the values I will embody not only for the next four years, but for the rest of my career as a physician.\"Austin Culver, president of the Feinberg Student Senate and third-year medical student, presented the Student Senate Service Awards to members of the Class of 2017 who were selected by their peers in recognition of their community service and leader- ship at the local, national and international levels during their first year at Feinberg. Award recipients were second-year medical students Jakita Baldwin, Rachel Chang, Timothy Janetos, Molly Lohman and William Webber. Following the convocation, members of the Feinberg community and invited guests attended the Nathan Smith Davis Founders' Day reception. Sponsored by the Medical Alumni Association, the reception honors one of the founders of the medical school, who also served as its first dean. \"After today's ceremony I feel like I am part of the profession,\" said Emmanuel Ogele, a first-year medical student. \"To me, the day was symbolic of community. As the mentors and second-year students gave us our white coats, it reminded me that we are all working together as a team against disease.\" Alexandra Williams picked up her crisp, white coat and listened to advice from second-year student Ryan Sacotte on August 15 as they headed to Founders' Day, a ceremony that serves as the official start of the academic year. \"It is a special honor to receive my white coat and the responsibilities that come with it,\" Williams said. \"Having a second- year medical student as a guide and role model is nice as it connects us early-on to the program, and it's someone I can ask a quick question of, someone who has been there before.\" During the convocation, Williams was presented with her white coat by Sacotte alongside the other 162 members of the incoming Class of 2018. The event marks the culmination of the Introduction to the Profession Module, a week of activities to orient students to campus, give an overview of the curriculum and provide hands-on learning opportunities. Kicking off the 156th Founders' Day, Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for medical affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean, welcomed students, faculty members and guests. \"You have opened a new portal to your life work that focuses on medicine and science very few are privileged to enter. There are a myriad of exciting times ahead for you, not the least of which is working in a medical center teeming with world- class hospitals,\" said Dr. Neilson. \"Founders' Day is the traditional start of our new academic year; it is also a new beginning for our students on a path that THE 163 MEMBERS OF THE CLASS OF 2018 RECITE THE DECLARATION OF GENEVA FOR THE FIRST TIME.LEFT: HAPPY STUDENTS POSED FOR PHOTOS BEFORE AND AFTER THE FOUNDERS' DAY EVENT.

Brigid Dolan, MD, and Bernice Ruo, MD, both assistant professors in medicine- general internal medicine and geriatrics, received this year's Augusta Webster Faculty Fellowship in Educational Research and Innovation. The fellow- ship provides funding and mentorship to support the career development of junior faculty members researching medical education. A committee from the Educational Research and Innovations program at the Center for Education in Medicine selected projects that address current issues and/or challenges in health professions education, and that could serve as a pilot for future research. Dr. Dolan will describe how milestones\u2014 specific measurable outcomes that demonstrate trainee skill attainment\u2014are being tracked and how they can be aligned across both levels and multiple disciplines. Dr. Ruo aims to improve the assessment of internal medicine residents. She plans to optimize the evaluation form to be more user-friendly and to develop an evaluator training to assess resident performance more accurately and thoroughly.

Now, Seema Khan, MD, professor of breast surgery at the Feinberg School of Medicine, reports in Clinical Cancer Research that putting the drug in a gel and applying it directly to the breast tissue, where it needs to work, may have merit. At the end of the small study, the women in both groups showed similar decreases in tumor-related proteins, but blood levels of tamoxifen were five times lower among the women using the gel than those taking the oral pill. That, says Dr. Khan, suggests that the drug's major side effects, which occur in the blood and other reproductive organs, may be largely avoided by using a gel. NIACIN DOESN'T REDUCE HEART PROBLEMS, MAY CREATE SOME U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT - JULY 16, 2014 Niacin, a commonly used cholesterol treatment, doesn't reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke in people with hardened arteries. What's more, the drug appears to have dangerous side effects, including a potential increased risk of death, according to new research.4 5in pregnancy can be missed because symptoms like trouble sleeping and moodiness also occur in pregnant women who are not depressed. And doctors have historically been taught in medical school that \"women don't get depressed during pregnancy because they are happy,\" says Katherine L. Wisner, MD, director of the Asher Center for the Study and Treatment of Depressive Disorders and a professor of psychiatry and obstetrics at the Feinberg School of Medicine. In a 2013 study, Dr. Wisner and colleagues found that 14 percent of 10,000 women had depression four to six weeks after giving birth, but that for a third of them it actually started during pregnancy. A MISSPENT YOUTH DOESN'T DOOM YOU TO HEART DISEASE NPR - JULY 1, 2014 People who drop bad habits in their late 30s and 40s can reduce their risk of developing coronary artery disease, according to a recent study published in the journal Circulation. \"And by the same token, if you get to adulthood with a healthy lifestyle, that doesn't mean you're home free,\" says Bonnie Spring, PhD, director of the Center for Behavior and Health, professor of preventive medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine and the lead author of the study.

This step signifies the expansion of NMHC's North- western Medicine\u00ae-branded health system to four Illinois hospitals, including Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital in Lake Forest, Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, and Delnor Hospital in Geneva. \"We are honored to welcome Cadence Health into the North- western Medicine family,\" says Dean M. Harrison, NMHC president and CEO. \"Cadence is an ideal health system to combine with as their vision, mission and values are very similar to ours. Together, we will continue to deliver the Northwestern Medicine brand promise, which is to provide trusted, quality care that is accessible where patients live and work, safe and accountable, and centered on world-class medicine.\" On July 14, the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board unanimously approved NMHC's application to combine health systems. The integration creates an expanded health delivery network encompassing more than 60 sites of care across metro Chicago and the north and western suburbs, approximately 1,600 inpatient beds, 19,500 employees, and a combined medical staff with 4,000 physicians. Harrison remains president and CEO of the expanded NMHC health system, and Mike Vivoda, Cadence Health's president and CEO will be NMHC regional president, Western Region. Additional Cadence executive leadership who will transition to NMHC include Cadence CFO and Executive Vice President John Orsini, named NMHC CFO and senior vice president, and Liz Rosenberg, executive vice president of Strategy and Administration, named NMHC senior vice president, Strategy. \"Our union is great for patients because it positions us to continue to provide unrivaled quality care within our communities,\" says Vivoda. \"As one integrated health system, not only can we continue to fulfill the health needs of our region, we can leverage our collective strength as Northwestern Medicine to build stronger, healthier communities.\" Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, Cadence Health Finalize Plans to Integrate 10 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE FALL 2014 11A new Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital will raise the bar by bringing academic medicine to Chicago's suburbsWRITTEN BY: Martha O'Connell PHOTOGRAPHY BY: Laura Brown ILLUSTRATION BY: Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects Martin Davidson, 72, came into the Emergency Department at Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital (NMLFH) with a complex myocardial infarction and received an angioplasty. Afterwards, he was brought to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for a difficult procedure to repair his ruptured mitral valve. Today, Mr. Davidson is doing well and his surgeon, Chris Malaisrie, MD, associate professor in NMLFH President Thomas McAfee, FACHE, knows all too well that many patients living outside the city will not come to down-town Chicago for treatment simply because of the distance. The new hospital solves that problem by bringing a new state-of-the- art Northwestern center to them. A major goal for the new hospital is to enable clinicians to seamlessly manage patients at both locations and provide highly sophisticated care. To make that possible, much of the new medical equipment, patient room layouts, communication systems, patient safety features\u2014and even the overall SISTER TO THE NORTH cardiac surgery, presented this case at a national thoracic conven- tion\u2014bringing the mission of an academic medical center full circle. Lake Forest Hospital's place within Northwestern Medicine is growing stronger as a new hospital for the 21st century takes shape. It is almost unheard of to have the extraordinary expertise of an academic medical center in a community of 20,000 people, but that is what occurred in 2010 when Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC) acquired Lake Forest Hospital, located 30 miles north of Chicago. The hospital has long been a top-ranked institu- tion within the larger Lake County area. WORKING TOGETHER, STEPHEN FALK, PRESIDENT OF THE NORTHWESTERN MEMORIAL FOUNDATION, PATRICK MCCARTHY, MD, CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF CARDIAC SURGERY, TOM MCAFEE, NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE LAKE FOREST HOSPITAL PRESIDENT, AND ANDREW PARSA, MD, PHD, CHAIR OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY, ARE HELPING TO MAKE THE NEW LAKE FOREST HOSPITAL A REALITY. 12 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE FALL 2014 13PATRICK SUGRUE, MD, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR (LEFT), WILL HEAD UP NEUROSURGERY AT LAKE FOREST HOSPITAL, IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANDREW PARSA, MD, PHD, CHAIR OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY.professor and chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine, and Christopher Beach, MD, assistant professor and vice chair of emergency medicine. Emergency care has been a longtime concern in Lake County, and leadership of both physicians brings the same high-quality emergency care to Lake County as patients receive at Northwestern Memorial. Ian Cohen, MD, assistant professor of cardiology who also leads the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Lake Forest Hospital, continues to increase referral networks among primary care doctors and specialists by demonstrating Northwest-ern's superior care. His counterpart, Patrick Sugrue, MD, assistant professor of neuro- logical surgery, does the same as head of neurosurgery at Lake Forest, in conjunction with Dr. Parsa. With their past lives at the Cleveland Clinic and the University of California San Francisco, McAfee, McCarthy and Parsa are experienced at setting up multiple sites and communication interfaces. They note that patient satisfaction scores, outcomes, mortality rates and other quality measure- ments will apply uniformly at both hospitals. \"Right now, we track 730-plus quality measures of cardiovascular care on the downtown campus. These measurements have served us very well in making us the No. 1 program in Illinois and 13th in the country,\" Dr. McCarthy says.aesthetics\u2014at Lake Forest will replicate Northwestern Memorial. \"We will have the best of both worlds\u2014a new Northwestern Medicine hospital in Lake County and we are incorporating everything we learned from Northwestern Memorial into this facility,\" McAfee says. OLD HOSPITAL REBORN Opened in 1899, the community hospital underwent several expansions that have served residents well but do not meet today's standards. Scheduled to open in 2017, the new $378 million hospital will be more cohesive, and accommodate advanced procedures, efficient workflow and increased demand for outpatient care. Key features in the 483,500-sq.-ft. facility include 114 private inpatient beds, 72 outpatient care bays, eight operating rooms, flexible space for outpatient procedures and common areas. It will feature abundant natural light, soaring ceilings, extensive use of wood building materials and architectural styling characteristic of the university. Built to serve patients far into the future, Lake Forest Hospital will make it possible to incorporate new medical technologies as they emerge. Structured in a spoke pattern, the new facility will include five interconnected pavilions set against an expansive reflecting pool and waterfall. Outside, the 160-acre property is designed to fit sensitively into the land-scape of Lake County, with hiking and biking trails, meadows and bioswales. After the hospital opens, additional property on the site will be considered for health and wellness, education and research functions of the academic health system. SETTING UP HOUSE Northwestern Medicine is already laying the groundwork to fully integrate staff at both hospitals, focusing on cardiology, neurosurgery and neurology, orthopaedics, oncology and women's health\u2014and that starts at the top. At 3 a.m., Andrew Parsa, MD, PhD, chair of the Department of Neurological Surgery and the Michael J. Marchese Professor, gets a call and drives to Lake Forest Hospital. Patrick McCarthy, MD, chief of the Division of Cardiac Surgery and the Heller-Sacks Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery, will do the same and is also a Lake Forest Hospital trustee. Other physicians and coordinators rotate between the Chicago and Lake Forest campuses, in addition to satellite clinic sites in nearby Grayslake and Glenview. These specialists include, emergency medicine physicians, overseen by James Adams, MD, NOT YOUR USUAL RESIDENCY Feinberg prefers residents start by working in a large, busy hospital. Lake Forest will be the right fit for some residents and students after the hospital increases patient volumes. \"When you are in medical school or residency, you learn a lot about taking care of patients in different settings. Having a clinic in Lake Forest will bring in more patients that residents would not ordinarily see,\" Dr. Parsa says. Currently, the Feinberg School of Medicine's physician assis- tant students rotate through Lake Forest Hospital. The McGaw Family Medicine Residency program, under the direction of Deborah Clements, MD, chair of family medicine, will bring some of the first residents to the hospital in 2015 for a unique program that will bolster the number of these underrepresented physicians and focus partly on serving economically disadvantaged patients in Lake County. McCarthy explains that residents and students based at Northwestern Memorial will be able to review additional complex cases referred from Lake Forest. Conversely, someone interested in routine cardiac practice can experience that in Lake Forest. Telemedicine also presents extra learning opportunities. The new hospital exemplifies the trend for systemized care, meaning that difficult, complex treatments happen in the flagship medical center and the system's outlying hospitals take patients who require less complicated therapies. \"I think residents will get more exposure to how medicine is going to be practiced in the future by understanding how care works at both of our hospitals,\" McCarthy says. MAKING IT REAL Charitable giving ensures that the new hospital will provide exceptional health care for many generations. Northwestern's immediate goal is to raise $75 million over the next three years to open the new hospital. Another $75 million will be raised over ten years to support future growth.Stephen Falk, president of Northwestern Memorial Foundation, notes that funds raised thus far have already surpassed expectations. \"Many of these generous donations have come from a new generation of donors\u2014people with strong Lake County ties who have never supported Northwest- ern Medicine before but do so now because they feel a new hospital is critical for the well-being of local residents,\" he says. Two prominent leaders at Northwest- ern's Chicago and Lake Forest hospitals are heading the campaign: James Stirling, Life Trustee for Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and Debbie Saran, Northwestern Memorial Foundation Trustee and former Women's Board president at Lake Forest Hospital. All donors will be recognized either through naming opportunities or on a recognition wall that will be viewed by thousands of people for years to come. Contributions to the Lake Forest campaign will also be honored as part of We Will, the university-wide fundraising campaign to help Northwestern accomplish its strategic goals. QUALITY WILL RULE Continuing the expansion of Northwestern Medicine's brand into Chicago's western suburbs, NMHC recently finalized the merger with Cadence Health, bringing Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield and Delnor Hospital in Geneva into the fold. With its world-class medicine and research, Northwestern Medicine provides an unparalleled level of care in the suburban market. Some patients who need highly complex treatment may have to go to Northwestern Memorial, but the dramatic changes soon to come at the three suburban hospitals will make it possible for many people to start and finish their care close to home. With savvy consumers in the Lake County market, patients scrutinize physi- cians, hospitals and post-operative care before making their decisions. Second opinions are common. \"We know that the vast majority of care can be done at Lake Forest. Our patient volumes will increase and stay that way because quality care always prevails,\" McAfee says. FEATURE: SISTER TO THE NORTH $378M NEW HOSPITAL 483.5K SQ. FT.

Formerly at the University of Chicago, she founded the Institute for Cardiovascular Research as well as launched a Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic. One of a few of its kind in the nation, the clinic focused on diagnosing and treating patients with inherited forms of heart disease. At Northwestern Medicine, she will direct a clinical cardiac genetics program through the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute. A new offering for Northwestern in the area of genomics and cardiovascular medicine, the program will take advantage of genetic counseling and testing to identify individuals at risk for hereditary heart disease and to plan approp- riate treatment from devices to drugs. While her expertise will further advance Northwestern Medicine's influence in genetic medicine, McNally envisions more. In her latest leadership role, she hopes to strengthen inter-insti-tutional collaborations across the city to establish Chicago as a \"mecca for genetics.\" It may sound like a pipe dream but so was the physician-scientist's goal to go after genetic modifiers some Exploring the human genome makes good gene hunters of researchers. DNA trackers search for clues among the needle-in- the-haystack framework of the 25,000 genes in the human body to better understand and treat genetically caused diseases. Their perseverance, coupled with ongoing technological advances, has yielded quite a few \"needles\" in recent years. The use of genetic information to inform patient care, from cancer to neurological disorders, has personalized medicine for individual patients like never before. But more is still to come. Much more, according to Elizabeth M. McNally, MD, PhD, new director of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine's Center for Genetic Medicine. An internationally renowned expert on the genetics of heart disease and muscular dystrophy, this experienced gene hunter or \"huntress\" foresees an entirely new era for genetic medicine. \"A revolution in DNA sequencing is dramatically driving down costs and transforming how we practice medicine,\" says the recently named Elizabeth J.

FALL 2014 17 FEATURE: DNA SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 15 years ago when genetic medicine was still in its infancy. Today, she counts among her most significant scientific accomplishments the identification of two gene modifiers that could change the destructive nature of muscular dystrophy: TGF-\u00df binding protein involved in prevent- ing muscle weakness and a newly identified modifier known as annexin A6 that sheds light on muscle cell injury and repair. McNally and colleagues are currently working on a novel therapeutic agent that modulates TGF-\u00df activity to reduce tissue damage and fibrosis and could be poten- tially applicable to a variety of diseases, including myocardial injury, radiation- induced injury and vascular disease. MATERNAL INSTINCTS The second oldest of five siblings, Dr. McNally credits two moms\u2014her own and that of a boyfriend\u2014for serving as key role models who helped shape her career. \"My mother raised us all, while at the same time earning her college degree in Spanish, English and education,\" shares the Chicago native, who spent her teen years in Platteville, Wis. \"In my family, there was definitely a push for education from my mother because she knew education and advancement were tightly tied.\" McNally attended Barnard College, Columbia University, in New York, where she earned bachelor's degrees in biology and philosophy in 1983. While at college, she dated a guy whose mother happened to be preeminent scientist Ora M. Rosen, MD. (The late Dr. Rosen and colleagues at Memorial Sloan- Kettering were the first to clone the gene for the human insulin receptor in the mid- '80s.) \"I was interested in research and medicine but wasn't quite sure of my direction,\" recalls McNally. \"Ora took me under her wing and encouraged me to work in a lab while I was still an undergraduate.\" Dr. Rosen connected McNally with researcher Leslie Leinwand, PhD, a faculty member at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. A summer stint in Leinwand's lab allowed the budding young investiga- tor to not only clone her first bit of DNA, the myosin gene, but also find her research calling. A major motor protein found in heart and skeletal muscles, myosin mutations interfere with muscle contraction that can lead to disorders such as cardiomyopathy (weakness of the heart muscle) and muscular dystrophy. McNally has focused on both of these areas of investigation throughout and ever since completing \"I love what has been established at Northwest- ern,\" she says. \"The extensive research resources like the NUgene Project [one of the nation's first DNA banking studies] and clinical services such as genetic counseling are not only fantastic but also necessary components of getting us to where we want to go in the future.\" AFFORDABLE GENOMES When McNally began hunting genes decades ago she relied on Southern blotting, a molecular biology technique used to isolate and examine a single DNA fragment from an individual. \"We would get just one nucleotide at a time to study\u2014one out of three billion base pairs in a human genome,\" she explains. \"Today with whole genome sequencing technology, we can look at all three billion bases in many different indi-vidual genomes and begin to search for both common and rare genetic variations that link to disease in populations of people.\" In 2003, the Human Genome Project completed the sequence of the first human genome. The international effort cost upwards of $3 billion and took 13 years to be declared a success. Last year, the average price tag for whole genome sequencing was $10,000. In January, biotech company Illumina introduced a new machine that can sequence an entire human genome for $1,000 in about 24 hours. This exciting develop-ment will extend whole genome sequencing to many more patients, providing richer and more robust genetic data that will dramatically change health care. \"Lower cost sequencing technology will allow us to better classify diseases. That's already been happening in the cancer field, cardiology and neurosciences,\" explains Dr. McNally. \"In cardiology, we tend to lump conditions into broad categories\u2014the group of heart failure, the group of cardiomyopathy. What we are learning is that there are many different diseases within these groups, and many times there is a strong genetic influence. If we can understand the effect of specific gene mutations on disease progression, we will have a better sense of when to intervene with medical and surgical treatments for each and every patient.\"the MD/PhD program at Albert Einstein in 1990. She even worked under the mentor- ship of Dr. Leinwand, who served as her dissertation advisor. McNally jokes, \"I was the summer student who never went away!\" An internship and residency training in internal medicine, however, took McNally to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. There she also completed a fellowship in cardiovascular medicine in 1996 before going on to a research fellowship in gen- etics at Boston Children's Hospital. She then joined the faculty at the University of Chicago, where her husband, Stephen Kron, MD, PhD, is currently professor of molecular genetics and cell biology. Twenty-eight years ago the Oak Park, Ill., couple met at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., where McNally spent two summers as a teaching assistant. Coincidentally, it was also at this seaside haven for scientists that McNally first made the acquaintance of Rex Chisholm, PhD, vice dean for Scientific Affairs and Graduate Education, and the Adam and Richard T. Lind Professor of Medical Genetics at Feinberg. In 2000 he founded Northwestern's Center for Genetic Medicine\u2014the very one McNally looks forward to building upon.

Past and present, soldiers, sailors, airmen and reservists may have enlisted to learn a trade, see different regions of the country or world, find discipline and structure, obtain funding to further their education, and serve their country. During periods of world conflict, some have answered the government's call to duty through mandatory physician drafts, even though they may have disagreed on a personal level with the potential for harm to self and others. To commemorate Veterans' Day on November 11, Northwestern Medicine Magazine is recognizing medical school alumni who are military veterans. We asked Feinberg graduates to submit informa- tion about where, when and in what capacity they served, and the response was overwhelming. You can find their summaries in the \"Ward Rounds News\" section in the back of the magazine, with more details online. (We will include additional submissions in the winter 2014-15 issue of the magazine.) On Northwestern's Chicago campus, there are also current students and trainees who are former or active-duty military\u2014and we wanted to share some of their stories, too. Featured are three first-year students\u2014MD, Physician Assistant, and Physical Therapy\u2014as well as a neonatology fellow.

KENNEDY 20 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE FALL 2014 21FEATURE: FROM THE MILITARY TO MEDICINE STEPHEN GRAVES First-year medical student Stephen Graves, 27, says that he was a good but unmoti- vated high school student who only applied himself when he liked a subject. He also had no desire to follow in the footsteps of his physician parents. His ambitions were to see the world beyond Reno, Nev., and serve his country as a U.S. Marine. Graduating from high school in 2006, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. \"What I needed was structure and discipline,\" he says. Graves trained and served in the Reserve while working toward his undergraduate degree at the University of Nevada, Reno. He went to boot camp at the San Diego Recruit Depot before entering a Reserve unit, where he trained as a scout sniper in the 4th Anti-Terrorism Battalion. These experiences, he says, \"taught me that regardless of whether you want to do something, you give it your all.\" Whatever motivation Graves was lacking in high school, he made up for in college, where he pursued dual majors in international business and management with a minor in economics. He attended Officer Candidate School the summer between his junior and senior years. Though driven in college, Graves still was unsure about a career path, so when a surgeon friend of his parents suggested that he shadow him at a hospital for a few months, he decided to give it a try. \"I saw how he had a direct impact on people's lives and thought, 'This is what I want to do.'\" Graves added science prerequisites to his course load, carrying 22 credit hours each semester of his junior and senior years. After graduating in 2009, he commis- sioned into the U.S. Marine Corps as a lieutenant and reported to the Officer Basic Course in Quantico, Virginia. All commis- sioned officers attend this course to learn how to be a provisional rifle platoon commander. \"The Corps wants everyone to understand what it's like to be on the ground. It's about producing leaders,\" Graves says. Ranked by instructors and peers, he graduated first in his class of 300 officers and earned both the Honor Graduate and Gung Ho awards. \"The Marine Corps is a pretty alpha male, aggressive culture, and some people lead by yelling. I led by helping others,\" he explains. His next stop was the infamous Infantry Officer Course, known for its grueling Combat Endurance Test. After passing, Graves reported to his unit, 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) Battalion, at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and assumed command of four LAR vehicles and 32 marines. Three years later, he deployed to Afghanistan, where he lived in a shipping container with another service member and worked 12 to 14 hours a day, every day for a year. His primary role was reporting to the commanding general on operations in Helmand province. Besides discipline and leadership, Graves says that his military experience heightened his appreciation of family, the comforts of life in the United States, and personal freedom. \"The Marine Corps is instrumental in who I am and the reason I have had any success.\" His highest honor, he says, came in June when he and wife Allie were married.MD STUDENT U.S. MARINESILENA CHAPMAN, MDNEONATOLOGY FELLOWUNITED STATES AIR FORCE Neonatology fellow Silena Chapman, MD, knew as a child that she wanted to be a doctor, decided to specialize in neonatology in college, and graduated from medical school at age 23. When she joined the U.S. Air Force as a commissioned officer during her first year of medical school, it was not because she needed direction. Her grandfa-ther had served in the Army Air Corps and, she says, \"I thought it would be a good opportunity to serve my country and pay for my medical education.\" Dr. Chapman, 29, grew up in Chicago and Bellwood, Ill. She obtained her bachelor's and medical degrees in a six-year program at Youngstown State University and Northeast Ohio Medical University. She attended Officer Training School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala- bama, which, she explains, is like a professional school. Among other things, attendees learn how to present them-selves as an officer, leadership, team building and physical fitness. In her last year of medical school, Chapman did rotations at the military hospitals at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, and Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. She also attained the rank of captain. She chose to do her pediatrics residency at Naval Medical Center Ports- mouth, Virginia, because she knew that it would provide maximum exposure to procedures and give her a head start on caring for sick and premature babies. She explains that military residencies focus on giving trainees the skills to stabilize and manage critically ill patients until emer- gency transport arrives. Chapman's interest in neonatology stems from having a cousin who was born eight weeks premature. \"I got to visit with him in the ICU and enjoyed observing the proce- dures and how the neonatologists interacted with my family. The atmosphere felt very comfortable,\" she says. After graduating from her residency in 2011, she served for a year as chief resident at Portsmouth and as pediatric hospitalist at Langley Air Force Base Hospital, Virginia. She sought permission to do her neonatol- ogy fellowship at a civilian hospital, so that she would have a different experience. \"There's something special about caring for families who are doing so much for this country. I'm taking time away, so that I can provide military families with better care when I return,\" Chapman says. Her commitment will include serving as an attending neonatologist at a military hospital for four years. A highlight of her service was participat- ing in a U.S. Air Force humanitarian mission during her residency. She lived on a naval ship for one month and treated patients, some of whom had never seen a doctor, at temporary clinics in Guyana and Surinam. Dr. Chapman and her husband Sean became first-time parents in June with the birth of their son Rory. She credits her military training and support from colleagues and family with helping her balance clinical and research commitments with motherhood. \"Being able to help families through a difficult time has always been what keeps me going,\" she says, \"but since having a baby, I find myself a little more emotionally invested.\" 22 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE FALL 2014 23COLIN O'CONNORPA STUDENT NAT'L GUARDEMILY B A K E R PT STUDENT U.S. NAVYFEATURE: FROM THE MILITARY TO MEDICINE When first-year physician assistant student Colin O'Connor returned from his 16-month Iraq deployment in 2007, the young Minnesota National Guard reservist felt lost. \"I was 19 when I left and 21 when I returned. I went in as a fire support specialist and was promoted overseas to sergeant. But when I got home I was just a punk college kid,\" he says. O'Connor, 28, joined the National Guard shortly after graduating high school, knowing that his unit would be deployed. He was one of the youngest recruits in boot camp at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and wanted to quit. \"It was a shock to the system for a kid who had never been away from home,\" O'Connor explains. His drill sergeant, however, encouraged him to tough it out. He was studying sociology at the University of Minnesota and planning to go into law enforcement, when the U.S. Army activated his unit. They trained at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, and O'Connor recalls, \"I remember wondering if we were going to do okay.\" He was assigned to a combined infantry and armor battalion, stationed at Camp Taqaddum in Central Iraq. The Iraq mission had shifted from combat to stability and security, and his responsibilities included security patrols and conducting a census to gain knowledge of local customs and culture. O'Connor got to know and drink tea with Iraqi families. Returning home with no sense of direction, O'Connor went back to college to complete his bachelor's degree. During his last semester, he enrolled in an emergency medical certification class as an elective and, he says, found his purpose. After graduating, he worked with a Red Cross mobile blood collection team and as a phlebotomist at a medical clinic. It was then that O'Connor decided to become a physician assistant and spent the next two years taking science prerequisites at a community college. The U.S. military, however, had other plans for him. Though he had completed his Guard service, he remained in a pool of recently active soldiers. A Reserve recruiter encouraged him to join a newly formed psychological operations unit to reduce the likelihood of being recalled to active duty. He joined as a sergeant and became distinguished honor graduate of the class. But before taking the plunge into a medical career, O'Connor went on a spiritual journey. He and his wife Sara attended bible school in California. Unbeknownst to him, the two-year program would also provide a head start on his medical training. To fulfill a commu - nity service requirement, he was invited to work at the school's free clinic. While applying to physician assistant programs, O'Connor learned about the deficit of primary care physicians and the growing demand for physician assistants and, he says, it struck a chord. \"When I heard about our country's healthcare needs, I thought, 'I'm willing, I'm inter - ested, and I'm able.'\"As a first-year physical therapy student at Northwestern University, Emily Baker is seeing a softer side of Chicago than she did in winter 2007 when she reported for training at Naval Station Great Lakes. The self-described Navy brat says that even she was unprepared for the degradations of boot camp. When Baker returned to Chicago in the summer of 2014 to find an apartment, she got another shock\u2014beauti- ful weather and friendly people. \"I loved it,\" she says. Seeking adventure and a sense of purpose, Baker, 27, enlisted in the Navy at age 19. The military delivered on the adventure front, but when she completed her service in 2012, she felt uncertain about her career path. Baker trained as an aircraft mainte- nance worker, specializing in F-18s, an older plane that requires more upkeep. She was stationed at Naval Air Station Lemoore in California from 2007 to 2011, following one year at a base in Washington. Her job was to maintain aircraft and flight decks. Volunteering for detachments, she spent several months at a time on aircraft carriers in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. She also earned the privilege of supporting training squadrons that filled in for the Blue Angels at air shows. \"It was a cool experience to work behind the scenes of an air show and see ordinary Americans' appreciation for the military,\" she says. Before enlisting, Baker was more interested in cross-country running than mechanics. \"I knew that I would feel like a fish out of water,\" she says. \"I had no mechanical aptitude and was in a male- dominated environment, but I was determined to do my best. It was empow- ering.\" She attained the rank of third class petty officer in less than three years. Nonetheless, when Baker completed her service, she knew she did not want a career in naval aviation. In search of direction, she volunteered at the VA San Diego Healthcare System. They assigned her to a spinal cord injury physical therapy unit and, Baker says, she found her calling. \"I thought I could do this for the rest of my life.\" Baker worked with patients diagnosed with paraplegia, quadriplegia and multiple sclerosis. She saw many of them progress from sitting in wheelchairs to standing with the aid of robotics and other mecha- nisms. \"They were facing incredibly tough challenges, but it was a happy atmosphere. There was so much camaraderie among the patients and therapists. It blew my mind every day.\" She had nearly completed her bach- elor's degree in social science while on active duty, but after deciding on a physical therapy career spent more than a year taking science prerequisites. Baker applied to the physical therapy program at the Feinberg School of Medicine \"on a wing and a prayer,\" she says, and was thrilled when she was both accepted and granted a Post 9/11 GI Bill Yellow Ribbon Scholarship. \"I wouldn't trade my Navy experience for anything. It gave me direction and the strength and confidence to pursue a physical therapy degree at Northwestern.\" 24 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE FALL 2014 25and summer through its four major committees. In particular, I would like to recognize the accomplishments of the Fundraising Committee, chaired by Dr. Jimmy Hill, immediate past president of the Medical Alumni Association Board, and committee members Drs. Bournias, Grayhack, Humes, Huurman, Kelly, Rusk and Sullivan. Through their efforts, our Board has achieved 100% annual giving for our current fiscal year! We hope that this sets an example for all of our alumni to contribute annually to the medical school in order to provide scholarship support for our future students. All the best, David Winchester, '63 MD Alumni Board PresidentDear Fellow Alumni: The fall season brings with it the excitement of incoming and returning Feinberg School of Medicine students to the Chicago campus. I want to share with you a student event I had the pleasure of attending on September 5 that epitomizes our medical students' close interaction with one another\u2014the annual \"Society Olympics.\" This event is an outgrowth of the Feinberg Society Program established in 2008. The four societies link the previously established four colleges from the 1990s across the four years of medical school at Feinberg. These \"Olympics\" enable students to compete against one another in a variety of fun, relatively low-skill events such as a water balloon toss, tug of war, and cornhole bean bag toss. Rather than battle it out in a muddy field after some hard rains that Friday afternoon, \"the Games\" were brought indoors and students went head-to-head in a spirited rock, paper, scissors contest, bean bag toss, and penny wars. (Members of each society contributed pennies to a jar bearing the society name \u2014receiving a point for each cent\u2014and opposing societies could donate larger denominations to their opponents' kitties in order to subtract points from their rivals. All proceeds went to Chicago Youth Programs.) The four societies, each of which is named after a famous Feinberg graduate, include: Cooper (John A.D. Cooper); Ricketts (Howard Taylor Ricketts); Thompson (Mary Harris Thompson); and Lawless (Theodore K. Lawless). This year the winning team was Cooper, and I had the privilege of presenting the trophy to their team. The Medical Alumni Association sponsored the indoor picnic and hopes to continue to support this event in the future because we feel strongly that it's important to promote interaction among students, faculty and medical alumni. In addition to encouraging socialization, these Feinberg societies are geared to promote interaction between older and younger students, and improve the experience at Feinberg through better connections, mentoring and teaching, and more participation in community engage- ment. I saw the enthusiasm with which the students competed and the wonderful camaraderie that exists and it brought me back to my med school days. My thanks go to Dr. Gregory Brisson, a key organizer of the Society Program, for providing me with background information so I could share this with you. Now for a Board update ...

Bergan, MD, '59 GME, a vascular surgeon, died June 11 in Chicago, 50 years after he performed the first kidney trans- plant at Northwest- ern Memorial Hospital (NMH). After serving in the Navy for two years during World War II, Dr. Bergan attended Indiana University School of Medicine. He completed a general surgery residency at Chicago Wesley Memorial Hospital and began his medical career as a clinical assistant in surgery at the medical school at Northwestern. Along with James Yao, MD, PhD, professor emeritus in surgery-vascular, Dr. Bergan founded the Division of Vascular Surgery at Feinberg in 1976 and established one of the earliest vascular surgery fellowships at Northwestern. Together, they developed the noninva- sive vascular laboratory at Wesley Hospital. \"We have lost a skilled surgeon, a prolific scholar, a dedicated educator, a great speaker, a tireless investigator, a fearless leader and a staunch advocate for venous disorders,\" says Dr. Yao, who was recruited by Dr. Bergan in 1972. \"I am grateful he gave me the opportunity to launch my career in vascular surgery, and I am honored and privileged to have worked side-by-side with him for 16 years.\" Bergan published more than 800 academic papers and edited or authored more than 40 textbooks, including one of the most authoritative books on the circulatory system. He started new societies, including the Midwestern Vascular Surgical Society and the Society for Vascular Surgery. He served as president of numerous societies, such as the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American College of Phlebology. He received national and international honors and awards, including the Rovsing Silver Medal from the Danish Surgical Society, Honorary Fellowship in the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Society for Endovascular Surgery.WARD ROUNDS\u00ae NEWS Remembering the Contributions of Two Feinberg Pioneers\u2014 Drs.

The young doctor also wanted to live in an area where he could pursue his passion for hunting and fishing. Dr. Cromer remained in practice in Antigo until early this June, when a medical condition forced him to step down. \"I did not plan on retiring,\" he admitted. During his decades in practice, the father of five delivered 3,000 babies, some of them home births in his early years. He also vividly remembered a country house call he made on Christmas Eve more than 40 years ago. While his wife Dede and young children were opening gifts, he received a call from a couple whose severely disabled son was sick. Although there were blizzard conditions, Dr. Cromer got in his Jeep and drove more than 15 miles out of town to this family's farm. He arrived to find that the boy had a high fever and a \"nasty cough, with scattered rales when I listened to his chest.\" Diagnosing pneumonia, the physician gave him an injection of long-acting penicillin and wrote a few prescriptions, leaving instructions to give the patient plenty of fluids and keep him in a semi-recumbent position. \"On the way home, as I drove slowly through the storm, it seemed to me that I had just been subjected to a test,\" he recalled. \"It was as if some 'Presence' had wanted to test me to see if I was a real doctor. I like to think that I passed the test.\" Throughout his 60 years of practice, Dr. Cromer found family medicine highly rewarding. \"I could hardly wait to get up in the morning to go to work,\" he said. \"I enjoyed getting to know our patients and their families as well as treating them.\" One needy family, for whom he delivered several babies, compensated him by making a fine cabinet for his office. Following his recent retirement, the cabinet was moved to Dr. Cromer's home. \"My advice for anyone contemplating a career in medicine is not to do it because you feel you must do it for your family's sake,\" he counseled. \"Do it because it's what you really want.\" Still, Dr. Cromer understood the reluctance of newly minted MDs to pursue rural medicine. \"If you graduate with a debt of $70,000 or more, you cannot afford to go into a lower-paying medical specialty,\" he said. \"Improving the art of medicine cannot be done with new curricula alone. Somehow, the cost and overhead of medical education must be made more reasonable. And some- how, the cost of medical care must be made more reasonable. For me it was simple because I had no debt. The government paid for my education.\" War Wound Sparked Interest in Medicine Editor's Note: Dr. Robert Cromer passed away June 25, 2014. We are proud to pay tribute to his military service and his dedication to the practice of rural family medicine.By Bob Kronemyer Bob Cromer, '52 MD, thanked his lucky stars that a German mortar shell hit his left leg during World War II combat in March 1945. That \"million-dollar\" wound\u2014serious enough to remove the 19-year-old infantryman from action but without causing permanent crippling\u2014 allowed him to receive a disability rating and have his education paid for under Public Law 16 (rehabilitation) instead of the standard G.I. Bill. \"This carried me through both undergraduate and medical school at Northwestern University and paid for everything: tuition, books, supplies and even a stipend for living expenses,\" recounted Dr. Cromer, 88, before his passing in June. \"So the German soldier who damaged me many decades ago actually wound up doing me a favor.\" Fortu- nately, the bones in his leg had been spared. \"The shrapnel had merely cut my calf in half, leaving a piece of burned trousers in the wound,\" explained the recipient of the Purple Heart Medal. Following his injury, Cromer underwent several leg surgeries and spent more than five months recuperating at various Army hospitals in Germany, Belgium, France, England and America, which allowed him to observe up-close caregivers in action. \"I was impressed by the medical and nursing care,\" he said. Furthermore, the young man had plenty of spare time to read, including numerous Ellery Queen mystery novels. \"I thought solving medical problems was a little bit like being a detective.\" His path toward medicine was also guided by what happened a few days before sustaining his injury. \"About half of my platoon got wiped out, and a good many others in my company,\" he recalled. \"I felt I was a survivor. I believe a lot of survivors feel they owe it to their deceased buddies to not waste the life that their buddies never got.\" Cromer grew up in the Chicago suburb of Maywood and originally wanted to become an ornithologist to study birds. But, shortly after the war ended, he followed in his older brother's footsteps and attended Northwestern, earning a bachelor's degree in liberal arts in 1948. Upon receiving his medical degree in 1952, Dr. Cromer served two years at Cook County Hospital in family practice. \"In those days, Cook County did not have a residency program, and I did not feel one year of internship was enough,\" he explained. He was attracted to family medicine because of the great need in rural areas, despite substantially less compensation than for many specialties. In 1954, when he joined a group practice in the small community of Antigo, Wis. (about 150 miles northwest of FALL 2014 37 36 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINEA decade ago, Sudip Bose, '99 MD, was a physician in the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division, one of a handful of doctors in Baghdad, Iraq, treating soldiers fighting on the front lines. Today, Dr. Bose is an emergency room physician with the Medical Center Health System and serves as medical director for the city of Odessa, Texas. He also holds the title of associate clinical professor of emergency medicine at the University of Illinois College of Medicine. In addition he continues to raise awareness\u2014and funds\u2014for the mental health issues plaguing veterans of the war in Iraq and previous wars through his nonprofit organization, The Battle Continues. \"We're trying to make a bigger impact on veterans' health care and other issues,\" he says. \"We just don't want to forget about our soldiers once they return to civilian life.\" After finishing the HPME program at Feinberg, Bose completed an emergency medicine residency at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood, Texas, which is the highest-volume emergency department in the military. During his final year of medical training, the 9/11 attacks occurred and he volunteered to remain at Fort Hood, attached to a mechanized infantry unit. \"I thought enlisting was a no-lose situation because I wanted to do emergency medicine. The military is a great way to see the world, get great skills and serve,\" explains Bose, who was in the military from 1995 to 2007. He also has a family history of military service. His great-grandfather, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, was a prominent independence leader in India during the 1940s, and is memorialized both on Indian currency and as the namesake of Calcutta's international airport. Dr. Bose spent 15 months in Iraq in 2004 and early 2005 as part of the second wave of soldiers out of Kuwait, known as Operation Iraqi Freedom 2. He was honored with The Bronze Star for serving one of the longest combat tours by a physician since World War II. He vividly recalls events like a bombing in the middle of a busy street, resulting in hundreds of casualties. \"How do you take care of all those people? How do you prioritize and treat everybody?\" asks Bose. \"It's tough.\" The experience made him realize the importance of training medics and the resulting multiplier effect that came from spreading his knowledge. While the Army captain spent most of his time in Baghdad during the peak of the Iraqi insurgency, he also served in other areas including Fallujah, treating several thousand U.S. soldiers. Perhaps the most memorable encounter was handling the basic medical checkup for Saddam Hussein after the Iraqi strongman was captured. \"You don't want to be the physician who misses a critical diagnosis on Saddam when he's in jail,\" Bose explains, noting that he needed to put his personal feelings aside when doing the exams. \"You're not the judge, jury nor the executioner. You just have to focus on your job. ... In the end, he was a patient we had to treat.\" While some patients need to be sedated, Saddam \"ended up being pretty cooperative,\" he adds. Brooke Langlois, a charge nurse who works with Dr. Bose in Odessa, says he is a low-key, upbeat leader. \"He brings a different vibe when he's around,\" she says. \"He takes charge. He knows what he needs to do, when he needs to do it. Even in the most intense moments he's not intense, and yet he still gets the job done.\" THE CASUALTIES OF WAR The U.S. soldiers Bose treated were able to endure horrific injuries, like the loss of limbs, which they probably would not have survived in earlier wars, he says. \"In the Korean War, if you were an amputee, you were pretty much dead. In this war, ampu- tees were coming back home. Medicine has definitely advanced.\" Often patients would be flown to Germany \"with their bellies open\" for further operations after Dr. Bose did \"damage-control\" on the front lines to stop the bleeding. The fact that soldiers have been prevail- ing over such physical trauma has led to a new round of mental and emotional battles, which Bose refers to as the \"invisible injuries\" of war. An estimated 23 veterans per day commit suicide, he says, and many more struggle with depression and post- traumatic stress disorder. Shortly after he returned from Iraq, Bose began speaking publicly about veterans' mental health and donating the speaking fees to veterans' causes like the Wounded Warrior Project, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars and others. This motivated him to start The Battle Continues and launch a website (www.TheBattleContinues.org). Earlier this year, he incorporated the nonprofit so he can take donations and disperse them directly to veterans. \"What prompted me was the opportu- nity to make a bigger difference,\" he admits. \"I'm trying to help veterans as they come back. A lot of the struggles they're battling with are the invisible wounds.\" The ER physician educates through presentations to corporations, doctors' groups and the public. Personal photos, video footage and stories from his Iraq deployment help him share lessons learned in combat and their application in civilian life, as well as how to better understand soldiers' mental and emotional state upon discharge. Dr. Bose has given hundreds of speeches in the international arena, including a keynote with U.S. President Barack Obama. Many veterans return and have to fight to get health care, and some end up homeless and jobless, Bose explains. \"A lot of people don't seek medical care because they think, 'My doctor is not going to understand.' I'm in a unique position to help, having been a battlefield doctor.\" He readily admits, \"I would not have known what they've been through if I had not served in Iraq. You come back and even your family and friends don't really understand. People can't conceive what soldiers are going through. These struggling veterans might be your next-door neighbor, or the guy in the next cubicle. These are often 20-year-old kids and they have their whole lives ahead of them.\" As previous wars have improved the care of physical wounds, Bose hopes the Iraq War aftermath will help to advance the treat- ment of veterans' mental health. \"These problems need to be addressed, and they need to be addressed early,\" he says. \"Society is doing better in recognizing these issues, but there is room for improvement.\" For more information and to find out how you can help, please visit www.TheBattleContinues.org.

Two years later, with the launch of the newly established medical school known as the Medical Department of Lind University (precursor to Northwestern University Medical School), a relationship blossomed through which clinic patients were treated by teaching faculty who presented interesting cases to their medical students. The dispensary was added to the regular curriculum in 1873. Until these clinics closed in 1975, they were a rich training ground for medical students.
