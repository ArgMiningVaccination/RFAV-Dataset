Doctors are trained to see the disease and not necessarily, the person. They are taught that pain means sickness. They are trained to use drugs, surgery, exhaustive tests and laboratory technologies. Clearly modern medicine has saved lives and made wonderful strides. The ability to isolate microbes without killing the patient was a major milestone. However, with the vast medical arsenal available to them today, doctors can only cure about one-fourth of the illnesses presented to them. In Abraham Maslow's words, \"If all you're trained to use is a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail.\"](https://miriamchemmoss.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/disease_treatment_cancer.jpg) Alternative medicine on the other hand, has its own amazing amount of research and tests on all aspects of natural healing, especially with herbs. It supports the notion that health is a lifestyle process, based on wellness care and not just illness treatments. [Alternative medicine's basis is that the human body is a beautifully designed, self-healing system that can meet many of its problems without much intervention. Inflammation of any kind is usually seen as a sign that the body is mounting an immune response to heal itself. Instead of trying to eliminate symptoms, lifestyle therapy treatments work to enhance natural defenses and healing vitality. Healing can be enhanced if patient is essentially seen as an individual who can be kept free of emotional depression and panic.](https://miriamchemmoss.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/altmedicine-6.jpg) Emotional trauma impairs immune function by decreasing the body's interleukins; vital immune defense substances. Panic constructs blood vessels, adding burden to our mental state and the ability of the immune system to do its job. Your mental, emotional and even spiritual life is inseparable from your physical health. Lifestyle health is more subtle than drugs or surgery. A sensible lifestyle, with fresh, healthy, wholesome foods, moderate exercise and restful sleep is still the best medicine for almost all conditions. [Your diet is the most powerful weapon you have for your health. It is the prevention approach which can guarantee and support health. Food nutrients in the form of minerals, vitamins, enzymes, amino acids, bioflavonoids, antioxidants and others. They maintain, normalize, balance and rejuvenate the body systems that may have gone out of whack; including the nervous and endocrine systems that govern your emotions and mental processes. There is no question that health and wellness has a profound spiritual component that is personal to each one of us.](https://miriamchemmoss.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/food-is-medicine-769243.jpg) In response to modern medical limitations, many people are now adopting holistic treatments. Quite a number of medical professionals are trying alternative medicine for their own self-care. An increasing number of doctors are including and adopting some practices of natural medicine in order to offer their patients the best of both worlds. We do need both types to counter our fast paced, high stress lifestyle. Both types of medicine are no substitute for sound, nutritious diet, regular exercise and the remarkable ability of whole herbs to boost the body's own natural healing response. [There is no prescription more valuable than knowledge. We need to be re-educated about our health, to take more responsibility for our being and to be less intimidated by disease and the medical industry.](https://miriamchemmoss.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/images2.jpg) This does not mean throw away your doctor's phone number. It means we become aware of the many choices for all sorts of healing. For everyday, non-emergency healing, many people don't know that they need not go any further than their own spice rack or garden. We can of course, educate ourselves on how these herbs interact with each other and what side effects, there are, if any. We can also expect the healing effects of natural remedies to be a little slower but more permanent; a normal thing as the body takes its time to do it right. Amongst numerous other natural healing methods, herbal healing exemplifies universal truth at its highest level. It is both a science and an art with qualities we would all like to represent and the ones we value the most in our lives. Herbs are intricate plants filled with long memory. They have intelligently adapted to the earth's changes as we have and they have always interacted with humans. You will be surprised to learn that till today, Chinese Pharmacies carry no drugs. Their customers believe in healing herbs and few animal extracts that have been used for over 3000 years without fail. Herbs work better together than they do by themselves. There are certain known combination for different ailments and conditions. Like all great realities of nature, there is so much more than we shall ever know. [The winds of change are blowing once more in this new millennium. There is clearly a rebirth of interest in the ways of nature and holistic healing. Both modern medical technology and the holistic approach can come together for the good of mankind.](https://miriamchemmoss.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/alternative-medicine.jpg) Although Western Herbal knowledge may have taken a detour through lab technology and over-reliance on pharmaceutical drugs, useful knowledge has resurfaced that otherwise might not have been found. If we can put aside greed and politics that have surrounded health-care, the best of both worlds may surface. Notable healer, Albert Schweitzer once said, \"the doctor of the future will be oneself.\" If we are to become our future doctors, where is our medicine? It is all around us. Our food is our pharmacy, herbs are our medicine, the oceans are our healers and even our very own breathing can bring us real health. It is time to return to Mother Nature. Nature provides wholesome, ready-to-use remedies. If we can clean up our environment and make more responsible and humane choices towards our unlimited resources, allow natural plants and animals to change naturally with time to adapt to a changing environment as they usually do, without interference (genetic engineering)...we can overcome many of the problems facing our species. Today, we are breaking nature's laws almost without thought to the consequences simply because we can do it or because of our limited understanding. [\"The idea that we live in something called 'the environment' is utterly preposterous. The world that environs us, that is all around us, is also within us. We are made of it, we eat, drink and breathe it. It is bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh\"-Wendell Berry](https://miriamchemmoss.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/5371974.jpg) Sources: Healthy Healing, A Guide To "}
