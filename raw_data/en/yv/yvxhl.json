So if you want to take medicine or have surgery they are great at helping you with those services. They have the rights to the words \"treat and cure\". You probably are asking, \"What does a holistic doctor help patients with?\" A holistic medicine doctor is a practitioner who looks at the patient holistically, meaning they consider a patient's mind, body, and spirit to improve their health and wellness. Holistic doctors are primarily focused on prevention and helping the body to find balance naturally, so it can heal itself. Holistic doctors usually don't diagnose any illness since a symptom is only a sign that the body is not in balance... there is something wrong. If we find out what is wrong the body will naturally revert back to health. Is a holistic doctor a real doctor? Yes, if some one went to school for a doctorate and got a State approved license they are a real doctor. If you are asking if holistic doctors are medical doctors, remember that holistic doctors address the underlying cause of illness with natural substances like [whole food supplements](https://www.drekberg.com/health-books.html), natural services like [nutrition response testing](https://www.drekberg.com/nutrition-response-testing-nrt.html) and [chiropractic](https://www.drekberg.com/chiropracticfaq), etc and don't prescribe medicine. A medical doctor treats with medicine and a surgeon treats with surgery. Is it worth it to see a holistic doctor? Having a broad-focused holistic doctors is an excellent advantage to your chronic health concerns, as you will not be treated as a list of symptoms. Instead, you will be assessed and treated as a whole person with complex issues that are all interconnected. You will not be given an endless amount of medicines that are given on guesses.
