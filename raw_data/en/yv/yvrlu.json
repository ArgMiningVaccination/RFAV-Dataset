Unless a greater amount is approved by the state credit union board, the aggregate amount of outstanding agricultural loans and business loans as defined in section 13-03-12-01 to any one member or group of associated members may not exceed twenty percent of the credit union's reserves. A credit union may lend an additional ten percent of the credit union's reserves to any one member or group of associated members if such credit is extended for seasonal advances associated with operating purposes for the production of farm products and repayment of which is required to be made within a normal business cycle not to exceed twelve months.

The determination whether a member agricultural loan will be classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss, for purposes of the valuation allowance for loan losses, will rely on factors not limited to the delinquency of the loan. Nondelinquent loans may be classified, depending on an evaluation of factors, including, but not limited to, the adequacy of analysis and documentation. 2. Loan classifications. a. Substandard. A loan classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the credit union will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual loans classified substandard. b. Doubtful. A loan classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the loan, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include: proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation actions, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. c. Loss. Loans classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but, rather, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may occur in the future. 3. Loans classified must be reserved as follows: 44 a. Loss loans at one hundred percent of outstanding amount; b. Doubtful loans at fifty percent of outstanding amount; and c. Substandard loans at ten unless other factors (e.g., credit union) indicate a appropriate. History: Effective May 1, 1988.

Unless a greater amount is approved by the state credit union board, the aggregate amount of outstanding member business loans and agricultural loans as defined in section 13-03-11-01, to any one member or group of associated members may not exceed twenty percent of the credit union's reserves. The exceptions to the \"business loan\" definition set forth in subdivisions a, b, and d of subsection 2 of section 13-03-12-01 and the exceptions to the \"agricultural loans\" set forth in subdivisions a and c of subsection 1\u00b7 of section 13-03-11-01 may not be calculated in determining the twenty percent limit. The dollar exceptions set forth in subdivision c of subsection 2 of section 13-03-12-01 for \"business loans\" (twenty-five thousand dollars) and subdivision b of subsection 1 of section 13-03-11-01 for \"agricultural loans\" (forty thousand dollars) may not be aggregated for purposes of determining loan limitations under this section. Therefore, the exception for \"business loans\" may never exceed twenty-five thousand dollars and the aggregate exception for \"business loans\". and \"agricultural loans\" may never exceed forty thousand dollars. Credit unions seeking an exception from the twenty percent limit must present the board with, at a minimum: the higher limit sought; an explanation of the need to raise the limit; and analysis of the credit union's prior experience in making member business loans; and a copy of its business lending policy.

The determination whether a member business loan will be classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss, for purposes of the valuation allowance for loan losses, will rely on factors not limited to the delinquency of the loan. Nondelinquent loans may be classified, depending on an evaluation of factors, including, but not limited to, the adequacy of analysis and documentation. 2. Loan classifications. a. Substandard. A loan classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the credit union will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual loans classified substandard. b. Doubtful. A loan classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the loan, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include: proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation actions, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. c. Loss. Loans classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. This classification do,es not necessarily mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but, rather, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may occur in the future. 3. Loans classified must be reserved as follows: a. Loss loans at one hundred precent of outstanding amount; b. Doubtful loans at fifty percent of outstanding amount; and c. Substandard loans at ten percent of outstanding amount 49 unless other factors (e.g., history of such loans at the credit union) indicate a greater or lesser amount is appropriate.

History: Amended effective May 1, 1988. General Authority: Law Implemented: 74-03-01-09. NDCC 4-09-03 NDCC 4-09-15 Field inspection. 1. Applications. Applications for field inspection, accompanied by the correct fees, past due accounts, and proof of seed eligibility, must be mailed or received at the state seed department office in Fargo not later than June twentieth fifteenth. The penalty fee will apply after that date. Applications may not be accepted after July fifth except for later planted crops. Soybean, millet, field peas, and buckwheat will be accepted until July fifteenth without late penalty. In case of an emergency or unusual circumstances due to weather and crop conditions, the deadline may be e~tended at the discretion of the seed commissioner. Application blanks are available at all county extension offices and the seed department offices at Fargo, Grand Forks, and Grafton. 2. Information required on application. The application blank shall be filled out by the grower and returned to the office. It is important that all questions be answered completely and correctly. Information is required regarding the variety of the crop, number of acres [hectares] seeded, and source of seed. The location of the farm and field shall be given clearly so that the inspector will be able to find the farm and field readily without waste of time and extra travel. A diagram of the field location shall be made on the bottom of the application blank. If the seed is purchased, an official certified seed tag must accompany the application. 3. Roguing and spraying fields. Roguing fields prior to inspection is desirable to remove undesirable plants from fields which are intended for seed certification. Plants that should be removed include off-type plants, prohibited and restricted noxious weeds, other crop plants such as sweet clover in alfalfa, oats in barley, winter rye in winter wheat, and other impurities which may be growing in the field. Roguing is usually done by pulling out other crop plants or weeds and removing them from the field. In the case of small grain, roguing should be done after heading as foreign plants are seen most easily at this time. In hybrid seed production, off-type and undesirable plants should be removed before pollen is shed. Roguing is very essential in maintaining the purity of varieties and high standards of certified seed. Wherever practical and advisable, seed fields should be sprayed with herbicides according to the best recommendations for the control of undesirable weeds. 4. Weeds and diseases. 215 a. Prohibited noxious weeds under North Dakota seed laws and rules are: leafy spurge, field bindweed (creeping jenny) Canada thistle, thistle, Russian knapweed, and hoary cress (perennial peppergrass). For purposes of seed certification, musk thistle and absinth wormwood shall be included. b. Restricted noxious weeds under North Dakota seed laws and rules are: dodder species, wild mustard, field pennycress (frenchweed), hedge bindweed (wild morning glory), wild oats, and quackgrass. c. A field may be rejected if it is the opinion of the field inspector that the amount and kind of common weeds present materially affect its appearance or make it difficult to give adequate inspection, or the condition is such that the quality of the cleaned seed may be questionable. d. Objectionable weed seeds are restricted noxious weeds under North Dakota seed laws and rules and some common weeds which cause a specific problem in the conditioning of some individual crops. e. Diseases not governed\u00b7 by specific crop standards may be cause for rejection if it is the opinion of the inspector that the quality of the cleaned seed may be affected or if results of tests made on the seed indicate a disease condition which will affect the crop produced from such seed. 5. Cancellation of field inspection. An application may be canceled by the grower before the field inspection is made and the application fee minus ten dollars will be refunded. The request for cancellation, however, must reach the state seed department before the inspector arrives in the general locality of the field or before inspection expense has been incurred. Refunds will not be made after fields are inspected or because fields have been rejected. History: Amended effective May 1, 1986; May 1, Charges for fees and services are subject to change. For current fees contact the state seed department. 1. Field inspection fees.

(The two cents for each bushel [35.24 liters] and six cents for each hundred pounds [45.36 kilograms] of alfalfa, clovers, and perennial grasses will be used to promote North Dakota certified seed.) Bulk certification: ten dollars per lot plus four cents per bushel [35.24 liters]. 4. Carryover seed tagging. New certification tags will be furnished for carryover seed at a cost of four cents per tag. All carryover seed must be retested for germination before new certified tags will be issued. 5. Carryover bulk seed. All carryover bulk seed must be retested for germination before new bulk certificates will be issued at ten dollars per lot ( four certificates -extra copies twenty-five cents per copy). Carryover bulk seed cannot be recertified in bags unless new samples are submitted for analysis. History: Amended effective May 1, 1986; May 1, 1987; sampling and laboratory inspection. 1. Identification in storage. Field inspected seed must be positively identified by lot number (field inspection number) at all times. Bins of bulk lots of uncleaned or cleaned seed should be marked. Bags should be identified by a stenciled lot number or an identification tag securely sewn or fastened to the bag. 2. Germination sample. To speed up tagging and determine suitability of seed prior to conditioning a representative sample of seed from each field which has passed field inspection may be submitted to the state seed department soon after the crop is harvested. A special seed envelope for this sample is furnished the grower. This sample should be cleaned 218 on a small mill or hand sieve to correspond as nearly as possible to the condition of the entire lot after cleaning or conditioning. Only a germination test and embryo test in the case of susceptible barley varieties is made on this sample. This germination test and embryo test (in the case of barley) can be used in the final tagging of the lot and all sublots. A grower may, however, request a new test on each lot after final conditioning or delay the germination test and embryo test until after conditioning. The labeler is responsible for the germination stated on the seed label. 3. Sampling procedures. a. All seed lots for final certification should be sampled during conditioning by taking samples from the mills at periodic intervals. b. Specific instruction to samplers are found on reverse side of samplers report. 4. Maximum lot size and numbering. a. The maximum size of lot for sampling of cereals and flax is five hundred bushels [176.20 dekaliters] for bagged seed, with no maximum size for bulk seed. For grasses and legumes the maximum size of lot shall be two thousand pounds [907.18 kilograms]. When desired, sublot samples can be combined under one lot number in which case, the average analysis of all sublot samples will be used for tagging. Field inspection numbers should not be changed. The maximum size for any bagged lot is two thousand bushels [704.78 dekaliters]. Bulk certified lots do not have a maximum limit except bin capacity. b. The lot number should be preceded by the initials of both the variety and kind of seed. When large lots of seed are broken up into smaller lots and conditioned at different times, a sublot number should be used. For example, the seed from a field of Larker barley, which has field inspection number eight hundred ninety-seven, will be designated as lot lb 897. If only a part of the entire lot is conditioned at one time, the sublot will be designated lb 897-1. When another portion of the lot is conditioned, this sublot will be designated lb 897-2. 5. Bulking seed lots. Seed from different fields of the same kind and variety, which have passed field inspection, may be bulked if the seed is of the same class, generation, or general quality. If the seed of different classes or generations is bulked the seed becomes eligible for the lowest class only. 6. Conditioning. 219 a. All field inspected seed which is to be tagged and sealed must be conditioned and must meet the m1n1mum seed standards and conditioning requirements for the crop and class. b. Field inspected seed may be conditioned either by the grower or at an approved seed conditioning plant. 7. Conditioning by grower farmer/grower -Procedure. a. Condition the seed. A growex farmer/grower does not need an approved conditioning plant permit if the gxowex farmer/grower conditions seed on the growex's farmer's/growers premises. b. Complete section A of management. C. The designated samplex w\u00b1H: be -s-ent sampling instructions, sampler's report and sample bag-;-Complete section A of the grower's declaration, and sampler's report, sign, and mail to the state seed department at Fargo. 8. Conditioning at an approved plant. a. Growers must fill in grower's declaration -section B on%y or C. b. The completed grower's declaration should be presented to the manager of the approved conditioning plant when the seed is delivered for conditioning. c. After conditioning all seed is sampled by the authorized sampler in the plant. 9. Regulatory sampling. The state seed department may resample any lot of seed either before final certification or after the seed is tagged and sealed. 10. Laboratory analysis. a. All laboratory testing shall be done by qualified personnel of the state seed department. Analysis and tests of seed samples and definition of analysis terms shall be in accordance with the rules of the association of official seed analysis. b. If more than one sample of seed is tested from the same lot without additional conditioning, an average shall be taken of all tests made. 220 History: Amended effective May 1, 1986; May 1, certification privileges. Any seed grower, conditioner, or seedsman who is found guilty of misusing certification tags, misrepresenting seed, or who violates any of the rules governing the growing, conditioning, and marketing of foundation, registered, or certified seed, or who is guilty of violations of the North Dakota seed laws and rules with respect to any seed which the grower, conditioner, or seedsman sells, may at the discretion of the state seed commissioner or the commissioner's agents be denied the right to produce, condition, or market seed under certification.

General Authority: NDCC 4-09.1-02 Law Implemented: NDCC 4-09.1-02 241 242 TITLE 75 Department of Human Services 243 244 JUNE 1988 AGENCY SYNOPSIS: Section 75-02-06-12(1), Income to offset cost: The word \"restricted\" is deleted so as to permit interest or investment income to be earned on noncommingled gifts without any offsetting of those earnings against nursing home costs. 75-02-06-12. Adjustment to cost and cost limitation. Reasonable patient-related costs will be determined in accordance with health care financing administration manual 15 (HCFA-15) and instructions issued by the department. Any conflict between the provision of HCFA-15 and instructions issued by the department will be controlled by the instructions issued by the department. 1. Income to offset cost. a. Several items of income to the home will be considered as offsets against various costs as recorded in the books of the facility. Any income which is received by the home for reimbursements of cost, with the exception of the basic daily rate, income from payments made under the Job Training Partnership Act, and income from charges to private pay patients for care items which are included in the title XIX rate, will be offset against costs. Any reimbursement not listed below, which may be classified as an offset, must be shown as such on the cost report and costs reduced accordingly. Items of income, whether in cash or in any other form, to offset cost include, but are not limited to, the following and, in the event that income exceeds costs, must be offset to all costs on the basis of percentage of total remaining nonoffset costs: (1) \"Activities income\". Income from the activities department and the gift shop. 245 (2) 11Confections income11 All income from the sale of pop, candy, or other items. (3) 110ietary income11 Amounts received from or on behalf of employees, guests, or other nonpatients for lunches, meals, or snacks. ( 4) (5) 11Drugs or employees, patients. supplies doctors, income11 Amounts received from or others not admitted as 11Insurance recoveries income11 Any amount received from insurance for a loss incurred shall be offset against costs reported in the current year if the facility did not adjust the basis for depreciable assets. (6) 11Interest or investment income11 Interest received on investment except amounts allowable as funded depreciation or from earnings on noncommingled restricted gifts. (7) 11Laundry income11 All amounts received for services rendered to or on behalf of employees, doctors, or others. (8) 11Private duty nurse reimbursement11 All reimbursement received for the providing of a private duty nurse. (9) 11Purchase discounts11 All discounts received from vendors on purchases included in costs. (10) 11Rebates and refunds expense or cost items appropriate cost. income11 must be Amounts received on offset against the (11) 11Rentals of nursing home space income11 Any revenues received from outside sources for the use of nursing home space and equipment. (12) 11Telegraph and telephone income11 All revenues received from patients, guests, or employees. (13) All therapy and other professional services revenue unless services rendered to medical assistance program eligible patients and outpatients are identified and revenue from those services offset to the related cost. b. Payments to a provider by its vendor will be considered as discounts, refunds, or rebates in determining allowable costs under the program even though these payments may be 246 treated as 11contributions11 or 11unrestricted grants11 by the provider and the vendor. However, such payments may represent a true donation or grant. Examples include, but are not limited to, when: (1) they are made by a vendor in response to building or other fundraising campaigns in which\u00b7 communitywide contributions are solicited; (2) they are in addition to discounts, refunds, or rebates, which have been customarily allowed under arrangements between the provider and the vendor; (3) the volume or value of purchases is so nominal that no relationship to the contribution can be inferred; (4) the contributor is not engaged in business with the provider or a facility related to the provider. c. Where an owner or other official of a provider directly receives from a vendor monetary payments or goeds~ or services for the owners or official1s own personal use as a result of the providers purchases from the vendor, the value of such payments, goods, or services constitutes a type of refund or rebate and must be applied as a reduction of the providers costs for goods or services purchased from the vendor. d. Where the purchasing function for a provider is performed by a central unit or organization, all discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates must be credited to the costs of the provider in accordance with the instructions above. These should not be treated as income of the central purchasing function or used to reduce the administrative costs of that function. Such administrative costs are, however, properly allocable to the facilities serviced by the central purchasing function. e. Purchase discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates are reductions of the cost of whatever was purchased. (1) 11Purchase discounts11 include cash discounts, trade, and quantity discounts. 11Cash discount11 is for prepaying or paying within a certain time of receipt of invoice. 11Trade discount11 is a reduction of cost granted certain customers. 11Quantity discounts11 are reductions of price because of the size of the order. (2) Allowances are reductions granted or accepted by the creditor for damage, delay, shortage, imperfection, or other cause, excluding discounts and refunds. (3) Refunds are amounts paid back by the vendor generally in recognition of damaged shipments, overpayments, or returned purchases. 247 2. ( 4) Rebates represent refunds of a part of the cost of goods or services. (5) 110ther cost-related income11 includes amounts generated through the sale of a previously expensed i tern, e.g., supplies or equipment. Costs not appropriate maintaining activities. reimbursable following: related to patient care are costs which are not or necessary and proper in developing and the operation of patient care facilities and Such costs are not allowable in computing costs. They include, but are not limited to, the a. Costs which are unallowable when incurred by a facility are also unallowable for a home office and cannot be allocated to facilities in a chain organization. b. Certain corporate costs, such as stockholder servicing costs, organization costs, or reorganization costs are not related to patient care and are not allowable. c. Costs, in excess of forty-five dollars per bed per year, incurred in the form of dues, contributions, and advertising exclusive of personnel procurement. d. The full cost of items or services such as telephone, television, and radio which are located in patient accommodations and which are furnished solely for the personal comfort of the patients are not includable in allowable costs. e. Fundraising costs, including salaries, advertising, promotional or publicity costs incurred for such a purpose are not includable in allowable costs. f. The cost of any equipment, whether owned or leased, not exclusively used by the facility except to the extent that the facility demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the department, that any particular use of equipment was related to patient care. g. Costs, including, by way of illustration and not by way of limitation, legal fees, accounting and administrative costs, travel costs, and the costs of feasibility studies, attributed to the negotiation or settlement of the sale or purchase of any capital assets, whether by sale or merger, when the cost of the asset has been previously reported and included in the rate paid to any hospital or facility. h. Costs which are incurred bY the provider's subcontractors, or by the lessor of property which the provider leases, and which become an element in the subcontractor's or 248 lessors charge to the provider, if such costs would not have been allowable had they been incurred by a provider directly furnishing the subcontracted services, or owning the leased property, provided, however, that no facility shall have a particular item of cost disallowed under this subdivision if that cost arises out of a transaction which was completed before July 18, 1984. i. The cost of providing meals and lodging to nursing home personnel living on premises in excess of charges. j. Depreciation expense for facility assets which are not related to patient care. k. Expense or liabilities established through or under threat of litigation against the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies; provided that reasonable insurance ~xpense shall not be limited by this subdivision. 1. Non-long-term care operations and associated administrative costs. m. Medicare utilization review costs. 3. All costs for services reimbursed by the department directly to the provider, e.g., pharmacy and therapies, must be excluded from the rate calculation. 4. Travel costs involving the use of vehicles not exclusively used by the facility are allowable within the limits of this subsection. a. Vehicle travel costs may not exceed the amount authorized by North Dakota Century Code section 54-06-09 for mileage. b. The facility must support vehicle travel costs with sufficient documentation to establish that the purpose of the travel is related to patient care. c. The facility must document any payment made to service or support the use of a vehicle not exclusively used by the facility. 5. Travel costs other than vehicle-related costs are allowable provided the items of cost do not exceed the maximum allowed pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 44-08-04 and the facility supports the travel costs with sufficient documentation to establish that the purpose of the travel is related to patient care. 6. The fees paid to members of a board of directors for meetings attended shall be allowed in an amount not to exceed the compensation paid, per day, to members of the legislative 249 council, pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 54-35-10, plus travel at a rate not to exceed the maximum allowed pursuant to North Dakota Century Code sections 44-08-04 and 54-06-09. Normally, no more than twelve meetings per fiscal year will be considered reasonable. No additional compensation will be allowed for service of employees on the board of directors. 7. All plans within the definition of deferred compensation and pension plans set forth in HCFA-15 sections 2140.1 and 2142.1, respectively, shall be considered in the determination of allowable costs. No prov1s1ons of these plans may discriminate in favor of certain employees, such as employees who are officers, stockholders, supervisors, or highly paid personnel. In order to be considered an allowable cost, the payment reported must benefit all eligible employees and be based on the same payment structure. A plan approved by the United States department of labor as nondiscriminatory will be treated as acceptable under this subsection.
