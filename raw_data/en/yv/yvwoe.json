Providing access to vaccines, treatments, and tests in the commercial market is something that manufacturers, logistics companies, and payors do every day, addressing a broad range of diseases and conditions. Over the last year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken a series of actions to communicate to and engage with manufacturers, distributors, payors, states and local jurisdictions, territories, and other stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition of the purchase and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine to the commercial market in the fall of 2023. Vaccine ordering through USG processes will begin to phase out on August 3, with a formal transition to the commercial market expected in mid-to-late September, pending regulatory action by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Our commitment to equity and access continues during this transition to the commercial market, especially for the uninsured through the [HHS Bridge Access Program for Vaccines and Treatments](/about/news/2023/04/18/fact-sheet-hhs-announces-hhs-bridge-access-program-covid-19-vaccines-treatments-maintain-access-covid-19-care-uninsured.html). As we've made clear throughout this transition, nothing is immediately changing with regard to the public's access to vaccines. Everyone can still receive the COVID-19 vaccine at no-cost from their local provider or pharmacy, as has been the case for some time. And anyone who is high-risk and hasn't already received the latest vaccine should so as soon as possible to allow greater time to pass between receiving the current and new versions of the vaccine. It is the safest way to protect yourself from severe disease and hospitalization.
