Africa is poised to make a bold move that could turn around its fortunes in coronavirus vaccine manufacturing \u2014 taking the continent from import dependence to self-sufficient production of life-saving jabs for coronavirus, TB and maybe even one day for HIV. Two manufacturers are establishing an [mRNA vaccine technology-transfer hub](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1748773) at the tip of the continent that could let it produce its own vaccines, on its own terms. It's a way to address just how exposed countries are if they don't have their own vaccine manufacturing capacity. Africa imports about 99 percent of routine immunizations \u2014 and is the least vaccinated against coronavirus in the world. One counter-measure to address this dearth of vaccines kicked off in October 2020, when South Africa and India, scrambling for options, proposed an intellectual property waiver at the World Trade Organization. The move would allow lower-income countries to produce coronavirus vaccines without fear of infringing on patents. The proposal has remained deadlocked, with the EU being the major blocker. But even if the proposal were accepted, it wouldn't address one important problem \u2014 how to actually produce the vaccines. You may like That's how another idea took off: The World Health Organization pitched an mRNA tech-transfer hub that would let multiple companies share the knowledge of how to produce vaccines from start to finish. Even French President Emmanuel Macron [gave his stamp](https://www.who.int/news/item/21-06-2021-who-supporting-south-african-consortium-to-establish-first-covid-mrna-vaccine-technology-transfer-hub) of approval. Two South African companies have been chosen as the initial partners for the first hub \u2014 Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines and Biovac. Afrigen will take the role of trainer in chief and transfer the technology for the mRNA vaccines to other sites, the first being Biovac. The choice of mRNA technology was also no coincidence. Before the pandemic, no vaccine or therapy produced using mRNA technology had ever been approved. But the runaway success of the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines convinced the EU to completely pivot to mRNA for future supplies. Its promise goes beyond coronavirus and holds the potential for applications related to cancer, Ebola or HIV. But it's exactly this potential that makes pharmaceutical companies all the more keen to cling to their newly minted technology even more tightly. And therein lies the rub: To get the hub up and running in a year \u2014 when it could still help end the pandemic \u2014 its partners need Big Pharma's help. And Big Pharma isn't keen: Neither Moderna nor Pfizer has signaled interest in working with the facility. The two drugmakers also declined to comment to POLITICO on their potential involvement. Pharma is playing \"a really dangerous game,\" warned Jaume Vidal, senior policy advisor for European projects at Health Action International. He believes that its actions are, in effect, \"condemning thousands.\" From theory to practice Through the hub, the WHO aims to bring together companies with knowledge of how to produce mRNA vaccines \u2014 ideally a drugmaker that has one already approved \u2014 with manufacturers that can be trained to produce the vaccine. In this instance, Afrigen would be in the middle, helping to transfer the technology from an mRNA vaccine developer to other manufacturers, with the support of a network of universities and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It's not the first time the WHO has done this. A similar technology-transfer program for influenza vaccines has led to [hundreds of millions of extra flu jabs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357709/) since 2007. Under the terms set out by the WHO, there are two ways the hub can use the technology: It either needs to be free of intellectual property constraints in low- and middle-income countries, or it can make such rights available to recipients through non-exclusive licenses to produce, export and distribute the COVID-19 vaccine in these countries. Marie-Paule Kieny, director of research at Inserm and chair of the U.N.-backed Medicines Patent Pool \u2014 a hub partner \u2014 argues it isn't going to run roughshod over existing licensing agreements. Pointing to other partnerships done by the Medicines Patent Pool \u2014 whose work includes signing agreements with patent holders for 13 HIV antiretrovirals \u2014 Kieny said it's aware of Pharma's concerns about competition, and that most of the time, a license is limited to a certain territory. This means, for example, that an mRNA vaccine produced in South Africa wouldn't be marketed or imported to the U.K. Petro Terblanche, managing director of Afrigen, also sees the terms being decided on a \"case by case basis,\" adding: \"It's in none of our interests to infringe. This will be done in agreement.\" The choice of South Africa was also deliberate. \"The due diligence, which was conducted by both by the Medicines Patent Pool and by WHO, indicates at this moment that there is no IP barrier in South Africa for the production of mRNA vaccines,\" Kieny said. That means that there is currently no patent application for an mRNA vaccine in the country, even though a patent application could still emerge, she added. This distinction is important: While the hub could potentially go hand in hand with the waiver, it's not predicated on it. If implemented, the waiver would simply allow time for production to go on. But because a waiver is time-limited for the pandemic, it wouldn't override the eventual need for a voluntary or compulsory licensing. Losing control Aside from the legal fine print, there's a bigger problem. Big Pharma isn't convinced that companies would accept the terms of the hub. Thomas Cueni, director general of international pharma lobby IFPMA, said the debate needs to \"be honest in expectation management.\" While he said industry shares the objective of ensuring global equitable access, \"you need to be pragmatic in terms of accepting that companies are not going for total sellout\" and engage in tech transfer and voluntary licensing. Drugmakers need to have high trust that \"the recipient of the tech transfer, the licensing, has the skilled workforce, skilled people, and they can be trusted to stick to the agreements,\" he explained. The WHO also could have done a better job, he added, noting he only heard about the hub when the press release promoting it landed in his inbox. To Alain Alsalhani, a pharmacist for Doctors Without Borders for nine years, the basic fact remains that Big Pharma won't do anything without direct benefit. So if drugmakers want to share their technology with a manufacturer in Africa as a form of \"social responsibility\" or a way to improve their public image, \"they can do it bilaterally,\" he said. \"They get the good press ... but they also hold complete control over everything,\" he added. \"What they see in the hub is clearly a way for them to lose control over [their] technology.\" He made those comments to POLITICO in early July. Just two weeks later, his prediction came true. On July 21, Pfizer and BioNTech announced their [bilateral plans for expansion in Africa](https://www.politico.eu/article/south-african-company-to-help-produce-biontech-pfizer-vaccine-for-africa/), with Biovac set to complete the final stage of production \u2014 or \"fill and finish\" \u2014 of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine in 2022. While the initiative was welcomed, many access groups pointed out that fill and finish operations alone [keep Africa reliant on Europe](https://msfaccess.org/covid-19-vaccines-pfizer-biontech-and-biovac-fill-and-finish-deal-step-right-direction-much-more) for the actual drug substance. Future proof Even the hub's advocates concede they have to play the long game. Tech transfer is slow, and neither Afrigen nor Biovac has experience in mRNA technology. It's likely to take a year for the first vaccines to be produced if an existing technology is provided by manufacturers, and 18 months if the hub needs to use an mRNA vaccine still in development. Is it even worth it, then, if the earliest of these jabs trickle in is mid-2022? Kieny says it definitely is, pointing out that mRNA coronavirus vaccines may well be needed for booster doses or periodic vaccination. And to Terblanche, it's about more than this pandemic \u2014 the ambition in choosing mRNA as the platform is to go for a \"next-generation, future relevant technology.\" The involvement of Big Pharma would be welcome, but the hub will go ahead without them if need be \u2014 and the platform needs to survive post-pandemic. \"It has to be a multipurpose and a multi-product platform,\" she said, indicating that [flu](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participant-dosed-phase-12-study-its), [TB](https://scrip.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/SC144741/TB-Vaccine-Development-COVID19-Pathways-mRNA-Tech-Hold-Hope), [HIV](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-clinical-progress-its-industry-leading-mrna) and Ebola were all areas that would be explored. \"It's going to take time; this is not a sprint,\" she said. Terblanche spoke to POLITICO before BioNTech's announcement on Monday that it plans to work with the hub \u2014 or its future iterations \u2014 for its mRNA malaria vaccine that's still in development. BioNTech will assess multiple vaccine candidates, with the most promising being selected. It's hoped that the first candidate would go to clinical trials at the end of 2022. This is why activists like Vidal are excited about the hub's potential \u2014 it could mean that in the future, there might be African manufacturers of mRNA vaccines for TB or malaria. \"That's why it's so important that this hub is successful,\" he said. And for all the mystique around mRNA vaccines, the technology is actually fairly simple to use, said Kieny. Crucially, it can also be harnessed by manufacturers of drugs, not just those with experience in biologicals. Scaling up production using the technology is also less complex, as Pfizer's dramatic ramp-up of production in Europe this past spring showed. Playing politics? The hub hasn't only been hounded by questions of whether a pharma company will join, but whether it has the necessary expertise to succeed. IFPMA's Cueni, for one, is doubtful of the WHO's ability to run it. While the Medicines Patent Pool has been successful in building up trust around licensing agreements, he thinks the WHO \"has a long way to go to gain that trust.\" \"They're playing too much politics and their operational track record is not too impressive in the field,\" he said. Cueni was similarly scathing of the process by which the WHO created the hub, saying that it was created \"unilaterally without any consultation.\" He views it as almost the same as C-TAP, a technology-transfer initiative launched by the WHO in May 2020, that no pharmaceutical company has signed up to. \"What is their strategy? Are they floating these ideas in the hope that companies will sign up? In which case they will be the heroes [because] they announced it? Or if it fails, they can make us the villains because we didn't do so?\" he asked. A WHO spokesperson declined to address Cueni's assertions directly. But he noted the WHO will \"continue to urge all pharmaceutical groups to do more to break the inequity, which means sharing licenses, technology and know-how, and waiving intellectual property temporarily.\" HAI's Vidal, meanwhile, agrees with Cueni on one point \u2014 that the work of the hub and C-TAP not only overlap, but could contradict each other. \"That's something that should be avoided at all costs,\" he said. However, those involved in the hub argue that while C-TAP's main focus was on patents, the hub is about sharing technology and training others to use it. As for questions about whether two small South African companies have the expertise, Terblanche is undaunted by the monumental challenge ahead. \"I think it's fair for the critics to say 'wow, so how are these guys going to do it?'\" she said. \"We don't underestimate the challenge and we know the ambition is massive,\" said Terblanche. But she says that people do underrate the knowledge base in South Africa. Just in her small team of about 15, there are over 60 academic degrees between them. They're running at high energy at the moment, she said with a laugh: \"We're going to crash sometime down the line, but not before this hub is done.\" Update: This article has been updated with the announcement of BioNTech's plans for an mRNA malaria vaccine.
