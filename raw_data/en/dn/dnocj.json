This relatively new breakthrough in vaccinology has established itself as a promising alternative to traditional vaccination methods because it is [safe for immunocompromised patients](https://www.henryford.com/blog/2021/01/mrna-technology-vaccines), is cost-effective, and can be quickly manufactured. Today more than [535 million](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total) COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been administered, and based on an independent analysis by the FDA, mRNA vaccines have demonstrated as high as [95% efficacy](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison). To build on this momentum of success, leading biotech companies are rapidly exploring opportunities to leverage mRNA technology with the goal of developing novel vaccinations and immunotherapy treatments that protect against a variety of harmful illnesses. Understanding mRNA Vaccines [Traditional vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/understanding-vacc-work.html) use a small or weakened strain of a virus to imitate an infection, prompting the immune system to produce protective antibodies that help the body recognize and fight off the disease in the future. [mRNA vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html) do not use the live virus. Instead, they are created using a small piece of the virus's mRNA that contains instructions for our bodies to create specific proteins. These proteins trigger the production of the antibodies that defend the body when faced with the real virus. Because mRNA vaccines do not need to use a live virus, they are typically a safer option for high-risk patients and can be manufactured through a streamlined method within a single facility. The Road to mRNA Vaccine Development Though mRNA therapies may appear to be new, cutting-edge technology, their initial development is the outcome of decades of scientific research. A [significant breakthrough](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-it-takes-to-achieve-world-changing-scientific-breakthroughs-202111162638) in their development came in the 1990s when Dr. Katalin Karik\u00f3 and her colleague Drew Weissman successfully minimized the body's violent response to exposure of a virus's mRNA while still allowing it to stimulate the immune system\u2014an obstacle that had prevented the advancement of mRNA therapies for years. Meanwhile, a husband-and-wife team of scientists, Uur ahin and zlem Tur\u00ebci, [refocused their extensive research](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-couples-quest-to-cure-cancer-led-to-the-wests-first-covid-19-vaccine-11606905001) around mRNA therapies intended for cancer patients to instead address the pressing needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, developing new medicines and clinical treatments is a complex and lengthy process, with the [path to market approval](https://newatlas.com/science/mrna-revolution-vaccine-covid-therapy-pandemic-future-cancer/) layered in numerous clinical trials and significant expense. However, the COVID-19 crisis called for a rapid response from biotech and clinical leaders worldwide. Through innovation, collaboration, and increased funding, these leaders were able to use existing mRNA research to accelerate the development, testing, manufacture, and distribution of the highly successful mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to the public. Will Emerging mRNA Technology Herald a New Era for Vaccinology? In today's biotech landscape, the possibilities presented by the success of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine are extremely promising. Clinical research is already underway to develop mRNA therapies that could treat or prevent a host of [additional harmful diseases](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/the-current-landscape-of-mrna-vaccines-in-clinical-research-0001) and conditions, including influenza, HIV, Lyme disease, Ebola, Zika virus, and even cancer. Furthermore, clinical researchers are exploring the role mRNA could play in [the production of proteins](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-are-mrna-vaccines-so-exciting-2020121021599) which are missing in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and sickle cell anemia. This new era of vaccinology represents an exciting medical advancement with the potential to profoundly impact how clinicians protect and care for their patients. "}
