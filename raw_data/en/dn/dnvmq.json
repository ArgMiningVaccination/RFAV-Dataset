Our research enables us to continually improve the care we offer and to contribute to the advancement of primary care knowledge and practices. We conduct and participate in national research on innovative strategies to enhance the utilization of integrative practice in health disparity populations. From the development of new technology to the creation of interprofessional curricula and competencies, the IFH is a leader in professional development and patient education to improve the care received by all primary care patients. While the Institute engages in a wide variety of research projects, we have focused efforts in several key research areas: - Racial and ethnic health disparities - Patient-centered care - Health information technology - Integration of mental health care and primary care - Women's health The IFH's practice sites, providers, and organizational leaders comprise a primary care-based research network registered with the Agency for Health Care Quality and Research. We foster and support research that is initiated by individual clinicians, including family practice residents, as well as broader, organizational-level projects implemented across all practice sites. Each of our three family medicine residency programs has a required research curriculum through which residents complete a wide range of research projects under the supervision of a faculty member. Institute research projects, as well as service and project grants with rigorous evaluation requirements, have received support from the National Institutes of Health, Agency for Health Care Quality and Research, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Resources and Services Administration, New York State Department of Health, and a variety of private foundations. The research conducted by Institute staff and residency faculty has resulted in numerous publications in a range of medical journals, including JAMA, Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, and Journal of Healthcare for the Poor and Underserved. Institute staff have also published health policy articles, book chapters, commentaries, and letters to the editor on issues related to primary care and care for the underserved.
