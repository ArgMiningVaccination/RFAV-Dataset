A child with a cancer diagnosis may have additional nutritional needs or challenges. Speak to your child's healthcare team about any foods that should be avoided or any special precautions that should be taken. Some foods can interact with cancer treatments or make them less effective. Good nutrition during cancer treatment can help your child feel better, avoid treatment delays and recover faster. Nutrition for Children. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends for anyone aged 2 years and older to include the following foods in their menus: {A variety of vegetables and fruits {Whole grains {Low-fat dairy products {A variety of protein foods, including plant proteins {Oils The guidelines also recommend limiting saturated and trans-fat, added sugars and sodium. Infants and toddlers under 2 years of age have different nutritional needs. A child's nutritional needs depend on their age, sex, and health. A child who is receiving cancer treatment may need additional calories or protein. To get specific recommendations for your child's nutritional needs, talk to your child's healthcare team and ask for a referral to a registered dietitian with expertise in pediatric oncology nutrition. Strategies to Encourage Healthy Food Choices. Children develop eating habits early in life and carry these habits into adulthood. All children should learn how to make good food choices. You can use the following strategies to teach your children healthy eating habits: {Be a role model. One of the best ways you can teach your child good nutrition and lifestyle habits is to follow them yourself. Let your child see you eating a lot of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats and lean proteins. {During your child's treatment, take care of yourself by making good food choices, too. Proper nutrition can provide you with more energy and reduce your risk for diseases. {Include your child in food preparation and other kitchen activities. As age-appropriate, let your child help with grocery shopping, food preparation and meal planning. For example, let younger children pick out the produce at the store. Let older children help stir pots or measure spices. Your child will learn important life skills and gain a new appreciation for food. Picky eaters may even be more likely to try a new food if they have helped to prepare it.WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK ONE-ON-ONE WITH A REGISTERED DIETITIAN? To schedule a personalized nutrition consultation, visit www.LLS.org/nutrition or contact an LLS Information Specialist at (800) 955-4572. Nutrition advice is everywhere, but it's not all good information. Be cautious of nutrition advice that you find online, in magazines or advertisements and advice offered by well-meaning family members and friends. Make sure you get nutrition information from a reliable source by talking to a registered dietitian. TIP:NUTRITION9Visit www.LLS.org/FamilyWorkbook to access all chapters and worksheets.2 l WWW.LLS.ORG/FamilyWorkbook {Eat together as a family. Share meals together as a family. When planning a meal, try to make dishes that everyone enjoys, but do not fall into the trap of being a short-order cook for your child by preparing completely separate meals just for them. (Bear in mind that if your child is receiving cancer treatment, they may have specific dietary needs. In this case, separate meals may be necessary.) {Introduce foods again, again and again. If your child doesn't like a food the first time you serve it, try again. Children may need to try a food many times before they begin to enjoy it. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggests it may take up to 15 tries before a child accepts a new food. {Encourage a colorful plate. Children often gravitate toward high-carb, starchy or bland foods, such as chicken nuggets, macaroni, fries and bread. Teach your child to eat a rainbow of foods\u2014not just brown or tan ones. Eating a variety of different colored fruits and vegetables is a good way to get many different healthy nutrients. Half the plate should be filled with vegetables and fruits. {Make fruits and vegetables available. Leave whole fruits, such as apples or bananas, out for your child. Keep cut up fruits and veggies in the fridge. If healthy snacks are readily available, your child is more likely to eat them. Remember: Follow appropriate food safety guidelines. {Limit buying packaged, processed snacks. Similarly, do not keep snacks with little nutritional value, such as cookies, candy and chips, in your home. If they are available, your child will eat them and ignore other healthier options. {Follow a plant-based menu. You do not need to serve meat with every meal. In fact, it is best to include a variety of protein sources in your menus, such as beans, peas, soy, legumes, nuts, nut butters and seeds. Make mealtimes exciting for your child by doing \"Meatless Mondays\" or choosing another set night for vegetarian meals. {Add \"secret\" vegetables. Add extra vegetables to dishes your child already enjoys so they will eat more of them. For example, add mushrooms, zucchini or carrots to spaghetti. {Keep your child hydrated. Provide water to keep your child hydrated. If your child doesn't like plain water, offer them water with slices of fruits or sparkling water for its fizz. Avoid sodas and other sugary drinks. Some \"fruit drinks\" branded for children have a lot of added sugar. Watch out for them and choose 100% fruit juice instead. {Reduce the risk of choking. Young children are at a high risk of choking while eating. You can help reduce your child's risk by: {Cutting food into small pieces {Serving soft foods that are easy to chew and swallow {Removing seeds, pits, and bones from food before serving {Supervising children during meals and snacks {Avoid using food as a reward. Typically, candy, desserts or other sweet snacks are used as rewards. These items generally have little nutritional value and may take the place of other foods with more nutritional value. Use stickers or verbal praise instead to reward your child. {Teach your child to avoid alcohol. Talk to your teenager about alcohol use, even if you believe they do not drink. It may be dangerous to consume alcohol while taking certain medications or receiving certain cancer treatments. Alcohol also contributes to dehydration, and it provides no nutritional benefits. {If adults in the home drink alcohol, keep all alcoholic beverages in a secure location to prevent your child from getting them. Any adult caring for your child should refrain from drinking unless another adult is present to administer medications to your child and/or in case of an emergency. If you worry about how much a loved one drinks, visit https://al-anon.org/ or ask members of the healthcare team for resources. While your child is receiving cancer treatment, it may be neither possible nor practical to follow all of these suggestions. Your child may experience side effects that make eating difficult. The healthcare team may provide specific guidelines to follow. Modify nutrition strategies as needed.TIP:NUTRITION l 3Vitamins and Supplements. Food is the best source for the vitamins and nutrients your child needs. However, during cancer treatment your child may have difficulty getting enough calcium and vitamin D, both of which are important to build strong bones. Ask your child's doctor or a registered dietitian if your child needs a multivitamin or some other supplement. Do not give your child any vitamins or supplements without consulting your child's healthcare team first. Some vitamins and supplements can interfere with cancer treatment.

Malnutrition. Malnutrition is a common but serious concern for children who have cancer. Side effects from treatment, such as a sore mouth, nausea or loss of appetite, can make eating difficult or unpleasant for your child. A child will become malnourished if they are not receiving or absorbing proper nutrition (the right amount of calories or nutrients needed for healthy bodily function). Your child will become malnourished if they are not eating enough, not eating the right foods, or if their digestive system cannot absorb and use food efficiently. Children with cancer who are diagnosed with malnutrition are at greater risk for health complications, hospitalizations, infections, loss of muscle strength and poor quality of life. To decrease the risk of malnutrition, your child should avoid losing weight during treatment unless advised to do so by the healthcare team. Losing weight can lower your child's energy levels and ability to fight infection. Watch for the signs of malnutrition in your child. Signs of malnutrition include: {Unintentional weight loss {For infants and toddlers, no increase in weight can also be a sign of malnutrition. {Loss of appetite {Changes in food intake {Side effects that make eating difficult for your child Take this short quiz to see if your child may be at risk for malnutrition. Check either Yes or No for each question. NUTRITION STATUS YES NO Has your child lost weight in last few weeks/months? Or, has your child not met weight and growth expectations based on age and sex? Is your child eating less due to decreased appetite? Has your child's food intake changed? Do side effects make it difficult for your child to eat (eg, nausea, taste changes, mouth sores, trouble swallowing, diarrhea, constipation, dental issues)? Does your child no longer enjoy mealtimes as much as they did before cancer? If you checked \"Yes\" to one or more of the questions above, alert the healthcare team. Your child may be at risk for malnutrition. Ask for a referral to a registered dietitian who specializes in pediatric oncology nutrition for strategies to improve your child's nutrition status.4 l WWW.LLS.ORG/FamilyWorkbook Food Safety. Cancer and cancer treatment weaken your child's immune system. It is important to pay special attention to food safety guidelines to reduce your child's risk of being exposed to potentially harmful bacteria from spoiled or undercooked foods. Preparing Food for Your Child. Following these guidelines while preparing food will reduce the risk of foodborne illness. Share them with children who may be preparing some meals and snacks on their own. Keep Everything Clean. {Wash hands often and thoroughly, especially before and after handling any food. Be sure to wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. Pay special attention to fingernails and the backs of the hands. {Keep raw and cooked foods separate. Do not reuse any utensils, cutting boards, plates or dishes once they have been touched by raw meat or eggs. Utensils, cutting boards, plates and dishes, that have been used for preparing raw meats or eggs should be washed in hot, soapy water. It is best to keep one cutting board for meat and another for fruits/vegetables. Have an extra clean cutting board available for additional preparation as well. {Rinse fruits and vegetables before cutting or peeling them. Clean the lids of canned foods before opening them. {Disinfect all food preparation surfaces, including sinks and countertops, both before and after cooking. Use an antibacterial kitchen cleaner and paper towels or bleach wipes. {If you use dish clothes or sponges, replace or wash them frequently. Avoid Foods Associated with Foodborne Illness. In addition to undercooked meat, these foods include: {Unpasteurized beverages, such as unpasteurized juice or raw milk {Unpasteurized cheeses such as soft mold-ripened and blue-veined cheeses, including Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola and blue {You may be able to find pasteurized versions of these cheeses which are safe to consume, unless otherwise directed by the healthcare team. Check the label. {Raw sprouts, such as alfalfa sprouts {Well water, unless tested, filtered or boiled for 1 minute before drinking or boiled for 3 minutes before drinking in altitudes of about 2,000 meters (about 6,562 feet or higher). {Ice from ice machines in public places {Frozen drinks, soft-serve ice cream, or frozen yogurt from bulk machines {Open drinks left at room temperature for 1 hour or more {Spices added after cooking {Berries (All other washed fruits, or any that are cooked or canned, are okay.) {Unwashed fruits and vegetables Review this list with members of the healthcare team.NUTRITION l 5Cook Food Thoroughly. {Avoid raw and/or undercooked meats, fish and eggs (for example, sushi, undercooked eggs, and other meats that have not been cooked to a proper internal temperature). {Cook eggs until both the white and the yolk are firm. Avoid foods that may contain raw eggs, such as raw cookie dough, homemade mayonnaise and homemade Caesar dressing. {Use a meat thermometer to make sure that all meats are cooked to the proper internal temperature before they are eaten. Use the chart below for reference.

Source: FoodSafety.gov by the US Department of Health & Human Services6 l WWW.LLS.ORG/FamilyWorkbook Store Food Safely. {Always store cold foods and leftovers within 1 hour of purchasing or cooking or as soon as possible. {Discard leftovers or open packages within 2 days. If you are unsure if something is safe to eat, remember, WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT. {Label cold food packages (use a marker or pen) with a \"use by\" date if the packaging does not have an expiration date. Visit www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/cold-food-storage-charts for more guidelines. {Put foods with the soonest expiration date at the front of the fridge or shelves so that you are more likely to use them. {Do not thaw food at room temperature. Thaw in the refrigerator, under cold water or in the microwave. Be Careful When Eating in Restaurants. {Buy only from trusted vendors with high grades in health department inspections. {Avoid buying food from street vendors. {Do not eat free food samples when shopping. {Do not choose restaurants with buffets when eating out. If you are at a party, ask if your child can go through the buffet line first. {At restaurants, ask for meat to be prepared well done. {If you are going to take home leftovers, ask to bag the food yourself and make sure to refrigerate the leftovers quickly. If You Suspect a Foodborne Illness. If your child or anyone living in your home gets a foodborne illness, have a plan. Alert the healthcare team as soon as possible. Symptoms of foodborne illness include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and/or stomach cramps. Mark any recently eaten food or beverage as \"do not eat.\" Keep the containers in the fridge in case the healthcare team wants to test any of the foods. Teaching Your Child About Food Safety. You may not always be with your children when they are eating. Here are simple things you can teach all your children about food safety. {Wash your hands regularly. Your children should wash their hands frequently, especially before eating, after using the bathroom, after playing with other children or pets or playing outside. Teach your children to wash their hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds by counting to 20 slowly or singing the ABCs. {Keep food on the plate. Don't put food or snacks on dirty surfaces such as counters, tables, and floors. Even if it looks clean, it may not be. Always use clean plates or napkins. {Rinse fruits and veggies with water before eating or cutting. Rinsing fruits and vegetables helps remove any remaining dirt or germs. {Some foods need to stay cold. You probably already know which foods need to stay in the refrigerator or freezer, but your children may not. Let your children know where specific foods belong in your kitchen. Remind your children to always shut the refrigerator and freezer doors. {Always store food properly. Give your children instructions on how to store food safely, such as always closing lids tightly or sealing the ziplock bag. Do not leave any foods uncovered or out in the open. {Pack school lunches safely. Use an insulated lunch bag and pack an ice pack or frozen drink to keep cold foods cold. Keep the lunch bag out of direct sunlight. After school, wipe out the bag with a disinfecting wipe. Tell your children to throw away anything they didn't eat at lunch. Do not save cold foods to be eaten later in the day. {Do not share food with others. If your child is immunocompromised, tell your child not to share food or drinks with other people. Unless the person is an adult who has washed their hands, do not eat food that other people have touched. Do not eat food that another person has bitten. If someone asks for your food, politely tell the person \"No.\" NUTRITION l 7 {WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT. Teach your children that if something has a bad smell or has been in the refrigerator or pantry for a long time, it may not be safe to eat. Tell them to check the expiration date or ask an adult to check it for them. If they are unsure about a food, they must not eat it. Even foods that don't look, taste, or smell bad can contain harmful bacteria. {Talk about which foods to avoid. Review the list of foods to avoid (see page 4) with your child so that they can decline them if you are not there. Visit the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) at www.nutrition.gov/audience/children/kids-food-safety to find activities, games, and resources to teach your children about food safety. Neutropenia and Diet. \"Neutropenia\" is a condition characterized by lower-than-normal numbers of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that helps fight infection). If your child has neutropenia, the healthcare team may recommend following special food guidelines for immunosuppressed patients. The guidelines will spell out ways to protect your child from bacteria and other harmful organisms found in some food and drinks. If your child has had a stem cell transplant, their diet restrictions may be stricter than those of other patients who received chemotherapy alone without a transplant. Members of the healthcare team may refer to these guidelines as a \"neutropenic diet\" or you may encounter the term elsewhere. This diet was supposed to help patients with neutropenia to learn how to decrease exposure to bacteria and other harmful organisms found in some foods; however, a universally-accepted definition of what foods should be included or excluded was never developed. In a review of studies, the neutropenic diet was never proven to decrease exposure to bacteria in food. Safer preparation and handling of foods is more important than restricting the intake of specific food groups because a balanced diet and optimal nutrition are the most significant concerns for patients who are coping with chemotherapy and other treatments. Food guidelines for immunosuppressed patients vary among cancer centers. Ask the healthcare team for any special instructions for your child. Managing Side Effects With Nutrition . Children with a cancer diagnosis may face challenges when it comes to nutrition. Side effects from cancer treatment, such as nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite or mouth sores, can make it difficult to make good food choices or eat enough nutrient-rich foods. During and after cancer treatment, children may lose weight or develop more slowly. Children may also gain weight due to corticosteroid treatment or decreased activity levels. Ask your child's doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian who specializes in pediatric oncology nutrition. Track Side Effects and Food Intake. By tracking and recording your child's food intake and side effects, you may be able to identify food and/or behaviors that make side effects worse. Then you can adjust mealtimes and your child's diet accordingly. For example, {Does a large breakfast keep your child energized throughout the day? {Is a certain food causing gas or diarrhea? You can also share this record with members of the healthcare team and discuss side-effect management. 8 l WWW.LLS.ORG/FamilyWorkbook Use Worksheet 13: Food Intake and Side-Effects Log. LLS Health ManagerTMApp. With LLS Health ManagerTM, you can now use your phone to manage your child's daily health by tracking side effects, medication, food and hydration, questions for the doctor, grocery lists and more. You can also set up reminders to take medications and to eat/drink throughout the day. Visit www.LLS.org/HealthManager to download. Tips to Boost Food Intake. During cancer treatment, your child may have difficulty eating. Your child may experience nausea and/or vomiting. Mouth sores may make eating painful. Treatment can change your child's sense of taste and smell so that they may turn down foods once enjoyed or decide that new foods taste better. Your child may not have much of an appetite or desire for any food. Always alert your child's healthcare team to new or worsening side effects. The following tips can help you to increase your child's food intake and manage side effects: {Regularly offer favorite, easily tolerated foods. Even if your child says they are not hungry, seeing the food may spark an appetite. If your child asks for a specific food, try to provide it when possible. {Your child's tastes may also change so they may turn down foods that were once favorites or request new foods. {Note when your child's appetite is at its best. Provide as much nutritious food as possible during this time. {Always keep snacks available in case your child does feel hungry. If your child is in school, ask your child's teacher to allow your child to eat snacks during class. {Make mealtimes fun; eat together as a family; have a \"picnic\" in the living room or backyard; use colorful plates and cups or plates with favorite cartoon characters. (Stick with plastic utensils. Metal utensils can leave a metallic taste in the mouth.) {Get rid of distractions, such as toys and games, and switch off the TV at mealtimes. {Praise good eating. {Do not force your child to eat or to clean the plate. It may make them feel sick and make eating even less appealing. {Keep strong odors that may trigger nausea away from your child. Use cups with lids and straws. Serve foods at room temperature, as hot foods tend to have a stronger smell. {Let your child sip liquids between meals, instead of at meals, to leave more room for food. {Add extra calories to dishes by adding high-calorie foods. For example, use whole milk in cereal, add cheese to cooked vegetables, or dip apple slices in peanut butter. {If your child is struggling with mouth sores, prepare soft, bland foods that are easier to eat. Cold foods, such as popsicles, smoothies and milkshakes, can also help soothe a sore mouth. Avoid foods that are too hot as they can irritate the sores. {If your child has trouble swallowing, serve moist foods, such as bananas, applesauce, cooked vegetables, gelatin, soups, pudding and ice cream. Cut foods into small pieces, as needed. {Provide foods that promote healthy bowel function, especially if your child experiences constipation. High-fiber foods include whole grains, beans, lentils and the skins of fruits and vegetables. Encourage your child to drink extra liquids after eating high-fiber foods to aid in digestion. {If your child experiences diarrhea, avoid high-fiber, spicy, fried or high-fat foods. Choose white rice, applesauce, cooked vegetables, and low-fat meat and dairy instead. To stay hydrated, your child should drink lots of clear liquids, such as water, ginger ale, sports drinks or electrolyte replacement drinks. Call the healthcare team if your child's diarrhea is severe as children can become dehydrated quickly. {Ask members of the healthcare team or a registered dietitian if your child would benefit from a liquid nutrition supplement drink.NUTRITION l 9 {Practice good dental and mouth care as directed by members of your child's healthcare team. The mouth is the first stop for turning food into fuel. Check with your child's cancer treatment team before scheduling any visits to the dentist. A child in cancer treatment may need to take special precautions at the dentist. To learn more about side-effect management, see Side Effects and Supportive Care.

With children and the demands of everyday life, it may be hard to find time to go to the grocery store. Here is where friends and family members can really provide help. Ask a friend or family member to go to the grocery store for you. Provide a list and arrange a drop-off time. If you are going to do the grocery shopping yourself, the following tips can make the trip easier: {Shop with a list. Make copies of a standardized grocery list, which includes perishables such as milk and bread. Add to it each week. Include in-season fruits and veggies and add any new items you will need to accommodate special dietary needs or guidelines provided by the healthcare team. Use Worksheet 11: Grocery List to put together and maintain a fully stocked pantry. {Keep cold foods at a safe temperature until you are able to put them in your own refrigerator or freezer. {Shop when the temperature outside is cooler (for example, earlier in the day). {Bring a cooler for refrigerated or frozen foods. {Choose room temperature items first. Pick up your cold and frozen foods right before you pay. {Learn more about organic foods. For the word \"organic\" to be on a label, the product must meet certain United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-approved guidelines. Organic produce has been grown without the use of most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Organic meat comes from animals that are raised in living conditions that accommodate their natural behaviors, fed organic food, and not given antibiotics or hormones. Keep in mind there is no definitive research that says organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods. Eating a variety of plant-based foods whether organic or conventional is what's important. Organic foods can also be more expensive You may be able to find budget-friendly organic foods at farmers' markets. Finding a source for local produce means your produce is picked at peak freshness and only travels a short distance to market. {Use coupons. Look online and in the newspaper for coupons. Some specialty products can be pricey. Check out the product's website for coupons or contact the manufacturer. {Save the receipt to keep track of how much you spend. Record the amount in your budget later. {Shop when stores are not likely to be crowded. The grocery store may be less crowded early in the day on weekdays, as many people tend to shop after work or on weekends.10 l WWW.LLS.ORG/FamilyWorkbook {Check out food delivery and pickup services. Many grocery stores now offer pickup and/or delivery services. You send a list to the store ahead of time. A store employee then puts together your grocery order. Once your groceries are ready, you go to the store, and an employee loads them into your car. Some online retailers also offer food delivery services. {Coordinate meals with friends and family members. Friends and family members may want to help you to prepare meals or provide meals. Keep a list on the refrigerator of who will bring what and when. You can also use online resources to help with meal planning and coordination. Use an app or check an online site to coordinate delivery of meals from family members and friends. {TakeThemAMeal.com {Meal Train ( www.mealtrain.com) {CareCalendar (www.carecalendar.org) Use Worksheet 14: Meal Planning to plan meals in advance. Meal and Snack Ideas. Meals and snacks do not have to be elaborate to be healthy and nutritious. Combine foods from different groups, such as protein, fruits, vegetables or complex carbs to create a complete meal. Try some of the following easy meal and snack ideas that require minimal cooking. Keep in mind that these meals and snacks are only suggestions. Make changes, as necessary, to accommodate food allergies or to follow nutrition guidelines provided by your child's healthcare team.
