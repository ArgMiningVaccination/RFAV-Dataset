Cigna Connect 700-4 MIHM0255 2 THIS IS AN HMO EOC That means this EOC does not provide benefits for a ny services you receive from an Out-of-Network Provider except: Services for Stabilization and initial treatment o f a Medical Emergency, or Medically Necessary services that are not availabl e through an In-Network Provider In-Network Providers include Physicians, Hospitals, and Other Health Care Facilities. Check the provid er directory, available on www.mycigna.com, or call th e number on Your ID card to determine if a Provider is In- Network. Choosing a Primary Care Physician (PCP) A Primary Care Physician may serve an important rol e in meeting health care needs by providing or arranging for medical care for each Member. For thi s reason, when you enroll as a Member, you will be asked to select a Primary Care Physician (\"PCP\"). Y our PCP will provide your regular medical care and assist in coordinating your care. You may select yo ur PCP by calling the customer service phone number on your ID card or by visiting Our website at www.m ycigna.com. The Primary Care Physician You select for Yourself may be different from the Primary Care Physician You select for each of Your Family Member(s). You have the right to designate any Prim ary Care Physician who participates in Our network for this plan and is available to accept You or You r Family Members. If you do not choose a PCP, We wi ll select a PCP for you. Referrals to Specialists You must obtain a Referral from your PCP before vis iting any Provider other than your PCP in order for the visit to be covered. The Referral authorizes t he specific number of visits that you may make to a Provider within a specified period of time. If you receive treatment from a Provider other than your PCP without a Referral from your PCP, the treatment is not covered. Exceptions to the Referral process: If you are a female Member, you may visit a qualifi ed Participating Provider for covered obstetrical a nd gynecological services, as defined in \"Covered Serv ices and Benefits,\" without a Referral from your PC P. You do not need a PCP Referral for Virtual Care Ser vices. If you are a Member under age 19, you may visit a d entist for Pediatric Dental Benefits or a Provider in Cigna's vision network for Pediatric Vision Benefit s without a Referral from your PCP. You do not need a Referral from your PCP for Emerge ncy Services as defined in the \"Definitions.\" In th e event of an emergency, get help immediately. Go to the nearest emergency room, the nearest hospital o r call or ask someone to call 911 or your local emerg ency service, police or fire department for help. Y ou do not need a Referral from your PCP for Emergency Ser vices, but you do need to call your PCP as soon as possible for further assistance and advice on follo w-up care. In an emergency, you should seek immediate medical attention and then as soon as possible thereafter you need to call your PCP for further assistance an d advice on follow-up care. In an Urgent Care situation a Referral is not requi red but you should, whenever possible, contact your PCP for direction prior to receiving services. INDHMOIL01-2021 01/21 Cigna HealthCare of Illinois, Inc. Cigna Connect 700-4 MIHM0255 3 You may also visit a qualified Participating Provid er for covered Pediatric Vision Care Services and Pediatric Dental Care Services, as defined in \"Cove red Services and Benefits\", without a Referral from your PCP. Standing Referral to Specialist You may apply for a standing Referral to a Provider other than your PCP when all of the following conditions apply: 1. You are a covered Member of the Cigna HMO EOC; 2. You have a disease or condition that is life thr eatening, degenerative, chronic or disabling; 3. Your PCP in conjunction with a network specialis t determines that your care requires another Provider's expertise; 4. Your PCP determines that your disease or conditi on will require ongoing medical care for an extended period of time; 5. The standing referral is made by your PCP to a n etwork specialist who will be responsible for providing and coordinating your specialty care; and 6. The network specialist is authorized by Cigna to provide the services under the standing referral. We may limit the number of visits and time period f or which you may receive a standing Referral. A standing Referral may be effective for up to 12 mon ths and may be renewed and re-renewed by your PCP. If you receive a standing Referral or any othe r Referral from your PCP, that Referral remains in effect even if the PCP ceases to be a Participating Physician. If the treating specialist leaves Cigna 's network or you cease to be a covered Member, the st anding Referral expires. Changing Primary Care Physicians You may voluntarily change your PCP but not more th an once in any calendar month. We reserve the right to determine the number of times during a plan Year that you will be allowed to change your PCP. You may request a change from one Primary Care Physicia n to another by going to mycigna.com, clicking on \"Manage My Health Team\", click \"Additional info on PCP selection\", and follow the directions displayed or by contacting Us at the Customer Servi ce number on your ID card. In addition, if at any time a Primary Care Physicia n ceases to be a Participating Provider, We will no tify you 30 days in advance, for the purpose of selectin g a new Primary Care Physician. If Your Physician Leaves the Network If your PCP or specialist ceases to be a Participat ing Physician, We will notify you in writing of his or her impending termination at least 30 days in advance o f the date the PCP leaves the network and provide assistance in selecting a new PCP or identifying a new specialist to continue providing Covered Servic es. If you do not choose a PCP after being notified tha t your PCP is no longer a Participating Provider, W e will select a PCP for you. If you are receiving treatmen t from a Participating Provider at the time his or her Participating Provider agreement is terminated, for reasons other than medical incompetence or professional misconduct, you may be eligible for co ntinued care with that Provider. INDHMOIL01-2021 01/21 Cigna HealthCare of Illinois, Inc. Cigna Connect 700-4 MIHM0255 4 Continuity of Care If your PCP ceases to be a Participating Physician, We will notify you. Under certain medical circumstances, We may continue to reimburse Covered Expenses from your PCP or a specialist you've been seeing at the Participating Provider benefit l evel even though he or she is no longer affiliated with Cigna's network. If you are undergoing an active co urse of treatment for an acute or chronic condition and continued treatment is Medically Necessary, you may be eligible to receive continuing care from the No n- Participating Provider for a specified time, subjec t to the treating Provider's agreement. You may als o be eligible to receive continuing care if you are in y our second or third trimester of pregnancy. In this case, continued care may be extended through your deliver y and include a period of postpartum care. Such continuity of care must be approved in advance by Cigna, and your Physician must agree to accept Our reimbursement rate and to abide by Cigna's poli cies and procedures and quality assurance requirements. There may be additional circumstances where continued care by a Provider who ceases to be a Participating Provider will not be available, such as when the Provider loses his/her license to practice or retires. You may request continuity of care from Cigna after your Participating Provider's termination from Cig na's network; start by calling the toll-free number on y our ID card.

The benefits under the Secondary Plan are re duced based on the benefits under the Primary Plan. Allowable Expense The portion of a Covered Expense used in determinin g the benefits this plan pays when it is the Secondary Plan. The Allowable Expense is the lesser of: the charge used by the Primary Plan in determining the benefits it pays; the charge that would be used by this plan in dete rmining the benefits it would pay if it were the Pr imary Plan, and the amount of the Covered Expense. If the benefits for a Covered Expense under your Pr imary Plan are reduced because you did not comply with the Primary Plan's requirements (for ex ample, getting pre-certification of Hospital admission or a second surgical opinion), the amount of the Allowable Expense is reduced by the amount of the reduction. Claim Determination Period A Calendar Year, but does not include any part of a year during which you are not covered under this plan or any date before this section or any similar provision takes effect. Order of Benefit Determination Rules A plan that does not have a coordination of benefit s rule consistent with this section shall always be the Primary Plan.
