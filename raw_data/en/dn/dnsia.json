But they are not without limitations and can cause some side-effects in individuals. Some of the common side effects of colon cleansing reported are diarrhea, fatigue, or dehydration. Primary ingredients such as senna leaf, psyllium draw fluids to soften hardened waste, and hence water hydration is vital. Senna and psyllium can cause diarrhea and/ or stomach cramps. Individuals sensitive to senna or psyllium should check with a doctor before using any supplements that contain these ingredients ( [1](https://www.cghjournal.org/action/showFullTableHTML?isHtml=true&tableId=tbl2&pii=S1542-3565%2808%2901229-9)). Chronic use of cascara sagrada bark can cause abdominal cramps and electrolyte imbalance especially that of potassium ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2504026/#S3title)). Licorice is known to cause hyperkalemia, hypertension in some people, and is not advised to be taken in conjunction with stimulant laxatives ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123875/#Sec22title)). Excessive use of magnesium-based laxatives are not advised for the elderly, individuals with renal issues, or to avoid electrolyte disturbances ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348737/#__sec8title)). Herbal ingredients may still interact with medications. Hence, people taking medication, pregnant, and nursing women, and children are advised to consult a practitioner before using any colon cleanse products. Summary: Colon cleanse supplements may contain natural laxatives that can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea, or electrolyte imbalances in some people. A doctor's advice is recommended before using these products to prevent adverse effects. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the Benefits of Using a Colon Cleanse Supplement? Colon cleanses are available for purchase without a prescription and easy to use with minimal effort, time, and cost. These supplements are good for occasional use when you don't have proper bowel movements or are suffering from constipation. A colon cleanse can clear long-accumulated waste that is toxic and regulate bowel movements. As a result, you are left with a cleaner colon, reduced weight, greater energy, and stronger immunity. Are There any Dietary Changes Required During a Colon Cleanse? While food restrictions are not mandatory during a colon cleansing process, what type of foods you choose takes more importance. Consumption of processed foods that are high in sugar and fat is what causes a waste buildup in the first place. Avoiding such foods and consuming more high-fiber foods, fruits, and vegetables during and after a colon cleanse will provide better benefits.

If you do not experience any of these indications and still suffer from constipation, then you should consult a doctor to rule out other medical conditions. Can Pregnant or Nursing Women do a Colon Cleanse? Pregnant and nursing women are strongly advised against using any colon cleanse supplements by themselves to prevent adverse effects such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. They should consult a doctor if required. Can I Continue to Take my Medications During a Colon Cleanse? If you are taking regular medications for a medical condition, it is recommended to check with a doctor regarding colon cleansing, as certain ingredients can interact with medicines. Prescribed medications can be continued during a colon cleansing process. But care should be taken to consume the medicines well before or after a cleanse to ensure their absorption by the body.
