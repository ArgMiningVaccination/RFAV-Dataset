Clayton Award VIIS Staff would like to congratulate Sonja Volker, VIIS Data Quality/Business Plan Manager, on receiving a Charles C. Clayton Award from VCU's School of Medicine. This award recognizes her scholarly achievement in the Biostatistics and Clinical Research Masters Program. Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (Shingrix) Administration Errors The CDC published a report on vaccine administration errors involving Recombinant Zoster Vaccine. Please take the time to read this report to avoid administration errors from occurring in your practice. The complete article is located here: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ wr/pdfs/mm6720a4 -H.pdf Merck Hep B Vaccine Shortage Extended Merck's supply of pediatric hepatitis B vaccine (Recombivax HB\u00ae) will continue to be limited for the remainder of 2018 due to a manufacturing issue. To supplement current vaccine availability, GSK will continue to make an increased amount of pediatric hepatitis B containing vaccine available, including both the single -component vaccine (Engerix -B\u00ae) and the combination vaccine (Pediarix\u00ae). This increase is sufficient to address the gap in supply related to Merck's manufacturing issue so that infants and young children can continue to receive their recommended hepatitis B vaccine series on time. Importantly, sufficient single -component hepatitis B vaccine will be available to continue to deliver the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine for infants. VIIS and Hearing Screening Trainings Providers can access the hearing screening report for their infant patients in VIIS. If you are a Pediatric or Family Practice, LHD or Community Health Center you can access these reports. * See page 2 for more information.... NEWSLETTER VIRGINIA IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION SYSTEM VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 2 Visit us online at: http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/immunization/viis NEWSLETTER VIRGINIA IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION SYSTEM VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH VIIS and the Virginia Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program Collaboration All newborns born in the state of Virginia are required by law to receive a newborn hearing screen prior to discharge from the hospital. In 2016, the hearing screening rate in Virginia was 99.2%. The Virginia Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) Program monitors the newborn hearing screening of all babies born within the state of Virginia, as well as hearing re -screening and diagnostic records for all infants from birth to 36 months of age that reside in the state of Virginia. This information is maintained in an online database called the Virginia Infant Screening and Infant Tracking System (VISITS). The hearing screening test is performed on all newborns shortly after birth. It is the first step in a process designed to identify children with hearing loss as early as possible, to ensure that all newborns can benefit from interventions that will help them develop to their full potential. Language development is largely dependent on hearing and begins very early in a child's life. Re-screening a newborn prior to 1 month of age and diagnosing a hearing loss prior to 3 months of age is important in providing the child with appropriate resources in a timely manner. These resources will help children achieve their best linguistic and literacy abilities, and improve their chances for educational success. In order to ensure appropriate and timely follow -up hearing rescreens, the Virginia EHDI program has collaborated with the Virginia Immunization Information System (VIIS), to allow the child's Primary Care Provider (PCP) easy access to view the newborn hearing screening results. The Virginia EHDI program and VIIS are scheduling site visits and/or GoTo meetings with PCP offices to provide training and education to view the screening results and discuss recommendations for children in need of rescreening. If a child fails or misses the newborn hearing screening in the hospital, as the PCP, you can make an audiology referral to ensure the child has a hearing rescreen or diagnostic evaluation performed. For a list of preferred audiology facilities within the state of Virginia you may visit the http://EHDIPALS.org website or refer to the back of the letter you receive from the Virginia EHDI program with hearing screening results and recommendations. If you are interested in scheduling a site visit or if you would like more information about the Virginia EHDI Program contact Kathleen Watts: Kathleen.Watts@vdh.virginia.gov or Deepali Sanghani: fax at 804 -864-7771.
