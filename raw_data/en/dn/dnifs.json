Acupuncture is the insertion of hair-fine needles into specific points in the body for therapeutic purposes. The practice originated in China approximately 3000 years ago. Since being introduced to Western culture in relatively recent times, there have been many research studies undertaken to understand aspects of how acupuncture works from a biomedical perspective. Studies have shown that acupuncture has the ability to affect many systems in the body, including the circulatory, respiratory, lymphatic, endocrine, and nervous systems. Acupuncture treatments can simultaneously have both local and systemic effects. An example of a local effect could be an acupuncture needle placed directly into a trigger point (aka fascial adhesion) at a site of musculoskeletal tension or pain. This method can quickly release tension from a local area and provide immediate relief. An example of a systemic effect could be a needle placed into a specific point in the foot or hand that can release endogenous endorphins in the body, lessening systemic pain, and improving one's overall sense of well being. Our acupuncture treatments often incorporate points for both local and systemic benefit. Acupuncture uses a system in Chinese medicine based on a network of meridians, or channels in the body, through which energy flows. These meridians closely mirror the planes of fascia, or connective tissue, that encases the body's muscles and internal organs. If you are interested in a fascinating read that explains the practice of acupuncture through the lens of fascia, our acupuncturist highly recommends [\"Spark in the Machine\" by Daniel Keown](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Machine-Acupuncture-Explains-Mysteries/dp/1848191960/ref=asc_df_1848191960/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312031138203&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2536550521572668580&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9033313&hvtargid=pla-432152163067&psc=1).
