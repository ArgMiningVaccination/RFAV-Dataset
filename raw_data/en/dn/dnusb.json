K. Crabbe is a member of the Mauna Kea Management Board's Hawaiian CultureCommittee. In collaboration with Kahu K\u00fc Mauna, this group is working to developeducational materials on the cultural signicance of Mauna Kea, including protocol.Crabbe, a Hawaiian cultural practitioner and educator, shares his personal views onprotocol on Mauna Kea in this article.Ho'olilo 2002Native Hawaiians have always had a close association to the '\u00e4ina upon which we live. As doother indigenous peoples of the world, Hawaiians view ourselves as kahu, caretakers of theland. And, as kahu, we have a personal responsibility to maintain the very essence and life ofthe land on which we live.Mauna Kea, the highest mountain in the Hawaiian archipelago and Pu'u K\u00fckahau'ula (nowgenerally identied as Pu'u W\u00ebkiu), its highest peak, are directly connected to our feeling forthe '\u00e4ina. Ascending the summit of Mauna Kea takes one closer to the spiritual and thesupernatural realm.In Hawaiian thinking, a visit to Mauna Kea has personal meaning because in the eyes of someHawaiians Mauna Kea is kupuna to them it was here long before us, and therefore it is our\"elder.\"Equally important for Hawaiians is the fact that Mauna Kea also serves as the nal restingplace of the iwi, or bones, of kupuna. So, with respect and reverence for the spirits of thoseancestors and kupuna who reside there, appropriate behavior is asked of anyone visiting MaunaKea.Protocol - a code of correct conduct, particularly within ceremonies - is a strong word.The purpose and function of Hawaiian protocol are deeply rooted in the cultural and spiritualbelief of mana \u2014 supernatural or divine power. Belief in akua, 'aumakua and kupuna helpedour ancestors to maintain a vital relationship with the natural and supernatural world.Hawaiians drew strength from their cultural protocol practices. This spiritual relationship hastranscended time and continues to be taught, perpetuated and appreciated by a growing numberof native Hawaiians today who want to learn, rediscover and identify with the cultural heritageof their ancestors.Two general principles help to guide the practice of Hawaiian protocol. First, a clear purposemust be established and the purpose of each part of the ceremony understood. Anyone whopractices Hawaiian ceremonial protocol should know why he or she is involved in a particularceremony and what they are expected to do.Second, there is an order or sequence in how one proceeds. For example, one suggestion for theprotocol elements of presenting ho'okupu, or offering, could include the sounding of the p\u00fcHawaiian Protocol on shell, which would be followed by an oli wehe, or opening chant. A processionwould follow, which could be accompanied by additional oli, followed by the bearers of theho'okupu to a pre-designated site in order of their rank or status. These steps are consistent inany Hawaiian protocol.Selection of oli is determined by the type of ceremony to be conducted at Mauna Kea. Today, itis common practice to select oli that are appropriate for the occasion. Different oli apply todifferent purposes, so a chanter should be familiar with the text of the chant and its function. Torequest permission to enter a sacred place such as Mauna Kea is consistent with Hawaiianthinking. Some oli k\u00e4hea, chants of request to enter, have been taught and learned forgenerations in the h\u00e4lau hula. 0li could also chants, or mele wahipana, place name chants.The rank or status of a person and the nature of their visit to Mauna Kea determines how formalor informal a ho'okipa, or welcoming ceremony, should be. A mea ha'i'\u00f6lelo, or speaker, fromthe visiting group should state the purpose of the group's visit. An ofcial greeter shouldwelcome and receive the visitor.Understanding and practicing proper protocol ensures that a ceremony is pono, or donecorrectly. If a ceremony is conducted with good intentions at all levels of the process, all partsof the ceremony will flow together. Conrmation may occur at a personal or a broad level.H\u00f6'ailona, or signs, will reveal themselves either through natural phenomena, a person'sbehavior, or a spoken word either prior to, during, or even after a ceremony has beenconducted.As a nal note: anyone planning to visit Mauna Kea should also be mindful of the health andsafety hazards of traveling to high altitudes. The Ofce of Mauna Kea Management and theVisitor Information Station are good sources to obtain a personal safety checklist.The Ofce of Mauna Kea Management 640 N. 26/20/11 3:02 AM "}
