Maybe it's that you bounced out of bed that morning, or sang in the shower. It could be that you didn't need that extra cup of coffee at 3pm, or that you were able to sustain a solid conversation or play games with the kids after dinner. Now, how often do you have that feeling? Or more importantly, do you remember the last time you felt that way? It's normal to have periods of time where life gets so busy that our energy has to be directed into specific tasks, or that we might be overtaxed and tired as a result. But if you've been feeling lackluster or low energy for a long period of time and can't seem to get out of that funk, it's time to address your energy levels more proactively. Try exploring these tried and true methods of protecting and bolstering your energy levels. Breathe for Energy While it is a common reaction to stress, shallow breathing prevents the body from receiving enough oxygen, and in a short period of time depletes the body of energy. Often, we don't even notice that our breathing has become quick or shallow until we're already anxious and exhausted. The trick is to be proactive and mindful about your breathing every day so that you can recognize and respond appropriately when you need to. One powerful and simple breathing technique we recommend is: Sit down with both feet on the floor. Close your eyes and press the tip of your tongue against the ridge behind your upper teeth. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a soft sighing sound. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose for a count of four. Hold your breath for a count of five and then exhale through your mouth for a count of eight. Repeat for a total of four breaths and try to do this every hour or two. You'll find that you are more centred and have more mental energy at your disposal. Short High Intensity Exercise Ideally about a half hour of exercise, three times a week can help you increase your energy and motivation. And some of the best kinds of activity for revving up your energy come in short bursts of high intensity movement. Whether you choose to take a HIIT class that focuses on interspersing bursts of cardio and strength training, or you decide to get outside on your lunch break for a brisk walk, swinging your arms and moving vigorously, those bursts of exertion will help you rev up your engine and keep you going for the rest of the day. Extra points if these activities happen outside, where you get the additional energy boosting effects of being in nature and getting healthy doses of sunshine! Stay Hydrated Think of it this way: your body is about 60% water so if you're dehydrated your body won't be able to function as well as it should - and it will tell you so. Headaches, lethargy, dry mouth, irritability, these are all signs that you need to hydrate. When your body is hydrated, your blood can more easily carry oxygen and nutrients to where they need to be and that results in a lift of energy! Increase Your B12 B-vitamins are also known as the 'happy vitamins' for their ability to assist the body to generate energy. While the body needs a few different varieties of B vitamins, one that is especially tied to good energy is vitamin B12. Exhaustion, tingling/numbness, feeling low and tired can all indicate low levels of vitamin B12 in the body ( [see a longer list of B12 deficiency symptoms](https://familynaturopath.ca/tips-resources/articles/vitamin-b12-new-signs-of-deficiency/)). B12 is primarily found in animal-based foods like meat, fish, poultry, dairy and eggs, but also in supplements and fortified foods such as rice or soy milk. Unfortunately, B12 is not reliably found in plants, so be sure to obtain it appropriately. For those with severe B12 deficiency, vitamin B12 injections are very helpful because they deliver the vitamin into the muscle tissue and bypasses the digestive system which, if compromised, may not absorb the nutrient effectively. Increase Blood Oxygen Bet you didn't realize that all of the previous four suggestions have one thing in common! They all positively affect your energy by pumping more oxygen into your bloodstream. Well-oxygenated blood is better able to carry nutrients, can eliminate toxins efficiently, help us think more clearly and can greatly diminish fatigue and exhaustion. Want another way to help your body get the oxygen it needs? Add fresh greenery to your home and office. Plants feed off of the carbon dioxide we exhale and replaces it with fresh oxygen in the air. So, while you're taking time to smell the flowers, take some time to sniff the plants as well; you just might find you're breathing easier and feeling more lively too! Maintaining healthy energy levels can be challenging when faced with the stresses of everyday life, but these tips can help you rev up your engine and keep you humming a happy tune all day long.
