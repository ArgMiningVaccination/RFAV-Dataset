Providers and staff at Phoenix Children's are doing their part to slow the spread, as well. When we identify the virus early, we can reduce everyone's exposure and keep more people healthy.

Anyone who has a fever and/or cold or flu-like symptoms will be asked to reschedule their appointment or to schedule a telehealth appointment. If this is not possible, they will be provided a medical mask to wear during the visit. Patients and caregivers who do not have symptoms will be permitted to wear their own personal mask. If they do not have their own mask, one will be provided for them. Providers and employees: All Phoenix Children's providers and staff are in compliance with our COVID-19 vaccination program. Testing COVID-19 testing will be needed for the following patients: - Hospitalized patients who have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and unknown COVID-19 status - Patients without COVID-19 symptoms who have a known recent close contact/exposure to COVID-19 in the last 10 days - In some cases, your provider may order a COVID-19 test upon admission or before a surgical procedure Triaging: Hospitalized patients who test positive for COVID-19 are placed in special isolation precautions to minimize the risk of exposure to others. Cost of testing: The cost of COVID-19 testing varies but is covered by most insurance plans. Patient families will not be responsible for any remaining balance. "}
