A systematic review Abstract Background: School or daycare vaccination mandates are present in two Canadian provinces, every US state, and are a growing strategy internationally in wealthy countries. However, the effectiveness of such laws for increasing population-level vaccine coverage is unclear. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PAIS, and WPSA were searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies of school or daycare vaccine mandate policies published 1980-2017. Reference lists of relevant articles were also searched. Included studies were too heterogeneous for meta-analysis, thus data were extracted using a standardized rubric, and results narratively synthesized. Results: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Seven were conducted using data from one or more US state and 1 an Australian state. One was a prospective cohort study, 5 were retrospective cohort studies, and 2 were retrospective analyses of survey data. Data sources included the US National Immunization Survey-Teen, school databases, state registries, and a clinical data repository. Findings were varied. Three studies found no increase in vaccine coverage following adolescent vaccine mandates, with HPV appearing particularly resistant to mandate efforts. Five studies showed increases in vaccination that might be attributable, at least in part, to vaccination or documentation mandates, although four of these had data that did not include all children. Interpretation: Although numerous studies have explored impacts of childhood vaccine mandates, the evidence regarding whether mandates are an effective intervention to increase population vaccine coverage remains inconclusive. Context-sensitive prospective studies with whole-population registry data and appropriate comparators are required.

These range in nature and intrusiveness, from efforts to increase easy access to vaccination services to policies requiring vaccination under certain circumstances. Vaccine mandates for school or childcare attendance are ubiquitous in the USA and growing as a strategy in Europe and Australia. Currently, school vaccine mandate legislation exists in two Canadian provinces, Ontario (1) and New Brunswick (2). Mandate policies vary in what they require and in restrictiveness (3). Such policies might require, for example: documentation of immunization status so that vulnerable individuals may be identified in an outbreak, documentation of immunization status plus additional documentation to verify that non-vaccination is intentional, documentation of immunization status and required completion of vaccine education to verify that non-vaccination was an educated choice, or mandated immunization with limited exceptions (e.g, for medical reasons, religious reasons). Mandates may be incentivized with benefits (e.g., financial rewards) for those who comply, and/or consequences (e.g., fines, exclusion) for those who do not. In 2015, at the 148th Annual Meeting, the CMA passed a resolution recommending documentation-with-education mandates, such \"that governments authorize elementary and secondary schools to require a declaration of immunization status, to be followed by a conversation between public health officials and parents where children are shown to be inadequately immunized.\"(4) However, such policies have not at this time been adopted by the majority of Canadian provinces. Debate regarding best practices for mandate policies tends to draw largely on ethical arguments (5) regarding the optimal legislation for maximum vaccine coverage of school children without violating parental civil liberties, with some voices advocating strict policies with few permitted exemptions, others favoring a more libertarian approach, and many aiming to strike an acceptable balance (6). Often in these debates, the effectiveness of vaccination mandate laws in increasing population vaccine coverage is assumed. However, despite the existence of thousands of articles on the topic of mandate policies, a thorough and focused synthesis of the available literature has not occurred. Our aim in this analysis is to inform the ongoing debates regarding optimal childhood vaccination policy by systematically identifying and synthesizing the existing evidence to answer Page 6 of 38 For Peer Review Only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential4 the question: Does the implementation of school or daycare-based childhood vaccine mandate policies cause an increase in vaccination coverage? In order to assess effectiveness of child vaccine mandates in real-life settings, studies with the appropriate outcome must be examined. Several cross-sectional studies have documented associations between existence of a child vaccination mandate (or difficulty of exemption from a mandate) and population vaccine coverage outcomes, suggesting that stricter policies around exemptions from mandates may increase compliance (7-10). These studies alone, however, cannot determine causality or directionality of the association. Other studies have explored the influence of mandates on outcomes such as exemption rate (11,12) or disease occurrence (13), without population vaccination data. A recent systematic review conducted by the United States Government attempted to synthesize findings of all research since 1980 on school vaccine mandates (14); however a review with more stringent inclusion criteria, which is focused on the actual effects of mandate implementation/changes, is merited to assess causality and inform jurisdictions that do not already have mandates in place. Population level vaccine coverage is the ideal outcome for implementation studies of vaccine mandates, since exemption rates may overlook unintended consequences such as clustering of unvaccinated children in private or home schooling not subject to mandates, and vaccine-preventable disease incidence is affected by many forces including temporal trends in outbreak cycles. Methods This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines (15). No protocol was registered for this non-clinical review of public health policy interventions. We sought English, French, or Spanish language studies published in 1980 or later using any empirical method to obtain evidence on potential causal effects of implementation of school or childcare vaccination mandate policies for children on the outcome of childhood vaccination coverage in the population. Appropriate comparison groups included same-time comparators in locations without mandate changes or pre/post intervention comparisons. Studies that focused only on the policy of a specific school rather than a regional/government policy were excluded, as were mandates for non-pediatric populations, policies that only imposed mandates in cases of outbreaks, non- empirical papers (e.g., theory, commentary, projected modeling), and studies that only examined Page 7 of 38 For Peer Review Only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential5 outcomes other than population immunization or vaccine coverage (e.g., exemption rate only, hypothetical choice experiments). Figure 1 summarizes inclusion and exclusion criteria. [--Figure 1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria about here--] We searched the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ERIC (Education Resources Information Center), PAIS (Public Affairs Information Service), and WPSA (Worldwide Political Science Abstracts) in August 2016 and again to update in October 2017, in order to identify potentially-relevant articles (see Appendix A for full search details). References of relevant articles were searched for additional potentially- includable citations, and a Google Scholar alert was set to help identify new articles published during analysis and writing. Titles and abstracts of initially gathered citations were first screened by a single author (CVM) for relevance. Full texts of potentially-includable articles were obtained and all three authors (DG, JAB, CVM) reviewed for inclusion or exclusion. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion among the authors to reach consensus. Included articles were then subjected to a data extraction process by all authors (see Appendix B for all characteristics for which data was extracted), discussed by all authors, and synthesized in a narrative manner. All included studies were also assessed normatively for potential bias in study methods by two authors (JAB, DG) using the bias categories from the ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions) tool (16). Results Database searches resulted in 2022 unique citations to screen and assess for eligibility, and reference lists of key articles on the topic revealed 5 additional studies. After screening for relevance and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 8 studies were selected for inclusion in this review (see Figure 1). [--Figure 2.

One was a prospective cohort study, 5 were retrospective cohort studies, and 2 retrospective analyses of vaccination coverage survey data. Data sources included various iterations of the US National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen), school vaccination documentation databases, state vaccination registries, and a clinical data repository from a university health system. The American studies assessed policies mandating adolescent vaccination (typically 5th or 6th grade level, 10-12 years of age), kindergarten-entrant vaccination (typically age 4-5 years), and parental education mandates (requiring education regarding certain vaccines for parents of adolescents). These policies had various exemption procedures, and while most examined the impact of the addition of new vaccine or education requirements, one looked at the impact of a change in exemption procedures. The Australian study focused on a school entry (kindergarten/grade 1, age 4-6 years) policy requiring parents to submit documentation of immunization. In the American studies, coverage was assessed among adolescents for the following vaccines: hepatitis B (HBV), human papillomavirus (HPV)(girls only), TDaP), varicella, or \"all required vaccines,\" while the Australian school entry study assessed rates of \"fully immunized\" students in the preparatory year through grade 2. Table 1 summarizes the included studies' methods, relevant findings, and limitations (including risks of bias). [ --Table 1. Included Studies--] Findings of Included Studies Findings of the included studies were varied, and the heterogeneity of study methods, data sources, populations, and unit of analysis precluded statistical meta-analysis. Thus, we report here a narrative synthesis of findings of the included studies, grouped by those that did not, and those that did, find an increase in coverage following implementation of a mandate policy.. Studies that showed no increase in coverage after mandatesPage 9 of 38 For Peer Review Only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential7 Three included studies used survey or health system data and found no increase in vaccine coverage following adolescent vaccine mandates that were implemented over the 2007-2009 time frame. Bugenske and colleagues (17) used NIS-Teen telephone survey data to examine whether states that implemented middle-school vaccine requirements in 2008-09 experienced a larger change in coverage than states that already had a mandate prior to 2008 or those with no mandate in 2008-09. While states with existing or new mandates were associated with higher coverage rates of both TDaP and MCV4 than states with no mandates, all states in the analysis saw increases in coverage from 2008 to 2009, with overlapping confidence intervals among almost all of the groups. This pattern did not hold with HPV; however, only one state included in the analysis had an HPV vaccine mandate in 2008-09, and this was associated with a possible (statistically-insignificant) decrease in coverage upon implementation of a mandate policy, as compared with comparatively small but statistically significant increase in states with solely education mandates or no mandates. HPV appeared particularly resistant to mandate efforts in other studies as well, both when examining within a jurisdiction before and after a mandate went into effect, and when comparing coverage uptake over time in jurisdictions with different policies. Perkins and colleagues (18) used NIS-Teen data 2009-2013 to conduct a contemporaneous comparison of HPV coverage among girls in two jurisdictions (one state and the District of Columbia) with vaccine mandates, 10 states with education mandates, and states without HPV mandates. All mandates for vaccination or education were implemented in 2007 or 2008. The authors found no difference in coverage in states with and without vaccine or education mandates. Cuff et al. (19) examined the VA state HPV mandate specifically, using clinical data from University of Virginia-supported medical practices in 2014 (five years post-mandate), and comparing this to pre-mandate data from 2008, found no effect on HPV coverage. Studies showing increase in coverage following mandates Two included studies used registries of school-enrolled children and found increases in vaccination among regional or state student populations following mandate policies: one in the 1990's in Chicago, another in 2009-2010 in Michigan. A third using a similar registry in Washington state found no decrease in vaccine coverage, and an increase in students who were Page 10 of 38 For Peer Review Only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential8 up-to-date for all vaccines, following imposition of stricter mandate exemption procedures. One study using the Arizona state vaccine registry, which is based on immunizer reporting rather than school enrollment data, found an increase in coverage following a mandate. The final study in this group, conducted in Victoria, Australia in the 1990's, found that implementation of a documentation mandate increased documentation of both vaccinated and unvaccinated students. Morita and colleagues (20) used data from the Chicago public school system to retrospectively look at HBV vaccine coverage by grade 12 (age 17-18 years) over a six-year span in the 1990's during which a 5th grade mandate policy for HBV vaccination was implemented. They found that post-mandate cohorts had much higher coverage of HBV. Similarly, Potter et al. (21) retrospectively used the Michigan state immunization registry of school-enrolled children to assess the impact of a new 6th grade mandate for adolescent TDaP, MCV4, and varicella, finding that vaccine completion was higher in the post-mandate year (2010) compared with the previous year (2009) and time to completion was shorter. Omer and colleagues (22) examined a policy that changed exemption procedures, rather than vaccines required for school enrollment. Using Washington state health data for kindergarten enrollment from 1997-98 through 2013-14, the authors found that after addition of the requirement to have a health care provider counsel/sign a form in order to exempt a child from the state vaccine mandate, there was a small increase in students who were complete for all vaccines. With access to population data for vaccines administered in the state of Arizona to children under 18 years, Simpson et al. (23) were able to track coverage of MCV4 vaccination among 11 and 12 year old children before and after implementation of the 2008 state requirement for students to be vaccinated before 6th grade entry. Simpson found that MCV4 coverage by Sept 1 among 12-year-olds increased after the mandate. The one Australian study that was included in this analysis, by Thompson and colleagues (24), used state administrative data (education census) before and after a documentation mandate was imposed, finding a small increase in submitted documentation for incoming primary (kindergarten) students following implementation of a documentation mandate policy. This included a small increase in documentation of fully vaccinated students and a larger increase in documentation of incompletely vaccinated students.

Overall, studies using school enrollee data appeared to find increases in vaccination after mandates were implemented or tightened, while those using survey or health system data and those looking at HPV mandates, did not. In the included studies, while implementing a mandate for vaccine coverage was often associated with higher vaccination coverage among school-enrolled children, the causal effects of such mandates on population vaccine coverage were unclear. Based on the evidence to date, it remains an open question whether implementation of childhood school- or daycare-based vaccine or documentation mandates increase vaccination coverage in a population. In several studies, there appeared to be a possible positive impact on vaccine coverage, while in others there appeared to be no impact. Context, which was rarely fully described in the included articles, may play an important role in the success or failure of such mandate policies. For example, while Simpson and colleagues found an increase in MCV4 coverage following implementation of a mandate, the exact contribution of the mandate\u2014as compared with an increase following Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation changes in 2005 and 2007, and concurrent interventions such as an educational campaign and provider behavior changes\u2014was not possible to reliably ascertain with these data alone. Similarly, the increase in students with up-to-date immunization status observed by Omer et al. (22) may have been influenced by the restrictions on mandate exemptions, but also potentially by changes in state vaccine purchasing and provider reimbursement, community vaccine promotion activities, retraction of the infamous Wakefield study from Lancet, and changes to the vaccine schedule as well as the exemption form. The particular lack of success of the HPV mandates studied in this body of research may relate to the highly charged political discourse surrounding the introduction of that particular vaccine (25). While the limitations of the included studies were not uncommon within the research context, study conclusions often glossed over such limitations, overstating the findings regarding intervention effectiveness. This was primarily due to two main issues, both of which may be remedied with additional high-quality future research. First, many of these studies, including all Page 12 of 38 For Peer Review Only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential10 but one of those with positive results, relied on data gathered from school-enrollees. This data may be more accurate than that gathered from a survey such as NIS-Teen; however, using school-level data to evaluate a state-level policy does carry several limitations related to the sample. Key among these is the issue of missing data. In several of these studies, home learners, private school enrollees, and those who simply did not comply with documentation requirements were omitted from the analysis. The population of compliant, public school-enrolled children, however, may not be an appropriate proxy for the whole school-aged population of a city, district, or state. Lack of measurement of whose data are missing, and where they spend their time, risks overlooking potentially-dangerous clustering of unvaccinated populations who are vulnerable to disease outbreaks. While not all included studies showed an increase in vaccine coverage after mandate imposition/tightening, many did. Unfortunately, those that did often noted an accompanying increase in exemptions or missing/incomplete data, which raises questions regarding whether these improved coverage rates may, at least in part, reflect reclassification or exclusion of out-of-compliance children, rather than any true increase in population vaccine coverage and also may be hinting at a shifting or clustering of unvaccinated populations. Second, as with most implementation science that uses natural policy experiments, the studies in this body of research are vulnerable to secular trends and ecological fallacies. Few studies adequately measured pre- and post-intervention periods, included appropriate comparator jurisdictions, or fully considered factors external to the vaccine mandate policies that may have influenced vaccination rates. Some factors that may have confounded findings of studies such as those reviewed in this study include (but are not limited to): outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease, the retraction of Andrew Wakefield's notorious Lancet paper, growing population familiarity with and corresponding acceptance of newer vaccines over time (e.g., HBV, varicella), changes in data source (e.g., starting of a new state registry), immunization promotion efforts or access improvements that may accompany a mandate policy without being officially part of the policy, improved immunization documentation being misinterpreted as increased coverage, new availability of vaccines for a given age group (e.g., TDaP for adolescents), media- popularized fears about specific vaccines (e.g., HPV), and growing popularity of home learning in the USA. Page 13 of 38 For Peer Review Only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential11 To better understand the effectiveness of mandates, comparisons between school enrollment and whole population/representative samples should be conducted. Simpson (23) contrasts results calculated from census data versus state immunization registry data, and finds very different coverage rates estimated using these different population data sources. Additionally, more studies on the impact of HPV mandates should be conducted now that the vaccine is universally recommended to all genders, to assess whether it remains resistant to mandate policies. Vaccine researchers should also be encouraged to consult with local and regional immunization program managers and to work with social scientists to better understand the impact of potentially- confounding contemporaneous interventions (e.g., those that affect access to vaccination) as well as other ecological factors (e.g., outbreaks, media scares about adverse events) that might affect policy effectiveness. Future studies of immunization documentation mandates should also explore population immunization coverage outcomes. Other Australian studies (26,27) not eligible for inclusion in this review have also found that documentation mandates appear to increase student immunization documentation, potentially enabling better identification of at-risk children in the case of an outbreak. However they did not measure any potential immunization coverage changes in the population, although this is commonly one of the stated objectives of such policies. Further, since childcare and preschool are not mandatory, restricting access risks increasing population inequities related to early child education and development without increasing vaccine coverage. Much recent attention has been paid to issues of mandate exemptions and \"opting out\" considerations in terms of political (28) and ethical implications (29), as well as impacts on exemption rates (30) and ultimately vaccine confidence and coverage impacts (31). Less attention has been paid to the question of whether mandates themselves are an effective tool for increasing vaccination in pediatric populations. This may be due to the fact that the vast majority of childhood vaccine mandate policy research focuses on US jurisdictions, where mandates are already in place. Removing an established mandate has not to our knowledge been studied, and certainly raises concerns regarding stoking vaccine hesitancy. However, as policy makers in Canada, as well as other countries, increasingly discuss and implement vaccine mandates for school (32,33) or childcare (34) attendance, broader questions of whether mandates are indeed Page 14 of 38 For Peer Review Only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential12 effective policy levers for increasing population vaccination are important on a global scale. Concerns raised regarding, for example, potential 'backfire effects' of increasing resistance, clustering unvaccinated children, weakening trust in the government and health professionals, or diversion of resources away from addressing structural barriers to vaccine access (35-38) should be taken seriously\u2014particularly given that, while implementation of a mandate may or may not increase coverage, removal or weakening of an existing mandate may decay vaccine confidence (12). If it is the case that an improved system of vaccine documentation and prompting is the main effect of most vaccine mandates, population vaccination registries may achieve the same effect with a much lower risk of increased resistance and clustering. In order to answer the question of whether mandates are an effective immunization promotion strategy for a country such as Canada, further research\u2014context-sensitive prospective studies with whole-population registry data and appropriate comparators both temporal and contemporaneous\u2014is required. Conclusions Although numerous studies have attempted to assess whether childhood vaccine mandates increase population vaccination coverage, the evidence remains uncertain. Future studies investigating this question may prove more conclusive if they are able to use whole-population data, triangulate data sources, include sufficient temporal and contemporaneous comparators, and more fulsomely take into account environmental confounders. At this time, the evidence cannot support either a recommendation for or against implementing vaccine mandate policies for children's attendance in school or daycare programs. References 1.

States with existing or new mandates had significantly higher coverage of TDaP and MenACWY than states without mandates. But coverage did not differ among states with new and old mandates. HPV and MenACWY coverage did not differ in states with educational requirements compared to states without educational requirements (no states had educational requirements for TDaP). Presence of vaccine mandates were not associated with increase in all recommended vaccines.Survey population was limited to land- line telephones and may not be representative. Vaccine coverage may be underestimated in the survey data used for the analysis, as NIS- Teen uses a combination of parent report and parent- referred health care provider report and only included respondents with adequate vaccination history information. Sample size for HPV and MenACWY mandates was small. Follow-up time for policies was limited. Policies were grouped together, not allowing for subtle differences in implementation or context. Ecological analysis: increase or decrease in coverage may be due to factors other than the mandate. Vaccine up-to-date was defined as 1 dose.Page 21 of 38 For Peer Review Only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Confidential19 Cuff 2016 American Journal of Obstetrics & GynecologyProspective cohort study using administrative data and telephone surveyVirginia, USAUniversity of Virginia clinical data repository (n=908 girls)6th grade HPV mandate for girls (2009)Low barrier to obtain philosophical exemptionsHPV vaccine initiation ( 1 dose) in girls11-12 years of age and proportion vaccinated in 2009 and 2014 cohorts.

No exemptions to required documentation for public school enrolment.Submitted documentation of immunization status; documentation of complete (up- to-date) immunization for age. There was a small increase in submitted documentation following policy mandate. This included a small increase in documentation of fully immunized students, and a larger increase in documentation of incompletely vaccinated students. Selection bias: data not available from non-governmental schools. Only schools with kindergarten enrollment included. Not possible to know reason for missing documentation, therefore unclear whether this presents bias in coverage outcome. Indications some schools more compliant than others.

States with existing or new mandates had significantly higher coverage of TDaP and MenACWY than states without mandates. But coverage did not differ among states with new and old mandates. HPV and MenACWY coverage did not differ in states with educational requirements compared to states without educational requirements (no states had educational requirements for TDaP). Presence of vaccine mandates were not associated with increase in all recommended vaccines. Survey population was limited to landCline telephones and may not be representative. Vaccine coverage may be underestimated in the survey data used for the analysis, as NISCTeen uses a combination of parent report and parentC referred health care provider report and only included respondents with adequate vaccination history information. Sample size for HPV and MenACWY mandates was small. FollowCup time for policies was limited. Policies were grouped together, not allowing for subtle differences in implementation or context. Ecological analysis: increase or decrease in coverage may be due to factors other than the mandate. Vaccine upCtoCdate was defined as 1 dose.

Morita 2008 Pediatrics Retrospective cohort study using administrative data Chicago, Illinois, USA Chicago public schools' vaccination database 5 th grade HBV mandate (1997) Medical or religious exemptions permitted HBV coverage by grade 12 (overall, and racial/ethnic disparities in coverage) Postmandate cohorts had significantly higher HBV coverage rates. Coverage rate disparities by race and ethnicity also decreased postC mandate. Ecological analysis: Likely inconsistent enforcement of policy, not captured by study data collection methods. Potential outcome bias: Losses to follow up (i.e.: students who left school before grade 12) excluded from the analysis. Only two years of postC mandate data. Omer 2017 Pediatrics Retrospective cohort study using administrative data Washington, USA Washington State Department of Health 1997C98 - 2013C14 Parents seeking exemption from any school vaccine mandates must submit certificate signed by a licensed health care provider indicating discussion of benefits and risks of vaccination occurred (2011) Medical, personal, or religious (with signed certificate) Kindergarten vaccination rates, exemption rates and clustering of vaccine exemptions Vaccination rates stayed the same or increased after the policy. Exemption rates decreased. NonCcompliance increased. Probability of a kindergartener interacting with an exempted kindergartener decreased. Ecological analysis: Other changes (e.g., in vaccine schedule, exemption forms) prior to the policy change appear to have had impact on trends. Home learners may not be included in this data (selection bias).

Potter 2014 American Journal of Public Health Retrospective cohort study of administrative data Michigan, USA Michigan Care Improvement Registry (statewide immunization registry) 2009C2010 New mandate at grade 6 entry for TDaP, MCV4, varicella Low barrier to obtain philosophical exemptions Completion of all required vaccines (as a single variable); time to completion (upCtoC date status) of all required vaccines; initiation of HPV vaccine (girls only) Vaccine completion was higher in postC mandate year and time to completion was shorter. Ecological analysis: increase in coverage may be due in part to factors other than the mandate. Only 1 year of baseline (preCmandate) and one year of follow up (postC mandate) data. Home learners may not be included in this data (selection bias). Losses to followCup (i.e. children who moved out of state) were included. Simpson 2013 Public Health Reports Retrospective cohort study of administrative data Arizona, USA Arizona State Immunizatio n Information System New mandate for MCV4 for grade 6 entry if 11 years or older Medical and religious/phil osophical MCV4 coverage Vaccine coverage for 12CyearColds was higher in postmandate years than before mandate. Ecological analysis: increase in coverage may be due in part to factors other than the mandate, for example the 2005 ACIP recommendation and education/awareness campaign that accompanied the mandate. Comparison with census data indicates that the registry possibly underestimated coverage.
