Next, we evaluated the ability of Mal-NPs and fluorescence spectroscopy by measuring the amountofproteinsboundtoeachNP.Mal-NPsharvestedmore proteins than NH2-NPs, with a previous study (Fig- ure2b).[10]NH2-NPsandMal-NPsformulationsshowedasimilar abilitytocaptureacomprehensivesetofproteins(Figure2c).No- tably,amongapproximately730setsofproteinscaptured,NH2- NPsshowed91uniquesets,whileMal-NPsdisplayed108unique sets was per- formedtoconrmtheexistenceofneoantigensincapturedpro- of neoantigens, har- vestedseveralsetsofneoantigens(e.g.,Ppp1r7,Dag1andActn4) with a much higher density (Figure 2e, Figure S6 and Table S2, Supporting Information). The captured neoantigens, such as Actn4, Eef2, and Dag1, enhanced tumor immunotherapy in an antigen-specic manner, as demonstrated by a potent IFN- production ex vivoafter neoantigen stimulation.[10]Moreover, thisimprovementmaybealsoassociatedwithanabundanceof the types cles can capture damage-associated molecular pattern proteins (DAMPs), which are pro-inflammatory biomolecules known to improveimmuneresponses.[12]Notably,Mal-NPscapturedasig- nicantly higher density of DAMPs than NH2-NPs, such as heat shock protein (Hsp90ab1, Hspa5, 2e, Figure gestthatMal-NPsshowastrongercapacityforneoantigensand DAMPsreleasedfromirradiatedB16-F10cells.

We studied particle lymphatic drainage and distribution in B cells, macrophages,andDCsresidingintumor-draininglymphnodes (TDLNs) 16 h after post-injection (Figure 2f). Mal-NPs were accumulated in DCs cells (B220+) at higher ratesthanNH2-NPs,whereastheaccumulationratesofthetwo nanoparticlesinmacrophagesweresimilar(Figure2fandFigure S7, Supporting Information). Furthermore, PDT markedly en- hancedMal-NPsuptakebybothDCsandBcellsinTDLNs(Fig- ureS7,SupportingInformation),similartoapreviousstudy.[10] Considering that Mal-NPs capture neoantigens, accumulate in lymph nodes, and promote DC maturation, we next investi-gated the eect of Mal-NPs on tumor immunotherapy 24 days (Figure 3b). The survival rateofmiceinthePDT/Mal-NPsgroupreached30%onday37, whileallmicefromothergroupsdiedwithin35days(Figure3c). Mice were euthanized on day 24, and tumors were harvested andweighed.TumorstakenfromPDT/NH2-NPsandPDT/Mal- NPs groups showed 63.9% 2. and promote cellular uptake in lymph node-resident immune cells. a) Schematic experimentaldesignisthesameasthatfortheB16-F10melanomainhibition study (Figure 3a). Two days after immunotherapy (on day 15), allmicewereeuthanized,andspleens,lymphnodes,andtumor tissues were harvested for analysis of immune cell faceexpressionofCD86andCD80onDCs(CD11c+)inTDLNs usingflowcytometry.Asillustratedin Figure4a-c,thereisanele- vatedcellexpression(1.5-2fold)ofCD86,CD80,ordoublemark- ersinTDLNsfrommicetreatedwithNH2-NPsorMal-NPs,com- pared with PBS PDT alone. Notably, treatment of mice with Mal-NPs-basedPDTresultsinatwo-foldincreaseininltrating CD8a+DCs compared to PBS treatment, preferentially evoking aTh1typeresponse[16](Figure4d). To conrm whether Mal-NPs-induced DC maturation in TDLNs leads to T cell activation and expansion, we an- alyzed the relative abundance of tumor-inltrating help T cells For tumorstreatedwithPDT,bothNH2-NPsandMal-NPsinjectionpromoted help (CD4+)a n dC D 8+cytotoxic T cell (CTL) inltration,comparedwithmicePBS-treatedtumors(Figure4e- g). Importantly, the percentage of CD8+CTLs in tumors after PDT/Mal-NPs treatment increased to 30%, which was higher thanPDT/NH2-NP-treatedgroups( 12%)(Figure4gandFigure S9,SupportingInformation).BothPDT/NH2-NPsandPDT/Mal- NPs increased the level of tumor-inltrating Treg cells (Figure S10, Supporting Information), which is similar to a previous study.[17]One probable explanation is that the increase of Tregs is used to control inflammatory immune response induced by apoptotic cells from PDT. Notably, the PDT/Mal-NPs group inducedthehighestCD8+CTL/Tregratiointumors(Figure4h), primarily responsible for cellular immunity due to increased antigen-specicCD8+Tcells.Moreover,therewerenoapparent changes in levels of on DC cells (CD11c+) in TDLNs of mice in a B16-F10 tumor model. d) Percent of CD8a+DC cells in TDLNs of mice in Figure3d.e-i)TherelativeabundanceofCD4+Tcell(e,f)andCD8+Tcell(e,g) subpopulationsintumors,theratioofCD8+TcellstoTreg cells(h), and the frequency of activated neutrophils (i) in tumors of mice in Figure 3d. j-l) Flow cytometric analysis improvement in m-MDSCsmaybeindicativeofaregulatoryresponsetorestrict STING-mediatedinflammation.[19] We next evaluated the eect of PDT/Mal-NPs on systemic T cell activation by assessing tumor-specic interferon- (IFN-) secretingsplenocytes,whichwerestimulatedwithtumorlysates ex vivo.ThehighestlevelsofIFN- -secretingCD4+TandCD8+ T cells were by combining PDT and Mal-NPs to aug- ment tumor-specic immune responses (Figure 4j-l). Consid- that PDT/Mal-NPs improved CD8+CTL accumulation in tumors (Figure 4h), we assumed that CD8+T cells participate in antitumor growth. To validate this hypothesis, we examined the antitumor eect of PDT/Mal-NPs in CD8 knockout mice. Eects of organsharvestedfrommicewithdierenttreatmentsconrmed thebiocompatibilityoftheMal-NPs(FigureS11,SupportingIn- formation).Moreover,at12,24,and48hfollowingimmunother- apy, cytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured in the systemic circulation (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The results showed that Mal-NPs maintained andchemokinelevels,conrmingtheirutilityforsafeandeca- ciousantitumorimmunity.

Immunological memory is a cardinal feature of adaptive im- munity, and it relates to its ability to remember antigens from pathogens and protect against reinfection upon reencounter of the same pathogens, including tumor cells.[20]In addition, the blockade of programmed death receptor-1(PD-1) or PD-L1 can activate CD8+T cell proliferation and suppress Treg cell dier- entiation in clinic situations.[21]In principle, memory CD8+T cells can be divided into two subsets, central memory T cells (TCM,C D 8+CD62L+CD44+) and eector TEMcells and non-lymphoid tissues display immediate eector function by producing multiple cytokines, such as TNF-a and IFN- .[22] Considering that combination of PDT and Mal-NPs slightly en- hanced the frequency of Tregs in tumors, we argued that intro- ducing of anti-PD-L1 antibody into this treatment may boost a more potent and durable antitumor immune response. In this regard, mice cured of CT26 tumors were rechallenged on day20 with the same CT26 tumors (Figure S13, Supporting Infor- mation).EectormemoryCD8+Tcells(TEM)andcentralmem- ory T cells (TCM) in spleens were analyzed on day 20 in dier- ent groups of mice. The percentage of TEMcells in PDT/Mal- NPs plus anti-PD-L1 group was much higher than that in mice treated with either surgery only or surgery plus anti-PD-L1, or PDT/Mal-NPs(FigureS13,SupportingInformation).Incontrast, thefrequencyofTCMcellsinPDT/Mal-NPsplusanti-PD-L1was muchlowerthanthatoftheotherthreegroups,indicatinglong- term immune memory protection. Combination of PDT/Mal- NPs and anti-PD-L1 substantially inhibited tumor growth com- paredwithothertreatments.Importantly,thismemoryimmune responsealsoprolongedsurvivaltime.Around66.7%ofmicein the PDT/Mal-NPs/anti-PD-L1 group survived for 90 days, while all mice in surgery and PDT/Mal-NPs controls died within 40 days(FigureS13f,SupportingInformation). Inthisstudy,wedesignedself-assembledpolymericnanopar- ticleswithneoantigenharvestingandself-adjuvantedcapabilities for personalized tumor immunotherapy. Our data indicate that these nanoparticles harvest neoantigens from perished cells to form SeaMac nanovaccines, which can induce DC maturation, present neoantigens to CD8+T cells with high eciency, and augment the eect of CD8+CTL activation. These activated CD8+T cells have proven eective in inhibiting primary and distant tumor growth and prolonging the survival time of tumor-bearingmice. Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-L1 antibody and anti- CTLA-4 antibody, have greatly changed the treatment and prog- nosis of cancers, especially melanoma. However, only a mi- nority of solid tumors respond to immune check inhibitors. Nanoparticle-based multi-mode therapies, in combination with immunotherapy, have achieved abscopal eects in various tumors.[10,17,23]However,thesynergisticeectofthesecombina- tionstrategiesusuallyrequirescommercialadjuvants(e.g.,CpG, or immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 antibodies), which inevitably increases the complexity and cost of cancer treatment. In our study, Sea- Macnanovaccinescanfunctionasanadjuvanttoevokeabscopal eectsinbothCT26andB16-F10tumorsintheabsenceofaddi- tionalimmunoactivators.Withoutthehelpofanti-PD-L1oranti- CTLA-4antibody,theevokedCD8+IFN-+TcellsbyPDT treatments substan- tially improve abscopal response rates but not necessarily with induced\"abscopaleect.\" Furthermore, tumor heterogeneity often limits the eec- tiveness of cancer therapy, which may explain why traditional approachesbasedonadministrationofoneorseveral\"selected\" neoantigens fail to improve immunotherapeutic responses.[24] Min et al. engineered the biodegradable polymer poly lactic- co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles with dierent functional groups for neoantigen capture and found that the combination of Mal AC-NPs with PD-1 antibody facilitated the absco- pal eect.[10]The ex vivostimulation studies of splenocytes showed that the captured neoantigens can induce neoantigen- specic T cell proliferation and activation. This indicates that antigen-capturing nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy oer a promising strategy for personalized therapy. It means that the neoantigens captured by Mal-NPs CT26 tumor model. f) Growth curves of untreated (secondary) tumors in individual mice in (c). g) Growth curves of untreated (secondary) tumors in individual mice in (e). h) The survival rate of the mice in the B16-F10 tumor model. i) The survival rate of the mice in the articial synthesis. More- over, PLGA NPs were selected as delivery systems due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability.[10]Dierent from PLGA NPs, Mal-NPs has intrinsic C7A (the inner core of Mal-NPs) can potently promote DC maturation through STING without the need for additional adjuvants, providing a simpleandlow-costpersonalizedcancerimmunotherapy. 3.Conclusion Unlike for clinical use, the SeaMac strategy may hold high potential for personalized immunotherapy in clinical trials with short production duration, low cost, and widespread applications.
