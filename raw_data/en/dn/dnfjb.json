This includes energy work (such as Reiki, Therapeutic Touch, and Qi Gong), shiatsu and other massage, and gentle osteopathic -type manipulation. With these techniques, I can be more effective than I could be with needles alone, especially for musculoskeletal conditions. I am in direct contact with the patient's body and energy systems. I stay with the patient for the entire treatment; I don't just put in some needles and leave. Normally I spend an hour or more with each patient .\" Community Resources - What's Out There \"Dr. Ferreira began her path in healthcare as a medical assistant and surgical assistant at Lovelace Hospital in 2000, while also earning her undergraduate degree from the University of New Mexico focusing on Biology and Chemistry.

I've been here twice and both masseuses have been professional and really took the time to find and work on my trouble areas as well as give me stretches to do at home. They do have licenses hanging on the wall. Masseuse seemed like somebody's uncle they'd just brought in to cover for the day. Never saw a license for the guy. He spent most of the time complaining about his ex -wife, and the rest copping a feel. Hide your kids, hide your wife. Massage therapist had a runny nose and a horrible cough! I was surprised to find her blowing her nose during the massage, then continuing to rub My shoulders. I made a comment that I was uncomfortable and it was ignored! After she coughed in her hand and tried to run her hands threw my hair I had to stop my massage! While leaving I explained why I was upset, I was just given a blank stare. Questions to Consider When Interviewing Potential Providers What medical conditions interest you the most? -Good Responses: Provider identifies the top 3- 5 medical conditions they're interested in. -Questionable Responses: Provider says they're interested in and effective in treating almost all medical conditions. This may mean that they're either desperate for business or that they don't yet have enough experience to know what they're most effective at treatment. Questions to Consider When Interviewing Potential Providers Will I still need to see my medical doctor if I'm receiving treatment from you? -Good Responses: Provider talks about how their treatment complements that of the medical doctor. -Questionable Responses: Provider leads you to believe that they can/will provide your medical care. Acupuncture, chiropractic, medical massage, and healing touch (or Reiki) are called Complementary Alternative Medicine services because they complement traditional western medicine. In NM, both chiropractors and acupuncturists are considered primary care providers. However, they do not have the same breadth of education and training as a medical doctor. Questions to Consider When Interviewing Potential Providers Have you ever worked with someone who _________ (behavioral description of condition or it's symptoms that may think are problematic)? What steps did you take to make the situation more workable for you and the client? -Good Responses: Provider's verbal and non-verbal responses are congruent. The provider comfortably talks about specific steps they've taken to make to make treatment more viable for the client. -Questionable Responses: Verbal and non-verbal responses are incongruent. Provider can't talk about specific steps they've taken, or they talk about steps they've taken to make the situation more workable for them not the client.
