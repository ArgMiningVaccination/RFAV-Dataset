It includes both general data collection conventions and item- specific guidance, as well as links to resources for agencies. 1.2 Organization of the Manual This manual includes the following content: Cha pter 1 - Introduction to the OASIS Manual, including the manual purpose, structure and content, and description of the OASIS requirements and conventions. The manual summarizes the statutory authorityfor OASIS data collection, and describes the backgro und on the development of OASIS, and its version history. Cha pter 2 - The importance of Data Accuracy, and how HHAs may audit OASIS data to minimize errors. This chapter briefly describes OASIS data correction and implications for reporting. Cha pter 3 - Item-specific guidance, subdivided into sections Appe ndix A - Glossary and Common Acronyms Appe ndix B - OASIS items, Time Points and Uses table Appe ndix C - OASIS Instruments (All Items, and all Time Points versions) Appe ndix D - Description of Changes fr om OASIS -D to OASIS -E table Appe ndix E - References and Resources Appe ndix F - OASIS and Quality Improvement 1.3 Background In the early 1990s the Health Care Financing Administration (renamed to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service [CMS] in 2001) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded research at the University of Colorado (Denver) Health Sciences Center to develop, test and refine a system of outcome quality measures that Medicare and home health agencies (HHAs) could use to continuously i mprove the effectiveness of home health care 1. Through multiple phases of testing and revision researchers developed and refined a core group of data elements to uniformly measure and risk adjust outcomes quality measures. The data set, called the Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), measured quality across all HHAs, to produce outcome measures and reports and serve as the basis of outcomes -based quality improvement (OBQI). Selected OASIS items were later identified for use in payment determina tion in the Prospective Payment System (PPS). 1 Shaughnessy PW, Crisler KS, Schlenker RI, Arnold AG, Kramer AM, Powell MC, and Hittle DF. (1994), Fall. Measuring and assuring the quality of home health care. Health Care Financing Review, 16 (1):35 -67. Chapter 1 OASIS Guidance Manual Introduction OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 4 OASIS and its associated Guidance Manual are periodically revised based on CMS's addition or removal of quality measures from the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HHQRP) or for other program requirements . Table 1 lists the version history of OASIS. 1.4 Changes from OASIS-D to OASIS-E Currently the main reason for revising OASIS is to increase standardization across post- acute care (PAC) settings to uniformly collect social determinants of health data and to enable calculation of standardized, cross- setting quality measures (QMs), pursuant to the provisions of the Improving Medicare Post- Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act. Standardized assessment data elements are assessment items and response options that are harmonized across four PAC assessment instruments, and to which aligned standards and definitions apply. 1.4.1 W hat's new with the OASIS instrument? New sections and items are added Different time point versions of some items Removal of some items Revision of some items Updated skip patterns Refer to the Chapter 3 Introduction and Appendix D for a more detailed summary of instrument and guidance changes. 1.5 OASIS Requirements This section provides a basic overview of collecting OASIS data. Refer to Chapter 3 of this manual for more detail on strategies for completing the OASIS as part of a comprehensive assessment. 1.5.1 Who does OASIS data collection apply to? OASIS data are collected for skilled Medicare and Medicaid patients, 18 years and older, except for patients receiving services for pre - or postnatal conditions. Those receiving only personal care, homemaker, or chore services are excluded from OASIS data collection and submission requirements. 1.5.2 OASIS and the comprehensive assessment OASIS data are collected as part of the comprehensive assessment required by the Medicare Conditions of Participation . 2 OASIS is not intended to represent a comprehensive assessment in and of itself. HHAs are expected to incorporate OASIS items into their comprehensive assessment documentation and follow their own assessment policies and procedures. Agencies may rearrange OASIS item sequence in a way that permits logical ordering within their own forms and electronic records, as long as the actual item content, and OASIS number and formatting remain the same, and maintaining the same skip logic. The comprehensive assessment forms the basis of the physician-ordered Plan of Care. Thus, there should be congruence between the overall comprehensive assessment and the Plan of Care. Agencies may have the comprehensive assessment including OASIS, if applicable, completed by one clinician. If collaboration with other health care personnel and/or agency staff is utilized, the agency is responsible for establishing policies and practices related to collaborative efforts, including how assessment information from 2 https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title -42/chapter -IV/subchapter -G/part -484 Chapter 1 OASIS Guidance Manual Introduction OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 5 multiple clinicians will be documented within the clinical record, ensuring compliance with applicable requirements, and accepted standards of practice. 1.5.3 W hen is OASIS Completed? (T ime Points ) OASIS data are collected at the time points listed in the table below, and within the required assessment timeframe. Not all OASIS items are completed at every assessment time point. All OASIS assessments, except transfer to inpatient facility and death at home, require the clinician to have an in -person encounter with the patient during a home visit. The transfer to an inpatient facility and deat h at home time points require collection of limited OASIS data (most of which may be obtained through a telephone call). OASIS data should be collected at each time point based on a unique patient assessment, not simply carried over from a previous assessm ent. Time Point Reason for Assessment (RFA, M0100) Assessment Timeframe Start of care (SOC) 1. Start of care - further visits planned Within 5 calendar days after the SOC date (SOC = Day 0) Resumption of care (ROC) 3. Resumption of care (after inpatient stay) Within 2 calendar days of the facility discharge date or knowledge of patient's return home Follow-up (FU) 4. Recertification (follow -up) assessment The last 5 days of every 60 days i.e., days 56-60 of the current 60-day period 5. Other follow-up Within 2 calendar days of significant change of patient's condition Transfer to an Inpatient Facility (TRN) 6. Transferred to an inpatient facility - patient not discharged from agency Within 2 calendar days of disch/trans/death date or knowledge of a qualifying transfer to inpatient facility 7. Transferred to an inpatient facility - patient discharged from agency Within 2 calendar days of disch/trans/death date or knowledge of a qualifying transfer to inpatient facility Discharge from Agency - not to an inpatient facility (DC) 8. Death at home (DAH) Within 2 calendar days of disch/trans/death date 9. Discharge from agency (DC) Within 2 calendar days of disch/trans/death date. 1.5.4 Who Completes OASIS? As identified in (M0080) Discipline of Person Completing Assessment, the comprehensive assessment including OASIS data collection, if applicable, is the responsibility of a registered nurse (RN) or any of the therapies, including physical therapist (PT), speech language pathologist/speech therapist (SLP/ST), or occupational therapist (OT). A licensed practical nurse or licensed vocational nurse (LPN/LVN), physical Chapter 1 OASIS Guidance Manual Introduction OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 6 therapist assistant (PTA), occupational therapy assistant (OTA), medical social worker (MSW), or Aide may not be responsible for completing the comprehensive assessment and OASIS. In cases involving nursing, the RN is responsible for completing the SOC comprehensive assessment, including OASIS if applicable. For a Medicare therapy -only case, the PT or SLP may conduct the SOC comprehensive assessment including OASIS. Effective January 1, 2022, OTs may conduct the SOC comprehensive assessments including OASIS for Medicare patients when the physician's referral order does not include skilled nursing, but does include PT and/or SLP, along with OT. Any discipline qualified to perform OASIS assessments (RN, PT, SLP, OT) may complete subsequent OASIS assessments (e.g., transfers, recertifications, resumptions of care, discharge) after the SOC. Note: Services which establish eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit include skilled nursing, PT and SLP. The change allowing OT to conduct SOC comprehensive assessments did not alter Medicare's criteria for establishing initial eligibility (i.e., the need for OT does not establish the initial eligibility for the HH benefit). The Medicare home health patient who initially qualifies for the home health benefit by requiring skilled nursing, PT or SLP, can retain eligibility if, over time, occupational therapy is the only remaining skilled discipline providing care. OT may conduct all subsequent comprehensive assessments with OASIS, if applicable. Multidisciplinary cases may have multiple points of discipline -specific discharge, though there is only one HHA discharge, which must include completion of the comprehensive discharge assessment including OASIS if applicable. Other non-OASIS required documentation for admission, recertification and discharge are specified in the Condition of Participation: Comprehensive Assessment of Patients .3 1.5.5 Conventions for Completing OASIS This section lists conventions, or general rules, to follow when completing OASIS. Item- specific guidance is provided in Chapter 3. It is not possible to address all situations and exceptions that may arise in clinical practice. Each patient scenario, clinical status, and social and environmental situation requires the clinician to consider available guidance and allows use of professional judgment and interdisciplinary collaboration for assessment. The OASIS guidance is updated periodically through the CMS Quarterly OASIS Q&As, based on questions received by the Home Health Quality Help Desk. In the event you cannot resolve your understanding of the OASIS item guidance by reviewing the OASIS Guidance Manual and/or the Q&A documents, consider submitting your question to the Home Health Quality Help Desk (a link to the OASIS Q&As and the email address for the Home Health Quality Help Desk can be found in Appendix E. References and Resou rces). 1.5.5.1 General OASIS Item Conventions 1. Understand the time period under consideration (look back) for each item. Report what is true on the day of assessment unless a different time period has been indicated in the item or related guidance. Day of assessment is defined as the 24 hours immediately preceding the home visit and the time spent by the clinician in the home. 2. For OASIS purposes, a quality episode must have a beginning (that is, an SOC or ROC assessment) and a conclusion (that is, a Transfe r, Death at Home, and Discharge assessment) to be considered a complete quality episode. 3 https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title -42/part -484 Chapter 1 OASIS Guidance Manual Introduction OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 7 3. If the patient's ability or status varies on the day of the assessment, report the patient's \"usual status\" or what is true greater than 50% of the time period under consideration, unless the item specifies differently. 4. Minimize the use of NA and Unknown responses. 5. Some items allow a dash response . A dash (-) value indicates that no information is available. CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. 6. Responses to items documenting a patient's current status should be based on observation and report of the patient's condition and ability at the time of the assessment without referring back to prior assessments or documentation of status from a prior care setting. Seve ral process items require review of documentation of care that occurred at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC or ROC OASIS assessment. These instructions are included in item guidance for the relevant OASIS items. 7. Assessment strategies to complete any and all OASIS items include observation, interview, collaboration with other agency staff and other relevant strategies, unless otherwise noted in guidance. For example, it is acceptable to review the hospital discharge summary for informatio n on a patient's episodes of confusion, or to interview the caregiver regarding the patient's incontinence. However, when assessing physiologic or functional health status, direct observation is the preferred strategy. 8. When an OASIS item refers to assistan ce, this means assistance from another person. Assistance is not limited to physical contact and can include necessary verbal cues and/or supervision. 9. Complete OASIS items accurately and comprehensively and adhere to skip patterns. 10. Understand the definitio ns of words as used in the OASIS. 11. Follow rules included in the item- specific Guidance (Chapter 3 of this manual). 12. Stay current with evolving CMS OASIS guidance via updates to the guidance manual and posted Q&A documents. 13. The comprehensive assessment includ es the OASIS items and is part of the patient's legal home health agency clinical record. 14. While only the assessing clinician is responsible for accurately completing and signing a comprehensive assessment, they may collaborate to collect data for all OASI S items, if agency policy allows. Collaboration may consider information from others such as the patient, caregivers, and other health care personnel, including the physician, pharmacist, and/or other agency staff who have had direct contact with the patie nt or had some other means of gathering information to contribute to the OASIS data collection. When collaboration is utilized, the M0090 - Date Assessment Completed, is the last date that information used to complete the comprehensive assessment and determine OASIS coding was gathered by the assessing clinician and documentation of the specific information/responses was completed. When used, collaboration must occur within the assessment timeframe and be consistent with data collection guidance. Any exception to this general convention concerning collaboration is identified in item- specific guidance. 15. The use of the term \" specifically ,\" means scoring of the item should be limited to only the circumstances listed. The use of \" for example,\" means the clinician may consider other relevant circumstances or attributes when scoring the item. Chapter 1 OASIS Guidance Manual Introduction OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 8 16. Section 3708 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act amended section 1861(aa)(5) of the Act, allowing nurse practitioners (NPs), clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), and phys ician assistants (PAs) to certify eligibility and provide orders for home health services, where not prohibited by State Law. Accordingly, when coding OASIS items where the presence of a physician's order affects the item coding, orders from these allowed practitioners would satisfy the condition of having a physician's order. 1.5.5.2 Conventions Specific to OASIS M1800 ADL/IADL Items 1. Report the patient's physical and cognitive ability to perform a task . Do not report on the patient's preference or willingness to perform a specified task. 2. The level of ability refers to the level of assistance (if any) that the patient requires to safely complete a specified task. Assistance includes verbal cues, reminders, supervision and/or stand-by or hands-on assistance. 3. While the presence or absence of a caregiver may impact the way a patient carries out an activity, it does not impact the assessing clinician's ability to assess the patient to determine and report the level of assistance the patient requires to safely complete a task. 4. Understand what tasks are included and excluded in each item and select the OASIS response based only on included tasks. 5. If the patient's ability varies between the different tasks included in a multi- task item, report what is true in a majority of the included tasks , giving more weight to tasks that are more frequently performed. 6. Consider medical restrictions when determ ining ability. For example, if the physician/allowed practitioner has ordered activity restrictions, consider this when selecting the best response to functional items related to ambulation, transferring, bathing, etc. Chapter 2 Data Accuracy and Correct ion of the OASIS Assessments OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 9 CHAPTER 2: DATA ACCURACY AND CORRECTION OF THE OASIS ASSESSMENTS 2.1 Data Accuracy In any data-driven system, the quality of the output is only as good as the quality of the data input. OASIS data are used for multiple purposes, including production of quality reports for agencies, public reports on the Care Compare website, and to determine payment. Thus, it is imperative that the OASIS data that HHAs collect and submit be accurate and complete. Regulatory language specifying accuracy of OASIS data can be found in the Medicare Conditions of Participation Accuracy of Encoded OASIS Data found in Section 484.55 of the Conditions of Participation (See Appendix E). This language stipulates that the encoded OASIS data must accurately reflect the patient's status at the time the information is collected. The State survey process for HHAs may include review of OASIS data collected versus data encoded and transmitted to the CMS. 2.2 Data Auditing It follows that minimizing data errors that could affect accuracy of clinical data or outcome analyses is a necessary condition. This is the responsibility of the agency since, ultimately, agency-level quality reports reflect the data agencies input into the system. Internal staff development and training should focus on data accuracy, not only at the start-up of OASIS data collection, but on a continuing basis. Once the qualified skilled professional (specifically, RN, PT, SLP/ST, or OT) completes the assessment, the HHA should develop internal systems for monitoring data accuracy to ensure that the OASIS data transmitted to CMS exactly reflects the data collected by the skilled professional. Processes to promote data accuracy may include cli nical record audits, data entry audits, reports produced from electronic health record systems or other activities. Routine agency OASIS data audits are recommended, with audit frequency determined by the agency. Some data audit activities might be conducted monthly, while others conducted at less frequent intervals, such as quarterly. The following guidelines offer examples of approaches for monitoring the quality of OASIS data in an agency. Types of audi ts, their recommended frequency, and categories of staff members (to conduct data audit activities and summarize findings) are suggested. Use of these approaches are not mandated by CMS, nor do they ensure regulatory compliance. If problems are identified, it is also recommended that the agency develop and implement a plan to correct data quality problems. Table 1 displays the data quality audit approaches discussed and summarizes the purpose, frequency, and procedures for each. Chapter 2 Data Accuracy and Correct ion of the OASIS Assessments OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 10 Table 1: Data Quality Audits Audit Type Purpose Frequency Overview of Procedure Performed By Clinical Record Audit To verify accuracy of OASIS patient status items compared to other related patient documentation Monthly Review at least five SOC records and five discharge records. Compare OASIS items to other documentation from the SOC or discharge visits and from other visits surrounding SOC or discharge. QI Coordinator Clinical Audit Visits To verify accuracy of OASIS assessment data (that is, evaluate assessment methodology and assessment skills of clinical staff) Quarterly For at least three or four patients on a team or within the agency, a supervisor or peer auditor attends the SOC visit. The auditor completes OASIS items while the assessing clinician conducts the assessment and completes SOC paperwork. OASIS item codes are compared for consistency between auditor and care provider. Consider similar auditing efforts for the additional time points after the SOC. QI Coordinator, Clinical Supervisor, or Clinical Staff 2.21 Clinical Record Audits Clinical record audits allow an agency to monitor the validity of OASIS data. This quality check assesses the congruence of OASIS data with other patient status information found in the clinical record. To complete a clinical record audit, an abbreviated r ecord review can be conducted for at least five new admissions and five patients discharged from the agency (but not due to an inpatient facility admission). Records should be randomly selected, in order to evaluate data quality for a cross-section of pati ents and care providers. In the event that the agency has fewer than five patients admitted to or discharged from the agency, review all records. It should be noted that many agencies may choose to audit a larger sample and some may audit 100% of records. 2.22 Procedure for Clinical Record Audits For new admissions, review the start of care (SOC) OASIS items and compare to other admission documentation and two or three subsequent visit notes, if they occur within the first week after SOC. In addition, if care providers from two disciplines perform assessments on the patient within one week of SOC (for example, registered nurse conducts comprehensive assessment visit and completes OASIS items; the physical therapist visits two days later and evaluates the pat ient), the documentation would be compared. Reviewers would evaluate whether any discrepancies between the SOC OASIS assessment and the other documentation are sufficiently significant to indicate a data quality problem. For example, if the SOC OASIS items indicate that the patient is fully independent in ambulation, but other documentation indicates that the patient needs assistance when walking, a data quality problem may exist. Assess for any discrepancies between sociodemographic items (for example, payment source or birth date) in addition to discrepancies in clinical assessments (ICD -10-CM codes, all clinical assessment OASIS items). Chapter 2 Data Accuracy and Correct ion of the OASIS Assessments OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 11 The records for discharged patients could be reviewed in the same manner. All discharge OASIS patient status items would be compared to other discharge information as well as to the previous two or three visit notes (if those visits occur within the same week of discharge). If there are unexpected/unexplainable differences in descriptions of the patient, a potential data quality problem may exist. If differences are found that cannot be explained by other documentation in the clinical record, the care provider who completed the OASIS would be contacted to determine if the discrepancies were real (for example, the patient did change significantly between the SOC visit and a visit the next day) or if an error was made when recording OASIS data. If data quality problems exist, the problems can be corrected. If clinical documentation must be amended, this is done according to agency policy. Any corrections to OASIS data in the clinical record must also be reflected in the OASIS database maintained by the agency, and if data submission has already occurred, a correction must be transmitted to CMS. 2.23 Clinical Audit Visits Clinic al audit visits provide an opportunity to verify the quality of patient status data collected by assessing clinicians. It is recommended that each quarter agencies conduct supervisory (or peer) audit visits to at least three to four patients. These audit visits should occur at the admission comprehensive assessment visit, as well as at other time points based on agency needs and goals. Within a one- year period, each clinical staff member of an average -sized agency or agency's team thus can receive an audit visit. The supervisor or peer auditor should complete the OASIS items while observing the assessing clinician conducting the assessment visit. The assessing clinician and auditor should not discuss OASIS items between themselves during the visit. The QI coordinator (or designated person) then compares each code on the OASIS items completed by the assessing clinician to the OASIS codes completed by the auditor. Discrepancies should be noted. Any differences between OASIS coding should be discussed jointly by the assessing clinician and auditor to determine the reasons for the differences and to ensure that assessing clinicians fully understand the OASIS items and related guidance. It is not necessary to select a random sample of patients for the audit visits, but the QI coordinator or QI team should ensure that a variety of patients and assessing clinicians are represented. 2.3 Summarizing Audit Activities Agencies would summarize findings from all audit activities as they are completed. Because these audit activities will be an ongoing quality monitoring activity, it may be helpful to include summaries of findings in quarterly QI reports. If data quality problems are identified from the audit activities, investigations would be conducted into the cause(s) of the problems, and action plans developed and implemented to resolve the problems. Approaches to assure that accurate patient- level data are utilized to describe patient status and to compute outcome measures increase the likelihood that agency -level outcome reports accurately describe the effectiveness of patient care. 2.4 Data Correction and Reporting Implications All HHA users are expected to submit required OASIS records to CMS via the internet Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (iQIES). An automated correction policy exists related to submission of modification and inactivation records when the current OASIS record in the iQIES database is erroneous. The following two processes have been established to correct records that have been accepted into iQIES: A Modification record should be used when a record has been accepted into iQIES, but the information in the record contains clinical errors or errors to non-key fields. An Inactivation record should be used when a record has been accepted into iQIES but the corresponding event did not occur or information in ANY of the key fields are erroneous. Chapter 2 Data Accuracy and Correct ion of the OASIS Assessments OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 12 Users are not allowed to change data in key fields. If data in the key fields in the current record are inaccurate, the current record must be inactivated and a new replacement record should be submitted. Effective January 1, 2020, HHAs have 24 months from the assessment target date to submit, modify or inactivate OASIS records. For additional details including the list of key fields, please reference the QIES Technical Support Office for HH Providers (See Appendix E) . Additionally, online help is available in iQIES for those users who take advantage of the assessment data entry software within iQIES. To access this online support authorized users would log into iQIES, select the Help link from the bottom of the page, and select the Assessments tab. Before data is publicly reported on Care Compare, HH providers have an opportunity to review and correct, as well as preview, their data. A Review and Correct Report is available for providers to access in the iQIES CMS reporting system. The Review and Correct Report will assist providers in identifying whether there are any issues with the data already collected and submitted before the applicable quarterly data submission deadlines. Correction of any errors identified by the agency must be submitted by the final submission deadlines, which can be found on the CMS HH QRP Data Submission Deadlines web page. Only updates/corrections to the underlying assessment data submitted before the data correction deadline will be reflected in the publicly reported data on Care Compare. If a provider corrects assessment data after the data correction deadline, the corrected data will only be reflected in the QM agency - and patient -level reports. Corrections will not be reflected in the Provider Preview Reports or on the Care Compare website. A quarterly Provider Preview Report issued by CMS displays the data that will be publicly reported. This report is available approximately 3 months prior to display on Care Compare. It provides an opportunity to review agency -level assessment and claims -based QM data for measures that will be publicly reported on the Care Compare website for that reporting perio d. Chapter 3 Item-by-Item Guide to the OASIS Assessment Instru ment OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 13 CHAPTER 3: ITEM-BY- ITEM GUIDE TO THE OASIS ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT 3.1 Overview This chap ter provides item-by-item coding instructions for HH assessing clinicians to complete each section of the OASIS -E instrument. The goal of this chapter is to provide HH st aff with the rationale and guidance necessary t o accurately complete each i tem of the OASI S Assessment. OASIS -E is a major revision to the OASIS instrument and guidance manual resulting in significant instrument redesign and manual reorganization. To align the items and guidance across the PAC settings, multiple new standardized items have been added to OASIS-E, new sections have been added or renamed, items have been reorganized within the sections, and the format for item specific guidance has changed. 3.2 OASIS- E Sections OASIS -E includes the following sections: Section Title Section Title A Administrative Information Patient Tracking H Bowel and Bladder B Hearing, Speech, and Vision I Active Diagnoses C Cognitive Patterns J Health Conditions D Mood K Swallowing/Nutritional Status E Behavior M Skin Conditions F Preferences for Customary Routine Activities N Medications G Functional Status O Special Treatments, Procedures and Programs GG Functional Status: Functional Abilities and Goals Q Participation in Assessment and Goal Setting 3.3 Using This Chapter Item-specific guidance has been included for all new items introduced in OASIS-E and for those retained from OASIS -D. Each section begins with a brief introduction describing the items found in the section. The sources of information clinicians use to respond to items are now located in the first bullet under Response- Specific Instructions, and the OASIS- D Section \"Data Sources/Resources\" has been removed. Dash language has been added to each item indicating whether a Dash is an acceptable response or not. General formatting and organization changes have been made to improve clarity and remove redundancy. Throughout this chapter, the sections of OASIS-E are presented using a standard format for ease of review by HH staff. The layout and text color for headings varies from OASIS- D. Item -specific guidance includes additional headings to convey information, for example, Coding Instructions, Coding Tips and Examples where appropriate, the order of information for all items in each section of the OASIS- E is presented as follows: Chapter 3 Item-by-Item Guide to the OASIS Assessment Instru ment OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 14 Item Display.

Coding Instructions Dash is not a valid response for this item. A1005: Ethnicity Item Intent The intent of this item is to identify the patient's self -reported ethnicity data. Item Rationale The ability to improve understanding of and address racial and ethnic disparities in health care outcomes requires the availability of better data related to social determinants of health, including ethnicity. The ethnicity and race data elements use a two -question format. Collection of A1005, Ethnicity and A1010, Race provide data granularity important for documenting and tracking health disparitie s and conform to the 2011 Health and Human Services Data Standards. Collection of ethnicity data is an important step in improving quality of care and health outcomes. Standardizing self-reported data collection for ethnicity allows for the comparison of data within and cross multiple post- acute care settings. These categories are NOT used to determine eligibility for participation in any Federal program. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Response- Specific Instructions Ask the patient to select t he category or categories that most closely corresponds to the patient's ethnicity from the list in A1005, Ethnicity. Chapter 3 Section A: Administrative Information - Patient Tracking OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 25 o Individuals may be more comfortable if this and the subsequent question are introduced by saying, \"We want to make sure that all our patients get the best care possible, regardless of their ethnic background.\" Respondent should be offered the option of selecting one or more ethnic designations. If a patient is unable to respond, a proxy response may be used. If neither the patient nor a proxy is able to provide a response to this item, use medical record documentation. If a patient declines to respond, do not code based on proxy response or medical record documentation. If the patient can provide a response: o Check all that apply o Check the box(es) indicating the ethnic category or categories identified by the patient Complete as close to the time of SOC as possible Coding Instructions Code X, Patient unable to respond, if the patient is unable to respond. o If the patient is unable to respond, a response may be determined via proxy input. If a proxy is not able to provide a response, medical record documentation may be used. o If the response(s) is/are determined via proxy input, and/or medical record documentation, check all boxes that apply, including Code X - Patient unable to respond. o If the patient is unable to respond and no other resources (proxy input or medical record documentation) provided the necessary information, Code X - Patient unable to respond, only. Code Y, Patient declines to respond, if the patient declines to respond . o In the cases where the patient declines to respond, Code Y - Patient declines to respond, only. o If the patient declines to respond, do not code based on a proxy input or medi cal record documentation. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Examples 1. The patient had an acute CVA with mental status changes. During the SOC assessment the patient is unable to respond to questions regarding their ethnicity. The patient's spouse informs the nurse that they are Cuban. Coding: A1005, Ethnicity would be coded as D - Yes, Cuban and X - Patient unable to respond. Rationale: If a patient is unable to respond and the proxy provides the response, code both the proxy response and X - Patient unable to respond. 2. The patient is admitted following a THA and declines to respond to questions regarding their ethnicity. Coding: A1005, Ethnicity would be coded as Y - Patient declines to respond. Rationale: If a patient declines to respond to this item, then the only response option that should be coded is Y - Patient declines to respond. No attempts should be made to use proxy input or medical record documentation to complete A1005, Ethnicity when a patient declines to respond. Chapter 3 Section A: Administrative Information - Patient Tracking OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 26 A1010: Race Item Intent The intent of this item is to identify the patient's self -reported race data. Item Rationale The ability to improve understanding of and address racial and ethnic disparities in health care outcomes requires the availability of better data related to soci al determinants of health, including race. The ethnicity and race data elements use a two -question format. Collection of A1005, Ethnicity and A1010, Race provides data granularity important for documenting and tracking health disparities and conform to the 2011 Health and Human Services Data Standards. Collection of the race data is an important step in improving quality of care and health outcomes. Standardizing self-reported data collection for race allows for the equal comparison of data across multiple post- acute care settings. These categories are NOT used to determine eligibility for participation in any Federal program. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Response- Specific Instructions Ask the patient to select the category or categories that most closely correspond to the patient's race from the list in A1010, Race. o Individuals may be more comfortable if this and the preceding question are introduced by saying \"We want to make sure that all our patients get the best care possible, regardless of their racial background.\" Respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more race category. Chapter 3 Section A: Administrative Information - Patient Tracking OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 27 If a patient is unable to respond, a proxy response may be used. If neither the patient nor a proxy is able to respond to this item use medical record documentation. If the patient declines to respond, do not code based on a proxy response or medical record documentation. If the patient can provide a response: o Check all that apply o Check the box(es) for indicating the race category or categories identified by the patient. Complete as close to the time of SOC as possible Coding Instructions Code X, Patient unable to respond, if the patient is unable to respond . o In the cases where the patient is unable to respond, a response may be determined via proxy input. If a proxy is not able to provide a response, medical record documentation may be used. o If the response(s) is/are determined via proxy input and/or medical documentation, check all boxes that apply, including Code X - Patient unable to respond. o If the patient is unable to respond and no other resources (proxy input or medical record documentation) provided the necessary information, Code X - Patient unable to respond, only. Code Y, Patient declines to respond, if the patient declines to respond . o In the cases where the patient declines to respond, Code Y - Patient declines to respond, only. o If the patient declines to respond, do not code based on proxy input or medical record documentation to complete this item. Code Z, None of the above, if the patient reports or it is determined from proxy or medical record documentation that none of the listed races apply to the patient. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Examples 1. The patient has severe dementia with agitation. During the SOC assessment the patient is unable to respond. The patient's child informs the nurse that the patient is Korean and African American. Coding: A1010 would be coded as B- Black or African American, H - Korean, and X - Patient unable to respond. Rationale: If a patient is unable to respond and the proxy provides the response, code both the proxy response and X - Patient unable to respond. 2. The patient decli nes to provide their race during the admission assessment stating, \"I'd rather not answer .\" Coding: A1010, Race would be coded as Y - Patient declines to respond. Rationale: If a patient declines to respond to this item, then code only Y, Patient declines to respond. No attempts should be made to use proxy input or medical record documentation to complete A1010, Race when a patient declines to respond. 3. The patient is admitted to the HHA following a recent CVA resulting in confusion and is unable to inform the assessing clinician which race applies to them. The proxy reports that none of the listed races apply to the patient. Coding: A1010, Race would be coded as X, Patient unable to respond and Z, None of the above. Chapter 3 Section A: Administrative Information - Patient Tracking OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 28 Rationale: If a patient is unable to respond, proxy input may be used to code A1010, Race. When a patient is unable to respond but proxy input can provide the necessary information, code both the information from the proxy input, in this case- Z, None of the above, and X, Patient unable to respond. M0150: Current Payment Sources for Home Care Item Intent This item identifies payers who will be billed by your home health agency for services provided during the home health episode. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Response- Specific Instructions Review referral information and health insurance identification cards. Exclude \"pending\" payment sources. If the patient's care is being reimbursed by multiple payers (for exampl e, Medicare and Medicaid; private insurance and self -pay; etc.), include all sources. If one or more payment sources are known but additional sources are uncertain, mark only those that are known. Do not consider any equipment, medications, or supplies being paid for by the patient in part or in full. Coding Instructions Code 2, if the payment source is a Medicare HMO, another Medicare Advantage Plan, or Medicare Part C. Code 3, if the patient is receiving services provided as part of a Medicaid waiver or home and community -based waiver (HCBS) program. Code 6, if the patient is receiving services through one of the following programs: o Title III - State Agency on Aging grants, which encourage State Agencies on Aging to develop and implement comprehensive and coordinated community-based systems of service for older individuals via Statewide planning and area planning. The objective of these services and centers is Chapter 3 Section A: Administrative Information - Patient Tracking OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 29 to maximize the informal support provided to older Americans to enable them to remain in their homes and communities. This program ensures that elders receive the services they need to remain independent by providing transportation services, in-home services, and caregiver support services; o Title V - State programs to maintain and strengthen their leadership in planning, promoting, coordinating and evaluating health care for pregnant women, mothers, infants, and children, and children with special health care needs in providing health services for mothers and children who do not have access to adequate health care; o Title XX - Social service block grants available to states to provide homemaking, chore service, home management or home health aide services and enable each State to furnish social services best suited to the needs of the individuals residing in the State.

Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 30 SECTION A: ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION A1110: Language Item Intent The intent of this item is to identify the patient's self -reported preferred language and need for an interpreter. Item Rationale Language barriers can lead to social isolation, depression, and patient safety issues. Language barriers can interfere with accurate assessment. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Response Specific Instructions Ask for the patient's preferred language. Ask if the patient needs or wants an interpreter to communicate with a doctor or health care staff. If the patient themselves - or with the assistance of an interpreter - is unable to respond to A1110A, What is your preferred language? or A1110B, Do you need or want an Interpreter? a proxy response is permitted. If neither the patient nor a proxy is able to provide a response to A1110A or A1110B, medical record documentation may be used. Complete as close to the time of SOC as possible. Coding Instructions for A1110A Enter the preferred language the patient primarily speaks or understands Dash is a valid response for this item. o If the patient or any available source cannot or does not identify preferred language, enter a dash (\"-\") in the first box. A dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 31 Coding Instructions for A1110B Code 0, No: if the patient indicates no want or need of an interpreter to communicate with a doctor or health care staff. o If the patient is unable to indicate the need or want of an interpreter proxy input may be used. o If the patient is unable and a proxy response is not available, then medical record documentation may be used. Code 1, Yes: if the patient indicates the need or want of an interpreter to communicate with a doctor or health care staff. Ensure that preferred language is indicated. o If the patient is unable to indicate the need or want of an interpreter, proxy input may be used. o If the patient is unable and a proxy response is not available, then medical record documentation may be used. Code 9, Unable to determine: if no source can identify whether the patient needs or wants an interpreter. Dash is not a valid response for this i tem. Coding Tips An organized system of signing, such as American Sign Language (ASL), can be reported as the preferred language if the patient needs or wants to communicate in this manner. M0080: Discipline of Person Completing Assessment Item Intent Specifies the discipline of the clinician completing the comprehensive assessment at the specified OASIS time point or the clinician reporting the transfer to an inpatient facility or death at home. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Transfer Discharge from agency Death at Home Response- Specific Instructions Data sources/resources for this item are agency policies. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 32 Enter the response associated with the discipline of the individual completing the assessment (referred to as the assessing clinician). Coding Instructions Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips While only the assessing clinician is responsible for accurately completing and signing a comprehensive assessment, they may collaborate to collect data for all OASIS items, if agency policy allows. According to the comprehensive assessment regulation, when both the RN and PT/SLP/OT are ordered on the initial referral, the RN must perform the SOC comprehensive assessment including OASIS. An RN, PT, SLP, or OT may perform subsequent assessments. LPNs, PTAs, COTAs, MSWs, and home health aides are not disciplines authorized to complete the comprehensive assessment or collect OASIS data. When both the RN and qualified therapist are scheduled to conduct discharge visits on the same day, the last qualified clinician to see the patient is responsible for conducting the discharge comprehensive assessmen t. M0090: Date Assessment Completed Item Intent Specifies the actual date the assessment is completed. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Transfer Discharge from Agency Death at Home Response- Specific Instructions If the day or month is only one digit, that digit should be preceded by a \"0\" (for example, May 4, 2021 = 05/04/2021). Enter all four digits of the year. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 33 Coding Instructions Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips Date Assessment Completed cannot be before the SOC date. The M0090 - Date Assessment Completed is the last date that information used to complete the comprehensive assessment and determine OASIS coding was gathered by the assessing clinician and documentation of the specific information/responses was completed. o Example: If the assessing clinician gathers additional information during the assessment timeframe that results in changing the coding of one or more OASI S items (for instance, identifies functional or cognitive information more representative of the patient's usual status than the code originally selected), the M0090 date would be changed to reflect the date the latest information was gathered by the asses sing clinician and documentation of the specific information/responses was completed. If an error is identified at any time, it should be corrected following the agency's correction policy and M0090 would not necessarily be changed. When completing a Transfer or Death at Home, record the date the agency completed the data collection after learning of the event. Comprehensive assessment, OASIS and collaboration The comprehensive assessment is a legal document and when signed by the assessing clinician, the signature serves as an attestation that to the best of their knowledge, the document, including OASIS responses, reflects the patient status as assessed, documented and/or supported in the patient's clinical record. Some OASIS items, for example, patient name, date of birth, or Medicare Number, may be completed initially by clerical staff as part of the intake/referral process, but should be verified by the assessing clinician when completing the assessment. For OASIS items requiring a patient assessment, the collaborating healthcare providers (e.g., other agency clinical staff: LPN/LVN, PTA, COTA, MSW, HHA) should have had direct in-person contact with the patient or have had some other means of gathering information to contribute to the OASIS data collection (health care monitoring devices, video streaming, review of photograph, phone call, etc.). When collaboration is utilized, the assessing clinician is responsible for considering available information from these other sources and selecting the appropriate OASIS item response(s), within the appropriate timeframe and consistent with data collection guidance. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 34 M0100: Assessment Reason Item Intent Identifies the \"time point\" - reason why the assessment data are being collected and reported.

Code 1, Start of care, for the start of care comprehensive assessment. A Plan of Care is being established, whether or not further visits will be provided after the start of care visit. This is the appropriate response anytime an initial HIPPS code (for a Home Health Resource Group) is required. Code 3, Resumption of care, when the patient: Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 35 o Resumes care following an inpatient stay of 24 hours or longer for reasons other than diagnostic tests. o Is discharged from an inpatient facility and care is resumed within the last 5 days of the 60- day certification period (that is, a recertification assessment is due). A ROC assessment, rather than a recertification assessment, is completed. Code 4, Recertification, if the follow -up assessment is conducted during the last five days of the 60- day certification period and is completed to continue the patient's services for an additional 60-day certification period. Code 5, Other follow -up, if the assessment is conducted due to a major decline or improvement in patient's healt h status occurring at a time other than during the last five days of the 60- day certification period. This assessment is done to re-evaluate the patient's condition, allowing revision to the patient's care plan as appropriate. Code 6, Transfer red to an Inpatient Facility - patient not discharged from agency , if the patient is admitted to an inpatient facility for 24 hours or longer (for reasons other than diagnostic tests), with the expectation that home health care will be resumed following inpati ent discharge. The patient is not discharged from the agency. A telephone call may provide the information necessary to complete the required data items. Short stay observation periods in a hospital, regardless of duration, do not meet the definition for transfer to an inpatient facility. Code 7, Transfer red to an Inpatient Facility - patient discharged from agency, if the patient is admitted to an inpatient facility for 24 hours or longer (for reasons other than diagnostic tests), and the agency does NOT anticipate the patient will be returning to care. The patient is discharged from the agency. A telephone call may provide the information necessary to complete the required data items. No additional OASIS discharge data are required. Short stay observation periods in a hospital, regardless of duration, do not meet the definition for transfer to an inpatient facility. Code 8, Death at home, when the patient dies: o At home, while receiving home health services. o Before being treated in the emergency department, or before being admitted to an inpatient facility. o In the emergency department. o Less than 24 hours after being admitted to an inpatient facility. o In outpatient surgery, or, in the care of the recovery room after outpatient surgery. o Do no t use Code 8, Death at home, when the patient dies after being admitted for a qualifying inpatient facility stay. A telephone call may provide the information necessary to complete the required data items. Code 9, Discharge from agency , when the patient is discharged from the agency for any reason other than transfer to an inpatient facility or death at home. This response includes transfer and discharge to another home health agency or an in-home hospice. The Discharge OASIS is not required when only a single visit is made in a quality episode (SOC/ROC to TRN/DC). Dash is not a valid response for this item.

Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 37 M0102: Date of Physician-ordered Start of Care (Resumption of Care) Item Intent The date specified by a physician/allowed practitioner order to start home care services (that is, provide the first covered service), or resume home care services (that is provide the first visit following a qualifying inpatient stay) regardless of the type of services ordered (for example, therapy only). Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Review the physician/al lowed practitioner orders to initiate home care, or resume home care following inpatient facility stay. Enter the date specified on the most recent physician/allowed practitioner order for the start or resumption of home care services. If the day or month is only one digit, that digit is preceded by a \"0\" (for example, May 4, 2019 = 05/04/2019). Enter all four digits of the year. If the originally ordered Start of Care (SOC)/Resumption of Care (ROC) is delayed due to the patient's condition or physician/allowed practitioner request (for example, extended hospitalization), then the date specified on the revised order to start/resume home care services would be considered the date of physician-ordered SOC/ROC. o For example, a patient discharged home on May 15, for whom the physician/allowed practitioner orders home care to begin May 20 for a specified order (for example, PT or administration of a subcutaneous drug), would have a physician-ordered SOC date of May 20. A revised physician's ordered SOC/ROC date must be received on or before the date of the previous physician's ordered SOC/ROC. If the order to extend the physician's ordered SOC/ROC date is received after the previous physician's ordered SOC/ROC date has passed, report NA for M0102 and report the original referral date in M0104. In order to be considered a physician-ordered SOC/ROC date, the physician/allowed practitioner must give a specific date to initiate or resume care, not a range of dates. o If a single date to initiate or resume services is not provided, the initial contact (via the initial assessment visit or ROC visit) must be conducted within 48 hours of the referral or within 48 hours of the patient's return home from the inpatient facility. When coding OASIS items where the presence of a physician's order affects the item coding, orders from an allowed practitioner including physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or other advanced practice nurse would satisfy the condition of having a physician's order. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 38 Coding Instructions Code N/A, o if the initial orders did not specify a SOC or ROC date, or, o if the order to extend the physician's ordered SOC/ROC date is received after the date of the previous order has passed. M0104: Date of Referral Item Intent Specifies the most recent date that verbal, written, or electronic authorization to begin or resume home care was received by the home health agency. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions The data sources/resources for responding to this item include the agency referral form; agency records specifying the date the referral was received by the agency; and/or hospital, nursing home, or other referring facility discharge information. A valid referral is considered received when the agency has received adequate information about a patient (such as name, address/contact info, and diagnosis and/or general home care needs) to initiate patient assessment and confirmed that the referring physician/allowed practitioner or another physician/allowed practitioner, will provide the plan of care and ongoing orders. o In cases where home care is requested by a hospitalist who will not be providing an ongoing plan of care for the patient, the agency must con tact an alternate or attending physician/allowed practitioner. The agency will note the date the alternate or attending physician/allowed practitioner agreed to follow the patient as the referral date (M0104) unless referral details are later updated or revised. Enter the date of the most recent/latest referral. If Start of Care or Resumption of Care is delayed due to the patient's condition or physician/allowed practitioner request (for example, extended hospitalization), the date the agency received the updated/revised referral for home care services would be considered the date of referral. o This does not include calls or documentation from others, such as assisted living facility staff or family, who contact the agency to prepare the agency for possible admission. If the day or month is only one digit, that digit is preceded by a \"0\" (for example, May 4, 2019 = 05/04/2019). Enter all four digits of the year.

Understanding patient transportation needs can help organizations assess barriers to care and facilitate connections with available community resources. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Ask the patient: o \"In the past six months to a year, has lack of transportation kept you from medical appointments or from getting your medications?\" o \"In the past six months to a year, has lack of transportation kept you from non- medical meetings, appointments, work, or from getting things that you need?\" Patient should be offered the option of selecting more than one yes designation, if applicable. If the patient is unable to respond, a proxy response may be used. If neither the patient nor a proxy is able to provide a response to this item, medical record documentation may be used. If the patient declines to respond, do not code based on proxy input or medical record documentation. Complete as close to the time of SOC/ROC as possible and within three days of discharge. Check all that apply Coding Instructions Code A, Yes, if the patient indicates that lack of transportation has kept the patient from medical appointments or from getting medications. Code B, Yes, if the patient indicates that lack of transportation has kept the patient from non- medical meetings, appointments, work, or from getting things that the patient needs. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 41 Code C, No, if the patient indicates that a lack of transportation has not kept the patient from medical appointments, getting medications, non- medical meetings, appointments, work, or getting things that the patient needs. Code X, Patient unable to respond, if the patient is unable to respond. o In the cases where the patient is unable to respond, a response may be determined via proxy input. If a proxy is not able to provide a response, medical record documentation may be used. o If the response(s) is/are determined via proxy input and/or medical record documentation, check all boxes that apply, including Code X - Patient unable to respond. o If the patient is unable to respond and no other resources (proxy or medical record documentation) provided the necessary information, Code X - Patient unable t o respond, only.

Dash is not a valid response for this item. Example 1. The patient has Multiple Sclerosis. During the SOC assessment the patient is confused and unable to understand when asked if they have had a lack of transportation that has kept them from medical appointments, meetings, work, or from getting things needed for daily living. No proxy with related information is available, but the patient's medical record indicates that their sibling uses their car to transport the patient wherever the patient needs to go. Coding: A1250, Transportation would be coded as Code C - No and Code X - Patient unable to respond. Rationale: If neither the patient nor a proxy is able to provide a response, but the medical record documentation can provide the necessary information, code both the information in the medical record, and Code X, Patient unable to respond. M1000: Inpatient Facilities Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 42 Item Intent Identifies whether the patient has been discharged from one or more inpatient facilities within the 14 days immediately preceding the Start of Care/Resumption of Care date. Item Rationale The purpose of this item is to establish the patient's recent health care history before formulating the Plan of Care. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver and review referral information. Home health providers may access Medicare's Common Working File (CWF) (for Medicare patients) to assist in determining the type of inpatient services received and the date of inpatient facility discharge, if the claim for inpatient services has been received by Medicare. Mark all that appl y. For example, patient may have been discharged from both a hospital and a rehabilitation facility within the past 14 days. The \"past 14 days\" is the two-week period immediately preceding the Start/Resumption of Care date. This means that for purposes of counting the 14-day period, the Start of Care date is day 0 and the day immediately prior to the Start of Care date is day 1. For example, if the patient's SOC date is August 20, any inpatient discharges falling on or after August 6 and prior to the HHA admission would be reported. An inpatient facility discharge that occurs on Day 0 should be included. Facility type is determined by the facility's state license. Coding Instructions Code 1, Long- term nursing facility, if the patient was discharged from a Medicare- certified skilled nursing facility but did not receive care under the Medicare Part A benefit in the 14 days prior to home health care. Code 2, Skilled nursing facility, includes (a) a Medicare certified nursing facility where the patient received a skilled level of care under the Medicare Part A benefit, or (b) a transitional care unit (TCU) within a Medicare-certified nursing facility. Code 2, Skilled nursing facility if the answer to all three questions below is \"Yes.\" o Was the patient discharged from a Medicare- certified skilled nursing facility? o While in the skilled nursing facility was the patient receiving skilled care under the Medicare Part A benefit? o Was the patient receiving skilled care under the Medicare Part A benefit during the 14 days prior to the home health care Start of Care date? Code 3, Short -stay acute hospital applies to most hospitalizations. Code 4, Long- term care hospital applies to a hospital that has an average inpatient length of stay of greater than 25 days. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 43 Code 5, Inpatient rehabilitation hospital or unit (IRF) means a freestanding rehab hospital or a rehabilitation bed in a distinct rehabilitation unit of a general acute care hos pital. Code 7, Other , if the patient was discharged from other than the listed inpatient facilities. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips If patient has been discharged from a swing -bed hospital , it is necessary to determine whether the patient was occupying a designated hospital bed (Response 3), a skilled nursing bed under Medicare Part A (Response 2), or a nursing bed at a lower level of care (Response 1). The referring hospital can answer this question regarding the bed st atus. Intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID) are considered \"Other\" (Response 7) for the purpose of this item M1005: Inpatient Discharge Date Item Intent Identifies the date of the most recent discharge fr om an inpatient facility that occurred within the 14 days immediately preceding the Start/Resumption of Care date. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver interview and review referral information. Home health providers may access Medicare's Common Working File (CWF) to assist in determining the type of inpatient services received and the date of inpatient facility discharge, if the claim for inpatient services has been received by Medicare. The \"past 14 days\" is the two-week period immediately preceding the Start/Resumption of Care date. This means that for purposes of counting the 14- day period, the Start of Care date is day 0 and the day immediately prior to the Start of Care date is day 1. For example, if the patient's SOC date is August 20, any inpatient discharges falling on or after August 6 and prior to the HHA admission would be reported. An inpatient facility discharge that occurs on Day 0 should be included. Use the most recent date of discharge from any inpatient facility, even though the patient may have been discharged from more than one facility in the 14 days immediately preceding the Start/Resumption of Care date. If the day or month is only one digit, that digit is preceded by a \"0\" (for example, May 4, 2019 = 05/04/2019). Enter all four digits of the year.

Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 48 A2120 and A2121: Provision of Current Reconciled Medication List to Subsequent Provider at Transfer and Discharge Special Note: The guidance for items A2120 and A2121 is the same, except that one item is used for home health transfers and the other one for discharges. The guidance is combined here, with specific instructions for either transfer or discharge as needed. Item Intent The intent of these items is to identify if the home health agency provided a current reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider. Item Rationale The transfer of a current reconciled medication list at the time of discharge or transfer, can improve care coordination, quality of care, help subsequent providers reconcile medications and may mitigate adverse outcomes related to medications. Communication of medication information at discharge/transfer is critical to ensure safe and effective transitions from one health care setting to another. Time Points Item(s) Completed Transfer (A2120) Discharge from agency (A2121) Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 49 Response Specific Instructions For Home Health at Transfer: Complete A2120 only if: M0100, This Assessment is Currently Being Completed for the Following Reason = 6.

Patient transferred to a non- institutional hospice Coding Instructions Code 0, No , if at transfer or discharge to a subsequent provider, your agency did not provide the patient's current reconciled medication list to the su bsequent provider. Code 1, Yes, if at transfer or discharge to a subsequent provider, your agency did provide the patient's current reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider. A2120 only: Code 2, NA, if at transfer to a subsequent provider, your agency was not made aware of the transfer timely and was, therefore, unable to provide the patient's current reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips At the time of transfer/discharge - This is the period of time as close to the actual time of transfer or discharge as possible. This time may be based on agency, State, or Federal guidelines for data collection at discharge. At Transfer- A subsequent provider is identified when the patient has transferred to any inpatient facility (M0100, RFA 6 or 7) At Discharge - A subsequent provider is identified when the patient has been discharged to home under the care of a home health agency (M2420 response 2) or home hospice (M2420 response 3) While the patient may receive care from other providers after discharge from your agency, such as primary care providers, other outpatient providers, and residential treatment centers, these locations are not considered to be a subsequent provider for the purpose of coding this item. Current Reconciled Medication list -This refers to a list of the patient's current medications at the time of discharge that was reconciled by the agency prior to the patient's discharge. Your agency should be guided by current standards of care and any applicable regulations and guidelines (e.g., Conditions of Participation) in determining what information should be included in a current reconciled medication list. Additional Considerations for Important Medication List Content Defining the completeness of that medication list is left to the discretion of the providers and patient who are coordinating this care. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 50 An example of items that could be on a reconciled medication list can be but are not limited to a list of the current prescribed and over -the-counter medications, nutritional supplements, vitamins, and/or homeopathic and herbal products administered by any route at the time of discharge or transfer. A reconciled medication list could also include important information about: (1) the patient, including their name, date of birth, active diagnoses, known medication and other allergies, and known drug sensitivities and reactions; and (2) each medication, including the name, strength, dose, route of medication administration, frequency or timing, purpose/indication, and/or any special instructions. However, this information serves as guidance and as stated prior, the completeness of the medication list is left to the discretion of the providers and patient. Documentation sources for reconciled medication list information include electronic and/or paper records. Some examples of such records are discharge summary records, a Medication Administration Record, an Intravenous Medication Administration Record, a home medication list, and physician orders. Examples 1. The patient is being transferred from home health to an acute care hospital in the same healthcare system which uses the same electronic health record (EHR), also sometimes referred to as an electronic medical record (EMR) (see definition of EHR/EMR in Appendix A). The patient's current reconciled medication list at the time of transfer from the agency is accessible to the subsequent acute care hospital staff admitting them and this is how the medication list is shared. Coding: A2120 would be coded 1, Yes. Rationale: Having access to the patient's medication list through the same EHR system is one way to transfer a medication list. This code of 1, Yes, is used for this passive means of trans ferring the medication list when the sending and receiving provider can access the same EHR system. 2. A patient is not taking any prescribed or over the counter medications at the time of discharge. Coding: If the lack of any medications for a patient is cle arly documented and communicated to the subsequent provider when the patient is discharged, code 1, Yes, that the medication list was transferred. If this information is not communicated to the subsequent provider, code 0, No. Rationale: Information confirming that the patient is not taking any medications at discharge is given to the subsequent provider and meets the item intent of providing the patient's current reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider. 3. When the nurse visited a patient for their monthly Foley catheter change, the patient informed the nurse that they had been admitted to the hospital last week for a urinary tract infection. Coding: Code A2120, 2, NA - the agency was not made aware of this transfer timely. Rationale: When a home health agency is not made aware of a transfer to an inpatient setting timely, they are unable to provide the current reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider timely. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 51 A2123: Provision of Current Reconciled Medication List to Patient at Discharge Item Intent The intent of this item is to identify if the home health agency provided a current reconciled medication list to the patient, family, and/or caregiver at discharge. Item Rationale Communication of medication information to the patient at discharge is critical to ensuring safe and effective discharges. The item, collected at the time of discharge, can improve care coordination, quality of care, aids in medication reconciliation, and may mitigate adverse outcomes related to medications. It is recommended that a reconciled medication list that is provided to the patient, family, or caregiver use consumer-friendly terminology and plain language to ensure that the information provided to patients and caregivers is clear and understandable.

Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 52 Coding Tips At the time of dis charge - This is the period of time as close to the actual time of discharge as possible. This time may be based on facility/agency, State, or Federal guidelines for data collection at discharge. Patient/family/caregiver - The recipient of the current reconciled medication list can be the patient and/or a family member and/or other caregiver in order to code 1, Yes, a current reconciled medication list was provided. It is not necessary to provide the current reconciled medication list to all of these recipients in order to code 1, Yes. Examples 1. A patient will not be taking any prescribed or over the counter medic ations at the time of discharge. Coding: If it is clearly documented that the patient is taking no medications and this is then clearly communicated to the patient, family, and/or caregiver when the patient is discharged, A2123 would be coded 1, Yes, that the medication list was provided. If this informat ion is not communicated to the patient, family and/or caregiver, code 0, No. Rationale: Information confirming that the patient is not taking any medications at discharge is provided to the patient, family, and/or caregiver and meets the item intent of providing the patient's current reconciled medication list to patient, family, and/or caregiver.

This would include situations where both the discharging and receiving provider have direct access to a common EHR system. This could also include providing the patient w ith direct access to their EHR medication information through a patient portal. Checking this route does not require confirmation that the patient has accessed the medication list from the portal or the subsequent provider has accessed the common EHR system for the medication list. Code A2122B /A2124B , Health Information Exchange, if your agency participates in a Health Information Exchange (HIE) and used the HIE to electronically exchange the current reconciled medication list with the subsequent provider, patient, family, and/or caregiver. Code A2122C/ A2124C, Verbal, if the current reconciled medication list information was verbally communicated (e.g., in-person, telephone, video conferencing) to the subsequent provider, patient, family, and/or caregiver. Code A2122D /A2124D , Paper -Based, if the current reconciled medication list was transmitted to the subsequent provider, patient, family, and/or caregiver using a paper-based method such as a printout, fax or efax. Code A2122E/ A2124E, Other Methods, if the current reconciled medication list was transmitted to the subsequent provider, patient, family, and/or caregiver using another method, not listed above (e.g., texting, email, CDs). Dash is not a valid response for this item. Examples 1. A patient receives a paper copy of their medication list, receives education about their medications by the home health nurse at discharge, and is notified that the home health patient portal is another means that the patient can obtain their discharge medication list. Coding: Code Electronic Health Record (A), Verbal (C), and Paper- based (D) for A2124. Chapter 3 Section A : Administrative Information OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 55 Rationale: The copy of the medication list is paper -based (D). The information about the patient's medication list was also communicated verbally by the nurse at the time of discharge (C). The patient portal uses the agency's EHR to provide access to the medication list (A). It is not necessary to confirm that the patient is a registered user of and accessed the patient portal in order to code EHR (A) as a route. 2. A PAC provider participates in a regional HIE as does a local acute care hospital. When patients are transferred to this acute care hospital , the PAC provider's medication list is included in the medications section of a transfer summary document from their EHR which is electronically exchanged through the HIE. The acute care hospital is then able to obtain and integrate the medication informa tion into their EHR. Coding: Code Electronic Health Record (A) and Health Information Exchange (B) for A2122. Rationale: The medication information is exchanged by the regional HIE through health IT standards. Sending the medication information in transfer summary allows the acute care hospital to integrate the medication information into their EHR. Code as EHR (A) since it was used to generate and exchange the information, and as HIE (B) since it is the means through which information exchange is possible with external providers. 3. A home health agency has developed an interface that allows documents from their EHR to be electronically faxed to the subsequent provider. Coding: Code Check Paper- Based (D) for A2122. Rationale: Faxing information is considered paper-based as faxed documents are comparable to hard copy documents, and not computable. 4. A home health agency created a process to automatically send a patient summary document containing medications and other information using Direct Messaging (Direct Exchange) to the receiving acute care hospital's EHR when a patient is transferred to this hospital. The EHR vendors are members of a health information service provider, or HISP, and are in compliance with DirectTrust requirements 4.The hospital clinicians can readily access the l atest medication and other medical information which is 'pushed' or sent to their EHR. Coding: Code Electronic Health Record (A) and Health Information Exchange (B) for A2122. Rationale: Direct Messaging is interoperable exchange through a HIE such as a HISP and EHR (A) was used to generate and initiate the exchange of the information. 4 DirectTrust | HIMSS Chapter 3 Section B: Hearing, Speech, And Vision OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 56 SECTION B: HEARING, SPEECH, AND VISION Introduction The items in this section assesses the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions. B0200. Hearing Item Intent Identifies the patient's ability to hear (with assistive devices, if they are used). Item Rationale Problems with hearing can contribute to sensory deprivation, social isolation, and mood and behavior disorders. Unaddressed communication problems related to hearing impairment can be mistaken for confusion or cognitive impairment. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Response- Specific Instructions Ensure that the patient is using their normal hearing appliance, if they have one. Hearing devices may not be as conventional as a hearing aid. Some patients by choice may use hearing amplifiers or a microphone and headphones as an alternative to hearing aids. Ensure the hearing appliance is operational. Interview the patient and ask about hearing function in different situations (e.g., hearing staff or family members, talking to visitors, using telephone, watching TV, participation in group discussion). Observe the patient during your verbal interactions and when interacting with others. Review the clinical record or other available documentation. Consult the patient's family/caregiver, and/or speech or hearing specialists. Coding Instructions Complete as close to the time of SOC as possible. Code 0, Adequate, No difficulty hearing in normal conversation, social interaction, or listening to TV. The patient hears all normal conversational speech and telephone or group conversations. Code 1, Minim al difficulty, Difficulty in some environments (e.g., when a person speaks softly or the setting is noisy). The patient hears speech at conversational levels but has difficulty hearing when not in Chapter 3 Section B: Hearing, Speech, And Vision OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 57 quiet listening conditions or when not in one-on- one situations. The patient's hearing is adequate after environmental adjustments are made, such as reducing background noise by moving to a quiet room or by lowering the volume on television or radio. Code 2, Moderate difficulty , Speaker has to increase volume and speak distinctly. Although hearing- deficient, the patient compensates when the speaker adjusts tonal quality and speaks distinctly; or the patient can hear only when the speaker's face is clearly visible. Code 3, Highly impaired, A bsence of useful hearing. The patient hears only some sounds and frequently fails to respond even when the speaker adjusts tonal quality, speaks distinctly, or is positioned face-to-face. There is no comprehension of conversational speech, even when the speake r makes maximum adjustments. Dash is a valid response when coding this item. o A dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips Patients who are unable to respond to a standard hearing assessment due to cognitive impairment will require alternate assessment methods. The patient can be observed in their normal environment. Do they respond (e.g., turn their head) when a noise is made at a normal level? Does the patient seem to respond only to specific noise in a quiet environment? Assess whether the patient responds only to loud noise or do they not respond at all. Examples 1. When asked about whether they can hear normal conversation without difficulty, patient responds, \"When I'm at home, I usually keep the TV on a low volume and hear it just fine. When I have visitors, I can hear people from across the room.\" Coding: B0200, Hearing, would be coded as 0, Adequate Rationale: Patient hears normal conversational speech. 2. \"Sitting at the dinner table, I can hear people who are sitting closer to me (e.g., within 5 feet) but not from farther across the table (e.g., 8 feet) speaking at a normal volume.\" Coding: B0200, Hearing, would be coded as 1, Minimal difficulty Rationale: Patient has difficulty in some situations (when someone is sitting farther away) but can hear clearly when someone is sitting close. 3. \"I have trouble following normal conversations, especially when a lot of different people are talking at the same time. I can usually make out what someone is saying if they talk a little louder and make sure they speak clearly and I can see their face when they are talking to me.\" Coding: B0200, Hearing, would be coded as 2, Moderate difficulty Rationale: Patient has difficulty hearing people in conversation, but comprehension is improved when the speaker makes adjustments like speaking at high volume, speaking clearly, and sitting close by so that the speaker's face is visible. Chapter 3 Section B: Hearing, Speech, And Vision OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 58 4. \"I cannot hear one person speaking, even at a high volume, if others are speaking at the same time. I tend to listen to the TV at a high volume even if I am alone and I still struggle to hear what is being said. People complain that they need to scream at me for me to hear anything.\" Coding: B0200, Hearing, would be coded as 3, Highly impaired Rationale: Patient cannot hear people in conversation even if the speaker is making maximum adjustments of speaking at high volume and sitting close. B1000: Vision Item Intent Identifies the patient's ability to see objects nearby in their environment, in adequate light, and with glasses or other visual appliances. Item Rationale A person's reading vision often diminishes over time. If uncorrected, vision impairment can limit the enjoyment of everyday activities such as reading newspapers, books, or correspondence, and maintaining and enjoying hobbies and other activities. It also limits the ability to manage personal business, such as reading and signing consent forms. Moderate, high, or severe impairment can contribute to sensory deprivation, social isolation, and depressed mood. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Response- Specific Instructions Ask the patient, family, caregivers and/or staff if possible about the patient's usual vision patterns (e.g., is the patient able to see newsprint, menus, greeting cards?). Ensure that the patient's customary visual appliance for close vision is in place (e.g., eyeglasses, magnifying glass). Chapter 3 Section B: Hearing, Speech, And Vision OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 59 Ensure adequate lighting. Ask the patient to look at regular-size print in a book or newspaper. Then ask the patient to read aloud, starting with larger headlines and ending with the finest, smallest print. If the patient is unable to read a news paper, provide material with larger print, such as a flyer or large textbook. When the patient is unable to read out loud (e.g., due to aphasia, illiteracy), you should test this by another means such as, but not limited to: o Substituting numbers or pictures for words that are displayed in the appropriate print size (regular-size print in a book or newspaper) Coding Instructions Complete as close to the time of SOC as possible. Code 0, Adequate , if the patient sees fine detail, including regular print in newspapers/books. Code 1, Impaired, if the patient sees large print, but not regular print in newspapers/books. Code 2, Moderately impaired, if the patient has limited vision and is not able to see newspaper headlines but can identify objects nearby in the ir environment. Code 3, Highly impaired, if the patient's ability to identify objects nearby in their environment is in question, but the patient's eye movements appear to be following objects (especially people walking by). Code 4, Severely impaired, if the patient has no vision, sees only light, colors or shapes, or does not appear to follow objects with eyes. Dash is a valid response when coding this item. o A dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips Some patients have never learned to read or are unable to read English. In such cases, ask the patient to read numbers, such as dates or page numbers, or to name items in small pictures. Be sure to display this information in two sizes (equivalent to regular and large print). If the patient is unable to communicate or follow your directions for testing vision, observe the patient's eye movements to see if their eyes seem to follow movement and objects. Though these are gross measurements of visual acuity, they may assist you in assessing whether or not the patient has any visual ability. For patients who appear to do this, code 3, highly impaired. Examples 1. When asked about whether they can see fine detail, including regular print in newspaper/books, pat ient responds, \"When I wear my glasses, I can read the paper fine. If I forget to wear glasses, it is harder to see unless I hold the paper a little closer.\" Coding: B1000, Vision, would be coded as 0, Adequate Rationale: The patient can read regular print when wearing glasses. 2. The assessor asks the patient to read aloud from a newspaper, starting with larger headlines and then the smaller print. The patient is able to read the headlines but not the regular newspaper pr int. Coding: B1000, Vision, would be coded as 1, Impaired Rationale: The patient sees large print, but not regular print in newspapers/books. Chapter 3 Section B: Hearing, Speech, And Vision OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 60 3. \"I cannot read the newspaper headlines, even with glasses.\" When the assessor presents the patient with newspap er text, while wearing glasses, the patient is not able to correctly read the headlines. The patient can identify objects in their environment. Coding: B1000, Vision, would be coded as 2, Moderately impaired Rationale: Patient cannot read newspaper headlines. 4. \"I can't see much of anything at this point. I can see blurry shapes and I can tell what things are, but I can't read books anymore - even the ones with giant print. I do okay recognizing my caregivers by their voices, but I couldn't tell you what they look like. Everyone's just a blob of color, even with my glasses on.\" The patient's eyes appear to follow the assessor when they move about the room. When the assessor presents the patient with newspaper text, while wearing glasses, the patient is able to appropriately reach for and successfully hold the paper , but is not able to correctly read the headlines. Coding: B1000, Vision, would be coded as 3, Highly impaired Rationale: Patient is able to follow objects and track movement in the environment (e.g., people moving throughout the room), but is unable to see people or objects in detail. B1300: Health Literacy Item Intent The intent of this item is to identify the patient's self -reported h ealth literacy. Item Rationale Similar to language barriers, low health literacy interferes with communication between provider and patient. Health literacy can also affect the ability for patients to understand and follow treatment plans, including medication management . Chapter 3 Section B: Hearing, Speech, And Vision OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 61 Poor health literacy is linked to lower levels of knowledge of health, worse outcomes, and the receipt of fewer preventive services, higher medical costs and rates of emergency department use Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions This item is intended to be a patient self -report item. No other source should be used to identify the response. Ask the patient, \"How often do you need to have someone help you when you read instructions, pamphlets, or other written material from your doctor or pharmacy?\" Coding Instructions Complete as close to the time of SOC/ROC as possible and within three days of discharge. Code 0, Never, if the patient indicates n ever needing help reading instructions, pamphlets, or other written materials from doctors or pharmacies. Code 1, Rarely, if the patient indicates rarely needing help reading instructions, pamphlets, or other written materials from doctors or pharmacies. Code 2, Sometimes, if the patient indicates sometimes needing help reading instructions, pamphlets, or other written mater ials from doctors or pharmacies. Code 3, Often, if the patient indicates often needing help reading instructions, pamphlets, or other written materials from doctors or pharmacies. Code 4, Always, if the patient indicates always needing help reading instructions, pamphlets, or other written materials from doctors or pharmacies. Code 7, Patient declines to respond, if the patient declines to respond. Code 8, Patient unable to respond, if the patient is unable to respond. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Example 1. When asked how often they need help when reading the instructions provided by their doctor, the patient reports that they never need help. The patient's son is present and shares that a family member must always accompany the patient to doctors' visits and that the patient often needs someone to explain the written materials to them multiple times before they understand, providing examples of needing to frequently explain to the patient why they are on a special diet and why and how to take some of their medications. Coding: B1300, Health Literacy is coded as Code 0, Never. Rationale: The patient indicated they never need help reading instructions from their doctor or pharmacist. B1300, health literacy is intended to be a patient self-report item and no other sources, including proxy/caregivers, should be used to identify the response to this item.Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 62 SECTION C: COGNITIVE PATTERNS Intro duction This section contains guidance for nine items that assess cognitive function including the Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) and Signs and Symptoms of Delirium from CAM\u00a9. There is general guidance for C0200 - C0500, including basic BIMS interview instruction and cue cards for administering the BIMS in written format, as well as specific guidance on the individual items. C0100. Should Brief Interview for Mental Status be Conducted? Item Intent The intent of this item is to identify if the Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS), a structured cognitive interview, should occur. Item Rationale Most patients are able to attempt the Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS). The BIMS is a structure d cognitive interview. A structured cognitive test is more accurate and reliable than observation alone for observing cognitive performance. o Without an attempted structured cognitive interview, a patient might be mislabeled based on their appearance or ass umed diagnosis. o Structured interviews will efficiently provide insight into the patient's current condition that will enhance good care. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interact with the patient using their preferred language. Be sure the patient can hear you and/or has access to their preferred method for communication. If the patient appears unable to communicate, offer alternatives such as writing, pointing, sign language, or cue cards. Determine if the patient is rarely/never understood verbally, in writing, or using another method. If rarely/never understood: skip items C0200-C0500. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 63 Coding Instructions If SOC/ROC assessment, complete as close to the time of SOC/ROC as possible. If discharge assessment, complete as close to the time of discharge as possible. Code 0, No, if the interview should not be conducted because the patient is rarely/never understood; cannot respond verbally, in writing, or using another method; or an interpreter is needed but not available. Skip items C0200-C0500. Code 1, Yes, if the interview should be conducted because the patient is at least sometimes understood verbally, in writing, or using another method, and if an interpreter is needed, one is available. Proceed to C0200, Repetition of Three Words. Dash is a valid response for this item. o A dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips Attempt to conduct the interview with ALL patients. C0200-C0500: Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 64 Item Intent The intent of this item is to determine the patient's attention, orientation and ability to register and recall information. Item Rationale Direct or performance -based testing of cognitive function decreases the chance of incorrect labeling of cognitive ability and improves detection of delirium. Cognitively intact patients may appear to be cognitively impaired be cause of a language barrier, hearing impairment, or lack of social interaction. Some patients may appear to be more cognitively intact than they actually are. If cognitive impairment is incorrectly diagnosed or missed, appropriate communication, worthwhile activities and therapies may not be offered. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from Agency Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 65 Basic Interview Instructions for BIMS (C0200 -C0500) Interview any patient not screened out by item C0100, Should Brief Interview for Mental Status Be Conducted? Conduct the interview in a private setting, if possible. Be sure the patient can hear you. o Patients with a hearing impairment should be tested using their usual communication devices/techniques, as applicable. o Try an external assistive device (headphones or hearing amplifier) if you have any doubt about hearing ability. o Minimize background noise. Sit so that the patient can see your face. Mini mize glare by directing light sources away from the patient's face. Give an introduction before starting the interview. Suggested language: \"I would like to ask you some questions. We ask everyone these same questions. This will help us provide you with be tter care. Some of the questions may seem very easy, while others may be more difficult.\" If the patient expresses concern that you are testing their memory, they may be more comfortable if you reply: \"We ask these questions of everyone so we can make sure that our care will meet your needs.\" Directly ask the patient each item in C0200 through C0400 at one sitting and in the order provided. If the patient chooses not to answer a particular item, accept their refusal and move on to the next questions. For C0200 through C0400, code refusals as incorrect/no answer or could not recall. Instructions for BIMS When Administered in Writing Interview any patient not screened out by Should Brief Interview for Mental Status Be Conducted? item (C0100) . Conduct the interview in a private setting, if possible. o Patients with visual impairment should be tested using their usual visual aids. o Minimize glare by directing light sources away from the patient's face and from written materials. Provide a written introduction before starting the interview. Suggested language: \"I would like to ask you some questions, which I will show you in a moment. We ask everyone these same questions. This will help us provide you with better care. Some of the questions may seem very easy, while others may be more difficult. We ask these questions of everyone so we can make sure that our care will meet your needs .\" Directly provide the written questions for each item in C0200 through C0400 at one sitting and in the order provided. o For each BIMS question, show the patient a sheet of paper or card with the instruction for that question from the form clearly writte n in a large enough font to be easily seen. o The patient may respond to any of the BIMS questions in writing. o Show separate sheets or cards for each question or statement. o For C0200 items, instructions should be written as: I have written 3 words for you to remember. Please read them. Then I will remove the card and ask you repeat or write down the words as you remember them. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 66 Category cues should be provided to the patient in writing after the patient's first attempt to answer. Written category cues sho uld state: \"sock, something to wear; blue, a color; bed, a piece of furniture.\" o For C0300 items, instructions should be written as: C0300A: \"Please tell me what year it is right now.\" C0300B: \"What month are we in right now?\" C0300C: \"What day of the w eek is today?\" o For C0400 items, instructions should be written as: Let's go back to an earlier question. What were those three words that I asked you to repeat?\" If the patient is unable to remember a word, provide Category cues again, but without using the actual word. Therefore, Category cues for: 1. C0400A should be written as \"something to wear,\" 2. C0400B should be written as \"a color,\" and 3. C0400C should be writt en as \"a piece of furniture.\" If the patient chooses not to answer a particular item, accept their refusal and move on to the next question. For C0200 through C0400C, code refusals as incorrect/no answer or could not recall. Rules for stopping the interview are the same as for administering the BIMS verbally, see Coding Tips. The agency may develop their own signs for this process. If the agency develops their own, they must use the exact language as that used in the item set. Coding Instructions See coding instructions for individual items. If SOC/ROC assessment, collect as close to the time of SOC/ROC as possible. If discharge assessment, complete as close to the time of discharge as possible . Dash is a valid response for this item. o A dash indicates \"no information\". CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips Nonsensical responses, incorrect answers, and questions the patient chooses not to answer should be coded as zero. o The assessing clinician should track the reason for coding answers as zero because this information will be used later for the coding of the summary score in C0500. Rules for stopping the BIMS interview before it is complete: o Stop the interview after completing (C0300C) \"Day of the Week\" if: All responses have been nonsensical (i.e., any response that is unrelated, incomprehensible, or incoherent; not informative with respect to the item being rated), OR there has been no verbal or written response to any of the questions up to this point, OR there has been no verbal or written response to some questions up to this point and for all others, the patient has given a nonsensical response. o If the interview is stopped, do the following: Code \"- \" (dash) in C0400A, C0400B, and C0400C. Code 99 in the summary score in C0500. If all responses to C0200, C0300A, C0300B, and C0300C are 0 because answers are incorrect, continue interview. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 67 Examples of Incorrect Answers, Refusals, and Nonsensical Responses Code 0 is used to represent three types of responses: incorrect answers (unless the item itself provides an alternate response code), nonsensical responses, and questions the patient chooses not to answer (or \"refusals\"). Since zeros resulting from these three situations are treated differently when coding the summary score in C0500, the assessing clinician may find it valuable to track the reason for the zero response to aid in accurately calculating the summary score. 1. Assessing clinician asks patie nt to state the year. The patient replies that it is 1935. This answer is incorrect but related to the question. Coding: This answer is coded 0, incorrect but would NOT be considered a nonsensical response. Rationale: The answer is wrong, but it is logical and relates to the question. 2. Assessing clinician asks patient to state the year. The patient says, \"Oh what difference does the year make when you're as old as I am?\" The clinician asks the patient to try to name the year, and the patient shrugs. Coding: This answer is coded 0, incorrect but would NOT be considered a nonsensical response. Rationale: The answer is wrong because refusal is considered a wrong answer, but the patient's comment is logical and clearly relates to the question. 3. Assessi ng clinician asks the patient to name the day of the week. Patient answers, \"blue, that's my favorite color.\" The clinician asks the patient the question again to confirm the patient is not hearing the question incorrectly, and the patient answers with the same response. Coding: The answer is coded 0, incorrect; the response is illogical and nonsensical. Rationale: The answer is wrong, and the patient's comment clearly does not relate to the question; it is nonsensical.

Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Basic BIMS interview instructions are shown on pages 65, 66, and 67. In addition, for C0200: Repetition of Three Words: Say to the patient: \"I am going to say three words for you to remember. Please repeat the words after I have said all three. The words are: sock, blue, and bed.\" Assessing clinicians need to use the words and related category cues as indicated. If the interview is being conducted with an interpreter present, the interpreter should use the equivalent words and similar, relevant prompts for category cues. Immediately after presenting the three words, say to the patient: \"Now please tell me the three words.\" After the patient's first attempt to repeat the items: o If the patient correctly stated all three words, say, \"That's right, the words are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture\" [category cues]. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 75 o Catego ry cues serve as a hint that helps prompt patients' recall ability. Putting words in context stimulates learning and fosters memory of the words that patients will be asked to recall in item C0400, even among patients able to repeat the words immediately. o If the patient recalled two or fewer words, code C0200, Repetition of T hree words according to the patient's recall on this first attempt. Next say to the patient: \"Let me say the three words again. They are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture. Now tell me the three words.\" If the patient still does not recall all three words correctly, you may repeat the words and category cues one more time. Do not code the number of repeated words on the second or third attempt. o If the patient does not repeat all three words after three attempts, re -assess ability to hear. If the patient can hear, move on to the next question. If they are unable to hear, attempt to maximize hearing (alter environment, use hearing amplifier) before proceeding. Coding Instructions Record the maximum number of words that the patient correctly repeated on the first attempt. This will be any number between 0 and 3. Code 0, none , if the patient did not repeat any of the 3 words on the first attempt. Code 1, one , if the patient repeated only 1 of the 3 words on the first attempt. Code 2, two, if the patient repeated only 2 of the 3 words on the first attempt. Code 3, three , if the patient repeated all 3 words on the first attempt. Dash is a valid response for this item. o A dash indicates \"no information\". CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips The words may be recalled in any order and in any context. For example, if the words are repeated back in a sentence, they would be counted as repeating the words. Do not score the number of repeated words on the second or third attempt. These attempts he lp with learning the item, but only the number correct on the first attempt go into the total score. Do not record the number of attempts that the patient needed to complete. Examples 1. The assessing clinician says, \"The words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\" The patient replies, \"Bed, sock, and blue.\" The clinician repeats the three words with category cues, by saying, \"That's right, the words are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture.\" Coding: C0200 Repetition of Three Words would be coded 3, three words correct. Rationale: The patient repeated all three items on the first attempt. The order of repetition does not affect the score. Per the Response Specific Instructions, the assessing clinician repeats the words with the category cues after the patient correctly states all three words. 2. The asses sing clinician says, \"The words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\" The patient replies, \"Sock, bed, black.\" The clinician repeats the three words plus the category cues, saying, \"Let me say the three words again. They are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture. Now tell me the three words.\" The patient says, \"Oh yes, that's right, sock, blue, bed.\" Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 76 Coding: C0200 Repetition of Three Words would be coded 2, two of three words correct. Rationale: The patient repeated two of the three items on the first attempt. Patients are scored based on the first attempt. 3. The assessing clinician says, \"The words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\" The patient says, \"Blue socks belong in the dresser.\" The clinician codes according to the patient's response. Then the clinician repeats the three words plus the category cues, saying, \"Let me say the three words again. They are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture. Now tell me the three words.\" The patient says, \"Oh yes, that's right, sock, blue, bed.\" Coding: C0200 Repetition of Three Words would be coded 2, two of the three words correct. Rationale: The patient repeated two of the three items \u2014blue and sock on the first attempt. The patient put the words into a sentence, resulting in the patient repeating two of the three words. 4. The assessing clinician says, \"The words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\" The patient replies , \"What were those three words?\" The patient's response is coded and then the clinician repeats the three words plus the category cues. Coding: C0200 Repetition of Three Words would be coded 0, none of the words correct. Rationale: The patient did not repeat any of the three words on the first attempt. C0300: Temporal Orientation: Year, Month, Day Item Rationale A lack of temporal orientation may lead to decreased communication or participation in activities. Not being oriented may be frustrating or frightening. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 77 Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Basic interview instructions for BIMS (C0200-0500) are shown on pages 63, 64, and 65. In addition, for C0300 (A, B, and C): Temporal Orientation: Ask the patient each of the 3 questions in Item C0300 separately. Allow the patient up to 30 seconds for each answer and do not provide clues. If the patient specifically asks for clues (e.g., \"Is this the day my daughter always visits?\") respond by saying, \"I need to know if you can answer this question without any help from me.\" Coding Instructions for C0300A, Able to Report Correct Year Code 0, missed by >5 years or no answer, if the patient's answer is incorrect and is greater than 5 years from the current year or the patient chooses not to answer the item. Code 1, missed by 2- 5 years, if the patient's answer is incorrect and is within 2 to 5 years from the current year. Code 2, missed by 1 year, if the patient's answer is incorrect and is within one year from the current year. Code 3, correct, if the patient states the correct year. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Examples 1. The date of interview is May 5, 2020. The patient, responding to the statement, \"Please tell me what year it is right now,\" states that it is 2020. Coding: C0300A would be coded 3, correct. Rationale: 2020 is the current year at the time of this assessment. 2. The date of interview is June 16, 2020. The patient, responding to the statement, \"Please tell me what year it is right now,\" states that it is 2017. Coding: C0300A would be coded 1, missed by 2-5 years. Rationale: 2017 is within 2 to 5 years of 2020. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 78 3. The date of interview is January 10, 2020. The patient, responding to the statement, \"Please tell me what year it is right now,\" states that it is 1920. Coding: C0300A would be coded 0, missed by more than 5 years. Rationale: Even though the '20 part of the year would be correct, 1920 is more than 5 years from 2020. 4. The date of interview is April 1, 2020. The patient, responding to the statement, \"Please tell me what year it is right now,\" states that it is \"'20.\" The assessing clinician asks, \"Can you tell me the full year?\" The patient still responds \"'20,\" and the assessing clinician asks again, \"Can you tell me the full year, for example, nineteen -eighty-two.\" The patient states, \"2020.\" Coding: C0300A would be coded 3, correct. Rationale : Even though '20 is partially correct, the only correct answer is the exact year. The patient must state \"2020,\" not \"20\" or \"1820\" or \"1920.\" Coding Instructions for C0300B, Able to Report Correct Month Count the current day as day 1 when determining whether the response was accurate within 5 days or missed by 6 days to 1 month. Code 0, missed by >1 month or no answer, if the patient's answer is incorrect by more than 1 month or if the patient chooses not to answer the item. Code 1, missed by 6 days to 1 month, if the patient's answer is accurate within 6 days to 1 month. Code 2, accurate within 5 days, if the patient's answer is accurate within 5 days, count current date as day 1. Dash is a valid res ponse for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Examples 1. The date of interview is June 25, 2020. The patient, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is June. Coding: C0300B would be coded 2, accurate within 5 days. Rationale: The patient correctly stated the month. 2. The date of interview is June 28, 2020. The patient, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is July. Coding: C0300B would be coded 2, accurate within 5 days. Rationale: The patient correctly stated the month within 5 days, even though the correct month is June. June 28th (day 1) + 4 more days is July 2nd, so July is within 5 days of the interview. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 79 3. The date of interview is June 25, 2020. The patient, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is July. Coding: C0300B would be coded 1, missed by 6 days to 1 month. Rationale: The patient missed the correct month by six days. June 25th (day 1) + 5 more days = June 30th. Therefore, the patient's answer is incorrect within 6 days to 1 month. 4. The date of interview is June 30, 2020. The patient, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is August. Coding: C0300B would be coded 0, missed by more than 1 month. Rationale: The patient missed the month by more than 1 month. 5. The date of interview is June 2, 2020. The patient, responding to the question, \"What month are we in right now?\" states that it is May. Coding: C0300B would be coded 2, accurate within 5 days. Rationale: June 2 minus 5 days = May 29th. The patient correctly stated the month within 5 days even though the current month is June. Coding Instructions for C0300C, Able to Report Correct Day of the Week Code 0, incorrect, or no answer, if the answer is incorrect or the patient chooses not to answer the item. Code 1, correct, if the answer is correct. Dash is a valid response for this item. o CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Examples 1. The day of interview is Monday, June 27, 2020. The assessing clinician asks: \"What day of the week is it today?\" The patient responds, \"It's Monday.\" Coding: C0300C would be coded 1, correct. Rationale: The patient correctly stated the day of the week. 2. The day of interview is Monday, June 27, 2020. The patient, responding to the question, \"What day of the week is it today?\" states, \"Tuesday.\" Coding: C0300C would be coded 0, incorrect. Rationale: The patient incorrectly stated the day of the week. 3. The day of interview is Monday, June 27, 2020. The patient, responding to the question, \"What day of the week is it today?\" states, \"Today is a good day.\" Coding: C0300C would be coded 0, incorrect. Rationale: The patient did not answer the question cor rectly. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 80 C0400: Recall Item Rationale Many persons with cognitive impairment can be helped to recall if provided cues. Providing memory cues can help maximize patient cognitive function and decrease frustration for those patients who respond. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Basic interview instructions for BIMS (C0200-C0500) are shown on pages 63, 64, and 65. In addition, for C0400 (A, B, and C): Recall: Ask the patient the following: \"Let's go back to an earlier question. What were those three words that I asked you to rep eat?\" Allow up to 5 seconds for spontaneous recall of each word. For any word that is not correctly recalled after 5 seconds, provide the category cue used in C0200 (refer to page 76 for the definition of category cue). Category cues should be used only after the patient is unable to recall one or more of the three words. Allow up to 5 seconds after category cueing for each missed word to be recalled. Coding Instructions For each of the three words the patient is asked to remember: Code 0, no\u2014could not recall, if the patient cannot recall the word even after being given the category cue or if the patient responds with a nonsensical answer or chooses not to answer the item. Code 1, yes, after cueing, if the patient requires the category cue to remember the word. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 81 Code 2, yes, no cue required, if the patient correctly remembers the word spontaneously without cueing. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips If on the first try (without cueing), the patient names multiple items in a category, one of which is correct, they should be coded as correct for that item. If, however, the assessing clinician gives the patient the cue and the patient then names multipl e items in that category, the item is coded as could not recall, even if the correct item was in the list. Examples 1. The patient is asked to recall the three words that were initially presented. The patient chooses not to answer the question and states, \"I'm tired, and I don't want to do this anymore.\" Coding: C0400A-C0400C would be coded 0, no\u2014could not recall , could not recall for each of the three words. Rationale: Choosing not to answer a question often indicates an inability to answer the question, so refusals are coded 0, no\u2014could not recall . This is the most accurate way to score cognitive function, even though, on occasion, patients might choose not to answer for other reasons. 2. The patient is asked to recall the three words. The patient replies, \"Socks, shoes, and bed.\" The examiner then cues, \"One word was a color.\" The patient says, \"Oh, the shoes were blue.\" Coding: C0400A, sock, would be coded 2, yes, no cue required. Rationale: The patient's initial response to the question included \"sock.\" They are given credit for this response, even though the patient also listed another item in that category (shoes), because they were answering the initial question, without cueing. Coding: C0400B, blue, would be coded 1, yes, after cueing. Rationale: The patient did not recall spontaneously but did recall after the category cue was given. Responses that include the word in a sentence are acceptable. Coding: C0400C, bed, would be coded 2, yes, no cue required. Rationale: The patient independently recalled the item on the first attempt. 3. The patient is asked to recall the three words. The patient answers, \"I don't remember.\" The assessor then says, \"One word was something to wear.\" The patient says, \"Clothes.\" The assessor then says, \"OK, one word was a color.\" The patient says, \"Blue.\" The assessor then says, \"OK, the last word was a piece of furniture.\" The patient says, \"Couch.\" Coding: C0400A, sock, would be coded 0, no\u2014could not recall. Rationale: The patient did not recall the item, even with a cue. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 82 Coding: C0400B, blue, would be coded 1, yes, after cueing. Rationale: The patient did recall after being given the cue. Coding: C0400C, bed, would be coded 0, no\u2014could not recall. Rationale: The patient did not recall the item, even with a cue. C0500: BIMS Summary Score Item Rationale The total score: Decreases the chance of incorrect labeling of cognitive ability and improves detection of delirium. Provides staff with a more reliable estimate of patient function and allows staff interactions with patients that are based on more accurate impressions about patient ability . The BIMS total score is highly correlated with Mini- Mental State Exam (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) scores. Scores from a carefully conducted BIMS assessment where patients can hear all questions and the patient is not delirious suggest the following distributions: 13-15: cognitively intact 8-12: moderately impaired 0-7: severe impairment Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions After completing C0200-C0400: o Add up the values for all questions from C0200 through C0400. Coding Instructions Enter the total score as a two -digit number. The total possible BIMS score ranges from 00 to 15. o If the patient chooses not to answer a specific question(s), that question is coded as incorrect and the item(s) counts in the total score. If, however, the patient chooses not to answer four or more items, then the interview is coded as incomplete. o To be considered a completed interview, the patient had to attempt and provide relevant answers to at least four of the questions included in C0200-C0400C. To be relevant, a response only has to be Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 83 related to the question (logical); it does not have to be correct. See general coding tips that follow for patients who choose not to participate at all. o If all BIMS items (C0200 -C0400) are coded with a \" -\" (dash), code C0500 Summary Score with a \"- \" (dash). o Code 99, unable to complete interview, if (a) the patient chooses not to participate in the BIMS, (b) if four or more items were coded 0 because the patient chose not to answer or gave a nonsensical respo nse, or (c) if any but not all of the BIMS items is coded with a \"-\" (dash) . Note: a zero score does not mean the BIMS was incomplete. To be incomplete, a patient had to choose not to answer or give completely unrelated, nonsensical responses to four or more items. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips Occasionally, a patient can communicate but chooses not to participate in the BIMS and therefore does not attempt any of the items in the section. This would be considered an incomplete interview; enter code 99 for C0500, BIMS Summary Score. Examples 1. The patient's scores on items C0200-C0400 were as follows: C0200 (repetition) 3 C0300A (year) C0400A \"sock\") 0 Coding: C0500- BIMS summary score would be coded 12 (Sum of C0200-C0400C). 2. The patient's scores on items C0200-C0400C were as follows: C0200 (repetition) 2 C0300A (year) C0400A \"sock\") 0 Coding: C0500- BIMS summary score would be coded as 07 (Sum of C0200-C0400C). 3. STOP the interview if each of items C0200-C0300C are coded as 0, because a patient chose not to participate in the BIMS and/or has provided nonsensical answers and/or does not provide verbal or written responses, then stop the interview after C0300C. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 84 Example: The patient's score on items C0200-C0400C were as follows: (repetition) 0 C0300A (year) 0 C0300B (month) 0 C0300C (day) 0 (Interview is stopped after C0400A and dashes entered for C0400A-C. C0500 - BIMS Summary Score, enter code 99, unable to complete interview. Note: a zero score does not mean the BIMS was incomplete. To be incomplete, a patient had to choose not to answer or give completely unrelated, nonsensical responses to four or more items. If one or more of the zeros in C0200 - C0300 are due to incorrect answers, the interview should continue. C1310: Signs and Symptoms of Delirium Item Intent The intent of this item is to identify any signs or symptoms of acute mental status changes as compared to the patient's baseline status. Item Rationale Delirium is associated with: increased mortality, functional decline, development or worsening of incontinence, Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 85 behavior problems, withdrawal from activities, rehospitalizations and increased length of home health stay. Delirium can be misdiagnosed as dementia. A recent deterioration in cognitive function may indicate deli rium, which may be reversible if detected and treated in a timely fashion. Examples of acute mental status changes include: o A patient who is usually noisy or belligerent becomes quiet, lethargic, or inattentive. o A patient who is normally quiet and content suddenly becomes restless or noisy. o A patient who is usually able to find their way around their living environment begins to get lost. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions If SOC/ROC assessment, complete as close to the time of SOC/ROC as possible. If discharge assessment, complete as close to the time of discharge as possible. Observe patient behavior during the assessment for the signs and symptoms of delirium. Review medical record documentation and consult with other staff, family members/caregivers and others in a position to determine the patient's baseline status compared to status on the day of assessment. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 86 Consider all relevant information and use clinical judgment to determine if an acute change in mental status has occurred. Scoring Guide Coding Instructions for C1310A, Acute Mental Status Change Code 0, no, if there is no evidence of acute mental status change from the patient's baseline. Code 1, yes, if patient has an alteration in mental status observed or reported or identified that represents an acute change from baseline. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Examples 1. Patient was admitted to home health. The family reports that the patient was alert and oriented prior to the day of assessment. During the BIMS interview and assessment, the patient is lethargic and incoherent. Coding: C1310A would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: There is an acute change of the patient's mental status from alert and oriented (family report prior to admission) to lethargic and incoherent during the start of care assessment. 2. Caregiver reports that a patient with poor short-term memory and disorientation to time has suddenly become agitated, calling out to their dead spouse, tearing off their clothes, and being completely disoriented to time, person, and place. Coding: C1310A would be coded 1, yes. Rationale: The new behaviors represent an acute change in mental status. Response- Specific Instructions for C1310B, Inattention Assess attention separately from level of consciousness. An additional step to identify difficulty with attention is to ask the patient to count backwards from 20. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 87 Coding Instructions for C1310B, Inattention Code 0, behavior not present, if the patient re mains focused during the assessment and all other sources agree that the patient was attentive during other activities. Code 1, behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate, if the patient had difficulty focusing attention, was easily distracted, or had difficulty keeping track of what was said AND the inattention did not vary. All sources must agree that inattention was consistently present to select this code. Code 2, beha vior present, fluctuates, if inattention is noted during the assessment or any source reports that the patient had difficulty focusing attention, was easily distracted, or had difficulty keeping track of what was said AND the inattention varied or if information sources disagree in assessing level of attention. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Examples 1. A patient tries to answer all questions during the BIMS. Although they answer several items incorrectly and respond \"I don't know\" to others, the patient pays attention to the assessing clinician. The family indicates that this is the patient's consistent behavior. Coding: C1310B would be coded 0, behavior not present. Rationale: The patient remained focused throughout the assessment and this was constant during the day of assessment. 2. Questions during the BIMS must be frequently repeated because the patient's attention wanders. This behavior occurs throughout the assessment. The family agrees that this behavior is consistently present. The patient has a diagnosis of dementia. Coding: C1310B would be coded 1, behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate. Rationale: The patient's attention consistently wandered throughout the assessment. The patient's dementia diagnosis does not affect the coding. 3. During the BIMS interview, the patient was not able to focus on all questions asked and their gaze wandered. However, the family confirmed that the patient was attentive prior to the nurse arriving for the home health visit. Coding: C1310B would be coded 2, behavior present, fluctuates. Rationale: Evidence of inattention was found during the assessment, but the family indicated the patient had been attenti ve earlier in the day. This disagreement shows possible fluctuation in the behavior. If any information source reports the symptom as present, C1310B cannot be coded as 0, Behavior not present. 4. Patient is dazedly staring at the television for the first sev eral questions. When you ask a question, the patient looks at you momentarily but does not answer. Midway through questioning, they pay more attention and try to answer. Coding: C1310B would be coded 2, behavior present, fluctuates. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 88 Rationale: Patient's at tention fluctuated during the assessment. If as few as one source notes fluctuation, then the behavior should be coded 2. Coding Instructions for C1310C, Disorganized Thinking Code 0, behavior not present, if all sources agree that the patient's thinking was organized and coherent, even if answers were inaccurate or wrong. Code 1, behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate, if, during the assessment and according to other sources, the patient's responses were consistently disorganized or incoherent, conversation was rambling or irrelevant, ideas were unclear or flowed illogically, or the patient unpredictably switched from subject to subject. Code 2, behavior present, fluctuates, if, during the assessment or according to other data sources, the patient's responses fluctuated between disorganized/incoherent and organized/clear. Also code as fluctuating if information sources disagree. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare oc currence. Examples 1. The assessing clinician asks a patient, who is often confused, to give the date, and the patient's response is: \"Let's go get the sailor suits!\" The patient continues to provide irrelevant or nonsensical responses throughout the interview, and their family indicates this is constant. Coding: C1310C would be coded 1, behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate. Rationale: All sources agree that the disorganized thinking is constant. 2. A patient responds that the year is 1837 wh en asked to give the date. Their family indicates that the patient is never oriented to time but has relevant conversations and does not ramble with incoherent speech. For example, the family reports the patient often discusses their passion for baseball. Coding: C1310C would be coded 0, behavior not present. Rationale: The patient's answer was related to the question, even though it was incorrect. No other sources report disorganized thinking. 3. The patient was able to tell the assessing clinician their name, the year and where they were. The patient was able to talk about the activity they just attended in the assisted living facility and the residents and staff that also attended. Then the patient suddenly asked the clinician, \"Who are you? What are you doing in my daughter's home?\" Coding: C1310C would be coded 2, behavior present, fluctuates. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 89 Rationale: The patient's thinking fluctuated between coherent and incoherent at least once. If as few as one source notes fluctuation, then the behavior should be coded 2. Coding Instructions for C1310D, Altered Level of Consciousness Code 0, behavior not present, if all sources agree that the patient was alert and maintained wakefulness during conversation, interview(s), and activities. Code 1, behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate, if, during the assessment and according to other sources, the patient was consistently lethargic, stuporous, vigilant, or comatose. Code 2, behavior present, fluctuates, if, during the assessment or according to other sources, the patient's level of consciousness varied. For example, the patient was at times alert and responsive, while at other times the patient was lethargic, stuporous, or vigilant. Code as fluctuating if information sources disagree. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Examples 1. At discharge, a patient is alert and conversational and answers all questions during the BIMS interview, although not all answers are correct. Medical record documentation and family reports consistently note that the patient was alert. Coding: C1310D would be coded 0, behavior not present. Rationale: All evidence indicates that the patient is alert during conversation, assessment(s) and activities. 2. The patient is lying in bed. They arouse to soft touch but only converse for a short time before their eyes close, and they appear to be sleeping. Again, the patient arouses to voice or touch but only for short periods during the assessment. Information from the caregivers indicates that this has been the patient's condition. Coding: C1310D would be coded 1, behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate . Rationale: The patient's lethargy was consistent throughout the assessment, and there is consistent validation from the caregivers.. 3. The patient is usually alert, oriented to time, place, and person per family report. Today, at the time of the BIMS interview, the patient is conversant at the beginning of the interview but becomes lethargic and difficult to arouse. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 90 Coding: C1310D would be coded 2, behavior present, fluctuates. Rationale: The level of consciousness fluctuated during the assessment. If as few as one source notes fluctuation, then the behavior should be coded 2, fluctuating. M1700: Cognitive Functioning Item Intent Identifies the patient's current (at the time of the assessment and in the preceding 24 hours) level of cognitive functioning, including alertness, orientation, comprehension, concentration, and immediate memory for simple commands. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview patient and/or caregiver interview and review referral information. Consider the signs/symptoms of cognitive dysfunction that have occurred over the past 24 hours. Consider the amount of supervision and care required due to cognitive deficits. Links to cognitive assessment resources can be found in Appendix E of this manual. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips Diagnoses such as dementia, delirium, developmental delay disorders, mental retardation, etc., will have various degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Patients with neurological deficits related to stroke, mood/anxiety disorders, or who receive opioid therapy may have cognitive deficits. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 91 M1710: When Confused (Reported or Observed Within the Last 14 Days) Item Intent Identifies the time of day or situations when the patient experienced confusion, if at all. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver and review the referral information. Assess specifically for confusion in the past 14 days. Codes 2, 3, and 4 differ from each other based on the time when the confusion occurred and the length of time the confusion persists. Links to cognitive assessment resources can be found in Appendix E of this manual. Coding Instructions Code 0 , Never , if the patient had no confusion in the last 14 days. Code 1, In new or complex situations only, if the patient's confusion is isolated to a new or a complex situation. Code 4, Constantly, if the patient's confusion was present at all times during the entire 14 days. Code, NA, Patient nonresponsive, if the patient is nonresponsive at the time of assessment and the information cannot be elicited from the caregiver or other source. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips The \"past 14 days\" is the two- week period immediately preceding th e Start/Resumption of Care date. This means that for purposes of counting the 14-day period, the Start of Care date is day 0 and the day immediately prior to the Start of Care date is day 1. For example, if the patient's SOC date is August 20, any confusion reported or observed on or after August 6 and prior to the HHA admission would be reported. \"Nonresponsive\" means that the patient is unable to respond, or the patient responds in a way that you cannot make a clinical judgment about the patient's level of orientation. Chapter 3 Section C: Cognitive Patterns OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 92 If the patient is nonresponsive at the time of assessment, elicit from the caregiver or other sources whether the patient experienced any confusion during the past 14 days. M1720: When Anxious (Reported or Observed Within the Last 14 Days ) Item Intent Identifies the frequency with which the patient has felt anxious within the past 14 days. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver and review referral information. Links to cognitive assessment resources can be found in Appendix E of this manual. Coding Instructions Code 3, All of the time , if the patient felt anxious at all times during the entire look back period of 14 days. Code NA, Patient nonresponsive , if the patient is nonresponsive at the time of assessment and the information cannot be elicited from the caregiver or other source. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips Anxiety includes worry that interferes with learning and normal activities, feelings of being overwhelmed and having difficulty coping, or symptoms of anxiety disorders. The \"past 14 days\" is the two- week period immediately preceding the Start/Resumption of Care d ate. This means that for purposes of counting the 14-day period, the Start of Care date is day 0 and the day immediately prior to the Start of Care date is day 1. For example, if the patient's SOC date is August 20, any anxiety reported or observed on or after August 6 and prior to the HHA admission would be reported. \"Nonresponsive\" means that the patient is unable to respond, or the patient responds in a way that you cannot make a clinical judgment about the patient's level of anxiety. If the patient is nonresponsive at the time of assessment, elicit from the caregiver or other sources whether the patient experienced any anxiety during the past 14 days. Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 93 SECTION D: MOOD Introduction This section contains items that address mood distress. The presence of indicators does not automatically mean that the patient has a diagnosis of depression or other mood disorder. D0150: Patient Mood Interview (PHQ-2 to 9) Item Intent This item identifies the presence of signs and symptoms of mood distress, a serious condition that is underdiagnosed and undertreated in home health and is associated with significant morbidity. It is particularly important to identify signs and symptoms of mood distress among home health patients because these signs and symptoms can be treatable. Item Rationale Depression can be associated with: psychological and physical distress, decreased participation in therapy and activities, decreased functional status, and poorer outcom es. Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 94 Mood disorders are common in home health and are often underdiagnosed and undertreated . Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions If SOC/ROC assessment, complete as close to the time of SOC/ROC as possible. If discharge assessment, complete as close to the time of discharge as possible. Conduct the interview in a private setting, if possible. Interact with the patient using their preferred language. o If the patient appears unable to communicate, offer alternatives such as writing, pointing, sign language, or cue cards. If an interpreter is used during patient interviews, the interpreter should not attempt to determine the intent behind what is being translated, the outcome of the interview, or the meaning or significance of the patient's responses. Explain the reason for the interview before beginning. Suggested language : \"I am going to ask you some questions about your mood and feelings over the p ast 2 weeks. I will also ask about so me common problems that are known to go along with feeling down. Some of the questions might se em personal, but everyone is asked to answer t hem. This will help us provide you with better care.\" Explain and/or show the interview response choices. A cue card with the response choices clearly written in large print might help the patient comprehend the response choices. Suggested language : \"I am going to ask you how often you have been bothered by a particular problem over the last 2 weeks. I will give you the choices that you see on this card.\" (Say while pointing to cue card): \"0-1 days 1 day , 2-6 days\u2014several days, 7-11 days\u2014half or m ore of the days, or 12-14 days\u2014nearl y ever y day.\" Ask the first two questions (D0150A D0150B) of the Patient Mood Interview (PHQ-2 to 9). \"Over the last 2 weeks, have you been bothered by any of the followin g proble ms?\" For each of the questions: o Read the it em as it is w ritten. o Do not provide definitio ns because the m eaning must be based on the patient's inte rpretation. For example, t he patient defines for themself what \"feeling down\" m eans; the item should be scored based on the patient's i nterpretation. Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 95 oEach q uestion must be asked in seque nce t o assess prese nce (column 1) and frequency (column 2 ) before proceeding t o the next question. oEnter code 9 in Column 1 and leave blank (or skip) Column 2 if the patient was unable or chose not to compl ete an interview item or responded nonsensically . A nonsensical response is one that is unrelated, incomp rehensible, or incoherent or if the patient's response is not informative with respect to the item being r ated (e.g., when asked the question about \"poor appetite or overeating,\" the patient answe rs, \"I always win at poker.\"). oFor a yes response, a sk the patient to tell you h ow often they were bothered by the symptom over the last 2 weeks. Use the response choice s in D0150 Column 2, Symptom Frequency. S tart by asking the patient the numb er of days that they were bothered by the symptom and read and show cue card with frequency categories/de script io ns (0-1 days\u2014never or 1 day, 2-6 days\u2014s everal days, 7-11 alf or more of the days, or 12-14 days\u2014n early e very day). Determine if the patient is rarely/never understood verbally, in writing, or using another method. If rarely/never understood: Code D0150A1 and D0150B1 as 9 (No response) and leave D0150A2 and D0150B2 blank, end the PHQ-2 interview and skip D0160. Determine whether to complete the PHQ-9 (i.e., ask the remaining seven questions: D0150C to D0150I. Whether or not further evaluation of a patient's mood is needed depends on the patient's responses to the PHQ -2 (D0150A and D0150B). oIf both D0150A1 and D0150B1 are coded 9, OR, both D0150A2 and D0150B2 are coded 0 or 1, END the PHQ interview; otherwise continue. If both D0150A1 and D0150B1 are coded 9, leave D0150A2 and D0150B2 blank, then end the PHQ-2 and skip D0160, Total Severity Score. If both D0150A2 and D0150B2 are coded 0 or 1 then end t he PHQ-2 and enter the total sum of D0150A2 and D0150B2 in D0160, T otal Severity Score. oFor all other scenarios proceed to ask the remaining seven questions (D0150C to D0150I) of the PHQ-9 and complete D0160, Total Severity Score. Coding Instructions for Column 1: Symptom Presence Record the patient's responses as they are stated, regardless of whether the patient or the assessor attributes the symptom to something ot her than mood. Code 0, no: if patient indicat es symptom s listed are not p resent. Enter 0 in Column 2 as well. Code 1, yes: if patient indicates symptom listed is present. Enter 0, 1, 2, or 3 in Column 2, Symptom Frequency. Code 9, no response, if the patient was unable or chose not to complete the interview, or responded nonsensically. Leave Column 2, Symptom Frequency, blank. Dash is a valid response for this item. Enter a Dash in Column 1 if the symptom presence was not assessed. Leave Column 2, Symptom Frequency, blank. oDash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Instructions for Column 2: Symptom Frequency Code 0, never or 1 day , if the patient indic ates that during the past 2 weeks they have never been bothered by the symptom or have only been bothered by the sy mptom on 1 day.Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 96 Code 1, 2- 6 days (several days) , if the patient indicat es that during the past 2 weeks they have been bothered by the sy mptom for 2-6 days. Code 2, 7- 11 days (half or more of the days), if the patient indicates that during the past 2 weeks they have been bothered by the sy mptom for 7 -11 days. Code 3, 12 -14 days (nearly every day) , if the patient indicat es that during the past 2 weeks they have been bothered by the sy mptom for 12-14 days. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips Attempt to conduct the interview with ALL patients. If Column 1 equals 0, enter 0 in Column 2 If Columns 1 equals 9 or dash, leave Column 2 blank. If one or more of the symptom presence items from D0150 is not assessed, code Column 1 with a dash and leave Column 2 blank. For question D0150I, Thoughts Tha t You Woul d Be B etter Off Dead or of Hurting Yourself in Some Way: o Beginning interv iewers may feel uncomfor table asking th is item because they may fear upsetting the patient or m ay feel that the question is too personal. Others may worry that it will giv e the patient inappropriate ideas. However, Experienced interviewers have found that most patients who are having this feeling appreciate t he opportunity to express it. Asking about thoughts of self-harm does not give the person the idea. It does let the provider better understand what the patient is already feeling. The best interviewing approach is to ask the question openly and without hesitation. If the patient uses their own words to describ e a symptom , this should be briefly explored. If you deter mine that the patient is reporting the intended sy mptom but using their own words, ask them to tell you how often they were bothered by that symptom. o Select only one frequ ency response per item. If the patient has difficulty selecting between two frequency responses, code for the higher frequency. Some items (e.g., item F) contain more than one phrase. If a patient gives different frequencies for the different parts of a single item, select the highest frequency as the score for that item. Patients may respond to questions: o verbally, o by pointing to their answers on the cue card, OR o by writing o ut their answers Interviewing Tips and Techniques Repeat a question if you th ink that it has been misund erstood or m isinterpreted. Some patients may be eager to talk with you an d will stray f rom the topic at hand. When a person strays, you should gently guide the conversation back to the topic. Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 97 o Example: Say, \"That's interesting, now I need to know...\"; \"Let's get back to...\"; \"I understand, can you tell me about....\" Validate your understanding of what the patient is sayin g by ask ing fo r clarification. o Example: Say, \"I thin k I hear you sayin g that ...\"; \"Let's see if I understood you correctly.\"; \"You said.... Is that right?\" If the patient has difficulty selecting a frequency response, start by offering a single frequency response and follow with a sequence of more specific questions. This is known as unfolding. o Example: Say, \"Would you say [name symptom] bothered you more than half the days in the past 2 weeks?\" If the patient says \"yes,\" show the cue card and ask whether it bothered them nearly every day (12-14 days) or on half or more of the days (7-11 days). If the patient says \"no,\" show the cue card and ask whether it bothered them several days (2-6 days) or never or 1 day (0 -1 ittal respo sho uld be explor ed. Patients m ay be reluctant to report sympto ms and should be gently encouraged to tell you if the sy mptom bothered them, even if it was only some of the ti me. This is known as probing. Probe by asking neutral or nondi rectiv e question s such as: o \"What do you mean?\" o \"Tell me what you have in mind.\" o \"Tell me more about that.\" o \"Please be more specific.\" o \"Give me an example.\" Sometimes respondents give a long answer to interview items. To narrow the answer to the response choices available, it can be useful to summarize their longer answer and then ask them which response option best applies. This is known as echoing. o Example: Item D0150E, Poor Appetite or Overeating . The patient responds \"the food is always cold and it just doesn't taste like it does at home. The doctor won't let me have any salt.\" Possible clinician response: \"You're telling me the food isn't what you eat at home and you can't add salt. How often would you say that you were bothered by poor appetite or over- eating during the last 2 weeks?\" o Example: Item D0150A, Little Interest or Pleasure in Doing Things . The patient, when asked how often they have been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things, responds, \"There's nothing to do here, all you do is eat, bathe, and sleep. They don't do anything I like to do.\" Possible clinician response: \"You're saying there isn't much to do here and I want to come back later to talk about some things you like to do. Thinking about how you've been feeling over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things.\" o Exam ple: Item D0150B, Feeling Down, Depressed, or Hopeless . The patient, when asked how often they have been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, responds: \"How would you feel if you were here?\" Possible clinician response: \"You asked how I would feel, but it is important that I understand your feelings right now. How often would you say that you have been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during the last 2 weeks?\" Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 98 If the patient has difficulty with longer items, separate the item in to shorter parts, and provide a chance to respond after each part. This method, known as disentangling, is helpful if a patient has moderate cognitive impairment but can respond to simple, direct questions. o Example: Item D0150E, Poor Appetite or Overeating. You can simplify this item by asking: \"In the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite?\" (pause for a response) \"Or overeating?\" o Example: Item D0150C, Trouble Falling or Staying Asleep, or Sleeping Too Much. You can break the item down as follows: \"In the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by having problems falling asleep?\" (pause for response) \"How often are you been bothered by having problems staying asleep?\" (pause for response) \"How often have you been bothered by feeling you are sleeping too much?\" o Example: Item D0150H, Moving or Speaking So Slowly That Other People Could Have Noticed. Or the Opposite\u2014Being So Fidgety or Restless That You Have Been Moving Around a Lot More than Usual. You can simplify this item by asking: \"In the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by having problems with moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed?\" (pause for response) \"How often have you been bothered by feeling so fidgety or restless that you move around a lot more than usual?\" Examples 1. Assessing clinician : \"Over the past 2 weeks, have you been bothered by any of the following problems? Little interest or pleasure in doing things?\" Patient : \"I'm not interested in doing much. I just don't feel like it. I used to enjoy visiting with friends, but I don't do that much anymore. I'm just not interested.\" Assessing clinician : \"In the past two weeks, how often would you say you have been bothered by this? Would you say never or 1 day, 2-6 days, 7-11 days, or 12-14 days? Patient : \"7-11 days.\" Coding: D0150A1 (symptom presence) would be coded 1, yes and D0150A2 (Symptom frequency) would be coded 2, 7- 11 days. Rationale: The patient indicates that they have lost interest in activities that they previously enjoyed. The patient indicates that the symptom has bothered them 7-11 days in the past two weeks. 2. Assessing clinician : \"Over the past 2 weeks, have you had trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television?\" Patient : \"Television? I used to like watching the news. I can't concentrate on that anymore.\" Assessing clinician : \"In the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by having difficulty concentrating on things like television? Would you say never or 1 day, 2-6 days, 7-11 days, or 12-14 days? Patient : \"I'd say every day. It bothers me every day.\" Coding: D0150G1 (symptom presence) would be coded 1, yes and D0150G2 (Symptom frequency) would be coded 3, 12-14 days. Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 99 Rationale: The patient states that they have trouble concentrating and that this bothers them every day. D0160: Total Severity Score Item Intent This item identifies the severity score cal culated from responses to the PHQ-2 to 9, item D0150. Item Rationale The score does not diagnose a mood disorder or depression but provides a st andard score which can be communicated to the patient's physician, other clin icians and m ental hea lth sp ecialists for appropriate follow up. The Total Severity Sco re is a su mmary of the frequency scores on the PHQ-2 to 9 that indica tes the extent of potential depression sympto ms. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Do not add up the score while you are interviewing the patient. Instead, focus your full attention on the interview. Use the scoring guide to complete scoring: Scoring Rules: Patient Mood Interview Total Severity Score D0160. The maximum patient s core is 27 (3 x 9). Coding Instructions If only the PHQ- 2 is completed because both D0150A1 and D0150B1 are coded 9, leave D0150A2 and D0150B2 blank, then end the PHQ interview and skip D0160, Total Severity Score. If only the PHQ- 2 is completed because both D0150A2 and D0150B2 are coded 0 or 1, add the numeric scores from these two frequency items and enter the value in D0160, Total Severity Score If the PHQ -9 was completed (D0150C-I were not skipped due to the responses in D0150A and B), and if the patient answered the frequency respo nses of at least 7 of the 9 ite ms on the PHQ- 9; add the numeric scores from D0150A2-D0150I2 and enter in D0160 Total Severity Score. If symptom frequency is blank for 3 or more it ems, the inte rview is de emed NOT co mplete. D0160, Total Severity Score should be coded as \"99 \" The Total Severity Score will be between 00 and 27 (or \" 99\" if sy mpto m frequency is blank for 3 or more ite ms). Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 100 Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips Responses to PHQ- 2 to 9 can indicate possible depression if the full PHQ-2 to 9 is completed (i.e., interview is not stopped after D0150B due to responses). Responses can be interpreted as follows: o Major Depressive Syndrom e is suggested if\u2014of the 9 items\u20145 or more items are identified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7-11 days) during the look-back period. o Minor Depressive Syndrom e is suggested if, of the 9 items, (1) feeling down, depressed or hopeless, (2) trou ble falling or staying asle ep, or sleepin g too much , or (3) feeling tired or having little energy are identified at a frequency of half or m ore of the days (7 -11 days) during the look- back period. o In addition, PHQ-2 to 9 Total Severity Score can be used to track changes in severity over tim e. Total Severity Score can be inte rpreted as follows: 0-4: minimal depression 5-9: mild depression 10-14: moderate depression 15-19: moderately severe depression 20-27: severe depression Scoring Rules: Patient Mood Interview Total Severity Score D0160 If only the PHQ -2 is completed because both D0150A2 and D0150B2 are coded 0 or 1 , add the numeric scores from these two frequency items and enter the value in D0160. If items D0150C through D0150I were asked, calculate the Total Severity Score: Item D0160 is used to store the total severity score for the Patient Mood Interview. The score in item D0160 is based upon the sum of the values that are contained in the following to as the \"items in Column 2\", below. The following rules explain how to compute the score that is placed in item D0160. These rules consider the \"number of missing items in Column 2\" which is the number of items in Column 2 that are skipped. An item in Column 2 is skipped if the corresponding item in Column 1 was equal to 9 (no response) or a dash (symptom presence not assessed). If all of the items in Column 2 have a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (i.e., they all contain non-missing values), then item D0160 is equal to the simple sum of those values. If any of the items in Column 2 are blank (or skipped) , then omit their values when computing the sum. If the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to one, then compute the simple sum of the eight items in Column 2 that have non -missing values, mul tiply the sum by 9/8 (1.125), and place the result rounded to the nearest integer in item D0160. If the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to two, then compute the simple sum of the seven items in Column 2 that have non -missing values, multiply the sum by 9/7 (1.286), and place the result rounded to the nearest integer in item D0160. If the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to three or more, then item D0160 must equal [99]. Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 101 Examples 1. All Items in Column 2 Have Non- missing Values The following example shows how to score the Patient interview when all of the items in Column 2 have non-missing values: Item Value D0150A2 1 D0150B2 3 D0150I2 2 D0160 14 Rationale: In this example, all of the items in Column 2 have non-missing values (i.e., none of the values are blank (or skipped). Therefore, the value of D0160 is equal to the simple sum of the values in Column 2, which is 14. 2. One Missing Value in Column 2 The following example shows how to score the Patient interview when one of the items in Column 2 has a missing value: Item Value D0150A2 1 D0150B2 2 D0150C2 D0150D2 0 D0150E2 3 D0150F2 0 D0150G2 1 Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 102 D0150H2 3 D0150I2 1 D0160 12 Rationale: In this example, one of the items in Column 2 (D0150C2) has a missing value (it is blank or skipped) and the other 8 items have non-missing values. D0160 is computed as follows: 1. Compute the sum of the 8 items with non-missing values. This sum is 11. 2. Multiply this sum by 1.125. In the example, 11 x 1.125 = 12.375. 3. Round the result to the nearest integer. In the example, 12.375 rounds to 12. 4. Place the rounded result in D0160. 3. Two Missing Values in Column 2 The following example shows how to score the Patient interview when two of the items in Column 2 have missing values: Item Value D0150A2 1 D0150B2 2 D0150I2 D0160 10 Rationale: In this example, two of the items in Column 2 have missing values: both D0150C2 and D0150I2 are blank (or skipped). The other 7 items have non-missing values. D0160 is computed as follows: 1. Compute the sum of the 7 items with non-missing values. This sum is 8. 2. Multiply this sum by 1.286. In the example, 8 x 1.286 = 10.288. 3. Round the result to the nearest integer. In the example, 10.288 rounds to 10. 4. Place the rounded result in D0160. Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 103 4. Three or More Missing Values in Column 2 The following example shows how to score the Patient interview when three or more of the items in Column 2 have missing values: Item Value D0150A2 1 D0160 99 Rationale: In this example, three of the items in Column 2 have missing values: D0150C2, D0150F2, and D0150G2are blank (or skipped). Because three or more items have missing values, D0160 is equal to 99. D0700: Social Isolation Item Intent The intent of this item is to identify the patient's actual or perceived lack of contact with other people, such as living alone or residing in a remote area. Item Rationale Social isolation tends to increase with age, is a risk factor for physical and mental illness, and a predictor of mortality. Chapter 3 Section D: Mood OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 104 Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions This item is intended to be a patient self -report item. No other source should be used to identify the response. Complete as close to the time of SOC/ROC and DC as possible. Data sources/resources: Ask for the patient, \"How often do you feel lonely or isolated from those around you?\" Coding Instructions Code 0, Never, if the patient indicates never feeling lonely or isolated from others Code 1, Rarely, if the patient indicates rarely feeling lonely or isolated from others Code 2, Sometimes, if the patient indicates sometimes feeling lonely or isolated from others Code 3, Often, if the patient indicates often feeling lonely or isolated from others Code 4, Always, if the patient indicates always feeling lonely or isolated from others Code 7, Patient declines to respond, if the patient declines to respond Code 8, Patient unable to respond, if the patient is unable to respond Dash is not a valid response for this item Chapter 3 Section E: Behavior OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 105 SECTION E: BEHAVIOR Introduction The items in this section help to identify and describe the presence and frequency of behaviors associated with a variety of disorders. M1740: Cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric symptoms Item Intent Identifies specific behaviors associated with significant neurological, developmental, behavioral, or psychiatric disorders. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver, conduct a physical assessment, including observation of the patient. Review the clinical record, including but not limited to, referral information and physician history and physical. Links to cognitive assessment resources can be found in Appendix E of this manual. Behaviors reported could be identified by a formal diagnosis and/or determined by clinical judgment of the assessing clinician. Behaviors which are severe enough to make the patient unsafe to self or others, cause considerable stress to the caregivers and/or require supervision or intervention should be included. Coding Instructions Code 7, None of the above behaviors demonstrated, when none of the other responses are selected. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section E: Behavior OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 106 M1745: Frequency of Disruptive Behavior Symptoms (Reported or Observed) Item Intent Identifies the frequency of any behaviors that are disruptive or dangerous to the patient or the caregivers. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver and conduct a physical assessment, including observation of the patient. Behaviors can be reported by the patient, caregiver, family, or others, and/or observed by the clinician. Review the clinical record, including but not limited to the referral information and the physician history and physical. Links to additional information sources can be found in Appendix E of this manual. Use professional judgment to determine if the behavior is disruptive or dangerous to the patient or others. Consider any and all disruptive/dangerous behaviors to respond to this item, not just the behaviors listed in M1740. Then consider how frequently these behaviors occur. Include behaviors considered symptomatic of neurological, cognitive, behavioral, developmental, or psychiatric disorders, identified by diagnosis and/or the assessing clinician's professional judgment. Coding Instructions Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips Examples of disruptive/dangerous behaviors include but are not limited to sleeplessness, \"sun-downing,\" agitation, wandering, aggression, combativeness, and/or getting lost in familiar places. Chapter 3 Section F: Preferences for Customary Routine Activities OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 107 SECTION F: PREFERENCES FOR CUSTOMARY ROUTINE ACTIVITIES Introduction This section identifies the patient's living situation including types, sources and amounts of assistance needed for routine activities. M1100: Patient Living Situation Item Intent This item identifies, using the assessing clinician's professional judgment, a) whether the patient is living alone or with other(s) and b) the availability of caregiver(s)other than home health agency staff to provide in-person assistance. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver, and review referral information. Information may also be available in an assisted living facility agreement or contract. First, determine living arrangement - whether the patient normally lives alone, in a home with others, or in a congregate setting. Second, determine availability of assistance - how frequently caregiver(s) other than home health staff are in the home and available to provide assistance if needed. o This item documents the time caregiver(s) are in the home and available without regard to the amount or types of assistance the patient requires, or whether the caregiver(s) are able to meet all or only some of the patient's needs. Chapter 3 Section F: Preferences for Customary Routine Activities OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 108 Living arrangement o Lives alone: The patient lives in an independent (non- assisted) setting such as a home, an apartment or a room in a boarding house. A patient is considered to be living alone when they have: Only live-in, paid help. A caregiver is temporarily staying in the home to provide assistance, but they normally live alone. A life -line or can obtain emergency help by phone but no other people are living with them. o Lives with others: The patient lives in an independent (non- assisted) setting with a spouse, family member or another significant other. A patient who lives with others and is occasionally alone when caregiver(s) travel, is still considered to be living with others. o Lives in congregate situation : The patient lives in a setting where assistance, supervision and/or oversight are provided as part of the living arrangement, such as an assisted living facility, residential care home or personal care home. The patient may live alone, or with a spouse or significant other, in an apartment or room in an assisted living facility, for example, and still be considered living in a congregate situation. Availability of Assistance o Around the clock: Someone is in the home to provide assistance to the patient 24 hours a day. o Regular daytime : Someone is in the home to provide assistance during daytime hours every day with infrequent exceptions. o Regular nighttime : Someone is in the home to provide assistance during nighttime hours every night with infrequent exceptions. o Occasional/short- term assistance: Someone is in the home to provide assistance only for a few hours a day, or on an irregular basis, or only occasionally. o No assistance available : There is no one available to provide any in- person assistance. Coding Instructions Code the response identifying the availability of ass istance in the row that matches the patient's living arrangement. Only one response should be marked. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips If the patient has recently changed their living arrangement due to their condition, report the usual living arrangement prior to the illness, injury or exacerbation for which the patient is receiving care, unless the new living arrangement is expected to be permanent. Use professional judgment to determine which hours constitute \"regular daytime\" and \"regular nighttime\" based on the patient's specific activities and routines. No hours are specifically designated as daytime or nighttime. Assistance refers to any type of in-person assistance provided in the home of the patient, including but not limited to ADLs and IADLs. Chapter 3 Section F: Preferences for Customary Routine Activities OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 109 Use professional judgment to determine if someone will be available to provide any assistance to the patient. If a person is living in the patient's home but is completely unable to or unwilling to provide any assistance to the patient , do not count them as a caregiver. Availability of assistance refers to the expected availability and willingness of caregiver(s) for this upcoming quality episode. If a person is in an assisted living or congregate setting with a call- bell that summons onsite, in -person help, this is considered in-person assistance. If its use is restricted to emergencies only, report the availability as occasional/short -term assistance unless other caregiver's availability meets a higher level. The caregiver(s) need not live in the home with the patient, but assistance via telephone is not included in this question. Examples 1. Patient lives alone in their own apartment. Since the patient's discharge from the hospital, their two daughters alternate staying with them during the day and night so that one of them is always there, except for the times when one goes out to run an errand or pick up a child at day care. Coding: 01 Rationale: Patient still considered to be living alone, since daughters are only staying there temporarily. Daughters are providing round-the-clock care, even if one occasionally needs to be out of the house for brief periods 2. Patient lives alone in their home but their son and daughter- in-law live across the street. They bring the patient dinner every night and are available around the clock by telephone. Coding: 04 Rationale: Son and daughter- in-law ar e not there to provide in-person assistance consistently, day or evening, even if they live across the street and are available by phone. 3. Patient lives with their child who works during the day but is home every evening and sleeps there every night. A paid aide comes in 3 days a week to assist with ADLs. The patient's child has back problems that prevent them from lifting patient, but they assist the patient with dressing every morning and take the patient to doctor's appointments. Coding: 08 Rationale: Patient lives in a home with others who are available every night to offer in-person assistance. Even if the child can't meet all of patient's needs, they are available all night. 4. Patient lives with their spouse who has significant cognitive and functional i mpairments, is wheelchair bound, and is unable to provide the patient with any assistance. A member of the church comes by one evening a week and brings groceries. Coding: 09 Rationale: Patient lives in a home with another person who is there 24 hours but is unavailable to provide assistance. Caregiver from church provides occasional assistance. Chapter 3 Section F: Preferences for Customary Routine Activities OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 110 5. Patient lives alone in an apartment that is part of an ALF. The apartment does not have a cal l-bell but their contract with the ALF includes having a home health aide assist her with ADLs 2 hours every morning. The patient's son also comes over occasionally to assist with bills, groceries, and errands. Coding: 14 Rationale: Patient is living in a congregate setting; one caregiver is available to assist for some part of every day on a regular basis, but not all day, another caregiver offers occasional assistance. M2102: Types and Sources of Assistance Chapter 3 Section F: Preferences for Customary Routine Activities OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 111 Item Intent Identifies ability and willingness of the caregiver(s) (other than home health agency staff) to provide categories of assistance needed by the patient. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver, and review the clinical record, including but not limited to the previous health history At SOC/ROC, report what is known on the day of assessment regarding ability and willingness of non- agency caregivers to provide supervision and safety due to a cognitive impairment for the upcoming episode of care. At Discharge, report what is known on the day of the discharge assessment regarding the ability and willingness of non-agency caregivers to provide assistance to the patient in the various categories of assistance at the time of the discharge. If patient needs assistance with any aspect of a category of assistance (such as needs assistance with some ADLs but not others), consider the aspect that represents the most need. If more than one response represents the non- agency caregiver's ability to provide assistance, select the response that represents the caregiver's greatest barrier to meet the need. For example, the caregiver provides assistance but also needs training or supp ort. In this example, report that the caregiver needs training/supportive services to provide assistance, because it represents the caregiver's greatest barrier to meeting the patient's need. For each row, enter one description of caregiver assistance. o a. ADL assistance includes basic self -care activities such as the examples listed. o c. Medication administration refers to any type of medication (prescribed or OTC) and any route of administration including oral, inhalant, injectable, topical, or administration via g-tube/j- tube, etc. o d. Medical procedures/treatments include procedures/treatments that the physician/allowed practitioner or physician-designee has ordered for the purpose of improving health status. Some examples of these procedures/treatments include wound care and dressing changes, range of motion exercises, intermittent urinary catheterization, postu ral drainage, electromodalities, etc. o f. Supervision and safety includes needs related to the ability of the patient to safely remain in the home. This category of assistance needs should focus on supervision and safety necessary due to cognitive or mental health issues. The need for supervision and safety due to cognitive or mental health issues does not require a specific diagnosis. Such assistance may range from calls to remind the forgetful patient to take medications, to in -person visits to ensure tha t a patient with impaired decision making is safe, to the need for the physical presence of another person in the home to ensure that the patient doesn't wander, harm themselves or others or to monitor other safety risks related to cognitive/mental health concerns. Chapter 3 Section F: Preferences for Customary Routine Activities OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 112 For the purposes of coding d. Medical procedures/treatments, consider devices such as anti- embolism stockings, prosthetic devices, orthotic devices, or other supports that have a medical and/or therapeutic impact as medical procedures/treatments. Do not consider these items in a. ADL assistan ce. Coding Instructions Code 3, Non-agency Caregiver(s) are not likely to provide assistance, if they are unwilling, reluctant, or unable to provide care. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section G: Functional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 113 SECTION G: FUNCTIONAL STATUS Introduction The items in this section address the patient's ability to safely perform personal care activities. The items identify the patient's ABILITY, not necessarily ac tual performance. \"Willingness\" and \"adherence\" are not the focus of these items. The patient must be viewed from a holistic perspective in assessing ability to perform ADLs. Ability can be temporarily or permanently limited by: physical impairments (for e xample, limited range of motion, impaired balance) emotional/cognitive/behavioral impairments (for example, memory deficits, impaired judgment, fear) sensory impairments, (for example, impaired vision or pain) environmental barriers. M1800: Grooming Item Intent Identifies the patient's ability to tend to personal hygiene needs, excluding bathing, shampooing hair, and toileting hygiene. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Observation/demonstration is the preferred method for coding this item. The assessing clinician may also interview the patient and/or caregiver, conduct environmental assessment and may consider available input from other agency staff who have had direct patient contact. The patient's ability may change as the patient's condition improves or declines, as medical restrictions are imposed or lifted, or as the environment is modified. The cl inician must consider what the patient is able to do on the day of the assessment. If ability varies over time, choose the response describing the patient's ability more than 50% of the time period under consideration. Grooming includes several activities. The frequency with which selected activities are performed (such as washing face and hands vs. fingernail care) must be considered in responding. Patients able to do more Chapter 3 Section G: Functional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 114 frequently performed activities (for example, washing hands and face) but unable to do less frequently performed activities (trimming fingernails) should be considered to have more ability in grooming. In cases where a patient's ability is different for various grooming tasks, enter the response that best describes the patient's level of ability to perform the majority of grooming tasks. Coding Instructions Code 2, Someone must assist the patient , if the patient can participate in grooming tasks but needs some assistance. The word \"assistance\" in this item refers to assistance from another person by verbal cueing/reminders, supervision, and/or stand-by or hands- on assistance. Dash is not a valid response for this item. M1810: Current Ability to Dress Upper Body Item Intent Identifies the patient's ability to dress upper body, including the ability to obtain, put on, and remove upper body clothing. Assess ability to put on whatever clothing is routinely worn. This specifically includes the ability to manage zippers, buttons, and snaps if these are routinely worn. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Observation/demonstration is the preferred method for coding this item. The assessing clinician may also interview the patient and/or caregiver, conduct environmental assessment and may consider available input from other agency staff who have had direct patient contact. For the purposes of coding this item, prosthetic, orthotic, or other support devices applied to the upper body (for example, upper extremity prosthesis, cervical collar, or arm sling) should be considered as upper body dressing items/tasks. The patient's ability may change as the patient's condition improves or declines, as medical restrictions are imposed or lifted, or as the environment is modified. The clinician must consider what the patient is able to do on the day of the assessment. If ability varies over time, enter the response describing the patient's ability more than 50% of the time period under consideration. Chapter 3 Section G: Functional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 115 In cases where a patient's ability is different for various upper body dressing tasks, enter the response that best describes the patient's level of ability to perform the majority of upper body dressing tasks. If a patient modifies the clothing they wear due to a physical impairment, the modified clothing selection will be considered routine if there is no reasonable expectation that the patient could return to their previous style of dressing. There is no specified timeframe at which the modified clothing style will become the routine clothing. The clinician will need to determine which clothes should be considered routine. It will be considered routine because the clothing is what the patient usually wears and will continue to wear, or because the patient is making a change in clothing options to styles that are expected to become the patient's new routine clothing. Coding Instructions Code 2, Someone must help the patient , if the patient can p articipate in upper body dressing tasks but needs some assistance. The word \"assistance\" in this item refers to assistance from another person by verbal cueing/reminders, supervision, and/or stand-by or hands- on assistance. Code 3, Patient depends entirely upon another person to dress the upper body , is selected only when the patient is dependent, relying entirely on another person to complete the majority of the upper body dressing tasks. Dash is not a valid response for this item. M1820: Current Ability to Dress Lower Body Item Intent Identifies the patient's ability to dress lower body, including the ability to obtain, put on, and remove lower body clothing. Assess ability to put on whatever clothing is routinely worn. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Observation/demonstration is the preferred method for coding this item. The assessing clinician may also interview the patient and/or caregiver, conduct environmental assessment and may consider available input from other agency staff who have had direct patient contact. Chapter 3 Section G: Functional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 116 For the purposes of coding this item, prosthetic, orthotic, or other support devices applied to the lower body (for example, lower extremity prosthesis, ankle-foot orthosis [AFO], or anti-embolism stockings) should be considered as lower body dressing items/tasks. The patient's ability may change as the patien t's condition improves or declines, as medical restrictions are imposed or lifted, or as the environment is modified. The clinician must consider what the patient is able to do on the day of the assessment. If ability varies over time, enter the response describing the patient's ability more than 50% of the time period under consideration. In cases where a patient's ability is different for various dressing lower body tasks, enter the response that best describes the patient's level of ability to perform th e majority of dressing lower body tasks. If a patient modifies the clothing they wear due to a physical impairment, the modified clothing selection will be considered routine if there is no reasonable expectation that the patient could return to their previous style of dressing. There is no specified timeframe at which the modified clothing style will become the routine clothing. The clinician will need to determine which clothes should be considered routine. It will be considered routine because the cloth ing is what the patient usually wears and will continue to wear, or because the patient is making a change in clothing options to styles that are expected to become the patient's new routine clothing. Coding Instructions Code 2, Someone must assist the pat ient, if the patient can participate in lower body dressing tasks but needs some assistance. The word \"assistance\" in this item refers to assistance from another person by verbal cueing/reminders, supervision, and/or stand-by or hands- on assistance. Code 3, Patient depends entirely upon another person to dress lower body , is selected only when the patient is dependent, relying entirely on another person to complete the majority of lower body dressing tasks.

M1830: Bathing Chapter 3 Section G: Functional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 117 Item Intent Identifies the patient's ability to bathe entire body and the assistance that may be required to safely bathe, including transferring in/out of the tub/shower. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Observation/demonstration is the preferred method for coding this item. The assessing clinician may also interview the patient and/or caregiver, conduct environmental assessment and may consider available input from other agency staff who have had direct patient contact. Specifically excludes washing face and hands, and shampooing hair. The patient's ability may change as the patient's condition improves or declines, as medical restrictions are imposed or lifted, or as the environment is modified. The clinician must consider what the patient is able to do on the day of the assessment. If ability varies over time, enter the response describing the patient's ability more than 50% of the time perio d under consideration. The patient's status should not be coded based on a patient's ability to perform a task with equipment they have not been assessed using. Coding Instructions Code 4, 5 or 6, depending on the patient's ability to participate in bathin g activities: o If a patient is medically restricted from stair climbing, and the tub/shower requires climbing stairs o If the patient does not have a tub or shower in the home o If the tub/shower is nonfunctioning or not safe for patient use Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips For Response 4 , the patient must be able to bathe outside the tub/shower safely and independently, including independently accessing water at the sink, or setting up a basin at the bedside, etc. For Response 5, the patient is unable to bathe in the tub/shower and needs intermittent or continuous assistance. Enter Response 6, if the patient is totally unable to participate in bathing and is totally bathed by another person, regardless of where bathing occurs or if patient has a functioning tub or shower. Chapter 3 Section G: Functional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 118 M1840: Toilet Transferring Item Intent Identifies the patient's ability to safely get to and from and transfer on and off the toilet or bedside commode.

Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Observation/demonstration is the preferred method for coding this item. The assessing clinician may also interview the patient and/or caregiver, conduct environmental assessment and may consider available input from other agency staff who have had direct patient contact. For most patients, the tran sfer between bed and chair will include transferring from a supine position in bed to a sitting position at the bedside, then some type of standing, stand-pivot, or sliding board transfer to a chair, and back into bed from the chair or sitting surface. If there is no chair in the patient's bedroom or the patient does not routinely transfer from the bed directly into a chair in the bedroom, report the patient's ability to move from a supine position in bed to a sitting position at the side of the bed, and then the ability to stand and then sit on whatever surface is applicable to the patient's environment and need, (for example, a chair in another room, a bedside commode, the toilet, a bench, etc.). Include the ability to return back into bed from the sitting surface. The patient's ability may change as the patient's condition improves or declines, as medical restrictions are imposed or lifted, or as the environment is modified. The clinician must consider what the patient is able to do on the day of the assessment. If ability varies over time, enter the response describing the patient's ability more than 50% of the time period under consideration. Chapter 3 Section G: Functional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 121 Able to bear weight refers to the patient's ability to support the majority of their body weight through any combination of weight- bearing extremities (for example, a patient with a weight-bearing restriction of one lower extremity may be able to support their entire weight through the other lower extremity and upper extremities). Bedfast refers to being confined to the bed, either per physician restriction or due to a patient's inability to tolerate being out of the bed. Coding Instructions Code 1 , if the patient: o Transfers either with minimal human assistance (but not a device), or with the use of a device (but no human assistance). Code 2, if the patient: o Requires both minimal human assistance AND an assistive device to transfer safely o Can both bear weight and pivot, but requires more than minimal human assistance Code 3, if the p atient is unable to bear weight or pivot and is not bedfast. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips \"Minimal human assistance\" applies when the helper is contributing less than 25% of the total effort required to complete the task. Assistance may include any combination of verbal cueing, environmental set-up, and/or actual hands-on assistance. M1860: Ambulation/Locomotion Item Intent Identifies the patient's ability and the type of assistance required to safely ambulate or propel self in a wheelchair over a variety of surfaces. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Chapter 3 Section G: Functional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 122 Follow-up Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Observation/demonstration is the preferred method for coding this item. The assessing clinician may also interview the patient and/or caregiver, conduct environmental assessment and may consider available input from other agency staff who have had direct patient contact. Variety of surfaces refers to typical surfaces that the patient would routinely encounter in their environment and may vary based on the individual residence. The patient's ability may change as the patient's condition improves or declines, as medical restrictions are imposed or lifted, or as the environment is modified. The clinician must consider what the patient is able to do on the day of the assessment. If a patient does not require human assistance, but safely ambulates with a walker in some areas of the home, and a cane in other areas (due to space limitations, distances, etc.), enter the response that reflects the device that best supports safe ambulation on all surfaces the patient routinely encounters. Coding Instructions Code 2 or 3 , if the patient requires human assistance (hands on, supervision and/or verbal cueing) to safely ambulate, regardless of the need for an assistive device. Code 2 if the ass istance required is intermittent. Code 3 if the assistance required is continuous. Code 2, if the patient is: o Able to safely ambulate without a device on a level surface, but requires minimal assistance on stairs, steps, and uneven surfaces. o Able to safely ambulate with a walker in the hallway or living room, even if there are some situations in the home where a cane provides adequate support as long as the patient does not require continuous human assistance. Code 3, if a patient does not have a walking device but is clearly not safe walking alone, unless the patient is chairfast. Code 4 or 5 , if a patient: o Is unable to ambulate even with the use of assistive devices and/or continuous assistance. o Demonstrat es or reports ability to take one or two steps to complete a transfer, but is otherwise unable to ambulate. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 123 SECTION GG: FUNCTIONAL ABILITIES AND GOALS GG0100: Prior Functioning: Everyday Activities Item Intent This item identifies the patient's usual ability with everyday activities, prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Ask the patient and/or family/c aregiver or review the clinical record for details describing the patient's prior functioning with everyday activities. Coding Instructions Code 3, Independent, if the patient completed ALL the activities by themself, with or without an assistive device, with no assistance from a helper. Code 2, Needed Some Help, if the patient needed partial assistance from another person to complete ANY of the activities. Code 1, Dependent, if the helper completed ALL the activities for the patient, or the assistance of two or more helpers was required for the patient to complete the activities . Code 8, Unknown, if the patient's usual ability prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury is unknown. Code 9, Not Applicable, if the activities were not applicable to the patient prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 124 Coding Tips For GG0100 - Prior Functioning; Everyday Activities report the patient's functional ability prior to the onset of the current illness, exacerbation of a chronic condition, or injury, whichever is most recent, that initiated this episode of care . If no information about the patient's ability is available after attempts to interview the patient or their family and after reviewing the patient's clinical record, code as 8, Unknown. Completing the stair activity for GG0100C Stairs indicates that a patient went up and down the stairs, by any safe means, with or without handrails or assistive devices or equipment (such as a cane, crutch, walker or stair lift), and/or with or without som e level of assistance. \"By any safe means\" may include a patient scooting up/down stairs on buttocks. Stairs include internal or external without a defined number. Going up and down a ramp is not considered going up and down stairs for coding GG0100C Stai rs Examples 1. Prior to their recent illness, the patient ambulated with a walker around their home without assistance. They required the use of a stair lift to negotiate the stairs to the second floor, where their bedroom is located. They were safe using the stair lift without any assistance or supervision. Coding: GG0100C, Stairs, would be coded 3, Independent. Rationale: Using the stair lift, the patient's prior status was that they were able to go up and down the stairs safely and independently. GG0110. Prior Device Use Item Intent This item identifies the patient's use of devices and aids immediately prior to the most recent illness, exacerbation, or injury. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 125 Response- Specific Instructions Ask the patient and/or family/caregiver, or review the clinical record, for details describing the patient's use of prior devices and aids. For GG0110C, Prior Device Use report the devices used by the patient prior to the ons et of the current illness, exacerbation of a chronic condition, or injury, whichever is more recent, that initiated this episode of care. Check all devices that apply. For the response categories in GG0110 (e.g., Mechanical lift, Orthotics/Prosthetics), CMS does not provide an exhaustive list of assistive devices that may be used when coding prior device use. Devices may have been used indoors and/or outdoors. Coding Instructions GG0110C, Prior Devices: Mechanical lift includes any mechanical device or equipment a patient or caregiver requires for lifting or supporting the patient's bodyweight. Examples include, but are not limited to: Stair lift, Hoyer lift, bathtub lift, sit- to-stand lift, stand assist, electric recliner and full-body style lifts, if required. o Clinical judgment may be used to determine whether other devices, meet the mechanical lift definition provided. GG0110D, Walker refers to all types of walkers. Examples include but are not limited to: pick -up walkers, hemi -walkers, rolling walkers, and platform walkers. Code Z, None of the above, if the patient did not use any of the listed devices or aids immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Examples 1. The patient is a bilateral lower extremity amputee and has multiple diagnoses, including diabetes, obesity, and peripheral vascular disease. They are unable to walk and did not walk prior to the current episode of care, which started because of a pressure ulcer and respiratory infection. They used a motorized wheelchair to mobilize. Coding: GG0110B, Motorized wheelchair and/or scooter would be checked. Rationale: The patient used a motorized wheelchair prior to the current illness/injury. 2. The patient has bilateral lower extremity neuropathy secondary to diabetes. Prior to this current home health admission, they used a cane. Today, they are using a walker. Coding: GG0110Z, None of the above, would be checked. Rationale: A cane is not a device included in the list of devices in GG0110. Not all devices and aids are included in this item.

Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Discharge from agency Response Specific Instructions - General Licensed clinicians may assess the patient's self -care and mobility performance based on direct observation (preferred), patient/caregiver report, assessment of similar activities and/or collaboration with Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 129 other agency staff who have had direct contact with the patient or some other means of gathering information. When possible, CMS invites a multidisciplinary approach to patient assessment. Patients should be allowed to perform activities as independently as possible, as long as they are safe. Communicating the activity request (e.g., \"Can you stand up from the toilet?\") would not be considered verbal cueing. If additional prompts are required in order for the patient to safely complete the activity (e.g., \"Push down on the grab bar\", etc.), the assessing clinician may need to use clinical judgment to determine the most appropriate code. If the patient only completes a portion of the activity (e.g., performs a partial bath or transfers into but not out of a vehicle) and does not complete the entire activity during the assessment timeframe, use clinical judgment to determine if the situation allows the clinician to adequately assess the patient's ability to complete the activity. If the clinician determines that this observation is adequate, code based on the type and amount of assistance the patient requires to complete the ENTIRE activity. If the clinician determines the partial activity does not provide adequate information to support determination of a performance code, select an appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code. When a GG function activity is not completed entirely during one clinical observation (i.e., a patient transfers bed -to-chair in the morning, and transfers chair- to-bed at night), code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the ENTIRE activity. Patients with cognitive impairments/limitations may need physical and/or verbal assistance when completing an activity (f or example, due to choking risk due to rate of eating, amount of food placed into mouth, risk of falling). Code based on the type and amount of assistance required to perform the activity safely. When using patient or caregiver reports, it is expected that the patient and caregivers are reporting on the patient's status within the time period under consideration (e.g., reporting on the patient's ability to complete an activity within the past 24 hours). For GG0130 and GG0170 the assessing clinician would code each activity based on the type and amount of assistance needed to complete the activity safely, not based on the availability of such assistance. Assessment of the GG self -care and mobility items is based on the patient's ability to complete the activity with or without assistance and/or a device. This is true regardless of whether or not the activity is being/will be routinely performed (e.g., walking may be assessed for a patient who did/does/will use a wheelchair as their primary mode of mobility, stair activities may be assessed for a patient not routinely accessing stairs). Refer to agency, Federal, and State policies and procedures to determine which agency staff members may complete an assessment. Patient assessments are to be done in compliance with agency, Federal, and State requirements. Response Specific Instructions - Assistive Devices Activities may be completed with or without an assistive device. This includes the use of any new or previously utilized assistive device(s) or equipment. Use of a device or equipment may result in the patient needing less assistance from a helper. The p atient may be assessed based on the first use of an assistive device or equipment that has not been previously used. The clinician would provide assistance, as needed, in order for the patient to complete the Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 130 activity safely, and code based on the type and amount of assistance required, prior to the benefit of services provided by your agency staff. \"Prior to the benefit of services\" means prior to provision of any care by your agency staff that would result in more independent coding. Introducing a new device should not automatically be considered as \"providing a service\". Whether a device used during the clinical assessment is new to the patient or not, use clinical judgment to code based on the type and amount of assistance that is required for the pati ent to complete the activity prior to the benefit of services provided by your agency staff. CMS does not provide an exhaustive list of assistive devices that may be used when coding self- care and mobility performance. Clinical assessments may include an y device or equipment (including a stair lift) that the patient can use to allow them to safely complete the activity as independently as possible. If the only help a patient needs to complete an activity is for a helper to retrieve an assistive device or adaptive equipment that is required for safe completion of the activity, such as a cane for walking, or a tub bench for bathing, before or after the activity, then enter code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. Response- Specific Instructions for SOC/ROC Perf ormance At SOC/ROC, the self -care or mobility performance code is to be based on a functional assessment that occurs at or soon after the patient's SOC/ROC. At SOC/ROC, the self -care or mobility performance code is to reflect the patient's baseline ability to complete the activity, prior to the benefit of services provided by agency staff. o This may be achieved by having the patient attempt the activity prior to providing any instruction that could result in a more independent code, and then coding based on the type and amount of assistance that was required prior to the benefit of services provided by your agency staff. Response- Specific Instructions for SOC/ROC Discharge Goal(s) A discharge goal is coded with each SOC/ROC assessment. Agencies are required to complete a discharge goal for a minimum of one of the following self- care or mobility activities: o GG0130A2 - Eating o GG0130B2 - Oral Hygiene o GG0130C2 - Toileting Hygiene Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 131 o GG0170B2 - Sit to lying o GG0170C2 - Lying to sitting on side of bed o GG0170D2 - Sit to stand o GG0170E2 - Chair/bed -to-chair transfer o GG0170F2 - Toilet transfer o GG0170J2 - Walk 50 feet with two turns o GG0170K2 - Walk 150 feet o GG0170R2 - Wheel 50 feet with two turns o GG0170S2 - Wheel 150 feet Agencies may choose to complete more than one self -care or mobility discharge goal and should dash any remaining self -care or mobility goals where a discharge goal is not established. Agencies may report a discharge goal for all GG0130 and GG0170 activities. Licensed clinicians can est ablish a patient's discharge goal(s) at the SOC/ROC based on the patient's prior medical condition, SOC/ROC assessment, self -care and mobility status, discussions with the patient and family, professional judgment, and standards of practice, expected treat ments, patient motivation to improve, anticipated length of stay, and the patient's discharge plan. Goals should be established as part of the patient's care plan. Use agency policies, practices and clinical judgment to determine when and how discharge go als will be established and how goals and interventions will be documented on the Plan of Care. Questions related to documentation requirements may be directed to hhasurveyprotocols@cms.hhs.gov Once a discharge goal is established, there is no need to update it if circumstances change or additional information becomes available either within or after the SOC/ROC assessment timeframe. Discharge goals should be coded using the 6-point scale or using one of the four \"activity not attempted\" codes (07, 09, 10, or 88). Discharge goal(s) may be coded the same as SOC/ROC performance, higher than SOC/ROC performance, or lower than SOC/ROC performance. If an activity was not completed prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury, and is not expected to occur for the patient, even with assistance and/or an assistive device, the discharge goal would be code 09 - Not applicable. If the SOC/ROC performance of an activ ity was coded with any activity not attempted code, a discharge goal may be coded using the 6-point scale if the activity is expected to be completed at discharge. If the activity was completed prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury; was not completed at SOC/ROC due to medical conditions or safety concerns; and is not expected to be completed at discharge, the discharge goal would be code 88 - Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Response- Specific Instructions for Follo w-up and Discharge Performance Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 132 Follow- up Performance: Clinicians should code the patient's functional status based on a functional assessment that occurs within the Recertification or Other Follow -up assessment timeframe. Discharge Performance: Code the patient's discharge functional status based on a functional assessment that occurs at or close to the time of discharge. Coding Instructions When coding the patient's performance and discharge goal(s), use the six-point scale or use one of the 4 \"activity not attempted\" codes (07, 09, 10, and 88) to specify the reason why an activity was not completed. Performance Codes: Code 06, Independent, if the patient completes the activity by themself with no assis tance f rom a helper. Code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance, if the helper sets up or cleans up; patient completes activ ity. Helper assists only prior to or following the activity, but not during the activity. For example, the patient requires assistance cutting up food or opening container or requires set-up of hygiene item(s) or assist ive device(s). Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance, if the helper provides verbal cues and/or touching/steadying and/or contact guard assistance as patient completes activ ity. Assista nce may be provided throughout the act ivity or intermittently. For example, the patie nt requires ver bal cueing, coax ing, or gener al supervision for safety to complete the act ivity; or patie nt may require only contact guard or steadying assistance during the activity. o Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance, if a single helper is required to manage the oxygen tank and/or oxygen tubing and/or provide steadying assistance/contact guard, to allow the patient to complete an activity safely. o Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance, if a single helper only manages the oxygen tank or the IV pole and otherwise the patient needs no assistance to safely complete the activity. o Code 04, Supervision or touching assistance, if the patient requires only verbal cueing to complete the activity. Code 03, Partial/moderate assistance, if the helper does LESS THAN HALF the effort. Helper lifts, hold s, or supports trunk or limbs, but provides less than half the effort. For example, the patient requires minimal assista nce from a helper to support partial weigh t-bearing during sit- to-stand. Code 02, Substantial/maximal assistance, if the helpe r does MORE THAN HALF the e ffort. Helper lifts or holds trunk or limbs and provides more than half the effort. For example, the patient is only able to wash their left arm and chest and requires a helper to complete all the remaining bath. Code 01, Dependent, if the helper does ALL of the effort. Patient does none of the effort to complete the activity . Or the assistance of two or more helpers is required for the patient to complete the activity. o Code 01, Dependent, if a patient requires the assistance of two helpers to complete an activity (one to provide support to the patient and a second to manage the necessary equipment to allow the activity to be completed). o Code 01, Dependent , if two helpers are required to complete an activity, even if the second helper was there for supervision/stand-by assist and did not end up needing to provide hands on assistance. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 133 Activity Not Attempted Codes: Use of an \"activity not attempted\" code should occur only after determining that the activity is not completed, and the performance code cannot be determined based on patient/caregiver report, collaboration with other agency staff, or assessment of similar activities . Code 07, Patient refused, if the patient refused to complete the act ivity and no other Performance or \"activity not attempted\" code is applicable. Code 09, Not applicable, if the patient did not attempt to perform the activity and did not perform this activ ity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Code 10, Not attempted due to environmental limitations, if the patient did not attempt this activity due to environmental limitations. Examples include lack of equipment, and weather constraints. Code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns, if the activity was not attempted due to medical co ndition or safety concer ns, and the activity was completed prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. A Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 134 Decision Tree This decision tree may be used to assist with coding the patient's self-care and mobility performance. If helper assistance is required because the patient's performance is unsafe or of poor quality, code according to the type and amount of assistance required. Use of an \"activity not attempted\" code should occur only after determining that the activity is not completed, and the performance code cannot be determined based on patient/caregiver report, collaboration with other agency staff, or assessment of similar activities . Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 135 GG0130: Description, Coding Tips, and Examples for GG0130 Self-Care Activities The following are descriptions, coding tips and coding examples for each GG0130 Self- Care activity. GG0130A Eating Coding Tips If the patient requires as sistance (e.g., supervision or cueing) to swallow safely, code based on the type and amount of assistance required for feeding AND safe swallowing. If a patient swallows safely, exclude swallowing from consideration when coding GG0130A, Eating. If the pa tient eats finger foods using their hands, then code GG0130A, Eating based upon the type and amount of assistance required. If the patient eats finger foods with their hands independently, for example, the patient would be coded as 06, Independent. If the patient eats and drinks by mouth and relies partially on obtaining nutrition and liquids via tube feedings or parenteral nutrition, code eating based on the amount of assistance the patient requires to eat and drink by mouth. Assistance with tube feedings and parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding this activity. Code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concern , if the patient does not eat or drink by mouth and relies solely on nutrition and liquids through tube feedings or tota l parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to a new (recent-onset) medical condition. Code 09, Not applicable, if the patient does not eat or drink by mouth at the time of the assessment, and the patient did not eat or drink by mouth prior to the current illness, injury or exacerbation. Examples 1. The patient does not have any food consistency restrictions, but often needs to swallow two or three times so that the food clears their throat due to difficulty with pharyngeal peristalsis. They require verbal cues to use the compensatory strategy of extra swallows to clear the food. Coding: GG0130A, Eating would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The patient swallows all types of food consistencies and requires verbal cueing (supervision) from the helper. Code based on assistance from the helper. The coding is not based on whether the patient had restrictions related to food consistency. 2. The patient is unable to eat or drink by mouth since they had a stroke 1 week ago. They receive nutrition and fluids through a G-tube, which is administered by a helper Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 136 Coding: GG0130A, Eating would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Rationale: The patient does not eat or drink by mouth at this time due to a recent- onset medical condition (their recent-onset stroke). This item includes eating and drinking by mouth only. If eating and drinking do not occur due to a recent-onset medical condition, then the activity is coded as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns . Assistance with G -tube feedings is not considered when coding this item. 3. The patient has no difficulty swallowing and is fed all meals by a helper, because the patient has severe arm weakness and is unable to assist. Coding: GG0130A would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: GG0130A Eating would be coded 01, Dependent, because the patient does not have a swallowing problem, and the helper does all of the effort related to bringing food/liquids to the mouth. GG0130B Oral hygiene Coding Tips If the patient does not perform oral hygiene during the home visit, determine the patient's ability based on the patient's performance of similar activities during the assessment, or on patient/caregiver report or collaboration with agency staff. For a pa tient who is edentulous, code oral hygiene based on the type and amount of assistance needed from a helper to clean the patient's gums. Examples 1. During the SOC/ROC assessment, the patient states they prefer to participate in oral hygiene twice daily. On assessment, the clinician identifies that the patient's caregiver completes more than half of this activity. The patient has severe arthritis, Parkinson's disease, diabetic neuropathy, and renal failure. These conditions result in multiple impairments, inclu ding limited endurance, weak hand grasp, slow movements and tremors. The assessing clinician, using professional judgment, all available information and collaboration as allowed, determines that the patient is not expected to progress to a higher level of functioning during the episode of care. However, the clinician anticipates that they will be able to maintain their SOC/ROC performance level. The clinician discusses functional goals with the patient and they agree maintaining current function is a reasonable goal. Coding: GG0130B Oral Hygiene SOC/ROC Performance would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Discharge Goal would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 137 Rationale: Performance assessment revealed the patient's caregiver completes more than half the Oral Hygiene activity, which would be coded Code 02, substantial/maximal assistance. The patient's condition makes it unlikely that their performance of this activity will improve, but that maintenance of their current level of function is possible, so the discharge goal is coded the same as admission performance. GG0130C Toileting hygiene Coding Tips Toileting hygiene includes performing perineal hygiene and managing clothing (e.g., undergarments, incontinence briefs, pants) before and after voiding or having a bowel movement. Includes toileting hygiene and adjusting any clothing relevant to the individual patient. The toileting hygiene activity can be assessed and coded regardless of the patient's need to void or have a bowel movement at the time of the assessment. When the patient requires different levels of assistance to perform toileting hygiene after voiding vs after a bowel movement, code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the ENTIRE activity. Toileting hygiene (managing clothing and perineal cleansing) takes place before and after use of the toilet, commode, bedpan, or urinal. For some patients this may include assessing the type and amount of assistance needed to complete clothing management and hygiene tasks after episodes of incontinence. If the patient completes a bowel toileting program in bed, code the item Toileting hygiene based on the patient's need for assistance for managing clothing and perineal cleansing. If the patient has an indwelling urinary catheter and has bowel movements, code the Toileting hygiene item based on the type and amount of assistance needed by the patient when moving their bowels. This may necessarily include the need to perform perineal hygiene to the indwelling urinary catheter site after the bowel movement. If a patient has an indwelling catheter, toileting hygiene includes perineal hygiene to the indwelling catheter site, but not management of the equipment. If a patient manages an ostomy, toileting hygiene includes wiping the opening of the ostomy or colostomy bag, but not management of the equipment. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 138 Examples 1. The patient has a progressive neurological illness that affects their strength, coordination, and endurance. The patient prefers to use the bedside commode for as long as possible rather than using incontinence undergarments. The helper currently provides steadying assist ance while the patient is standing so that the patient can pull down their underwear before sitting onto the bedside commode. After voiding, the patient wipes their perineal area, then requires the helper to support their trunk while the patient pulls up t heir underwear. The assessing clinician, using professional judgment, all available information and collaboration as allowed anticipates that the patient will weaken further by discharge, and while they will still be able to use the bedside commode, they will need the helper to provide most of the effort needed to complete toileting hygiene. Coding: GG0130C, Toileting hygiene SOC/ROC Performance would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Discharge Goal would be coded 02, substantial/maximal assistanc e. Rationale: Assessment of SOC/ROC performance of toileting hygiene demonstrated that the helper provided less than half the effort for the patient's toileting hygiene. The assessing clinician expects that by discharge, the patient will need the helper to assist with more than half the effort of toileting hygiene. GG0130E Shower/bathe self Coding Tips Shower/bathe self includes the ability to wash, rinse and dry the face, upper and lower body, perineal area and feet, regardless of where the bathing takes place. Do not include washing, rinsing and drying the patient's back or hair. Shower/bathe self does not include transferring in/out of a tub/shower, or onto or off of the tub bench. Assessment of GG0130E, Shower/bathe self can take place in any location including a shower or bathtub, at a sink, or in bed (i.e., full-body sponge bath). Bathing can be assessed with the patient sitting on a tub bench. If the patient can complete bathing tasks only after a helper retrieves or sets up supplies necessary to perform the included tasks before or after the activity, code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. If the only help a patient requires is assistance before or after the activity to cover wounds or devices for water -protection during bathing, code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. If the patient cannot bathe their entire body, then code GG0130E Shower/bathe self based on the type and amount of assistance needed to complete the activity. Use clinical judgment to determine if completing a partial bath or simulating the shower/bath allows the clinician to adequately assess the patient's ability to complete the activity of shower/bathe self (GG0130E) . If the clinician determines that this observation is adequate, code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the shower/bathing activity. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 139 If the patient cannot bathe their entire body because of a medical condition (e.g. cast or a non- removable dressing), then code Shower/bathe self, based on the type and amount of assistance needed to complete the activity. Examples 1. During SOC/ROC functional assessment, the patient states they prefers to bathe the mself rather than depending on helpers or their spouse to perform this activity. The clinician assesses the patient's SOC/ROC performance for Shower/bathe self, and determines the helper performs more than half the effort. The assessing clinician, using professional judgment, available information and collaboration as allowed anticipates that by discharge the patient will require a helper for less than half of the activity Shower/bathe self. Coding: GG0130E, Shower/bathe self, SOC Performance, would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Shower/bathe self, Discharge Goal would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: At SOC/ROC assessment, the patient participates in the activity Shower/bathe self, but a helper performs more than half the activity. The assessing clinician expects the patient has the potential to improve in performance of this activity, to the extent that a helper needs to assist for less than half the activity. GG0130F, GG0130G, and GG0130H This section presents Coding Tips that are applicable for GG0130F - Upper body dressing, GG0130G - Lower body dressing, and GG0130H - Putting on/taking off footwear. Item-specific guidance and examples follow. Upper body and lower body dressing and footwear include dressing and undressing in clothing and footwear routinely worn by the patient. o The clinician will need to determine which clothes should be considered routine. It will be considered routine because the clothing is what the patient usually wears and will continue to we ar, or because the patient is making a change in clothing options to styles that are expected to become the patient's new routine clothing. If a patient modifies the clothing they wear due to a physical impairment, the modified clothing selection will be c onsidered routine if there is no reasonable expectation that the patient could return to their previous style of dressing. There is no specified timeframe at which the modified clothing style will become the routine clothing. For upper body dressing, lower body dressing, and putting on/taking off footwear, if the patient dresses and undresses themself and the only help the patient requires is for a helper to retrieve or put away the patient's clothing before or after the activity, then code 05, Setup or cle an-up assistance. If a patient requires assistance with dressing including assistance with buttons, fasteners and/or fastening a bra, code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the entire dressing activity. When donning and doffing a supportive elastic bandage, compression stockings, or an orthosis or prosthesis, count the elastic bandage/compression stocking/orthosis/prosthesis as a piece of clothing when determining the amount of assistance the patient needs to complete the dressing activity. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 140 Coding of the dressing activities should consider all dressing items relative to the patient, regardless of the timing of when each item is put on/taken off. o For example, if a patient dresses in the morning, puts on a prosthetic device later in the day, and then undresses in the evening, code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the entire dressing activity, even if portions occur in the morning, evening or throughout the day. GG0130F Upper body dressing Coding Tips Upper body dressing items to consider when coding GG0130F include but are not limited to: bra, undershirt, T-shirt, button-down shirt, pullover shirt, dresses, sweatshirt, sweater, and pajama top. If a patient requires assistance with upper body dressing including assistance with buttons and/or fastening a bra, code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the entire upper body dressing activity. The following items are considered a piece of clothing as related to tasks associated with upper body dressing or undressing: o thoracic-lumbar- sacrum -orthosis (TLSO), abdominal binder, back brace, stump sock/shrinker, upper body support device, neck support, hand or arm prosthetic/orthotic. Examples 1. The patient has right-side upper extremity weakness as a result of a stroke and has received therapy to re-learn how to dress their upper body. During the day, they require a helper to place clothing next to the bedside. The patient can then use compensatory strategies to put on their bra and top without any assistance. At night they remove their top and bra independently and put the clothes on the nightstand and the helper puts them away . Coding: GG0130F would be coded 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. Rationale: The patient dresses and undresses their upper body and requires a helper only to retrieve and put away their clothing; that is, setting-up the clothing for patient use. The description refers to the patient as \"independent\" (when removing clothes), but they need setup assistance, so they are not independent with regard to the entire activity of upper body dressing. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 141 GG0130G Lower body dressing Coding Tips Lower body dressing items to consider when coding GG0130G include but are not limited to: underwear, incontinence brief, slacks, shorts, capri pants, pajama bottoms, and skirts. The following items are considered a piece of clothing as related to tasks associated with lower body dressing or undressing: o knee brace, elastic bandage, stump sock/shrinker, above knee or below knee lower- limb prosthesis. Examples 1. The patient has severe rheumatoid arthritis and multiple fractures and sprains due to a fall. They have been issued a knee brace to be worn during the day. The patient threads their legs into their garments and pulls up and down their clothing to and from just below the hips. Only a little assistance from a helper is needed to pull up their garments over the hips. The patient requires the helper to fasten the knee brace because of grasp and fine motor weakness. Coding: GG0130G would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assist ance. Rationale: A helper provides only a little assistance when the patient is putting on their lower extremity garments and fastening the knee brace. The helper provides less than half of the effort. Assistance putting on and removing the knee brace is considered when determining the type and amount of assistance required when coding lower body dressing. GG0130H Putting on/taking off footwear Coding Tips Footwear dressing items to consider when coding GG0130H include but are not limited to: socks, shoes, boots, and running shoes. The following items are considered a piece of clothing as related to tasks associated with putting on/taking off footwear: o Footwear examples - ankle foot orthosis (AFO), elastic bandages, foot orthotic, orthopedic walking boots, compression stockings (considered footwear because of dressing don/doff over foot). If the patient wears just shoes or just socks (e.g., grip socks) that are safe for mobility, then GG0130H, Putting on/taking off footwear, may be coded. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 142 Note that while some types of clothing, wraps or supportive devices may cover both the lower leg/lower body and the foot, the patient's ability to put them on/take them off should not be considered for both GG0130G, Lower Body Dressing and GG0130H, Footwear. In order to assist in determining which activity the piece of clothing/wrap/orthotic/prosthetic should apply to, consider items that cover all or part of the foot (even if it extends up the leg, like a sock or ankle foot orthosis) as footwear . For patients with bila teral lower extremity amputations with or without use of prostheses, the activity of putting on/taking off footwear may not occur. For example, the socks and shoes may be attached to the prosthesis associated with the upper or lower leg. o If the patient performed the activity of putting on/taking off footwear immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury but the activity is not completed at SOC/ROC, code as 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. o If the patient did not perform the activity of putting on/taking off footwear immediately prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury because the patient had bilateral lower- extremity amputations and the activity of putting on/taking off footwear was not completed at SOC/ROC, code as 09, Not applicable - Not attempted and the patient did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. For patients with a single lower extremity amputation with or without use of a prosthesis, the activity of putting on/taking off footwear could apply to the intact limb or both the limb with the prosthesis and the intact limb. o If the activity of putting on/taking off footwear occurs for the intact limb only, then code based upon the type and amount of assistance needed to complete the activity for one limb. o If the activity of putting on/taking off footwear occurs for both the intact limb and the prosthetic limb then code based upon the type and amount of assistance needed to complete the activity for both limbs. Examples 1. The patient has been receiving physical and occupational therapy for right-side upper and lower body weakness following a stroke. They have made significant progress toward independence and are being discharged from home health today. The patient wears an ankle-foot orthosis that they put on their foot and ankle after they put on their socks but before they put on their shoes. They always place their AFO, socks, and shoes within easy reach of the bed. While sitting on the bed, they need to bend over to put on and take off the AFO, socks, and shoes, and they occasionally lose their sitting balance, requiring a helper to place their hands on them to maintain their balance while performing this task. Coding: GG0130H would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The patient puts on and takes off their AFO, socks, and shoes by themself; however, because of occasional loss of balance, they need a helper to provide touching assistance when they are bending ove r. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 143 GG0170: Description, Coding Tips, and Examples for GG0170 Mobility Activities The following are descriptions, coding tips and coding examples for each GG0170 Mobility activity. GG0170A, GG0170B, and GG0170C This section presents Coding Tips that are applicable for GG0170A - Roll left and right, GG0170B - Sit to lying, and GG0170C - Lying to sitting on side of bed. Item-specific guidance and examples follow. If the patient does not sleep in a bed, assess bed mobility activities using the preferred or nec essary sleeping surface used by the patient. For GG0170A, Roll left and right, GG0170B, Sit to lying, and GG0170C, Lying to sitting on side of bed clinical judgment should be used to determine what is considered a \"lying\" position for the patient. For exam ple, a clinician could determine that a patient's preferred slightly elevated resting position is \"lying\" for that patient. Code 88, Not attempted due to medical or safety concerns, if at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to lie flat due to medical conditions or restrictions, but could perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury. For example, if a clinician determines that a patient's new medical need requires that the patient sit in an upright sitting position rather than a slightly elevated position, then code GG0170A, Roll left and right as 88, Not attempted due to medical or safety concerns. Code 09, Not applicable , if at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to lie flat due to medical conditions or restrictions and could not perform the activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury. GG0170A Roll left and right Coding Tips The activity includes the patient rolling to both the left and to the right while in a lying position on their preferred or necessary sleeping surface. If the clinician determines that bed mobility cannot be assessed because of the degree to which the head of the bed must be elevated due to the patient's medical condition, code GG0170A, Roll left and right, using the appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code. If the patient does not sleep in a bed, assess the patient rolling to both the left and to the right while in a lying position, and returning to lying on the back on their preferred or necessary sleeping surface. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 144 Examples 1. At SOC, the physical therapist observes the patient turn onto their right side while their spouse prompts them to bend their left leg and roll to the right side. The spouse then prompts the patient to position their limbs to return to lying on their back and then to repeat a similar process for rolling onto their left side and then return to lying on their back. The patient completes the activity without physical assistance from a helper. The patient was moving about in bed without difficulty prior to hospitalization. The therapist expects the patient will roll left and right by themself without any assistance from a helper by discharge. Coding: GG0170A, Roll left and right, SOC Performance would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assist ance. Discharge Goal would be coded 06, Independent. Rationale: At SOC, the spouse provides verbal cues to the patient as they roll from their back to their right side and returns to lying on their back. No physical assistance is provided. After assessment and considering the patient's current condition, the therapist expects they will be independently rolling left and right at discharge. GG0170B Sit to lying Coding Tips The activity includes the ability to move from sitting on side of bed to lying flat on the bed or on their preferred or necessary sleeping surface. If the patient does not sleep in a bed, assess the patient's ability to move from sitting on side of the patient's preferred or necessary sleeping surface to lying flat on the patient's preferred or necessary sleeping surface. If the clinician determines that bed mobility cannot be assessed because of the degree to which the head of the bed must be elevated due to the patient's medical condition, code GG0170B, Sit to lying , using the appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code. Examples 1. At SOC, the patient requires assistance from two helpers to transfer from sitting at the edge of the bed to lying flat on the bed due to paralysis on their right side, obesity, and cognitive limitations. One of the helpers explains to the patient each step of the sitting to lying activity. The patient is then fully assisted by the 2 helpers to get from sitting to a lying position on the bed. The patient makes no attempt to assist when asked to perform the incre mental steps of the activity. Coding: GG0170B, Sit to lying would be coded 01, Dependent. Rationale: The assistance of two helpers is needed to complete the activity of sit to lying. If two or more helpers are required to assist the patient to complete an activity, code as 01, Dependent. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 145 2. The patient suffered multiple vertebral fractures due to a fall off a ladder. At SOC, they require assistance from a therapist to get from a sitting position to lying flat on the bed because of significant pain in their lower back. The therapist supports the patient's trunk and lifts both legs to assist them from sitting at the side of the bed to lying flat on the bed. The patient assists themself a small amount by bending both knees while transitioning into a ly ing position. Coding: GG0170B, Sit to lying would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The helper provided more than half the effort for the patient to complete the activity of sit to lying. GG0170C Lying to sitting on side of bed Coding Tips The activity includes patient transitions from lying on their back to sitting on the side of the bed and sitting upright on the bed, or alternative sleeping surface, without back support. It is not required that the patient's feet be flat on th e floor to consider the activity as being completed. Note that the reference to the patient having their feet flat on the floor has been removed from GG0170C in the OASIS -E instrument. Back support refers to an object or person providing support for the patient's back. If the clinician determines that bed mobility cannot be assessed because of the degree to which the head of the bed must be elevated due to the patient's medical condition, code GG0170A, Roll left and right, using the appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code. Examples 1. The patient is recovering from a spinal fusion. At Discharge, they roll to their right side and push themself up from the bed to get from a lying to a seated position. The family provides needed verbal cues as the patient safel y uses their hands and arms to avoid twisting as they raise themself from the bed. The patient then maneuvers to the edge of the bed, to complete the activity without hands- on assistance. Coding: GG0170C, Lying to sitting on side of bed would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The helper provides verbal cues only as the patient moves from a lying to sitting position on the side of the bed. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 146 GG0170D Sit to stand Coding Tips The activity includes the patient coming to a standing position from any sitting surface. Code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance, if the only help a patient requires to complete the sit to stand activity is for a helper to retrieve an assistive device or adaptive equipment, such as a walker or ankle foot orthosis. If a mechanical lift is used to assist in transferring a patient for a chair/bed -to-chair transfer, and even with assistance the patient is not able to complete the sit to stand activity, code GG0170D, Sit to stand with the appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code. If a sit to stand lift is used and the patient requires the assistance of two helpers to get from a sitting to standing position, code as 01, Dependent. Examples 1. The patient is being admitted to home health for pressure ulcer care. They have complete tetraplegia from an injury one year ago and have been unable to bear weight in standing since the injury. At SOC, even when fully supported, they are unable to stand, and are via Hoyer transferred from their bed into a wheelchair with assistance. Coding: GG0170D, Sit to stand, SOC Performance would be coded 09, Not applicable. Rationale: The activity was not attempted at SOC and the patient did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury (the pressure ulcer) due to the diagnosis of complete tetraplegia. GG0170E Chair/bed-to-chair transfer Coding Tips The activity reflects a transfer between (to and from) any two sitting surfaces. This could be a chair- to- chair transfer that does not include the bed. Depending on the patient's abilities, the transfer may be a stand-pivot, squat-pivot, or a slide board transfer. When possible, the transfer should be assessed in an environmental situation where taking more than a few steps would not be necessary to complete the transfer. If a mechanical lift is used to assist in transferring a patient for a chair/bed -to-chair transfer and the patient requires the assistance of two helpers code as 01, Dependent, even if the patient assists with any part of the chair/bed -to-chair transfer. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 147 When a GG function activity is not completed entirely during one clinical observation (i.e., a patient transfers bed -to-chair in the morning, and transfers chair- to-bed at night), code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the ENTIRE activity. In addition to direct observation, coding can be determined based on patient/caregiver report, collaboration with other agency staff, or assessment of similar activities. The activities of GG0170B - Sit to lying and GG0170C - Lying to sitting on side of bed are two separate activities that are not assessed as part of GG0170E - Chair/Bed to Chair Transfer. Examples 1. The patient had a stroke and uses a wheelchair for mobility. When they get out of bed at SOC, their daughter moves the wheelchair into the correct position and locks the brakes so that the patient can transfe r into the wheelchair safely. The patient transfers into the wheelchair by themself without the need for supervision or assistance during the transfer. The family reports that the patient does transfer safely from bed to wheelchair and back without the need for supervision, once the wheelchair is placed and locked. The therapist does not expect the patient's mobility status to change by discharge. Coding: GG0170E, Chair/bed- to-chair transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 05, Setup or clean- up assistance. Discharge Goal would be coded 05, Setup or clean up assistance. Rationale: A helper must provide setup assistance only. Once set up is provided, the patient transfers to and from the wheelchair safely and does not need supervision or physical assistance during the transfer activity. The therapist expects the patient will continue to need wheelchair setup assistance for this transfer at discharge. GG0170F Toilet transfer Coding Tips Toilet transfer includes the patient's ability to get on and off a toilet (with or without a raised toilet seat), or bedside commode. Toileting hygiene, clothing management, getting to and from the toilet, and transferring on and off a bedpan are not cons idered part of the toilet transfer activity. The Toilet transfer activity can be assessed and coded regardless of the patient's need to use a toilet or commode to void or have a bowel movement in conjunction with the toilet transfer assessment. Communicating the activity request (i.e., \"Can you stand up from the toilet?\") would not be considered verbal cueing. If additional prompts are required in order for the patient to safely complete the activity (\"Push down on the grab bar\", etc.), the assessing clinician may need to use clinical judgment to determine the most appropriate code, utilizing the Coding Section GG Activities Decision Tree . Code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance, if the patient requires a helper to position/set-up the bedside commode before and/or after the patient's bed to commode transfers (place at an accessible angle/location next to the bed) and the patient does not require helper assistance during toilet transfers. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 148 Code 05, Setup or clean- up assistance, if the only help a patient needs to complete the toilet transfer activity is for a helper to retrieve and place the toilet seat riser, and remove it after patient use. Code 01, Dependent, if the patient requires assistance from two or more helpers to get on and off the toilet or co mmode. Examples 1. The assessing clinician notes that the home health aide visit note (documented on the afternoon visit on the SOC date) stated that the aide needed to steady the patient with a light contact when the patient lowers their underwear and also as they transfer onto the toilet. After voiding, the patient cleanses themself. They then stand up supporting their own weight as the aide steadies them with contact guard assistance. The patient pulls up their underwear as the aide steadies them to ensure they does not lose their balance. Coding: GG0170F, Toilet transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The aide needs to provide only steadying assistance as the patient transfers on and off the toilet. Assistance with managing clothing and cleansing when toileting is coded under item GG0130C, Toileting hygiene, and is not considered when coding the toilet transfer item. 2. At SOC, the patient is on bedrest due to a new medical complication. They use a bedpan for bladder and bowel management. The assessing clinician expects the patient will return to independent use of the bathroom toilet once the current condition resolves. Coding: GG0170F, Toilet transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Discharge Goal would be coded 06 Independent. Rationale: At SOC, the patient does not transfer onto or off a toilet due to being on bedrest because of a new medical condition but was able to perform this activity prior to the current medical condition. It is expected that the patient will be independent in the activity at discharge. GG0170G Car transfer Coding Tip s The activity includes the patient's ability to transfer in and out of a car or van seat on the passenger side. Any vehicle model available may be used for the assessment of GG0170G, Car transfer. The car transfer could still be completed while accommodating medical restrictions such as long sitting, The Car transfer does not include getting to or from the vehicle, opening/closing the car door, or fastening/unfastening the seat belt. If the patient remains in a wheelchair and does not transfer in and out of a car or van seat, the activity is not considered completed and the appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code would be used. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 149 The setup and/or clean -up of an assistive device that is used for walking to and from the car, but not used for the tra nsfer in and out of the car seat, would not be considered when coding the car transfer activity. Clinicians may use clinical judgment to determine if observing a patient performing a portion of the car transfer activity (e.g., getting into the car) allows the clinician to adequately assess the patient's ability to complete the entire GG0170G, Car transfer activity (transferring in and out of a car). If the clinician determines that this observation is adequate, code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the activity. Use of an \"activity not attempted\" code should occur only after determining that the car transfer activity is not completed, and the performance code cannot be determined based on patient/caregiver report, collaboration with other agency staff, or assessment of similar activities . Example 1. The patient uses a wheelchair and ambulates for only short distances. At SOC, the patient requires the physical therapist to lift most of their weight to get from a seated position in the wheelchair to a standing position. The therapist provides trunk support when the patient takes several steps during the transfer turn. The patient lowers themself into the car seat with steadying assistance from the therapist. The patient moves their le gs into the car as the therapist lifts the weight of their legs from the ground. Coding: GG0170G, Car transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. Rationale: The therapist completed more than half the effort to transfer the patient into the car by providing significant lifting assistance from the wheelchair, trunk support when taking steps toward the car seat, steadying when lowering into the car seat and lifting support when moving legs into the car. 2. The day after being admitted to home health, the patient is evaluated by an occupational therapist on transfers in and out of the passenger side of a car. When reviewing the therapist's evaluation, the assessing clinician reads that when performing car transfers, the patient required verbal reminders for safety and contact guarding assistance from the OT. Documentation showed that the therapist opened and closed the car door. Coding: GG0170G, Car transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The therapist provides verbal cues and touching assistance only as the patient transfers in and out of the passenger seat of the car. Assistance with opening and closing the car door is not included in the definition of this item and is not considered when coding this item. GG0170I, GG0170J, GG0170K, and GG0170L This section presents Coding Tips that are applicable for GG0170I - Walk 10 feet, GG0170J - Walk 50 feet with two turns, GG0170K - Walk 150 feet, and GG0170L - Walki ng 10 feet on uneven surfaces. Item- specific guidance and examples follow. Assessmen t of the walking activities starts with the patient in a standing position. Code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the walking activity, with or without the use of assistive devices or adaptive equipment. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 150 Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a cane or leg brace) required to complete the walking activity should not automatically result in the reporting of a more dependent code. The w alking activities cannot be completed without some level of patient participation that allows patient ambulation to occur for the entire stated distance. A helper cannot complete a walking activity for a patient. During a walking activity, a patient may take a brief standing rest break. If the patient needs to sit to rest during a GG walking activity, consider the patient unable to complete the walking activity. Report an appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code when the patient requires a sitting rest break, and/or cannot complete the walking activity with the assistance of one or more helpers. Clinicians can use clinical judgment to determine how the actual patient assessment of walking is conducted. If a clinician chooses to combine the assessment of multiple walking activities, use clinical judgment to determine the type and amount of assistance needed for each individual activity. Use clinic al judgment when assessing activities that overlap or occur sequentially to determine the type and amount of assistance needed for each individual activity If the patient who participates in walking requires the assistance of 2 helpers to complete the acti vity, code 01, Dependent. If the only help a patient needs to complete the walking activity is for a helper to retrieve and place the walker and/or put it away after patient use, then enter code 05, Setup or clean -up assistance. GG0170I Walk 10 feet Coding Tips Starting from standing, the activity includes the patient's ability to walk 10 feet. Examples 1. The patient had bilateral below the knee amputations 3 years ago, and prior to this home health admission for pressure ulcer care and initiation of prostheses use, they used a wheelchair and did not walk. At SOC, the patient does not use prosthetic devices and only uses a wheelchair for mobility. The patient's care plan will include assisting with fitting and use of bilateral lower extre mity prostheses. The therapist's care plan goal is for the patient to walk distances of 30 feet with contact guard assistance within their home and then discharge to outpatient therapy. Coding: GG0170I, Walk 10 feet SOC Performance would be coded 09, Not applicable. Discharge Goal would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: When assessing the patient for GG0170I, Walk 10 feet, consider the patient's status prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury. Use code 09, Not applicable, because the patient could not Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 151 perform the activity of walking at SOC and did not perform the activity of walking prior to the most recent illness, exacerbation or injury (the pressure ulcer). The therapist expects the patient will be walking more than 10 feet with contact guard assistance by discharge. GG0170J Walk 50 feet with two turns Coding Tips Starting from standing, the activity includes the patient's ability to walk 50 feet, making two turns. The turns included in the items GG0170J (Walk 50 feet with two turns) are 90 degree turns. The turns may occur at any time during the 50-foot walk. The turns may be in the same direction (two 90- degree turns to the right or two 90 degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90 degree turn to the left and one 90 degree turn to the right). The 90-degree turn should occur at the person's ability level and can include use of an assistive device (for example, cane). Examples 1. At SOC, the patient is recovering from a recent stroke and now has difficulty walking. Even with assistance, they walk only 30 feet. The patient's care plan includes muscle strengthening and gait training. The therapist expects the patient will walk 50 feet with two turn s safely with the assistance of a caregiver for verbal cues and contact guard for steadying while turning at discharge. Coding: GG0170J, Walk 50 feet with two turns, SOC Performance would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. Discharge Goal would be 04 Supervision or touching assistance. Rationale: The patient is ambulatory but was not able to walk the entire distance because of their new medical condition (stroke). Since the patient is unable to complete the activity at SOC, but was completing the activity prior to the recent stroke, Code 88 is appropriate. Although not able to complete the activity at SOC, the therapist anticipates the patient will be able to walk 50 feet with two turns safely with the assistance of a caregiver for verbal cues and contact guarding at discharge. GG0170K Walk 150 feet Coding Tips Starting from standing, the activity includes the patient's ability to walk 150 feet. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 152 When coding GG0170K, if the patient's environment does not accommodate a walk of 150 feet without turns, but the patient demonstrates the ability to walk with or without assistance 150 feet with turns without jeopardizing the patient's safety, code using t he 6-point scale. Examples 1. The patient has recent endurance limitations due to an exacerbation of heart failure and is only walking about 30 feet before they tire, lose strength and must sit and rest. They report they were walking 150 feet or more with their cane prior to this exacerbation of their heart failure. Coding: GG0170K, Walk 150 feet would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical conditions or safety concerns. Rationale: The activity was not completed due to the patient's recent endurance limitations and current medical condition, and a helper cannot complete the walking activity for a patient. The patient was able to complete the activity prior to the recent exacerbation of their condition. GG0170L Walking 10 feet on uneven surfaces Coding Tips Starting from standing, the activity includes the patient's ability to walk 10 feet on uneven surfaces. GG0170L Walking 10 feet on uneven surfaces can be assessed inside or outside. Examples of surfaces include: uneven or sloping surfaces, turf or gravel. Use clinical judgment to determine if a surface meets this intent. Examples 1. The patient has severe joint degenerative disease and is recovering from sepsis. When walking on the uneven (gravel) driveway was attempted yesterday when they came home from the hospital, they were able to mostly walk by themself, but reports that their neighbor held their belt and helped support their weight during a few steps. Coding: GG0170L, Walking 10 feet on uneven surfaces would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: Per patient report, the patient required some weight-bearing support from a neighbor, as they walked 10 feet on uneven surfaces. The patient provided more than half the effort for walking 10 feet on uneven surfaces Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 153 GG0170M, GG0170N, and GG0170O This section presents Coding Tips that are applicable for GG0170M - 1 step (curb), GG0170N - 4 steps, and GG0170O - 12 steps. Item-specific guidance and examples follow. Completing the stair activities indicates that a patient goes up and down the stairs, by any safe means, with or without any assistive devic es (for example, railing or stair lift) and with or without some level of assistance. Getting to/from stairs is not included when coding the curb/step activities. Going up and down stairs by any safe means includes the patient walking up and down stairs on their feet or bumping/scooting up and down stairs on their buttocks. Ascending and descending stairs does not have to occur sequentially or during one session. If the assessment of going up and down stairs occurs sequentially, the patient may take a standing or seated rest break between ascending and descending the 4 steps or 12 steps. A patient who is a wheelchair user may be assessed going up and down stairs (including 1 step/curb) in a wheelchair. Code based on the type and amount of assistance the pat ient required from the helper. If the patient goes up and down steps (1, 4, or 12) by any safe means (for example, walking on their feet, in a wheelchair, or bumping/scooting on their buttocks), with or without an assistive device, and with no set-up assistance, verbal or physical assistance, code 06, Independent. If the patient requires a helper to provide total assist, code 01, Dependent (for example, a patient requires total assist from a helper to move up and down a curb in their wheelchair). If at the time of the assessment the patient is unable to complete the activity due to a physician prescribed restriction (for instance, no stair climbing for 2 weeks), but could perform this activity prior to the current illness, exacerbation or injury, code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns. GG0170M 1 step (curb) Coding Tips Assess the patient going up and down 1 step or up and down a curb. If both are assessed, and the patient's performance going up and down a curb is different than their performance going up and down one step (e.g., because the step has a railing), code GG0170M 1 step (curb) based on the activity with which the patient requires the most assistance. Examples 1. The patient had a stroke and needs to step up and down one step to enter and exit their home. At SOC, the patient's daughter is observed providing needed verbal cueing as the patient uses their quad cane to aid their balance in stepping up and back down one step. No physical assistance was requi red. Coding: GG0170M, 1 step would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 154 Rationale: The patient needs only verbal cueing to complete the activity of stepping up and down one step. GG0170N 4 steps Coding Tips Assess the patient going up and down 4 steps. Examples 1. At SOC, the patient has lower body weakness and the physical therapist provides light touching assistance when they ascend 4 steps. While descending 4 steps, the physical therapist faces the patient and descends the stairs providing trunk support, with one hand on the patient's hip and the other holding the gait belt, as the patient holds the stair railing. Coding: GG0170N, 4 steps would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Rationale: The therapist provides touching assistance as the patient ascends 4 steps. The therapist provides trunk support when they descend the 4 steps, providing less than half the effort to complete the activity. The patient requires partial/moderate assistance to go up and down 4 steps. GG0170O 12 steps Coding Tips Assess the patient going up and down 12 steps . If a patient's environment does not have 12 steps, clinical judgment may be used to determine if the combination of going up and down 4 stairs 3 times consecutively in a safe manner is an acceptable alternative to meet the intention of this activity. Examples 1. At SOC, the patient is recovering from a stroke resulting in motor issues and poor endurance. The patient's home has 12 stairs, with a railing, and they need to use these stairs to enter and exit their home. The patient's physical therapist uses a gait bel t around the patient's trunk and provides less than half of the effort as they ascend and then descend 12 stairs. Coding: GG0170O, 12 steps would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 155 Rationale: The helper provides less than half the required effort in providing the necessary support for the patient as they ascend and descend 12 stairs. 2. The patient is returning home after a hip replacement. They are restricted from stair climbing until they are seen for their follow-up MD appointment in one week. Just prior to their surgery, they climbed a flight of 12 stairs with stand -by assist of a helper. Coding: GG0170O, 12 steps would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical conditions or safety concerns. Rationale: At the SOC, the patient is unable to complete the activity of going up and down 12 steps due to a temporary physician-ordered activity restriction. Prior to the recent surgery, the patient was able to complete that activity with assistance so code 88 is ap propriate. GG0170P Picking up object Coding Tips The activity includes the patient bending/stooping from a standing position to pick up a small object, such a spoon, from the floor. Assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment may be used, for example a cane to support standing balance and/or a reacher to pick up the object. Picking up object must be assessed while the patient is in a standing position. If the patient is not able to stand, the activity did not occur and the appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code would be used. If a standing patient is unable to pick up a small object from the floor, therefore requiring the helper to pick up the object, code 01, 02, or 03, depending on whether the helper is providing all the effort, more than half of the effort, or less than half of the effort. Clinicians should use clinical judgment to apply guidance regarding a patient's degree of participation in picking up an object. Examples 1. The patient has a neurologic condition that has resulted in coordination and balance problems. At SOC, the patient reports they and their spouse worked with the OT in the SNF on picking things up from the floor. The patient demonstrates how they stoop to pick up a pencil from the floor as their spouse provides the right amount of verbal cues for safety and stands by, ready to help in case the patient loses their balance. Coding: GG0170P, Picking up object would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistanc e. Rationale: A helper is needed to provide verbal cues and stand-by assistance when the patient picks up an object due to their coordination and balance limitations. 2. The patient has recently undergone a hip replacement. At SOC, they walk with a walker without assistance. When they drop a hairbrush from their walker basket, they ask a helper to locate their long- handled reacher Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 156 and bring it to them. Using the reacher, the patient bends slightly, and safely picks up the hairbrush with the reacher, without ne ed of additional assistance or verbal cues. Coding: GG0170P, Picking up object would be coded 05, Set- up or clean -up assistance. Rationale: The helper provides set-up assistance only by retrieving the reacher and then the patient is able use the device to pick up the hairbrush safely. GG0170Q, GG0170R, GG0170RR, GG0170S, and GG0170SS This section presents guidance that is applicable for GG0170Q - Does patient use wheelchair and/or scooter?, GG0170R - Wheel 50 feet with two turns, GG0170RR - Indicate the type of wheelchair or scooter used, GG0170S - Wheel 150 feet, and GG0170SS - Indicate the type of wheelchair or scooter used. Item- specific guidance and examples follow. The intent of the wheelchair mobility items is to assess the ability of patients who use a wheelchair and/or scooter under any condition. GG0170Q Does patient use wheelchair and/or scooter? Coding Tips The intent of the wheelchair mobility items is to assess the ability of patients who use a wheelchair and/or scooter under any condition. This includes patients who are learning how to self-mobilize using a wheelchair or scooter, those who require assistance from a helper to mobilize using a wheelchair/scooter, and those who require a helper to push them in a wheelchair. Only Code 0, No, if at the time of the assessment the patient does not use a wheelchair or scooter under any condition. o Skip all remaining wheelchair questions (including related Discharge Goals for skipped wheelchair activities). Code 1, yes, if the patient uses a wheelchair and/or scooter. The responses for the gateway wheelchair item (GG0170Q1 and GG0170Q3) might not be the same on admission and discharge assessments. o For example, at SOC a patient may never have used a wheelchair before and is currently not u sing one under any condition. GG0170Q at SOC is coded 0-No. During the episode, the patient does begin instruction in wheelchair use, and at Discharge the patient is able to mobilize the manual chair for short distances. GG0170Q at Discharge is coded 1- Yes. Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 157 Examples 1. Patient does not own a wheelchair but uses the assisted living facility's wheelchair in order to access activities and locations in the facility which are too far for the patient to walk. Coding: GG0170Q - Does patient use wheelchair and/or scooter would be coded 1- Yes. Rationale: Although it is in specific and possibly infrequent situations, the patient does use a wheelchair for mobility. GG0170R, GG0170RR, GG0170S, GG0170SS Coding Tips Clinicians can use clinical judgment to determine how the actual patient assessment of wheelchair mobility is conducted. If a clinician chooses to combine the assessment of multiple wheelchair activities use clinical judgment to determine the type and amount of assistance needed for each individual activity. A helper can assist a patient to complete the wheelchair distance or make turns if required. When a patient is unable to wheel the entire distance themselves the activity can still be completed, and a p erformance code can be determined based on the type and amount of assistance required from the helper to complete the entire activity. GG0170R Wheel 50 feet with two turns, and GG0170RR Indicate the type of wheelchair or scooter used Coding Tips Assess the patient's ability to wheel 50 feet with two turns. The turns included in the item GG0170R (wheeling 50 feet with 2 turns) are 90-degree turns. The turns may be in the same direction (two 90-degree turns to the right or two 90 -degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90-degree turn to the left and one 90-degree turn to the right). The 90-degree turn should occur at the person's ability level. If at the time of assessment, the patient uses both a manual and a motorized wheelchair or scooter to complete the Wheel 50 feet with two turns activity, code the activity based on the type of wheelchair/scooter with which the patient requires the most assistance. Examples 1. At SOC, the patient is unable to bear any weight on their right leg due to a recent fracture. The nurse observes as the certified nursing assistant in the assisted living facility provides steadying assistance when Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 158 transferring the patient from the bed into the manual wheelchair. Once in the wheelchair, the patient propels themselves safely about 60 feet down the hall using their left leg and both arms and safely makes two turns without any necessary physical assistance or supervision. Coding: GG0170R, Wheel 50 feet with two turns would be coded 06, Independent. GG0170RR, Indicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used would be coded 1, Manual. Rationale: Using a manual wheelchair, the patient wheels themself more than 50 feet safely without need for supervision or physical assistance. Assistance provided with the transfer is not considered when scoring Wheel 50 feet with two turns. 2. Once seated in the man ual wheelchair, the patient wheels about 10 feet, including around one corner to the hallway. Due to shoulder pain, the patient asks a helper to push the wheelchair the additional 40 feet around another corner and into the bathroom. Coding: GG0170R, Wheel 50 feet with two turns would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. GG0170RR, Indicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used would be coded 1, Manual. Rationale: Using a manual wheelchair, the patient assists in propelling themself in a wheelchair and also needs assistance from a helper, who provides more than half of the effort to complete distance and the activity. GG0170S Wheel 150 feet, and GG0170SS Indicate the type of wheelchair or scooter used Coding Tips If at the time of assessment, the p atient uses both a manual and a motorized wheelchair or scooter to complete the Wheel 150 feet activity, code the activity based on the type of wheelchair/scooter with which the patient requires the most assistance. If the patient's environment does not accommodate wheelchair/scooter use of 150 feet without turns, but the patient demonstrates the ability to mobilize the wheelchair/scooter with or without assistance 150 feet with turns without jeopardizing the patient's safety, code using the 6- point scale. Examples 1. The patient uses a below -the-knee prosthetic limb. The patient has peripheral neuropathy and limited vision due to complications of diabetes. Via observation and patient report, the assessing clinician determines that Chapter 3 Section GG: Functional Abilities and Goals OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 159 the patient's usual performance is that a helper is needed to provide verbal cues for safety due to vision deficits, and the patient mobilizes their manual wheelchair a distance of 150 feet within their home. Coding: GG0170S, Wheel 150 feet would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. GG0170SS, Indicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used would be coded 1, Manual. Rationale: Using a manual wheelchair, the patient requires the helper to provide verbal cues for their safety as they propel themself in their wheelchair for 150 f eet. Chapter 3 Section H: Bladder and Bowel OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 160 SECTION H: BLADDER AND BOWEL Introduction The items in this section assess bowel and bladder function to identify situations that could impact patient health status or their plan of care. M1600: Has this patient been treated for a Urinary Tract Infection in the past 14 days? Item Intent Identifies treatment of urinary tract infection during the past 14 days. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver and review referral information. The \"past 14 days\" is the two-week period immediately preceding the Start/Resumption of Care date (or for Discharge, the M0090 Date Assessment Completed). This means that for purposes of counting the 14-day period, the Start of Care date is day 0 and the day immediately prior to the Start of Care date is day 1. For example, if the patient's SOC date is August 20, any treatment for a UTI occurring on or after August 6 would be considered. Coding Instructions Code 0, No, if patient has not been treated for a UTI within the past two weeks, including if the patient had symptoms of a UTI or a positive culture for which the physician did not prescribe treatment, or the treatment ended more t han 14 days ago. Code 1, Yes, when: o The patient has been prescribed an antibiotic within the past 14 days specifically for a confirmed or suspected UTI o The patient is on prophylactic treatment and develops a UTI. Code NA, if the patient is on prophylactic treatment for the prevention of UTI. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section H: Bladder and Bowel OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 161 M1610: Urinary Incontinence or Urinary Catheter Presence Item Intent Identifies presence of urinary incontinence or urinary catheterization of any type, including intermittent or indwelling. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Interview patient and/or caregiver and review referral information. The etiology (cause) of incontinence is not addressed in this item. Coding Instructions Code 0, No incontinence or catheter , if the patient has: o Anuria o An ostomy for urinary drainage (for example: an ileal conduit) o that is pouched (ileal conduit, urostomy, ureterostomy, nephrostomy), with or without a stoma Code 1, patient is incontinent , if the patient is: o Incontinent at any time, including occasionally, \"only when I sneeze,\" \"sometimes I leak a li ttle bit\" etc. o Dependent on a timed-voiding program Code, 2, patient requires a urinary catheter , when the patient: o Uses a catheter or tube for drainage, even if catheterizations are intermittent o Requires the use of a catheter for urinary drainage for any reason (for example: retention, post-surgery, incontinence) o Has a catheter inserted during the comprehensive assessment o Is both incontinent, and requires a urinary catheter Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section H: Bladder and Bowel OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 162 Coding Tips A leaking urinary drainage appliance is not incontinence. A catheter solely utilized for irrigation of the bladder or installation with an antibiotic is not reported in this item. If a catheter was discontinued during the comprehensive assessment or if a catheter is both inserted and discontinued during the comprehensive assessment, Code 0 or 1 would be appropriate, depending on whether or not the patient is continent. M1620: Bowel Incontinence Frequency Item Intent Identifies how often the patient experiences bowel incontinence. Refers to the frequency of a symptom (bowel incontinence), not to the etiology (cause) of that symptom. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview patient and/or caregiver and review referral information. Coding Instructions Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips \"On a daily basis\" means the patient experiences bowel incontinence once per day This item does not address treatment of incontinence or constipation (for example, a bowel program) Chapter 3 Section H: Bladder and Bowel OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 163 M1630: Ostomy for Bowel Elimination Item Intent Identifies whether the patient has an ostomy for bowel elimination and, if so, whether the ostomy was related to a recent inpatient stay or caused a change in medical treatment plan. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Interview patient and/or caregiver and review referral information including current supply list. Applies to any type of ostomy for bowel elimination (for example: colostomy, ileostomy). This item only addresses bowel ostomies, types of ostomies (for example: urinary ostomies, tracheostomies). If the patient has an ostomy for bowel elimination, determine whether the ostomy was related to an inpatient stay or necessitated a change in the medical or treatment regimen within the last 14 days. The \"last 14 days\" is the two -week peri od immediately preceding the Start/Resumption of Care. This means that for purposes of counting the 14-day period, the Start of Care date is day 0 and the day immediately prior to the Start of Care date is day 1. For example, if the patient's SOC date is A ugust 20, any ostomy related to an inpatient stay or requiring medical or treatment regimen change that occurred on or after August 6 would be considered. Coding Instructions Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips If an ostomy has been reversed, then the patient does not have an ostomy at the time of assessment. Chapter 3 Section I: Active Diagnoses OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 164 SECTION I: ACTIVE DIAGNOSES Introduction This section includes three items that identify active diagnoses and co- morbidities. M1021/M1023: Primary Diagnosis/Other Diagnoses Item Intent The intent of these items is to accurately report and enter ICD -10 CM codes for the patient's primary (M1021) and other (M1023) home health diagnoses and document the degree of symptom control for each diagnosis. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Chapter 3 Section I: Active Diagnoses OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 165 Response- Specific Instructions Identifying Primary (M1021) and Other (M1023) Diagnoses The assessing clinician must determine the primary and other home health diagnoses based on the assessment findings, information in the medical record including but not limited to physician/allowed practitioner orders, medication list and referral information, and input from the physician/allowed practitioner. The assessing clinician is expected to complete the patient's comprehensive assessment and understand the patient's overall medical condition and care needs before assigning diagnoses. The assessing clinician may elicit input from other agency staff that have had direct in -person contact with the patient or have had some other means of gathering information to contribute to the OASIS data collection. The primary diagnosis (M1021) and other diagnoses (M1023) may or may not relate to the patient's most recent hospital stay, but must meet the definitions of primary and other diagnoses presented in this guidance. Diagnoses may change during the course of the home health stay due to a change in the patient's health status or a change in the focus of home health care. At each required OASIS time point, the assessing clinician must assess the patient's clinical status and determine the primary and other diagnoses based on patient status and treatment plan at the time of the assessment. Only current diagnoses should be reported as primary and secondary diagnoses in M1021 and M1023. Diagnoses should be excluded if they are resolved or do not have the potential to impact the skilled services provided by the HHA. An example of a resolved condition is cholecystitis following a cholecystectomy Reporting ICD-10-CM codes for Primary (M1021) and Other (M1023) Diagnoses Adherence to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting when assigning ICD 10 CM diagnosis codes is required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It is expected that each agency will ensure that diagnoses and ICD-10- CM codes reported in OASIS meet these guidelines. Chapter 3 Section I: Active Diagnoses OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 166 CMS and the Natio nal Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provide the \"Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting.\" \"These guidelines should be used as a companion document to the official version of the ICD-10-CM as published on the NCHS website.\" The assessing clinician can enter the ICD -10-CM codes. Alternatively, a coding specialist in the agency may enter the actual numeric ICD -10-CM codes in Column 2, as long as the assessing clinician has determined the primary and other diagnoses in Column 1. Reporting the Symptom Control Rating in Column 2 Assessing degree of symptom control includes but is not limited to review of presenting signs and symptoms, type and number of medications, frequency of treatment readjustments, and frequency of contact with health care provider s. o Inquire about the degree to which each condition limits daily activities. o Assess the patient to determine if symptoms are controlled by current treatments. Clarify which diagnoses/symptoms have been poorly controlled in the recent past. Coding Instructions Column 1, Diagnoses: o Enter the description of each diagnosis o List each diagnosis for which the patient is receiving home care o Diagnoses are listed in the order that best reflects the seriousness of each condition and supports the disciplines and services provided o Complete Column 1 from top to bottom, leaving any blank entries at the bottom. o Order other diagnoses (M1023) according to the degree they impact the patient's health and need for home health care, rather than the degree of symptom control. For example, if a patient is receiving home health care for Type 2 Diabetes that is \"controlled with difficulty\" this diagnosis would be listed above a diagnosis of a fungal infection of a toenail that is being treated, even if the fungal infection is \"poorly controlled.\" Column 2, ICD -10 CM codes: o For each diagnosis in Column 1, enter its ICD-10 CM code at the highest level of specificity o No surgical or procedure codes allowed in Column 2 o ICD-10-CM sequencing requirements must be followed if multiple coding is indicated for any diagnoses. o External cause codes (ICD -10-CM codes beginning with V, W, X, or Y) may not be reported in M1021 (Primary Diagnosis) but may be reported in M1023 (Other Diagnoses). o When a Z -code is reported in Column 2, the code for the underlying condition can often be entered in Column 2, as long as it is an active on-going condition impacting home health care. See the ICD -10-CM \"Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting\" for complete instructions on code assignment and sequencing related to the use of Z-codes, and use of multiple coding for a single condition (such as manifestation/etiology pairs). Chapter 3 Section I: Active Diagnoses OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 167 M1028: Active Diagnoses - Comorbidities and Co-existing Conditions Item Intent This item identifies whether two specific diagnoses are present and active. These diagnoses influence a patient's functional outcomes or increase a patient's risk for development or worsening of pressure ulcers/injuries. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions 1. Identify diagnoses : The diseases and conditions in this item require a physician (or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other authorized licensed staff if allowable unde r state licensure laws) documented diagnosis be present at the time of assessment. o Clinical record sources for these diagnoses include, but are not limited to transfer documents, physician/allowed practitioner: progress notes, recent history and physical, discharge summary, orders, and consults. o Do not include diseases or conditions that have been resolved or do not affect the patient's current functional, cognitive, mood or behavior status; medical treatments; nurse monitoring; or risk of death at the time of assessment . o Diagnostic information, including past medical and surgical history obtained from family members and close contacts, must also be documented in the clinical record by the physician (or others as listed above) to ensure validity, follow-up, and coordination of care. o Only diagnoses confirmed and documented by the physician (or others, as listed above) should be considered when coding this item. 2. Determine whether diagnoses are active: Once a diagnosis is identified, determine whether the diagnosis is active. o If information regarding active diagnoses is learned after the end of the assessment timeframe, the OASIS item should not be revised to reflect this new information. The OASIS should reflect what was documented at the time of the assessment. Chapter 3 Section I: Active Diagnoses OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 168 If, however, it comes to light after the OASIS assessment is submitted an error occurred, where a documented active diagnosis was initially present but not indicated on the OASIS, the Home Health Agency should correct the OASIS following the agency's correction policy and M0090 would not necessarily be changed. Coding Instructions Code 1, Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), if the patient has an active diagnosis of Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD ). Code 2, Diabetes Mellitus (DM), if the patient has an active diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Code 3, None of the Above, if the patient d oes not have any of the active diagnoses listed above. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips The following tips may assist staff in determining whether a disease or condition should be coded as an active diagnosis. The physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other authorized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws) may specifically indicate that a diagnosis is active. If there is documentation in the clinical record that a patient has diabetes mellitus, select Response 2, Diabetes Mellitus (DM). If there is only documentation in the clinical record of a complication such as nephropathy or neuropathy and there is no documentation that the patient has diabetes, it should not be assumed the complication is associated with diabetes, and Response 2, Diabetes Mellitus, should not be checked. If a diabetic patient has either PAD or PVD both Response 1 and Response 2 should be checked. The physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or other authorized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws) for example, documents at the time of assessment that the patient has inadequately controlled diabetes and requires adjustment of the medication regimen. This would be sufficient documentation of an active diagnosis and would require no additional confirmation because the physician documented the diagnosis and also confirme d that the medication regimen needed to be modified. Examples 1. Active Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus A patient is prescribed insulin for diabetes mellitus. They require regular blood glucose monitoring to determine whether blood glucose goals are achieved by the current medication regimen. The physician progress note documents diabetes mellitus. Coding: M1028, Active Diagnoses, would be coded 2, Diabetes Mellitus. Rationale: This would be considered an active diagnosis because the physician progress note documents the diabetes mellitus diagnosis, and because there is ongoing medication management and glucose monitoring. Chapter 3 Section I: Active Diagnoses OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 169 2. None of the Above During the SOC/ROC assessment, a patient told Nurse J, RN that they have had diabetes for 20 years. Nurse J reviewed the transfer documents from the acute care facility and all clinical records on the patient but was unable find a documented diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus by physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant or authorized licensed staff member in their state. There is no documented diagnosis of PVD or PAD. Coding: M1028, Active Diagnoses, would be coded 3, None of the Above. Rationale: This would be considered a \"none of the above\" response because the nurse was unable to find the diagnosis of diabetes at the time of assessment, documented by a physician (or nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or other aut horized licensed staff if allowable under state licensure laws). And, there is no documented diagnosis of PVD or PAD. Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 170 SECTION J: HEALTH CONDITIONS Introduction This section includes seven items to assess risk for hospitalization, pain interfering with activities, frequency of falls and shortness of breath. M1033: Risk of Hospitalization Item Intent Identifies patient characteristics that may indicate the patient is at risk for hospitalization. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient/caregiver, conduct physical assessment, consult with the physician, and/or review the clinical record, including but not limited to health history, and referral information. History of falls ( Response 1 ) includes witnessed and report ed (unwitnessed) falls. Multiple hospitalizations ( Response 3 ) includes only acute care hospitalizations. Inpatient psychiatric and long- term care hospitals (LTCHs) are excluded. Multiple hospitalizations ( Response 3 ) defines hospitalization as the patien t being admitted for 24 hours or longer to an inpatient acute bed for reasons other than diagnostic testing. Multiple emergency department visits ( Response 4 ) includes only hospital emergency room departments (e.g., not urgent care centers or walk- in clinics). Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 171 Decline in mental, emotional, or behavioral status ( Response 5 ) refers to significant changes occurring within the past 3 months that may impact the patient's ability to remain safely in the home and increase the likelihood of hospitalization. A decline is considered a change in which the patient, family, caregiver or physician has noted a decline regardless of cause. A decline can be temporary or permanent. Physician consultation may or may not have occurred. Medications ( Response 7 ) include prescribed and over-the- counter (OTC) medications, nutritional supplements, vitamins, and homeopathic and herbal products administered by any route and as noted on the reconciled medication profile. Medications may also include total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and oxygen Other risk(s), (Response 9 ) may be selected if the assessing clinician finds characteristics other than those listed in Responses 1-8 that may indicate risk for hospitalization (for example, slower movements during sit to stand and walking). If None of the above ( Response 10) is selected, no other responses should be selected. Coding Instructions Dash is not a valid response for this item . J0510-J0530: Pain Interview Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 172 Item Intent The intent of the items in this section is to assess the effect of pain on sleep, pain interference with therapy activities, and pain interference with day -to-day activities. Item Rationale The assessment of pain is not associated with any particular approach to pain management. Since the use of opioids is associated with serious complications, an array of successful non-pharmacologic and non-opioid approaches to pain management may be considered. There are a range of pain management strategies that can be utilized, including but not limited to non- narcotic analgesic drugs, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy, supportive devices, acupuncture, biofeedback, application of heat/cold, massage, physical therapy, nerve block, stretching and strengthening exercises, chiropractic, electric stimulation, radiotherapy, and ultrasound. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Spec ific Instructions Give an introduction before starting the interview. Suggested language: \"I'd like to ask you some questions about pain. The reason I am asking these questions is to understand how pain affects your sleep and activities. This will help us to develop the best plan of care to help manage your pain.\" Directly ask the patient each item in J0510 through J0530 in the order provided. o Use other terms for pain or follow-up discussion if the patient seems unsure or hesitant. Some patients avoid use of the term \"pain\" but may report that they \"hurt.\" Patients may use other terms such as \"aching\" or \"burning\" to describe pain. If the patient is unsure about whether the pain effect or interference occurred in the 5- day time interval, prompt the patient to think about the most recent episode of pain and try to determine whether it occurred within the look-back period. Coding Instructions Code 8, Unable to answer , if the patient is unable to answer the question, does not respond (refuses) or gives a nonsensical response. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 173 J0510: Pain Effect on Sleep Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Read the question and response choices as written. No pre-determined definitions are offered to the patient. The response should be based on the patient's interpretation of frequency response options. If the patient's response does not lead to a clear answer, repeat the patient's response and then try to narrow the focus of the response. For example, if the patient responded to the question, \"Over the past 5 days, how much of the time has pain made it hard for you to sleep at night?\" by saying, \"I always have trouble sleeping,\" then the assessing clinician might reply, \"You always have trouble sleeping. Is it your pain that makes it hard for you to sleep?\" The clinician can then narrow down responses with additional follow-up questions about the frequency. Coding Instructions If SOC/ROC assessment, complete as close to the time of SOC/ROC as possible. If discharge assessment, complete as close to the time of discharge as possible. Code 0, Does not apply , if the patient responds that they did not have any pain or hurting in the past 5 days. Code 1, Rarely or not at all, if the patient responds that pain has been present and the pain rarely or not at all made it hard to sleep in the past 5 days. Code 2, Occasionally, if the patient responds that pain has occasionally made it hard to sleep in the past 5 days. Code 3, Frequently, if the patient responds that pain has frequently made it hard to sleep in the past 5 days. Code 4, Almost constantly, if the patient responds that pain has almost constantly made it hard to sleep in the past 5 days. Code 8, Unable to answer, if the patient is unable to answer the question, does not respond or gives a nonsensical response. Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 174 Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips This item should be coded based on the patient's interpretation of the provided response options for frequency. If the patient is unable to decide between 2 options, then the assessing clinician should code for the option with the higher frequency. The key difference between code 0, Does not apply and code 1, Rarely or not at all is that for code 0 , the p atient reports no pain/hurting in the past 5 days, and code 1 , the patient reports pain/hurting HAS been present in the past 5 days, but has rarely or not at all impacted sleep. If the patient reports they had pain in the past 5 days and the pain does not interfere with the patient's sleep (e.g., because the patient is using pain management strategies successfully), code 1, Rarely or not at all . Examples 1. Assessing clinician: \"Over the past 5 days, how much of the time has pain made it hard for you to slee p at night?\" Patient: \"I've had a little back pain from being in the wheelchair all day, but it's felt so much better when I go to bed. The pain hasn't kept me from sleeping at all.\" Coding: J0510 would be coded 1, Rarely or not at all. Rationale: The pati ent reports pain has been present, but no sleep problems related to pain. 2. Assessing clinician: \"Over the past 5 days, how much of the time has pain made it hard for you to sleep at night?\" Patient: \"All the time. It's been hard for me to sleep all the time. I have to ask for extra pain medicine, and I still wake up several times during the night because my back hurts so much.\" Coding: J0510 would be coded 4, Almost constantly. Rationale: The patient reports pain- related sleep problems \"all the time,\" so the most applicable response is \"Almost constantly.\" Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 175 J0520: Pain Interference with Therapy Activities Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Read the question and response choices as written. No pre-determined definitions are offered to the patient. The response should be based on the patient's interpretation of frequency response options. Confirm that the patient has been offered rehabilitation therapies during the reference timeframe. Coding Instructions If SOC/ROC assessment, complete as close to the time of SOC/ROC as possible. If discharge assessment, complete as close to the time of discharge as possible. Code 0, Does not apply , if the patient responds that they did not participate in rehabilitation therapy for reasons unrelated to pain (e.g., therapy not needed, unable to schedule) in the past 5 days. Code 1, Rarely or not at all, if the patient responds that pain has rarely or not at all limited participation in rehabilitation therapy sessions in the past 5 days. Code 2, Occasionally, if the patient responds that pain has occasionally limited participation in rehabilitation therapy sessions in the past 5 days. Code 3, Frequently , if the patient responds that pain has frequently limited participation in rehabilitation therapy sessions in the past 5 days. Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 176 Code 4, Almost constantly, if the patient responds that pain has almost constantly limited participation in rehabilita tion therapy sessions in the past 5 days. Code 8, Unable to answer, if the patient is unable to answer the question, does not respond or gives a nonsensical response. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips This item should be coded based on the patient's interpretation of the provided response options for frequency. If the patient is unable to decide between 2 options, then the assessing clinician should code for the option with the higher frequency. Rehabilitation therapies may include treatment supervised in person by a therapist or nurse or other staff, or the patient/family/caregivers carrying out a prescribed therapy program without agency staff present. Examples 1. Assessing clinician : \"Over the past 5 days, how often have you lim ited your participation in rehabilitation therapy sessions due to pain?\" Patient : \"Since the surgery a week ago, the pain has made it hard to even get out of bed. I try to push myself, but the pain frequently limits how much I can do with my therapist.\" Coding: J0520 would be coded 3, Frequently Rationale: The patient reports that pain frequently limits participation in therapies. J0530: Pain Interference with Day-to-Day Activities Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Read the question and response choices as written. No pre-determined definitions are offered to the patient. The response should be based on the patient's interpretation of frequency response options. Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 177 Coding Instructions If SOC/ROC assessment, complete as close to the time of SOC/ROC as possible. If discharge assessment, complete as close to the time of discharge as possible. Code 1, Rarely or not at all, if the patient responds that pain has rarely or not at all limited day -to-day activities (excluding rehabilitation therapy sessions) in the past 5 days . Code 2, Occasionally, if the patient responds that pain has occasionally limited day -to-day activities (excluding rehabilitation therapy sessions) in the past 5 days. Code 3, Frequently, if the patient responds that pain has frequently limited day- to-day activities (excluding rehabilitation therapy sessions) in the past 5 days. Code 4, Almost constantly, if the patient responds that pain has almost constantly limited day -to-day activities (excluding rehabilitation therapy sessions) in the past 5 days . Code 8, Unable to answer, if the patient is unable to answer the question, does not respond or gives a nonsensical response. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips This item should be coded based on the patient's interpretation of the provided response options for frequency. If the patient is unable to decide between 2 options, then the assessing clinician should code for the option with the higher frequency. Examples 1. Assessing clinician : \"Over the past 5 days, how often have you limited your day- to-day activities (excluding rehabilitation therapy sessions) because of pain?\" Patient : \"Although I have some pain in my back, I'm still able to read, eat my meals, and take walks like I usually do.\" Coding: J0530 would be coded 1, Rarely or not at all. Rationale: The patient reports that pain has not limited participation in day -to-day activities. 2. Assessing clinician : \"Over the past 5 days, how often have you limited your day- to-day activities (excluding rehabilitation therapy sessions) because of pain?\" Patient : \"The pain has made it hard to do pretty much anything. Even getting out of bed to brush my teeth has been hard. I haven't been able to talk to my family because the pain is so bad. It's just constant. I'd say it constantly limits what I do.\" Coding: J0530 would be coded 4, Almost constantly. Rationale: The patient reports that pain has constantly limited part icipation in other activities. Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 178 J1800: Any Falls Since SOC/ROC Item Intent This item is intended to code any witnessed or unwitnessed falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. Item Rationale Falls are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Fear of falling can limit an individual's activity and negatively impact quality of life. Time Points Item(s) Completed Transfer Death at home Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver, review the home health clinical record and any other relevant clinical documentation, such as incident reports or fall logs. Include all falls since the most recent SOC/ROC, regardless of where the fall occurred. Coding Instructions Code 0, No, if the patient has not had any falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. Code 1, Yes, if the patient has fallen since the most recent SOC/ROC and continue to J1900. Number of Falls since SOC/ROC . Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 179 Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips Report falls that occurred at any time during the quality episode, regardless of where the fall occurred. For example, o a fall that occurred at the doctor's office during the HH quality episode would be reported o a fall that occurred during a qualifying inpatient facility transfer (e.g., hospital or SNF) would not be reported as it did not occur within a HH quality episode Examples 1. The discharging RN reviews the clinical record and interviews the patient and caregiver, determining that a single fall occurred since t he most recent SOC/ROC. The fall is documented on a clinical note from an RN home visit in which the caregiver reported the patient slipped from their wheelchair to the floor the previous day. Coding: J1800, Any Falls since SOC/ROC, would be coded 1, Yes. Rationale : This item addresses unwitnessed as well as witnessed falls. 2. An incident report describes an event in which a patient was walking down the hall and appeared to slip on a wet spot on the floor. The patient lost their balance and bumped into the wall, but was able to grab onto the handrail and steady themself. Coding: J1800 would be coded 1, Yes. Rationale: An intercepted fall is considered a fall. An intercepted fall occurs when the patien t would have fallen if they had not caught themself or had not been intercepted by another person. 3. A patient is participating in balance training during a therapy session. The therapist is intentionally challenging the patient's balance, anticipating a los s of balance. The patient has a loss of balance to the left due to hemiplegia and the physical therapist provides steadying/contact guard assistance to allow the patient to maintain standing. Coding: J1800 would be coded 0, No. Rationale: The patient's balance was intentionally being challenged, so a loss of balance is anticipated by the physical therapist. When assistance is provided to a patient to allow them to maintain standing during an anticipated loss of balance, this is not consider ed a fall or \"intercepted fall.\" 4. A patient is ambulating with a walker and with the help of a physical therapist. The patient unexpectedly stumbles, and the therapist has to bear some of the patient's weight in order to prevent the fall. Coding: J1800 would be coded 1, Yes. Rationale: The patient unexpectedly stumbled, which was not anticipated by the therapist, and the therapist intervened to prevent a fall. An intercepted fall is considered a fall if it is not an anticipated loss Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 180 of balance resulting from a supervised therapeutic intervention where the patient's balance is being intentionally challenged during balance training. J1900: Number of Falls since SOC/ROC Item Intent This item is intended to code the number of falls a patient had since the most recent SOC/ROC and fall- related injury. Item Rationale Falls are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Fear of falling can limit an individual's activity and negatively impact quality of life. Time Points Item(s) Completed Transfer Death at Home Discharge from agency Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 181 Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver and review the home health clinical record, incident reports, and any other relevant clinical documentation such as fall logs. Include all falls since the most recent SOC/ROC, regardless of where the fall occurred. Coding Instructions Determine the number of falls that occurred since the most recent SOC/ROC and code the level of fall - related injury for each. Code each fall only once. If the patient has multiple injuries in a single fall, code the fall for the highest level of injury. Coding Instructions for J1900A, No injury Code 0, None, if the patient had no injurious fall since the most recent SOC/ROC. Code 1, One, if the patient had one non- injurious fall since the most recent SOC/ROC. Code 2, Two or more, if the patient had two or more non- injurious falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Instructions for J1900B, Injury (except major) Code 0, None, if the patient had no injurious fall (except major) since the most recent SOC/ROC. Code 1, One, if the patient had one injurious fall (except major) since the most recent SOC/ROC. Code 2, Two or more, if the patient had two or more injurious falls (except major) since the most recent SOC/ROC. Dash is a valid response for this i tem. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Instructions for J1900C, Major injury Code 0, None, if the patient had no major injurious fall since the most recent SOC/ROC. Code 1, One, if the patient had one major injurious fall since the most recent SOC/ROC. Code 2, Two or more , if the patient had two or more major injurious falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips Report falls that occurred at any time during the quality episode, regardless of where the fall occurred. For example, o a fall that occurred at the doctor's office during the HH quality episode would be reported o a fall that occurred during a qualifying inpatient facility transfer (e.g., hospital or SNF) would not be reported as it did not occur within a HH quality episode Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 182 Agencies are encouraged to correct errors as accurate information regarding fall -related injuries becomes known. For example, o Injuries can present themselves later than the time of the fall. o The agency may not learn of the level of injury until after the OASIS assessment is completed (e.g., because the patient was transported to ER and admitted to an inpat ient facility post- fall). o Errors should be corrected following the agency's correction policy. The M0090 date would not necessarily be changed. Examples 1. A nursing note states that a patient slipped out of their wheelchair onto the floor during a transfer from the bed to the wheelchair. Before being assisted back into bed, an assessment was completed that indicated no injury. Coding: J1900A, No injury, would be coded 1, One, if no other falls without injury occurred. Rationale: Slipping onto the floor is a fall. No injury was noted. 2. A nurse's note describes a patient who climbed over their bedrail and fell to the floor. On examination, they had a cut over their left eye and some swelling on their arm. The patient was sent to the emergency room, where x -rays revealed no injury and neur ological checks revealed no changes in mental status. The patient returned home within 24 hours. Coding: J1900B, Injury (except major), would be coded 1, One. Rationale: Lacerations and swelling without fracture are classified as injury (except major). 3. A patient fell, lacerated their head, and was sent to the emergency room, where a head computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a subdural hematoma. The patient received treatment and returned home after 2 days. Coding: J1900C, Major injury, would be coded 1, One. Rationale: Subdural hematoma is a major injury, and it occurred as a result of the fall. 4. Review of the patient record, incident reports and patient and caregiver report identify that two falls occurred since the most recent SOC/ROC. The falls are documented on clinical notes. The first describes an event during which the patient tripped on the bathroom rug and almost fell, but caught themself against the sink. The RN assessment identified no injury. The second describes an event during which the patient, while coming up the basement stairs with the laundry, fell against the stair and sustained a bruise and laceration on their left knee. Coding: J1900A , No injury, would be coded 1, one non- injurious fall since the most recent SOC/ROC. J1900B, Injury (except major), would be coded 1, one injurious (except major) fall since the most recent SOC/ROC. J1900C, Major injury, would be coded 0, no falls with major injury since the most recent SOC/ROC. Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 183 Rationale: The first fall is an intercepted fall, which is considered a fall. The patient sustained no injury as a result of this fall. The second fall resulted in a laceration and bruising, considered injury, but not major injury. 5. Review of the patient record, incident reports and patient and caregiver report identify that a single fall occurred since the most recent SOC/ROC. The fall is documented on an incident report, which describes an event during which the patient fell while walking from the bedroom to the bathroom and was transported to the emergency room via ambulance. Examination and testing revealed a skin tear on the patient's left hand, bruising on both knees, and a fractured left hip. Coding: J1900A, No injury, would be coded 0, no non- injurious falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. J1900B, Injury (except major), would be coded 0, no injurious (except major) falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. J1900C, Major injury, would be coded 1, one fall with major injury since the most recent SOC/ROC. Rationale: Documentation of only one fall since the most recent SOC/ROC was identified. The patient sustained multiple injuries in the fall. When multiple injuries are sustained in a single fall, code the injury of highest severity. M1400: When is the patient dyspneic or noticeably Short of Breath? Item Intent Identifies the level of exertion/activity that results in a patient's dyspnea or shortness of breath. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge Response- Specific Instructions Conduct physical assessment, including observation. Interview the patient/caregiver and/or review the health history. If the patient uses oxygen continuously, code the response based on assessment of the patient's shortness of breath while using oxygen. Chapter 3 Section J: Health Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 184 If the patient uses oxygen intermittently, code the response based on the patient's shortness of breath without the use of oxygen. o Responses are based on the patient's actual use of oxygen in the home, not on the physician's oxygen order. For a chairfast or bedbound patient, evaluate the level of exertion required to produce shortness of breath. The chairfast patient c an be assessed for level of dyspnea while performing ADLs or at rest. Coding Instructions Code 0, Patient is not short of breath, if the patient has not been short of breath on the day of assessment. Code 1, When walking more than 20 feet, climbing stairs, and/or if demanding bed- mobility activities produce dyspnea in the bedbound patient (or physically demanding transfer activities produce dyspnea in the chairfast patient). Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chap ter 3 Section K: Swallowing/Nutritional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 185 SECTION K: SWALLOWING/NUTRITIONAL STATUS Introduction This section includes three items. Height and weight to calculate body mass, nutritional approaches and assessment of the ability to eat, chew and swallow food. M1060: Height and Weight Item Intent These items support calculation of the patient's body mass index (BMI) using the patient's height and weight. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response-Specific Instructions Whenever possible, a current height and weight should be obtained by the agency as part of the SOC/ROC assessment. M1060.A Height o Measure height in accordance with the agency's policies and procedures. o Measure and record the patient's height to the nearest whole inch. o Use mathematical rounding (i.e., if height measurement is X.5 inches or greater, round height upward to the nearest whole inch. If height measurement number is X.1 to X.4 inches, round down to the nearest whole inch). For example, a height of 62.5 inches would be rounded to 63 inches, and a height of 62.4 inches would be rounded to 62 inches. o Only enter a height that has been directly measured by agency staff. Do not enter a height that is self-reported or derived from documentation from another provider setting. M1060.B Weight o Weight should be measured in accordance with the agency's policies and procedures. o Measure and record the patient's weight in pounds. o Use mathematical rounding (e.g., if weight is X.5 pounds [lbs.] or more, round weight upward to the nearest whole pound. If weight is X.1 to X.4 lbs., round down to the nearest whole pound). For example, a weight of 152.5 lbs. would be rounded to 153 lbs. and a weight of 152.4 lbs. would be rounded to 152 lbs. Chap ter 3 Section K: Swallowing/Nutritional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 186 o If agency staff weighs the patient multiple times during the assessment period, use the first weight. o Only enter a weight that has been directly measured by agency staff. Do not enter a weight that is self-reported or derived from documentation from another provider setting. Coding Instructions Dash is a valid response to this item if: o the patient falls outside the following height and/or weight parameters Height parameters <50 inches or >80 inches Weight parameters <65 lbs. or > 440lbs o If a patient's height/weight cannot be measured during the assessment timeframe, and no agency- obtained height/weight from a documented visit conducted within the previous 30-day window is available o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips When reporting height for a patient with bilateral lower extremity amputation, measure and record the patient's current height (i.e., height after bilateral amputation). If a patient cannot be weighed, for example, because of extreme pai n, immobility, or risk of pathological fractures, the use of a dash ( -) is appropriate. When there is an unsuccessful attempt to measure a patient's height or weight, at SOC/ROC, an agency-obtained height or weight from a documented home health visit conducted within the previous 30-day window may be used to complete this item. K0520: Nutritional Approaches Chapter 3 Section K: Swallowing/Nutritional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 187 Item Intent The intent of this item is to identify if any nutritional approaches listed are used by the patient. Item Rationale Nutri tional approaches such as mechanical ly altered food or those that rely on alt ernative methods (e.g., paren teral/IV or f eeding tubes) can diminish an individual 's sense of dignity and s elf-worth as well as diminish plea sure from eating. The patient's clinic al condition may potent ially benef it from the various nutritional approac hes in cluded here. 5 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. (2019). Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics definition of terms Retrieved Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 188 Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions for SOC/ROC Consult the patient, family, or caregiver and/or review the clinical record or other available documentation to determine if an y of the listed nutritional approaches apply during the time period under consideration for the SOC/ROC assessment. Coding Instructions for SOC/ROC Check all that apply during the time period under consideration for the SOC/ROC assessment. If none apply, check K0520Z, None of the above. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Response Specific Instructions for Discharge Consult the patient, family, or caretaker and/or review the clinical record or other available documentation to de termine if any of the lis ted nut ritional approa ches were received in the last 7 days (Column 4) and during the time period under consideration for the discharge assessment (Column 5). Coding Instructions for Discharge Check all nutritional approaches that were received in the last 7 days (Column 4) and during the discharge assessment timeframe (Column 5). If none apply, check K0520Z, None of the above. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. General Coding Tip If a patient will receive one of the listed nutritional approaches as a resul t of this SOC/ROC assessment (for example, IV hydration will be started at this visit or a specified subsequent visit; the physician is contacted for an enteral order, etc.), mark the applicable nutritional approach. At SOC/ROC and discharge check all of the nutritional approaches that are part of the patient's current care/treatment plan during the time period under consideration for SOC/ROC and discharge, even if not used during the time period under consideration for SOC/ROC and discharge, and whether or not it is expected to be used after discharge. Coding Tips for K0520A, Parenteral/IV feeding Parenteral/IV feeding includes parenteral or IV fluids provided for nutrition or hydration. Includes additional fluid intake specifically addressing a documented nutrition or hydration need. Excludes fluids Chap ter 3 Section K: Swallowing/Nutritional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 189 provided solely to maintain access and patency. o The following items may be included: IV fluids or hyperalimentation, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), administered continuously or intermittently. Hypodermoclysis and subcutaneous ports in hydration therapy. IV fluids can be coded in K0520A if needed to prevent dehydration if the additional fluid intake is specifically needed for nutrition and/or hydration. o The following items are NOT to be coded in K0520A: IV medications \u2014Code these when appropriate in O0110H, IV Medications. IV fluids used to reconstitute and/or dilute medications for IV administration. IV fluids administered as a routine part of an operative or diagnostic procedure or recovery room stay. IV fluids administered to flush the IV line. Parenteral/IV fluids administered in conjunction with chemotherapy or dialysis. . Coding Tips for K0520D, Therapeutic Diet Enter al feeding form ulas: o Should not be coded as a m echanical ly altered d iet. o Should only be coded as K0520D, Therapeutic Diet when t he ent eral fo rmula is altered to m anage problem atic heal th conditions, e.g. ent eral form ulas speci fic to diabet es. A nutritional supplem ent given as par t of the tre atment for a disease or c linical condition m anifesting an altered nutrition status, does not consti tute a therapeutic diet, b ut may be part of a therapeut ic diet. Therefore, supplem ents (whether taken with, in-between, or instead of m eals) are o nly coded in K0520D, Therapeutic D iet when they are b eing taken as part of a therapeutic diet to manage problem atic health condi tions (e.g. supplem ent for prote in-calorie m alnutritio n). o Food elimination diets related to food alle rgies (e.g. peanut a llergy) can be coded as a therapeut ic diet. Examples for SOC/ROC: K0520A, Parenteral/IV feeding 1. A patient is admitted with orders for an antibiotic in 100 cc of normal saline via IV for symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), fever, abnormal lab results (e.g., new pyuria, microscopic hematuria, urine culture with growth >105 colony forming units of a urinary pathogen), and documented inadequate fluid intake (i.e., output of fluids far exceeds fluid intake) with signs and symptoms of dehydration. The plan of care is updated to include a hydration intervention to ensure adequate hydration. Documentation shows IV fluids are being administered as part of the already iden tified need for additional hydration. Coding: K0520A would be checked. The IV medication would be coded at IV Medications item (O0110H). Rationale: The patient received 100 cc of IV fluid and there is supporting documentation that reflected an identified need for additional fluid intake for hydration. 2. A patient is admitted and receiving an antibiotic in 100 cc of normal saline via IV. They have a UTI, no fever, and documented adequate fluid intake. The patient is placed on an oral hydration plan to maintain adequate hydration. Chap ter 3 Section K: Swallowing/Nutritional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 190 Coding: K0520A would NOT be checked. The IV medication would be coded at IV Medications item (O0110H). Rationale: The patient received IV fluids but it is not reported in K0520A because documentation indicated that fluid intake was adequate. Oral hydration is not included in K0520. Examples for Discharge 1. The patient will be discharged today. They were receiving rehabilitation services for a stroke. The patient has longstanding Celiac disease and therefore was placed on a gluten free diet. Because of their recent stroke, they also have documented dysphagia requiring a mechanical soft diet and honey- thick liquids to prevent aspiration and will be discharged on this same diet. Coding: K0520C4 an d K0520C5 as well as K0520D4 and K0520D5 would be checked. Rationale: The patient requires both a mechanically altered diet (i.e., mechanical soft diet and honey- thick liquids) and a therapeutic diet (i.e., gluten free) for Celiac disease and they were administered in the last seven days as well as during the time period under consideration for the discharge assessment. 2. Prior to their SOC/ROC with home health, the patient had been on a chopped diet due to facial trauma. They will be discharged today after rehabilitation services for multiple fractures after a car accident. The patient has been on a regular diet during their entire home health stay and has not required any parenteral or enteral nutrition. Coding: K0520Z4 and K0520Z5 would be checked. Rationale: The patient had a regular diet their entire home health stay and did not require any nutritional modifications. M1870: Feeding or Eating Item Intent Identifies the patient's ability to feed themself, including the process of eating, chewing, and swallowing food. The intent of the item is to identify the patient's ability, not necessarily actual performance. \"Willingness\" and \"adherence\" are not the focus of this item. Time Points Item(s) Completed Chap ter 3 Section K: Swallowing/Nutritional Status OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 191 Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Observation/demonstration is the preferred method to complete this item. Other sources of information include but are not limited to patient/caregiver interview, physical assessment, nutritional assessment, physician orders, plan of care, referral information, and review of past history. When coding this item, the assessing clinician may consider available input from other agency staff who have had direct patient contact. Code this item based on the assistance needed by the patient to feed themself once th e food is placed in front of them. Assistance means human assistance by verbal cueing/reminders, supervision, and/or stand- by or hands- on assistance. Consider what the patient is able to do on the day of the assessment. If ability varies over time, ente r the response describing the patient's ability more than 50% of the time period under consideration. Do not consider preparation of food, or transport of food to the table when coding this item. \"Meal set up\", (Response 1, option a), refers to activities such as mashing a potato, cutting up meat/vegetables when served, pouring milk on cereal, opening a milk carton, adding sugar to coffee or tea, arranging the food on the plate for ease of access, etc. - all of which are special adaptions of the meal for the patient. Coding Instructions Code 5, Unable to take in nutrients orally or by tube feeding, if all nutrition is received intravenously (such as TPN) or for patients who are receiving only intravenous hydration. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips If a patient is being weaned from tube feeding, code 3 or 4 will continue to apply until the patient no longer uses the tube for nutrition, at which time, code 0, 1, or 2. This is true, even if the tube remains in place, unused for a period of time. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 192 SECTION M: SKIN CONDITIONS Introduction This section includes items that assess the presence of pressure ulcers, stasis ulcers and surgical wounds. M1306: Unhealed Pressure Ulcer/Injury at Stage 2 or Higher Item Intent Identifies the presence or absence of Unhealed Stage 2 or higher or Unstageable pressure ulcers/injuries only. Item Rationale An existing pressure ulcer/injury identifies patients at risk for further complications or skin injury. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Follow-up Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions The presence of pressure ulcers/injuries and unstageable ulcers/injuries should be determined by physical assessment and observation. Medical records, patient/caregiver report and physician input may be used for historical purposes only to identify the presence of an existing ulcer/injury or the stage of a previously healed pressure ulcer. Review the history of each pressure ulcer/injury in the clinical record. If the pressure ulcer/injury was previously classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, as long as it remains stageable, it should continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage until healed. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 193 Home health agencies may adopt the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) guidelines in their clinical practice and documentation. Howeve r, since CMS has adapted the NPIAP guidelines for OASIS purposes, the definitions do not perfectly align with each stage as described by NPIAP. When discrepancies exist between the NPIAP definitions and the OASIS scoring instructions provided in the OASIS Guidance Manual and CMS Q&As, providers should rely on the CMS OASIS instructions. Coding Instructions Code 0, No, if the only pressure ulcer/injury is one or more Stage 1 OR healed pressure ulcers/injuries (of any previous stage) AND the patient has no other pressure ulcers/injuries. Code 1, Yes, if the patient has an unhealed Stage 2, Stage 3, OR Stage 4 pressure ulcer OR if the patient has an Unstageable ulcer/injury. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips If pressure is not the primary cause of the lesion, do not report the wound as a pressure ulcer/injury. Stage 1 pressure injuries and Deep Tissue Injury (DTI), although closed (intact skin), would not be considered healed. Unstageable pressure ulcers/injuries, whether covered with a non- removable dressing or eschar or slough, would not be considered healed. Stage 2 (partial thickness) pressure ulcers heal through the process of regeneration of the epidermis across a wound surface, known as \"re- epithelialization.\" Stage 3 and 4 (full thickness) pressure ulcers heal through a process of granulation (filling of the wound with connective/scar tissue), contraction (wound margins contract and pull together), and re-epithelialization (covers with epithelial tissue from within wound bed and/or from wound margins). Once the pressure ulcer has fully granulated and the wound surface is completely covered with new epithelial Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 194 tissue, the wound is considered closed, and will continue to remodel and increase in tensile strength. For the purposes of scoring the OASIS, the wound is considered healed at this point, and should no longer be reported as an unhealed pressure ulcer. M1307: The Oldest Stage 2 Pressure Ulcer that is present at discharge Item Intent The intent of this item is to a) identify the oldest Stage 2 pressure ulcer that is present at the time of discharge and is not fully epithelialized (healed), b) assess the length of time this ulcer remained unhealed while the patient received care from the home health agency, and c) iden tify patients who develop Stage 2 pressure ulcers while under the care of the agency. Item Rationale Stage 2 pressure ulcers may worsen without proper interventions. These patients are at risk for further complications or skin injury. Time Points Item(s) Completed Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Staging of a pressure ulcer/injury should be determined by physical assessment and observation. Medical records, patient/caregiver report and physician input may be used for historical purposes only to identify the presence of an existing ulcer/injury or the stage of a previously healed pressure ulcer. Review the history of each pressure ulcer/injury in the clinical record. If the pressure ulcer/injury was previously classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, as long as it remains stageable, it should continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage until healed. Do not reverse stage pressure ulcers as a way to document healing as it does not accurately characterize what is physiologically occurring as the ulcer heals. For example, over time, even though a Stage 4 pressure ul cer has been healing and contracting such that it is less deep, wide, and long, the Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 195 tissues that were lost (muscle, fat, dermis) will never be replaced with the same type of tissue. Clinical standards require that this ulcer continue to be documented as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer until it has healed or becomes unstageable. Stage 2 (partial thickness) pressure ulcers heal through the process of regeneration of the epidermis across a wound surface called, \"re-epithelialization.\" An ulcer that is suspected of being a Stage 2, but is Unstageable due to non- removable dressing/device at the time of discharge, should not be identified as the \"oldest Stage 2 pressure ulcer\" (See M1311 for definition of Unstageable due to non-removable dressing/device). Coding Instruct ions Code 1, Was present at the most recent SOC/ROC assessment, if the oldest Stage 2 pressure ulcer that is present at discharge was already present as a Stage 2 pressure ulcer at the first skin assessment completed at the most recent SOC/ROC. Code 2, Developed since the most recent SOC/ROC assessment, if the oldest Stage 2 pressure ulcer that is present at discharge was NOT a Stage 2 pressure ulcer at the first skin assessment completed at the most recent SOC/ROC. o If Code 2 is entered, specify the date the Stage 2 pressure ulcer was first identified. Use two digits to indicate the month (for example, May is 05), single-digit dates should begin with 0, and use four digits to indicate the year (for example, May 4, 2021 would be 05/04/2021). Code 2, Developed since the most recent SOC/ROC assessment, if no pressure ulcer existed at the SOC, then a Stage 1 pressure injury developed, which progressed to a Stage 2 by discharge. Specify the date that the pressure ulcer was first identified as a Stage 2 ulcer. Code NA, No Stage 2 pressure ulcers are present at discharge, if there are no Stage 2 pressure ulcers at the time of discharge, or all previous Stage 2 pressure ulcers have healed.

M1311: Current Number of Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries at Each Stage Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 196 Item Intent This item identifies the number of pressure ulcers/injuries at each stage (Stage 2, 3, and 4) and designated as Unstageable, that are observed on assessment. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 197 At discharge, this item also identifies if each pressure ulcer/injury present on the discharge assessment was observed at the same stage at the time of the most recent SOC/ROC. Stage 1 pressure injuries and all healed pressure ulcers/injuries are not reported in this item. Item Rationale It is important to recognize and evaluate each patient's risk factors for developing skin ulcers, wounds or lesions, and to identify and evaluate all areas at risk of constant pressure. A complete assessment of skin is essential to an effective pressure ulcer/injury prevention and skin treatment program. It is imperative to determine the etiology of all wounds and lesions, as this will determine and direct the proper treatment and management of the wound. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions The presence of pressure ulcer/injuries and unstageable ulcers/injuries should be determined by physical assessment and observation. Medical records, patient/caregiver report and physician input may be used for historical purposes only to identify the presence of an existing ulcer/injury or the stage of a previously healed pressure ulcer. Review the history of each pressure ulcer/injury in the clinical record. If the pressure ulcer/injury was previously classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, as long as it remains stageable, it should continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage until healed. If the patient has been in an inpatient setting for some time, it is conceivable that the wound has already started to granulate, thus making it challenging to know the highest numerical stage of the wound. The Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 198 clinician should make every effort to contact previous providers (including patient's physician) to determine the highest numerical stage of the pressure ulcer. The general standard of practice for patients starting or resuming care is that patient assessments are completed as close to the actual time of the SOC/ROC as possible. For example, if a pressure ulcer/injury that is identified on the SOC date increases in numerical stage within the assessment time frame, the stage of the pressure ulcer/injury at the first skin assessment completed would be reported in M1311X1 at the SOC. o When the assessing clinician is unable to complete a full skin assessment at the first visit, the assessing clinician may collaborate with a second clinician who completes the first clinical skin assessment, within the assessment timeframe. Stage 2 Pressure Ulcers o Report in M1311A1 the number of Stage 2 pressure ulcers that are observed on the current day of assessment. o Examine the area adjacent to or surrounding an intact blister for evidence of tissue damage. If other conditions are ruled out and the tissue adjacent to or surrounding the blister demonstrates signs of tissue damage (e.g., color change, tenderness, bogginess or firmness, warmth or coolness), these characteristics suggest a deep tissue injury (DTI) rather than a Stage 2 pressure ulcer. o Granulation tissue, slough, and eschar are not present in Stage 2 pressure ulcers. Stage 3 Pressure Ulcers o Report in M1311B1 the number of Stage 3 pressure ulcers that are observed on the current day of assessment. o A previously closed Stage 3 pressure ulcer that is currently open again should be reported as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer, unless currently presenting at a higher stage or unstageable. Stage 4 Pressure Ulcers o Report in M1311C1 the number of Stage 4 pressure ulcers that are observed on the current day of assessment o If any bone, tendon or muscle or joint capsule (Stage 4 structures) is visible, the pressure ulcer should be reported as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer, regardless of the presence or absence of slough and/or eschar in the wound bed. o A previously closed Stage 4 pressure ulcer that is currently open again should be reported as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer, unless currently unstageable. Unstageable Ulcers/Injury: Non -removable in M1311D1 the number of pressure ulcers/injuries that on the current day of assessment are known but not stageable due to non-removable dressing/device. o Pressure ulcers/injuries that are known to be present but that are Unstageable due to a non-removable dressing/device, such as a cast that cannot be removed to assess the skin underneath, should be reported in M1311D1, Unstageable. o \"Known\" refers to when documentation is available that states a pressure ulcer/injury exists under the non-removable dressing/device. Unstageable pressure ulcers/injuries covered with a non- removable dressing would not be considered healed. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 199 Unstageable Ulcers: Slough/Eschar o Report in M1311E1 the number of pressure ulcers that on the current day of assessment are unstageable due to coverage of wound bed by slough and/or eschar. Pressure ulcers that have eschar or slough tissue present such that the anatomic depth of soft tissue damage cannot be visualized in the wound bed, should be cl assified as unstageable. If the wound bed is only partially covered by eschar or slough, and the anatomical depth of tissue damage can be visualized, numerically stage the ulcer, and do not code this as unstageable. Pressure ulcers that are covered with slough and/or eschar, and the wound bed cannot be visualized, should be coded as unstageable because the true anatomic depth of soft tissue damage (and therefore stage) cannot be determined. Only when enough slough and/or eschar is removed to expose the anatomic depth of soft tissue damage involved, can the stage of the wound be determined. o Unstageable pressure ulcers due to eschar or slough would not be considered healed. Unstageable: Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) o Report in M1311F1 the number of unstageable pressure injuries presenting as deep tissue injury. Deep tissue injury may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones. Deep Tissue Injury (DTI), although closed (intact skin), would not be considered healed. A pressure ulcer/injury pres enting with characteristics of a DTI is reported as a DTI unless full thickness tissue loss is present. For example, a DTI presenting as purple localized discoloration with tenderness caused by pressure, but without full thickness tissue loss would be coded as a DTI, even though the wound is not completely intact. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 200 Determining \"Present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" to answer M1311X2 For each pressure ulcer/injury observed and reported in items M1311A1- F1 on Discharge, determine whether that pressure ulcer/injury was observed at the same stage at the time of the most recent SOC/ROC, and did not form during this home health quality episode. If the patient has a pressure ulcer that was documented at SOC/ROC and at discharge is documented at the same stage, it wou ld be considered as \"present at the most recent SOC/ROC\", even if during the episode the original pressure ulcer healed and reopened. If the pressure ulcer/injury was unstageable at SOC/ROC, but becomes numerically stageable later, when completing the Disc harge assessment, its \"Present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" stage should be considered the stage at which it first becomes numerically stageable. If it subsequently increases in numerical stage, do not report the higher stage ulcer as being \"present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" when completing the Discharge assessment. Any numerically stageable pressure ulcer/injury observed at SOC/ROC that is unstageable due to slough and/or eschar at discharge, should be considered new, and not coded as \"present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" for M1311E2. If an unknown pressure ulcer/injury is discovered upon removal of a non-removable dressing/device, that pressure ulcer/injury should be considered new, and not be coded as \"present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" for M1311X2. If a pressure ulcer/injury that is stageable at SOC is unstageable due to a non- removable dressing/device at discharge, it would be considered \"present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" if it had not 1) increased in numerical stage, or 2) become unstageable due to slough/eschar when the non- removable dressing/device was applied. This is because even though the stage of the pressure ulcer/injury is unknown at discharge, there is no documentation or indication that it increased in numerical stage or worsened during the stay. A deep tissue injury with intact skin at SOC/ROC, that becomes stageable, is considered \"present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" at the stage at which it first becomes numerically stageable. If a DTI that was observed at SOC/ROC does not evolve to be numerically stageable, but is subsequently classified as another type of unstageable pressure ulcer/injury, it would be considered and coded as \"present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" on the discharge assessment in that unstageable pressure ulcer/injury category (M1311X1=1 and M1311X2=1). Coding Instructions At SOC/ROC, enter a response for the following rows of this item: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, and F1. o Example: At SOC, in B1, enter the number of Stage 3 pressure ulcers that are observed at the first skin assessment completed during the SOC assessment timeframe. Enter 0 if no Stage 3 pressure ulcers are observed. Dash is not a valid response for this item at the SOC/ROC time points. At Discharge, enter a response for each row of this item: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, E1, E2, F1, and F2, unless directed to skip. o Example: At Discharge, in A1 enter the number of Stage 2 pre ssure ulcers that are observed at the discharge assessment. If no Stage 2 pressure ulcers are observed, enter \"0\" in A1, and skip A2. If at least one Stage 2 pressure ulcer is observed and reported in A1, enter in A2 the number of these Stage 2 pressure ul cers that were observed at the same stage at the most recent SOC/ROC. Dash is a valid response for this item at the discharge time point. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 201 o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips Any type of flap procedure performed to surgically replace a pressure ulcer is reported as a surgical wound, until healed. It should not be reported as a pressure ulcer/injury on M1311. A pressure ulcer treated with any type of graft is no longer reported as a pressure ulcer/injury, and until healed, should be reported as a surgical wound on M1340. A pressure ulcer that has been surgically debrided remains a pressure ulcer and should not be reported as a surgical wound on M1340. Examp les - Identify \"Present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" to answer M1311 at Discharge 1. Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) with intact skin at a SOC assessment becomes numerically stageable The RN assesses a patient's skin at the SOC and identifies a DTI with intact skin on the patient's left heel. This DTI remains unchanged until the RN skin assessment 10 days later, which reveals open skin presenting as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer. The pressure ulcer does not change for the remainder of the episode. At the discharge skin ass essment, the ulcer remains a Stage 3. (In this example, there are no other pressure ulcers/injuries at the SOC assessment, during the episode or at discharge). Coding: On the discharge assessment, M1311B1, Number of Stage 3 pressure ulcers, would be coded \"1\". M1311B2, Number of these Stage 3 pressure ulcers that were present at the most recent SOC/ROC would be coded \"1\". M1311F1, Number of unstageable pressure injuries presenting as DTI, would be coded \"0\". (Skip M1311F2). Rationale: At the discharge asses sment, the patient had one Stage 3 pressure ulcer, and zero unstageable pressure injuries presenting as DTI. The Stage 3 pressure ulcer observed on the discharge skin assessment is reported \"present at the most recent SOC/ROC\" because that is the stage at which the DTI observed at the SOC assessment first became numerically stageable. 2. Deep tissue injury (DTI) with intact skin at SOC, becomes numerically stageable and increases in numerical stage by discharge The RN completes a skin assessment during the SOC visit for a patient and identifies a right hip DTI with intact skin. This DTI is first numerically stageable 10 days later as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer and increases in numerical stage five days after that, to a Stage 4 pressure ulcer. The pressure ulcer remains a Stage 4 at discharge. Coding: On the DC discharge assessment M1311C1, Number of Stage 4 pressure ulcers, would be coded \"1\". M1311C2, Number of these Stage 4 pressure ulcers that were present at the most recent SOC/ROC, would be coded \"0\". M1311F1, unstageable pressure injuries presenting as DTI, would be coded \"0\". (Skip M1311F2). Rationale: The DTI with intact skin observed on the SOC skin assessment first became numerically stageable as a Stage 3. Because the Stage 3 pressure ulcer increased in numerical stage to a Stage 4 by the discharge assessment, the Stage 4 pressure ulcer at discharge is considered new, and not coded as present at the most recent SOC/ROC. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 202 3. Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) with intact skin at SOC, becomes numerically stageable, t hen is unstageable due to slough and/or eschar at discharge The RN assesses a patient's skin during the assessment timeframe for the SOC and identifies a DTI with intact skin on the patient's right heel. This DTI first becomes numerically stageable at the third home visit, as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer. At the discharge skin assessment, this pressure ulcer is unstageable due to slough and eschar. Coding: On the discharge assessment, M1311E1, number of unstageable pressure ulcers due to slough and/or would be coded \"1\". M1311E2, number of these unstageable pressure ulcers that were present at the most recent SOC/ROC, would be coded \"0\". M1311F1, unstageable pressure injuries presenting DTI, \"0\". (Skip M1311F2). Rationa le: The DTI with intact skin observed on the SOC skin assessment first became stageable as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer. This ulcer did not remain a Stage 3, however. At the discharge skin assessment the ulcer was unstageable due to slough and eschar. Any pressure ulcer/injury that is unstageable due to slough and/or eschar at discharge, but was previously numerically stageable, is considered new, and not coded as present at the most recent SOC/ROC. M1322: Current Number of Stage 1 Pressure Injuries Item Intent Identifies the presence and number of Stage 1 pressure injuries. Item Rationale Stage 1 pressure injuries may deteriorate to more severe pressure ulcers/injuries without adequate intervention; as such, they are an important risk factor for further tissue damage. Development of a Stage 1 pressure injury is one of multiple factors that should lead providers to initiate pressure ulcer/injury prevention interventions. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 203 Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Spec ific Instructions Staging of a pressure ulcer/injury should be determined by physical assessment and observation. Medical records, patient/caregiver report and physician/allowed practitioner input may be used for historical purposes only to identify the presence of an existing ulcer/injury or the stage of a previously healed pressure ulcer. Review the history of each pressure ulcer/injury in the clinical record. If the pressure ulcer/injury was previously classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, as long as it remains stageable, it should continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage until healed. Recognize that although Stage 1 pressure injuries are closed (intact skin), they would not be considered healed. Coding Instructions Enter the number of Stage 1 pressure injuries present at the first skin assessment completed at the SOC/ROC. Dash is not a valid response for this item. M1324: Stage of Most Problematic Unhealed Pressure Ulcer/Injury that is Stageable Item Intent Identifies the stage of the most problematic unhealed stageable pressure ulcer/injury. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 204 Response- Specific Instructions Staging of a pressure ulcer/injury should be determined by physical assessment and observation. Medical records, patient/caregiver report and physician input may be used for historical purposes only to identify the presence of an existing ulcer/injury or the stage of a previously healed pressure ulcer. Review the history of each pressure ulcer/injury in the clinical record. If the pressure ulcer/injury was previously classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, as long as it remains stageable, it should continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage until healed. Coding Instructions Enter the response that most accurately describes the stage of the most problematic unhealed stageable pressure ulcer/injury. o Step 1: Determine which pressure ulcer(s)/injur(ies) are stageable or unstageable. Definitions of pressure ulcer/injury stages are in guidance for M1311, Current Number of Unhealed Pressure Ulcers/Injuries. A pressure ulcer/injury is considered unstageable if: It is covered with a non-removable dressing/device, such as a cast, that cannot be removed. The wound bed is obscured by some degree of necrotic tissue AND no bone, muscle, tendon, or joint capsule (Stage 4 structures) are visible. Note that if a Stage 4 structure is visible, the pressure ulcer is reportable as a Stage 4 even if slough or eschar is present. It presents as a deep tis sue injury o Step 2: Determine which stageable pressure ulcer/injury is the most problematic. \"Most problematic\" may be the largest, the most advanced stage, the most difficult to access for treatment, the most difficult to relieve pressure, etc., depending on the specific situation. If the patient has only one stageable pressure ulcer, then that ulcer is the most problematic. Enter \"NA\" if the patient has NO pressure ulcers or only has pressure ulcers that are unstageable at the time of the assessment. Stage 1 pressure injuries, although closed (intact skin), would not be considered healed. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips Pressure ulcers/injuries that have healed are not considered for this item. Do not reverse stage pressure ulcers as a way to document healing as it does not accurately characterize what is physiologically occurring as the ulcer heals. For example, over time, even though a Stage 4 pressure ulcer has been healing and contracting such that it is less deep, wide, and long, the tissues that were lost (muscle, fat, dermis) will never be replaced with the same type of tissue. Unless it becomes unstageable, clinical standards require that a Stage 4 pressure ulcer continue to be documented as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer until it has healed. o If a pressure ulcer is Stage 4 at SOC and is granulating at the next assessment, the ulcer remains a Stage 4 ulcer. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 205 M1330: Does this patient have a Stasis Ulcer? Item Intent Identifies patients with ulcers caused by inadequate venous circulation in the area affected (usually lower legs). This lesion is often associated with stasis dermatitis. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instr uctions Physical assessment and observation are the preferred approach to determine the presence of stasis ulcers. Patient/caregiver report, medical records including physician/allowed practitioner orders and input may be used. It is important to differentiate stasis ulcers from other types of skin lesions, and only report stasis ulcers in this item. Stasis ulcers DO NOT include arterial lesions or arterial ulcers. Once a stasis ulcer has completely epithelialized, it is considered healed and shou ld not be reported as a current stasis ulcer. Unobservable stasis ulcers are reported stasis ulcer(s) that cannot be observed because of a dressing or device, such as a cast or Unna boot that cannot be removed. Information may be obtained from the physician or patient/caregiver regarding the presence of a stasis ulcer underneath the cast or dressing. Coding Instructions Code 1, Yes, if patient has BOTH observable and unobservable stasis ulcers. Code 2, Yes, if the patient has observable stasis ulcers ONLY. Code 3, Yes, if the patient has unobservable stasis ulcers ONLY. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 206 M1332: Current Number of Stasis Ulcer(s) that are Observable Item Intent Identifies the number of visible (observable) stasis ulcers. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Physical assessment and observation are the preferred approach to determine the presence of stasis ulcers. Patient/caregiver report, medical records including physician/allowed practitioner orders and input may be used. All stasis ulcers except those that are covered by a non -removable dressing/device, such as a cast or Unna boot, are considered observable. Dash is not a valid response for this item.

Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 207 Response- Specific Instructions Physical assessment and observation are the preferred approach to determine the presence of stasis ulcers. Patient/caregiver report, medical records, including physician/allowed practitioner orders and input may be used. Determine which stasis ulcers are observable. Include all stasis ulcers that are not covered with a non - removable dressing/device, such as a cast or Unna boot. If the patient has only one observable stasis ulcer, that ulcer is the most problematic. \"Most problematic\" is determined by the clinician's professional evaluation of the individual's overall wound status, and may be based on factors including, but not limited to: o Healing status, such as an ulcer that is infected or resistant to treatment o Size (may be the largest ulcer) o Location (may be difficult to access for treatment) Once a stasis ulcer has completely epithelialized and is without signs/symptoms of infection, it is considered healed and should not be reported as a current stasis ulcer. Coding Instructions Code 1, Fully Granulating, when the stasis ulcer wound bed: o is filled with granulation tissue to the level of the surrounding skin or new epithelium; o has no dead space; o has no avascular tissue; o has no signs or symptoms of infection; and, o has open wound edges. Code 2, Early/Partial Granulation, when: o 25% of the wound bed is covered with granulation tissue; o there is minimal avascular tissue (that is, <25% of the wound bed is covered with avascular tissue); o may have dead space; o has no signs or symptoms of infection; and, o has open wound edges. Code 3, Not Healing, when: o 25% of the wound bed is avascular tissue - AND/OR o signs/symptoms of infection are present - AND/OR o the wound bed is clean but non-granulating - AND/OR o the wound edges are closed/hyperkeratotic - AND/OR o there is persistent failure to improve despite appropriate comprehensive wound management. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 208 M1340: Does this patient have a Surgical Wound? Item Intent Identifies the presence of a wound resulting from a surgical procedure. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Physical assessment and observation are the preferred approach to determine the presence of surgical wounds. Patient/caregiver report, medical records, including physician/allowed practitioner orders and input may be used. The agency may use any skin assessment conducted during the assessment timeframe to code M1340 . For the purpose of this OASIS item, a surgical site closed primarily (with sutures, staples, or a chemical bonding agent) is generally described in documentation as a surgical wound until re- epithelialization has been present for approximately 30 days, unless it dehisces or presents signs of infection. After 30 days, it is generally described as a scar and should not be included in this item. Old surgical wounds that have resulted in scar or keloid formation are not considered current surgical wounds and should not be included in this item. An incision line is considered a surgical wound. The staple or suture sites are not considered surgical wounds. Coding Instructions Code 1, Yes, patient has at least one observable surgical wound, if the patient has at least one observable surgical wound o If the patient has both an observable surgical wound, and a known but not observable surgical wound, Code 1, Yes. Code 2, Surgical wound known but not observable if the only surgical wound is not observable. A surgical wound is considered not observable when it is covered by a dressing/device, such as a cast, which is not to be removed per physician order. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 209 Coding Tips If a pressure ulcer is surgically closed with a flap or graft it is no longer reported as a pressure ulcer. It should be reported as a surgical wound until healed. If the flap or graft fails, it should continue to be considered a surgical wound until healed. A bowel ostomy is excluded as a surgical wound, unless a \"take-down\" procedure of a previous bowel ostomy is performed, in which case the surgical take-down produces a surgical wound. A bowel ostomy being allowed to close on its own is excluded as a surgical wound. All other ostomies are excluded from consideration under this item and should not be counted as surgical wounds. o There are many types of \"ostomies,\" all of which involve a surgically formed opening from outside the body to an internal organ or cavity. Examples include cystostomy, urostomy, thoracostomy, tracheostomy, gastrostomy, etc. Other examples of surgical wounds include, but are not limited to: o Orthopedic pin sites, o Central line sites (centrally inserted venous catheters), o Wounds with drains, o Medi -port sites and other implanted infusion devices, or o Venous access devices A PICC line (peripherally inserted venous catheter), either tunneled or non-tunneled, is NOT a surgical wound, when it is peripherally inserted. Cataract surgery of the eye, surgery to the mucosal membranes, or a gynecological surgical procedure via a vaginal approach do NOT create a surgical wound for the purpose of this item. M1342: Status of Most Problematic Surgical Wound that is Observable Item Intent Identifies the degree of healing present in the most problematic, observable surgical wound. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 210 Response- Specific Instructions Physical assessment and observation are the preferred approach to determine the presence of surgical wounds. Patient/caregiver report, medical records, including physician/allowed practitioner orders and input may be used. Determine which surgical wounds (as defined in M1340 guidance) are observable. Identify the most problematic observable surgical wound. If the patient has only one observable surgical wound, that wound is the most problematic. \"Most problematic\" is determined by the clinician's professional evaluation of the individual's overall wound status, and may be based on factors including, but not limited to: o Healing status, such as a surgical wound that is infected or resistant to treatment o Size (may be the largest surgical wound) o Location (may be difficult to access for treatment) Surgical Wound Assessment The clinician mus t first assess if the wound is healing entirely by primary intention (well-approximated with no dehiscence), or if there is a portion healing by secondary intention, (due to dehiscence, interruption of the incision, or intentional secondary healing). For surgical wounds healing by primary intention, observe if the incision line has re- epithelialized. Surgical wounds healing by primary intention (approximated incisions) do not granulate; therefore, the only appropriate responses are Response 0 - \"Newly epit helialized\" or Response 3 - \"Not healing\" o A surgical incision is not automatically coded Response 3 - \"Not healing\" solely due to the presence of staples. For a surgical wound healing by primary intention, if there is not full re-epithelialization, such as in the case of a scab adhering to underlying tissue, the correct response is Response 3 - \"Not healing\" Surgical wounds with incisional separation heal by secondary intention. Surgical incisions healing by secondary intention do granulate; therefore, in addition to meeting the definitio n for 0 - Newly epithelialized or 3 - Not healing, these secondary intention wounds may also fit the definitions for Response 1 - \"Fully granulating\" or Response 2 - \"Early, partial granulation\" if appropriate. If complete epidermal resurfacing of a surgical wound has occurred, the correct response is Response 0 - \"Newly epithelialized\" until approximately 30 days have passed without complication, at which time it is no longer a reportable surgical wound. Chapter 3 Section M: Skin Conditions OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 211 Coding Instructions Code 0, Newly epithelialized, when: o the wound bed is completely covered with new epithelium; no exudate; no avascular tissue (eschar and/or slough); no signs or symptoms of infection. o the incision site of an implanted venous access device or infusion device is healed and without signs and symptoms of infection. Code 1, Fully granulating, when: o the wound bed is filled with granulation tissue to the level of the surrounding skin and o has no dead space, o has no avascular tissue; o has no signs or symptoms of infection; o has open wound edges. Code 2, Early/partial granulation, when: o 25% of the wound bed is covered with granulation tissue; o < 25% of the wound bed is covered with avascular tissue, o may have dead space; and o wound bed has no signs or symptoms of infection; o wound has open e dges. Code 3, Not healing, when: o The wound bed has 25% avascular tissue - AND/OR o signs/symptoms of infection - AND/OR o the wound bed is clean but non-granulating - AND/OR o wound edges are closed/hyperkeratotic - AND/OR o persistent failure to improve despite appropriate comprehensive wound management.

Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 212 SECTION N: MEDICATIONS Introduction The intent of the items in this section is to record whether: the patient is taking any medications in high-risk drug classes, there is an indication noted and the patient/caregiver have been educated about the high -risk medications a drug regimen review was conducted the patient can manage oral and injectable medications N0415: High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication Item Intent This item identifies if the patient is taking any prescribed medications in the specified drug classes and whether the indication was noted for all medications in the drug class. Item Rationale Patients who take medications in these high- risk drug classes are at risk for side effects that can adversely affect health, safety, and quality of life. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 213 Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Data sources/resources include medical records received from facilities where the patient received health care, the patient's most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, medication lists/records , clinical progress notes, and other resources as available. o Discussions (including with the acute care hospital, other staff and clinicians, the patient, and the patient's family/significant other) may supplement and/or clarify the information gleaned from the patient's medical records. Determine whether the patient is taking any prescribed medications in any of the drug classes (Column 1). Coding Instructions If Column 1 is checked (patient is taking medication in the drug class), review patient documentation to determine if there is a documented patient -specific indication noted for all medications in the drug class (Column 2). Code medications according to the medication's therapeutic category and/or pharmacological classification, regardless of why the patient is taking it. Code a medication that is part of a patient's current drug regimen, even if it was not taken on the day of assessment. At discharge, N0415 identifies medications included in the patient's prescribed drug regimen at discharge, even if the medication was not taken on the day of assessment, and whether or not it is expected to be taken after discharge. Do not code antiplatelet medications such as aspirin/extended release, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel as N0415E, Anticoagulant. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 214 Anticoagulants such as Target Specific Oral Anticoagulants (TSOACs), which may or may not require laboratory monitoring, should be coded in N0415E, Anticoagulant. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips Include any of these medications used by any route (e.g., PO, IM, transdermal, or IV) in any setting (e.g., at home, in a hospital emergency room, at physician office or clinic) while a patient of the home health agency. Medications that have more than one therapeutic category and/or pharmacological classification should be coded in all categories/classifications assigned to the medicati on, regardless of how it is being used. For example, prochlorperazine is dually classified as an antipsychotic and an antiemetic. Therefore, in this section, it would be coded as an antipsychotic, regardless of how it is used. Count long- acting medications , such as fluphenazine decanoate or haloperidol decanoate, that are given every few weeks or monthly only if they are part of the current drug regimen at the time of assessment. Include newly prescribed medications that are part of the current drug regimen, even if the medication is not yet in the home and/or the first dose has not been taken. A transdermal patch is designed to release medication over a period of time (typically 3-5 days); therefore, transdermal patches would be considered long- acting medi cations for the purpose of coding the OASIS and are included as long as it is part of the patient's current drug regimen. Combination medications should be coded in all categories/pharmacologic classes that constitute the combination. Herbal and alternative medicine products are considered to be dietary supplements by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, they should not be counted as medications (e.g., melatonin, chamomile, valerian root) for N0415. CMS does not specify a source for identifying the therapeutic category and/or pharmacological classification. Examples 1. The documentation for a patient reflects that (at SOC) they are taking edoxaban and glipizide. The documentation indicates the patient has type 2 diabetes and is taking the glipizide to control high blood sugar. There is no indication documented for the edoxaban. Coding: Medications in N0415, would be coded as follows: Column 1 (is taking) would be checked for E. Anticoagulant and J. Hypoglycemic. Column 2 (Indication noted) would be checked only for J. Hypoglycemic. Rationale: Column 2 would not be checked for E. Anticoagulant because there was no indication documented for the edoxaban. 2. At discharge, a patient's documentation indicates they are taking oxycodone for pain. Tramadol is also listed but there is no indication documented for the Tramadol. Coding: Medications in N0415, would be coded as follows: Column 1 (is taking) would be checked for H. Opioid. Column 2 (Indication noted) would not be checked for H. Opioid. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 215 Rationale: Column 1, H. Opioid is checked because the patient is taking oxycodone and tramadol, both medications within that class. However, all medications in the class need the indication to be documented to check Column 2. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 216 M2001: Drug Regimen Review Item Intent Identifies if a drug regimen review was conducted, and whether any potential or actual clinically significant medication issues were found . Item Rationale Potential and actual patient medication adverse consequences and errors are prevalent among post- acute care (PAC) settings and often occur during transitions in care. Medication errors can lead to medication -related adverse reactions (adverse consequences related to medications may result in serious harm or death), emergency department visits, and re- hospitalizations, and affect the patient's health, safety and quality of life. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Spec ific Instructions Complete a drug regimen review as close to the actual time of SOC/ROC as possible. The drug regimen review includes all medications, prescribed and over the counter (OTC) including nutritional supplements, vitamins and homeopathic and herbal products, administered by any route (for example, oral, topical, sublingual and by infusion). The drug regimen review also includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and oxygen. Potential or actual clinically significant medication issues may include, but are not limited to, the following: o adverse reactions to medications (such as a rash) o ineffective d rug therapy (such as analgesic that does not reduce pain) o side effects (such as potential bleeding from an anticoagulant) o drug interactions (such as serious drug-drug, drug-food and drug- disease interactions) Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 217 o duplicate therapy (such as generic name and brand name equivalent drugs are both prescribed) o omissions (such as missing drugs from a prescribed regimen) o dosage errors (either too high or too low) o nonadherence (purposeful or accidental) Any of the circumstances listed above must reach a level of clinical significance that in the clinician's professional judgment warrants notification of the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) for orders or recommendations by midnight of the next calendar day, at the latest. Any circumstance that does n ot require this immediate attention is not considered a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue for the purpose of the drug regimen review items. Coding Instructions Code 0, No - No issues found during review, if a complete drug regimen review was conducted upon SOC/ROC and based on the assessing clinician's professional judgement, no potential or actual clinically significant issues were identified. o Examples may include, but not limited to: Patient's inpatient facility discharge medication list matches medications patient has on hand. Patient has a plan for taking medications safely at the right time. Patient is not showing signs/symptoms that could be adverse reactions caused by medications. The diagnoses/conditions for which the patient is taking the medications appear adequately controlled Code 1, Yes - Issues found during review , if a complete drug regimen review is conducted upon SOC/ROC and based on the assessing clinician's professional judgment, potential or actual clinically significant medication issues are identified. o Examples may include, but are not limited to: Patient's list of medications from the inpatient facility discharge instructions DO NOT match the medications the patient shows the clinician at the SOC/ROC assessment visit. Assessment shows that diagnoses/symptoms for which the patient is taking medications are NOT adequately controlled. Patient seems confused about when/how to take medications indicating a high risk for medication errors. Patient has not obtained medications or indicates that they will not take prescribed medications because of f inancial, access, cultural, or other issues with medications. Patient has signs/symptoms that could be adverse reactions from medications. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 218 Patient takes multiple non -prescribed medications (OTCs, herbals) that could interact with prescribed medications. Patient has a complex medication plan with medications prescribed by multiple physicians and/or obtained from multiple pharmacies so that the risk of drug interactions is high. Code 9, NA- Patient is not taking any medications, if a drug regimen review was conducted at the time of the patient's SOC/ROC and, per data sources/resources reviewed, there were no medications prescribed for the patient and the patient was not taking any medications, by any route, at the time of the assessment. Dash is a valid response for this item; however, o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. o If elements of the drug regimen review were skipped, (for example drug- to-drug interactions were not completed), a dash (-) should be reported, indicating the drug regimen review was not completed. Coding Tips The drug regimen review is part of the comprehensive patient assessment. The comprehensive patient assessment is the responsibility of and must ultimately be completed by one clinician, but collaboration is allowed. Agency policy and practice will determine this process and how it is documented. o For example, for this drug regimen review item, collaboration in which the assessing clinician evaluates patient status (for example, presence of potential ineffective drug therapy or patient nonadherence), and another clinician (in the office) assists with review of the medication list (for example, possible duplicate drug therapy or omissions) is allowed. If portions of the drug regimen review (for example, identification of potential drug-drug interactions or potential dosage errors) are completed by agency staff other than the clinician responsible for completing the SOC/ROC OASIS, information on drug regimen review findings must be communicated to the assessing clinician responsible for the SOC/ROC OASIS assessment so that the appropriate response for M2001 may be entered. o The M0090 Date Assessment Completed, is the last date that information used to complete the comprehensive assessm ent and determine OASIS coding was gathered by the assessing clinician and documentation of the specific information/responses was completed. Examples 1. No issues identified During the comprehensive assessment visit, the PT reviews all the patient's medications and identifies no problems except that the patient's newly prescribed pain medication is not in the home. The patient's child states they were only going to pick it up from the pharmacy if \"the pain got bad enough.\" The PT reviews the physician's instructions for the new medication with the patient and their child; they both agree the medication should be on hand, and to follow physician's instructions for administration. Prior to the PT leaving the home, the child went to the drugstore and returned with the medication. Coding: M2001 would be coded 0, No - No issues found during review. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 219 Rationale: Because the issue, in the PT's professional judgment, did not require physician (or physician- designee) contact by midnight of the next calendar day, at the latest to resolve, it does not meet the criteria for a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue. 2. Drug regimen review (DRR) not complete; use of the dash During the SOC comprehensive assessment, the nurse completes all elements of the DRR except for checking for drug -drug interactions. Coding: M2001, enter a dash, \"-\" Rationale: When any element is not assessed, the DRR is considered incomplete. M2003: Medication Follow-up Item Intent Identifies if potential or actual clinically significant medication issues identified through the drug regimen review were communicated to the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) and to the extent possible, prescribed/recommended actions were completed by midnight of the next calendar day following their identification. Item Rationale Integral to the process of safe medication administration practice is timely communication with physician/ allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) when a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue has been identified. Completion of physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) prescribed/recommended actions in response to identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issue s by midnight of the next calendar day at the latest reduces patient harm. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 220 Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Review the clinical record, communication notes, plan of care and medication list. Determine whether the following criteria were met for all potential and actual clinically significant medication issues that were identified during the SOC/ROC drug regimen review; o Two-way communication between the agency and the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) was completed by midnight of the next calendar day; AND o All physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) prescribed/recommended actions were completed to the extent possible by midnight of the next calendar day. For each potential or actual clinically significant medication issue identified during the SOC/ROC comprehensive assessment, identify if the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) was contacted, and prescribed/recommended actions were complet ed, to the extent possible, by midnight of the next calendar day (at the latest). o Examples of by midnight of the next calendar day : A clinically significant medication issue is identified at 10:00 AM on F ebruary 12th and physician (or physician- designee) prescribed/recommended action is completed on or before 11:59 PM on February 13th. A clinically significant medication issue is identified at 10:00 PM on February 12th physician (or physician- designee) prescribed/reco mmended action is completed on or before 11:59 PM on February 13th. Coding Instructions Code 0, No , if all identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issues were not communicated to the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician designee), with prescribed/recommended actions completed to the extent possible by midnight of the ne xt calendar day. o Examples: Clinician did not communicate all identified clinically significant medication issues to the phys ician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) until after midnight of the next calendar day. Clinician communicated all identified clinically significant medication issues to the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) by midnight of the next calendar day, but the clinician did not receive a response from the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) to communicate prescribed/ recommended actions until after midnight of the next calendar day. Clinician did not complete all physician/allowed practitioner (or physician -designee) prescribed/recommended actions for all identified clinically significant me dication issues until after midnight of the next calendar day (even if all but one medication issue was addressed before midnight of the next calendar day). Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 221 Code 1, Yes, if the two -way communication AND completion of the prescribed/recommended actions to the extent possible occurred by midnight of the next calendar day after the potential clinically significant medication issue was identified. o Examples: Clinician communicated all identified clinically significant medication issues to the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee), and all physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) prescribed/recommended actions for all identified medication issues were completed by midnight of the next calendar day. Clinician contacted the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) regarding all identified medication issues; and the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) communicated to the clinician that no actions wer e necessary regarding the reported issues. All communications took place before midnight of the next calendar day. Dash is a valid response for this item; however, o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Coding Tips If the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) recommends an action that will take longer than the allowed time to complete, then Code 1, Yes should be entered as long as by midnight of the next calendar day the agency has taken whatever actions are possible to comply with the recommended action. o Example of a physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) recommended action that would take longer than midnight of the next calendar day to complete : Physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) writes an order instructing the clinician to monitor the medication issue over the next three days and call if the problem persists. o Examples of by midnight of the next calendar day: A clinically sig nificant medication issue is identified at 10:00am on Sept The phys ician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) -prescribed/ -recommended action is completed on or before 11:59pm on Sept 13. A clinically significant medication issue is identified at 11:00pm on Sept 12. The physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) -prescribed/ -recommended action is completed on or before 11:59pm on Sept 13. Examples 1. Clinically significant medication issue identified, with follow- up During the SOC comprehensive assessment visit, the RN completes a drug regimen review and identifies that the patient is taking two antihypertensives; one which was newly prescribed during their recent hospital stay, and another that they were taking prior to hospitalization. During the home visit, the RN contacts the physician's office, and leaves a message with office staff providing notification of the potential duplicative drug therapy and a request for clarification. The next day, the RN returns to the home to complete the comprehensive assessment and again contacts the physician from the patient's home. The physician's office nurse reports to the agency and patient that the physician would like the patient to continue with only the newly prescribed antihypertensive and discontinue the previous medication. Coding: M2001, Drug Regimen Review, would be coded 1, Yes, Issues found during review. M2003, Medication Follow-up, would be coded 1, Yes. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 222 Rationale: Because the issue identified was determined by th e clinician to be clinically significant, requiring physician contact by midnight of the next calendar day, it meets the criteria for a potential clinically significant medication issue (M2001). As the clinically significant issue was communicated to the p hysician and the prescribed/recommended action was completed by midnight of the next calendar day, M2003 would be coded 1 - Yes. M2005: Medication Intervention Item Intent Identifies if potential or actual clinically significant medication issues identified at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC were communicated to the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) and to the extent possible, prescribed/recommended actions were completed by midnight of the next calendar day following their identification. Item Rationale Potential or actual clinically significant medication issues can occur throughout the patient's home health stay. Time Points Item(s) Completed Transfer Death at Home Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions To complete M2005, the assessing clinician (alone or in collaboration with other agency staff) reviews the patient's clinical record back to and including the most recent SOC/ROC, to determine if for each clinically significant medication issue identified, communication occurred and, to the extent possible, physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) prescribed or recommended actions were completed by midnight of the next calendar day. Potential or actual clinically significant medication issues may include, but are not limited to, the following: o adverse reactions to medications (such as a rash) o ineffective drug therapy (such as analgesic that does not reduce pain) o side effects (such as potential bleeding from an anticoagulant) o drug interactions (such as serious drug-drug, drug-food and drug- disease interactions) Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 223 o duplicate therapy (such as generic name and brand name equivalent drugs are both prescribed) o omissions (such as missing drugs from a prescri bed regimen) o dosage errors (either too high or too low) o nonadherence (purposeful or accidental) Coding Instructions Code 0, No, if all clinically significant medication issues identified at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC were not communicated to the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) and/or all prescribed/recommended actions were not completed, to the extent possible, by midnight of the next calendar day. o Examples: At the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC, the clinician(s) did not communicate all identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issues to the physician until after midnight of the next calendar day. At the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC, the clinician(s) communicated to the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) all identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issues, but the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) did not respond until after midnight of the next calendar day. At the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC, the clinician(s) did not complete all physician/allowed practitioner (or physician -designee) prescribed/recommended actions to the extent possible for al l identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issues by midnight of the next calendar day. Code 1, Yes, if all clinically significant medication issues identified at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC were communi cated to the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) and all prescribed/recommended actions were completed, to the extent possible, by midnight of the next calendar day each time a potential clinically significant issue was identified. o Examples: At the most recent SOC/ROC and throughout the quality episode, the clinician(s) communicated all identified clinically significant medication issues to the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) , and all physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) prescribed/recommended actions for the identified issues were completed by midnight of the next calendar day. At the most recent SOC/ROC and throughout the quality episode, the clinician(s) contacted the physician/allowed practition er (or physician- designee) regarding all identified potential or actual clinically significant medication issues, and the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) communicated to the clinician(s) that no actions were necessary regarding the reported issues. All communications took place before midnight of the next calendar day. Code 9, NA, if there were no potential or actual clinically significant medication issues identified at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC, or if the patient is not taking any medications at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/RO C. Dash is a valid response for this item; however, o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 224 Coding Tips If the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) prescribed/recommended action will take longer than midnight of the next calendar day to complete, then code 1, Yes, should still be entered, if by midnight of the next calendar day, the clinician has taken the appropriate steps to comply with the recommended action. o Example of a physician/allow ed practitioner (or physician -designee) recommended action that would take longer than midnight of the next calendar day to complete : The Physician/allowed practitioner (or physician-designee) writes an order instructing the clinician to monitor the medication issue over the next three days and call if the problem persists. o Examples of by midnight of the next calendar day: A clinically significant medication issue is identified at 10:00 AM on February 12 th. Communication occurs and the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) prescribed/recommended action is completed on or before 11:59 PM on February 13th. A clinically significant medication issue is identified at 10:00 PM on February 12th. Communication occurs and the physician/allowed practitioner (or physician- designee) prescribed/recommended action is completed on or before 11:59 PM on February 13th. Examples 1. No clinically significant medication issues identified throughout the episode During the Discharge assessment visit, the RN reviews the patient's medication list and confirms that no potential clinically significant medication issues are present. In reviewing the clinical record, there is documentation that a drug regimen review was conducted at SOC, and no potential clinically significant medication issues were identified. There is no other documentation to indicate that potential or actual clinically significant medication issues occurred during the episode of care. Coding: M2005: ENTER Response 9 (NA) - There were no potential clinically significant medication issues identified since SOC/ROC or patient is not taking any medications. Rationale: This item is reported as NA because there is documentation that the agency looked for potential clinically significant medication issues via completion of a drug regimen review and that no potential or actual clinically significant medication is sues were identified at any time during the episode, from SOC through Discharge. 2. Clinically significant medication issue identified, late follow- up During the SOC comprehensive assessment, the RN completes the drug regimen review and identifies a potential clinically significant medication issue. On that day of admission, the RN calls and leaves a message with the physician's office related to the medication issue. The physician does not return their call until after midnight of the next calendar day. No other medication issues arise during the episode, and the patient is discharged from home health. Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 225 Coding: At SOC: M2001: ENTER Response 1 - Yes - Issues found during review. M2003: ENTER Response 0 - No. At DC: M2005: ENTER Response 0 - No. Rational e: Because an issue identified was determined by the clinician to be clinically significant, warranting physician contact by midnight of the next calendar day, it meets the criteria for a clinically significant medication issue (1 - Yes for M2001). While t he clinician -initiated communication with the physician, the required two-way communication did not occur until after midnight of the next calendar day, resulting in 0 - No responses for M2003 and M2005. M2010: Patient/Caregiver High-Risk Drug Education Item Intent Identifies if clinicians instructed the patient and/or caregiver about all high -risk medications the patient takes. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Review the clinical record, communication notes, medication list, plan of care, documentation of other agency staff responsible for educating patient/care givers on medications. High -risk medications should be identified based on one or more authoritative sources (e.g., the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, the American Geriatrics Society, and The Joint Commission) and would be identified from medications included on the patient's reconciled medication profile. High -risk medications are those identified by an authoritative source as having considerable potential for causing significant patient harm when they are used erroneously. If agency staff other than the clinician responsible for completing the SOC/ROC provided high- risk medication education to the patient/caregiver, this information may be communicated to the assessing clinician for consideration in completing the SOC/ROC OASIS assessment. This collaboration does not Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 226 violate the requirement that the comprehensive patient assessment is the res ponsibility of and ultimately must be completed by one clinician. Links to resources for identifying high-risk medications can be found in Appendix E of this manual. Coding Instructions Code 0, No, if the interventions are not completed as outlined in this item. Code 1, Yes, if high-risk medications are prescribed and education was provided. Code NA, if patient/caregiver is fully knowledgeable about special precautions associated with all high- risk medications in their medication profile, or if there are no high-risk drugs in their medication profile. Dash is not a valid response for this item. M2020: Management of Oral Medications Item Intent This item is intended to identify the patient's ability to prepare and take all oral (p.o.) medications reliably and safely on the day of the assessment. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Observation/demonstration is the preferred method, followed by patient/caregiver interview, and review of the referral information. The intent of the item is to identify the patient's ABILITY, not necessarily actual performance. \"Willingness\" and \"adherence\" are not the focus of these items. These items address the patient's ability to safely take oral medications, given the current physical and mental/emotional/cognitive status, activities permitted, and environment. The patient must be viewed from a holistic perspective in assessing ability to perform medication management. Ability can be temporarily or permanently limited by: o physical impairments (for example, limited manual dexterity); Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 227 o emotional/cognitive/behavioral impairments (for example, memory deficits, impaired judgment, fear); o sensory impairments (for example, impaired vision, pain); o environmental barriers (for example, access to kitchen or medication storage area, stairs, narrow doorways). Includes all prescribed and OTC (over- the-counter) p.o. medications that the patient is currently taking and are included on the Plan of Care. Excludes topical, injectable, and IV medications. Only medications whose route of administration is p.o. should be considered for this item. Medications are considered to be p.o. if they are placed in the mouth and swallowed, with absorption occurring through the gastrointestinal system. Medications administered by other routes, including sublingual, buccal, swish and expectorate, or administered per gastrostomy (or other) tube are not to be considered for this item. Includes assessment of the patient's ability to obtain the medication from where it is routinely stored, the ability to read the label (or otherwise identify the medication correctly, for example patients unable to read and/or write may place a special mark or character on the label to distinguish between medications), open the container, select the pill/tablet or milliliters of liquid and orally ingest it at the correct times. If the patient's ability to manage oral medicatio ns varies from medication to medication, consider the medication for which the most assistance is needed when selecting a response. If an oral medication is ordered PRN and the medication is needed by the patient on the day of assessment - and the patient needed a reminder to take this PRN medication on the day of assessment, Code 2 , Able to take medication(s) at the correct times if g iven reminders by another person at the appropriate times. If the patient did not need any PRN oral medications on the day of assessment and therefore no reminders were necessary, assess the patient's ability based on all of the medications scheduled to be taken on the day of assessment. Coding Instructions Code 0, Able to independently, if the patient is able to manage all oral medications without assistance. This includes if the patient sets up a their own \"planner device\" and is able to take the correct medication in the correct dosage at the correct time as a result of using this device. Code 1, Able to take medication(s) correctly, if the patient is able to take their oral medication(s) but: o another person must prepare individual doses in advance (for example, place medications in a medi- planner or other device) o and/or another person in the home must modify the original medication container to enable patient access (for example, removing childproof lids, marking labels for the visually impaired or those who cannot read), o and/or someone in the home must develop a drug diary or chart which the patient relies on to take medications appropriately. Code 2, Able to take medication(s) at correct times if given reminders, if daily reminders to take medications are necessary, regardless of whether the patient is independent or needs assistance in preparing individual doses (for example, setting up a \"planner device\") and/or developing a drug diary or chart. (Reminders provided by a device that the patient can independently set up and manage are not considered \"assistance\" or \"reminders.\"). Code 3, Unable to take medication unless administered by another person, if the patient does not have the physical or cognitive ability on the day of assessment to take all medications correctly Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 228 (right medication, right dose, right time) as ordered and every time ordered, and it has not been established that set up, diary, or reminders have already been or will be successful. The clinician would need to return to assess if the new interventions, such as reminders or a med planner, provided adequate support for the patient to take all medications safely. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips For a patient who resides in a facility, such as an assisted living facility (ALF), where the facility holds or locks up the patient's medications: o Report the patient's ability to take the correct oral medication(s) including proper dosage(s) reliably and safely at the correct times. o Determine ability based on observation and assessment of the complexity of the patient's drug regimen, as well as patient characteristics, including cognitive status, vision, strength, manual dexterity and general mobility. o Assessment includes consideration of whether a patient: can get to the location where the medications are routinely stored at the correct times, can recognize the correct medication dose(s) and take their oral medications, recognizing that someone would need to make the medication available to the patient once they are at the location (e.g., nursing office or medication cart) o Select response 0, 1, 2 or 3 depending on the level and timing of assistance required on the day of assessment to allow the patient to take the correct dose(s) of all oral medications reliably and safely at the correct times. M2030: Management of Injectable Medications Item Intent This item is intended to assess the patient's ability to safely and reliably take all injectable medications on the day of assessment. Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 229 Response- Specific Instructions Observation/demonstration is the preferred method, followed by patient/caregiver interview and review of the referral information. The intent of the item is to identify the patient's ABILITY, not necessarily actual performance. \"Willingness\" and \"adherenc e\" are not the focus of these items. These items address the patient's ability to safely manage injectable medications, given the current physical and mental/emotional/cognitive status, activities permitted, and environment. The patient must be viewed from a holistic perspective in assessing ability to perform medication management. Ability can be temporarily or permanently limited by: o physical impairments (for example, limited manual dexterity); o emotional/cognitive/behavioral impairments (for example, memo ry deficits, impaired judgment, fear); o sensory impairments (for example, impaired vision, pain); o environmental barriers (for example, access to kitchen or medication storage area, stairs, narrow doorway. Excludes IV medications, infusions (for example, medications given via a pump), and medications given in the physician's office or other settings outside the home. Includes one- time injections administered in the home. Includes assessment of the patient's ability to obtain the medication from where it is routinely stored, the ability to read the label (or otherwise identify the medication correctly, for example patients unable to read and/or write may place a special mark or character on the label to distinguish between medications), draw up the correct dose accurately using aseptic technique, inject in an appropriate site using correct technique, and dispose of the syringe properly. If the patient's ability to manage injectable medications varies from medication to medication, consider the medication for which the most assistance is needed when selecting a response. PRN injectables, ordered and included on POC, are to be considered when determining the patient's ability to manage injectable medications. If the PRN medication was not needed during the assessment timeframe, use clinical judgment and make an inference regarding the patient's ability by asking them to describe and demonstrate the steps for administration and needle disposal, considering the patient's cognitive and physical status as well as any other barriers. Assessment strategies: A combined observation/interview approach with the patient or caregiver is helpful in determining the most accurate response for this item. Observe patient preparing the injectable medications. If it is not time for the medication, ask the patient to describe and demonstrate the steps for administration. The cognitive/mental status and functional assessments contribute to determining the appropriate response for this item. Coding Instructions Code 0, Able to independently take the correct medication(s) and proper dosage(s) at the correct times, if the patient is able to manage all injectable medications without assistance. This includes if the patient sets up their own individual doses and is able to take the correct medication(s) in the correct dosage(s) at the correct time as a result of this. Code 1, Able to take injectable medication(s) at the correct times if, the patient is able to administer their injectable medication(s) but: o another person must prepare syringes/individual doses in advance Chapter 3 Section N: Medications OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 230 o and/or another person in the home must modify the original medication container in advance to enable patient access (for example marking label s for the visually impaired or those who cannot read), o and/or if another person must develop a drug diary or chart which the patient relies on to take medications appropriately Code 2, Able to take medication(s) at the correct time if given reminders by an other person, if reminders to take medications are necessary, regardless of whether the patient is independent or needs assistance in preparing individual doses and/or developing a drug diary or chart. (Reminders provided by a device that the patient can i ndependently manage are not considered \"assistance\" or \"reminders.\") Code 3, Unable to take injectable medication unless administered by another person, if: o The patient does not have the physical or cognitive ability on the day of assessment to take all injectable medications correctly (right medication, right does, right time) as ordered, or o even with reminder the patient requires assistance administering their injectable medication(s), or o the physician ordered the RN to administer an injection in the home. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips For a patient residing in a facility, such as an assisted living facility (ALF), where the facility holds or locks up the patient's medications o Report the patient's ability to administer all injectable medication(s) and proper dosage(s) reliably and safely at the correct times. o Determine ability based on observation, an assessment of the complexity of the patient's drug regimen, as well as patient characteristics, including cognitive status, vision, strength, manual dexterity and general mobility. o Assessment includes consideration of whether a patient: Can get to the location where the medications are routinely stored at the correct times, . Can recognize the correct medications dose(s) and administer their injectable medications, recognizing that someone would need to make the medications available to the patient once they are at the location (e.g., nursing office or medication cart). o Select response 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the level and timing of assistance required on the day of assessment to allow the patient to take the correct dose(s) of all injectable medications reliably and safely at the correct times.

None of the Above Item Intent The intent of the item is to identify any special treatments, procedures, and programs that apply to the patient. Item Rationale The treatments, procedures, and programs listed can have a profound effect on an individual's health status, self -image, dignity, and quality of life. Chapter 3 Section O : Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 233 Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Review the patient's clinical record and consult with the patient, family, caregiver(s) and/or staff to determine whether or not any of the treatments, procedures, or programs apply during the time period under consideration for the SOC/ROC assessment (for the SOC/ROC) or during the time period under consideration for the DC assessment (for the DC) . Check all treatments, programs and procedures that are part of the patient's current care/treatment plan during the time period under consideration, even if not used during the time period under consideration for SOC/ROC and discharge, and whether or not it is expected to occur after discharge. Include treatments, programs and procedures performed by others and those the patient performed themselves independently or after set-up by agency staff or family/caregivers. Check treatments, procedures and programs that are performed in the patient's home, or in other settings (e.g., dialysis performed in a dialysis center). Do not check services that were provided solely in conjunction with a surgical procedure or diagnostic procedure, such as IV medications. Surgical procedures include routine pre- and post- operative procedures. For O0110A1 (Chemotherapy), O0110B1 (Radiation), and O0110J1 (Dialysis), check if the patient is undergoing treatment at the time of assessment. Coding Instructions Check each type of treatment, procedure, or program that applies. Code O0110A1, Chemotherapy, if any type of chemotherapy medication administered as an antineoplastic for cancer treatment given by any route in this item. o Code O0110A2, Chemotherapy, IV, if chemotherapy administered intravenously. o Code O0110A3, Chemotherapy, Oral, if chemotherapy administered orally (e.g., pills, capsules, or liquids the patient swallows). This sub- element also applies if the chemotherapy is administered enterally (e.g., feeding tube/PEG). o Code O0110A10, Chemotherapy, Other, if chemotherapy administered in a way other than intravenously, enterally, or orally (e.g., intramuscular, intraventricular/intrathecal, intraperitoneal, or topical routes). Code O0110B1, Radiation, if radiation is administered intermittently or via radiation implant in this item. Code O0110C1, Oxygen Therapy, if continuous or intermittent oxygen is used via mask, cannula, etc., including in Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure/Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP/CPAP). Do not include hyperbaric oxygen for wound therapy in this item. Chapter 3 Section O : Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 234 o Code O0110C2, Oxygen Therapy, Continuous , if oxygen therapy is continuously delivered for 14 hours per day. o Code O0110C3, Oxygen Therapy, Intermittent, if oxygen therapy is delivered intermittently (< 14 hours continuously). o Code O0110C4, Oxygen Therapy, High concentration, if oxygen is delivered via a high - concentration delivery system at a concentration that exceeds FiO2 of 40% (i.e., exceeding that of simple low -flow nasal cannula at a flow- rate of 4 liters per minute). o A high-concentration delivery system can include either high or low- flow systems (e.g., simple face masks, partial and non-rebreather masks, face tents, venturi masks, aerosol masks, high-flow cannula or masks). o These devices may also include invasive mechanical ventilators, non- invasive mechanical ventilators, or trach masks, if the delivered FiO2 of these systems exceeds 40%. o Oxygen-conserving nasal cannula systems with reservoirs (e.g., mustache, pendant) should be included only if they are used to deliver an FiO2 greater than 40%. Code O0110D1, Suctioning, only if tracheal and/or nasopharyngeal suctioning is performed. Do not include oral suctioning here. This item may also be checked if the patient performs their own tracheal and/or pharyngeal suctioning. o Code O0110D2, Suctioning, Scheduled, if suctioning is scheduled. Scheduled suctioning is performed when the patient is assessed to clinically benefit from regular interventions, such as every hour. Scheduled suctioning applies to medical orders for performing suctioning at speci fic intervals and/or implementation of agency-based clinical standards, protocols, and guidelines. o Code O0110D3, Suctioning, As needed, if suctioning is performed on an as needed basis, as opposed to regular scheduled intervals, such as when secretions become so prominent that gurgling or choking is noted, or a sudden desaturation occurs from a mucus plug. Code O0110E1, Tracheostomy care, if cleansing of the tracheostomy and/or cannula is performed. This item may also be checked if the patient performs the ir own tracheostomy care or receives assistance. Code O0110F1, Invasive Mechanical Ventilator (ventilator or respirator), if any type of electrically or pneumatically powered closed -system mechanical ventilator support device is used that ensures adequate ventilation in the patient who is or who may become (such as during weaning attempts) unable to support their own respiration. Code O0110G1, Non -Invasive Mechanical Ventilator, if any type of respiratory support device is used that prevents airways from closing by delivering slightly pressurized air through a mask or other device continuously or via electronic cycling throughout the breathing cycle. The BiPAP/CPAP mask/device enables the individual to support their own spontaneous respiration. This item may be checked if the patient places or removes their own BiPAP/CPAP mask/device or if the family/caregiver applies it for the patient o Code O0110G2, BiPAP, if the non-invasive mechanical ventilator support was BiPAP. o Code O0110G3, CPAP, if the non-invasive mechanical ventilator support was CPAP. Code O0110H1, IV medications, if any medication or biological is given by intravenous push, epidural pump, or drip through a central or peripheral port in this item. Do not include flushes to keep an IV access port patent, or IV fluids without medication here. Epidural, intrathecal, and baclofen pumps may be checked here, as they are similar to IV medications in that they must be monitored frequently and they involve continuous administration of a substance. Subcutaneous pumps are not included in this item. Do Chapter 3 Section O : Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 235 not include IV medications of any kind that were administered during dialysis or chemotherapy. Dextrose 50% and/or Lactated Ringers given IV are not considered medications, and should not be included here. o Code O0110H2, Vasoactive medications, if at least one of the IV medications was a vasoactive medication. o Code O0110H3, Antibiotics, if at least one of the IV medications was an antibiotic. o Code O0110H4, Anticoagulation, if at least one of the IV medications was an IV anticoagulan t. Do not include subcutaneous administration of anticoagulant medications. o Code O0110H10, Other, if at least one of the IV medications was not an IV vasoactive medication, IV antibiotic, or IV anticoagulant. Examples include IV analgesics (e.g., morphine ) and IV diuretics (e.g., furosemide). Code O0110I1, Transfusions, if any blood or any blood products (e.g., platelets, synthetic blood products), are administered directly into the bloodstream in this item. Do not include transfusions that were administered during dialysis or chemotherapy. Code O0110J1, Dialysis, if peritoneal or renal dialysis occurs in the home or at a facility. IV medication, and blood transfusions administered during dialysis are considered part of the dialysis procedure and are not to be coded under items K0520A (Parenteral/IV feeding), O0110H1 (IV medications), or O0110I1 (transfusi ons). This item is also checked if the patient performs their own dialysis. o Code O0110J2, Hemodialysis, if the dialysis was hemodialysis. In hemodialysis the patient's blood is circulated directly through a dialysis machine that uses special filters to re move waste products and excess fluid from the blood. o Code O0110J3, Peritoneal dialysis, if the dialysis was peritoneal dialysis. In peritoneal dialysis, dialysate is infused into the peritoneal cavity and the peritoneum (the membrane that surrounds many of the internal organs of the abdominal cavity) and serves as a filter to remove the waste products and excess fluid from the blood. Code O0110O1, IV Access, if a catheter is inserted into a vein for a variety of clinical reasons, including long- term medication administration, hemodialysis, large volumes of blood or fluid, frequent access for blood samples, intravenous fluid administration, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), or in some instances the measurement of central venous pressure. o Code O0110O2, Peri pheral, if IV access is peripheral access (catheter is placed in a peripheral vein) and remains peripheral. o Code O0110O3, Midline, if IV access is midline access. Midline catheters are inserted into the antecubital (or other upper arm) vein and do not reach all the way to a central vein such as the superior vena cava. o Code O0110O4, Central (e.g., PICC, tunneled, port), if IV access is centrally located (e.g., peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC], tunneled, port). Code O0110Z1, None of the above , if none of the above treatments, procedures, or programs apply. Dash is a valid response for this item. o Dash indicates \"no information.\" CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. Chapter 3 Section O : Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 236 Examples 1. The patient's referral information indicates that they were discharged from an acute care facility following an inpatient stay for bacterial pneumonia that required placement of a tracheostomy. At start of care, the patient requires intermittent oxygen and assistance with trach care. Their tracheal suctioning needs are PRN. The patient has intermittent desaturations due to mucus plugging that have required use of a tracheostomy mask at a FiO2 of greater than 40% intermittently. The patient has orders for 1 more week of IV antibiotics, which are being delivered via a PICC line. Coding: Check boxes O0110C1 (Oxygen Therapy), O0110C3 (Intermittent), and O0110C4 concentration), and O0110D3 Needed), O0110E1 Care), O0110H1 (IV Medications) and O0110H3 (Antibiotics), and O0110O1 (IV Access) and O0110O4 (Central). Rationale: The patient is receiving intermittent oxygen, high-concentration oxygen delivery, as needed suctioning, tracheostomy care, and IV antibiotics via a PICC line at start of care . 2. A patient has advanced prostate cancer and is receiving radiation and oral chemotherapy medication to treat the prostate cancer. They are being admitted today, following an inpatient stay for an acute pulmonary embolism. Their discharge orders include enoxaparin subcutaneously for continued anticoagulation. The patient does not have orders for other IV medications but still has a port in place. Coding: Check boxes O0110A1 (Chemotherapy), O0110A3 (Chemotherapy, Oral), O0110B1 (Radiation), O0110O1 (IV Access) and O0110O4 (Central). Rationale: O0110H4 (Anticoagulation) is not checked because enoxaparin is administered subcutaneously, not intravenously. Even though the patient's port is not being accessed currently, they still have one and therefore O0110O1 (IV Access) and O0110O4 (Central) should be checked. The patient is also receiving oral chemotherapy and radiation so O0110A1 (Chemotherapy), O0110A3 (oral), and O0110B1 (Radiation) should be selected. 3. A pati ent has multiple myeloma and was discharged from an acute hospitalization after a pathologic vertebral fracture with significant pain. On admission to home health, referral documentation and physician orders include palliative radiation, lenalidomide orally for chemotherapy, and notes that frequent transfusions are required not related to the chemotherapy. They have a port for pamidronate infusions due to hypercalcemia. Coding: Check boxes (Oral), and O0110B1 (Radiation), O0110I1 (Transfusions), O0110H1 (IV Medications) and O0110H10 (Other) and O0110O1 (IV Access) and O0110O4 (Central). Rationale: The patient is receiving oral chemotherapy (lenalidomide), radiation, transfusions, an IV medication (pamidronate), which falls under \"other\" IV medications, and has a port. The transfusions are noted to not be related to chemotherapy, and as such should be coded separately. 4. During the home health start of care assessment, the assessing clinician learns that a patient has sleep apnea and requires a CPAP device to be worn when sleeping. The patient's spouse sets- up the humidifier element of the CPAP and the patient puts on the CPAP mask prior to falling asleep. Chapter 3 Section O : Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 237 Coding: Check boxes O0110G1 (Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilator) and O0110G3 (CPAP). Rationale: The patient is able to breathe on their own and wears the CPAP mask when sleeping to manage the sleep apnea. M1041: Influenza Vaccine Data Collection Period: Item Intent Identifies whether the patient was receiving services from the home health agency during the time period for which influenza vaccine data are collected (October 1 and March 31). Time Points Item(s) Completed Transfer Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Review the clinical record to identify the date of the most recent SOC or ROC. A care episode is one that includes both SOC/ROC and Transfer/Discharge. Therefore, when completing this item at Transfer or Discharge, only go back to the most recent SOC or ROC to determine if the patient was receiving home health agency services on or between October 1 through March 31. Coding Instructions Code 0, No, if no part of the care episode (from SOC/ROC to Transfer/Discharge) occurred during the time period from October 1 and March 31. Code 1, Yes, if part of the care episode (from SOC/ROC to Transfer/Discharge) occurred during the time period from October 1 and March 31. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section O : Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 238 M1046: Influenza Vaccine Received Item Intent For a patient with any part of the home health episode (SOC/ROC to Transfer/Discharge) occurring between October 1 and March 31, identifies whether the patient received an influenza vaccine for this year's flu season, and if not, the reason why. Time Points Item(s) Completed Transfer Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions Interview the patient and/or caregiver, review the clinical record, and/or ask the physician or other health care provider. Refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for detailed guidelines on the influenza vaccine, including information about medical contraindications (Response 5), age and condition guidelines (Response 6), and information regarding vaccine availability and potential shortages (Response 7). A link to CDC Guidelines can be found in Appendix E of this manual. It is the agency's responsibility to make current guidelines available to clinicians. Coding Instructions Code 1, Yes, if your agency provided the influenza vaccine to the patient during this episode of care (SOC/ROC to Transfer/Discharge). Code 2, Yes, if your agency provided the influenza vaccine to the patient for this year's flu season prior to this episode , in a prior episode or at a flu clinic run by your agency (a roster billing situation). o For example, if the SOC/ROC for this episode was in winter, but your agency provided the vaccine in the fall (during a prior episode) when the vaccine became available. Code 3, Yes, if the patient or caregiver reports, or there is documentation in the clinical record, that the patient received the influenza vaccine for the current flu season from another provider. The provider can be the patient's physician, a clinic, or health fair providing influenza vaccines, etc. Code 4, No, if the patient and/or healthcare proxy (for example, someone with power of attorney) was offered the vaccine and refused. Note: It is not required that your agency offer the vaccine. Enter Response 4 only if the patient was offered the vaccine and it was refused. Chapter 3 Section O : Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 239 Code 5, No, if the influenza vaccine is contraindicated for medical reaso ns. Code 6, No , if the patient does not meet age/condition guidelines for the influenza vaccine. Code 7, No, only in the event that the vaccine is unavailable due to a CDC- declared shortage. Code 8, No, if the patient did not receive the vaccine due to a reason other than Responses 4-7, including situations where the assessing clinician is unable to determine wh ether the patient received the influenza vaccine. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips Codes 1, 2 or 3 may be entered even if the influenza vaccine for this year's flu season was provided priorto October 1 (that is, influenza vaccine was made available early). M2200: Therapy Need Item Intent Identifies the total number of planned therapy visits (physical, occupational, or speech therapy combined). Time Points Item(s) Completed Start of Care Resumption of Care Response- Specific Instructions Review physician's/allowed practitioner's orders, referral information, plan of care, and other availabledocumentation. Enter a number that is \"zero filled and right justified.\" For example, 11 visits should be reported as \"011.\" Therapy visits must (a) relate directly and specifically to a treatment regimen established by the physician/allowed practitioner through consultation with the therapist(s), and (b) be reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the patient's illness or injury. While CMS will no longer use M2200 to influence payment under PDGM, other payers may be using this data in their PPS -like payment models. In such cases, agencies should follow instructions from individual payers directing data collection. oAgencies may code M2200 Therapy Need with NA - Not Applicable for assessments where the data is not required for the patient's payer (including all Medic are FFS assessments). oContinue to report the number of therapy visits that are planned for the 60-day certification period, unless otherwise directed by the individual payer. Chapter 3 Section O : Special Treatments, Procedures, and Programs OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 240 The qualifying service does not have to be rendered prior to the other Medicare covered home health services ordered in the Plan of Care. For example, if a patient has both physical therapy and occupational therapy orders in the Plan of Care, the sequence of the delivery of the type of therapy is irrelevant as long as the need for the qualifying service is established prior to the delivery of other Medicare covered services and the qualifying discipline provides a billable visit prior to transfer or discharge. For multidisciplinary cases - Nursing and Therapy may collaborate to answer this item. The PT, OT, and/or SLP may communicate the number of visits ordered by the physician to the RN completing this item. Coding Instructions Code NA, Not Applicable, when this assessment will not be used to determine a case mix group for other payers using a Medicare PPS -like model. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Coding Tips When a patient is discharged home from an inpatient facility admission in the last five days of a certification period (the requirement to complete a Resumption of Care assessment overlaps with the requirement to complete a Recertification assessment), CMS allows the agency to complete a single ROC assessment to meet the requirements of both time points. In such cases, the total number of therapy visits planned for the upcoming 60-day certification period should be reported. Chapter 3 Section Q: Participation in Assessment and Goal Setting OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 241 SECTION Q: PARTICIPATION IN ASSESSMENT AND GOAL SETTING Introduction This section includes one item to identify interventions that were included in the physician-ordered plan of care and implemented.

Item Intent Identifies if specific interventions were both included on the physician- ordered home health Plan of Care AND implemented as part of care provided at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC assessment. Time Points Item(s) Completed Transfer Discharge from agency Response- Specific Instructions First, review the physician's orders and the Plan of Care to identify if the specific interventions are included. Then, determine if the interventions were implemented by reviewing the clinical record, including but not limited to the clinical assessments, and communication notes.Chapter 3 Section Q: Participation in Assessment and Goal Setting OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 242 Consider interventions implemented any time during the quality episode (at the time of, or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC assessment, to the time the Discharge or Transfer assessment is completed). The problem- specific interventions referenced in this item may or may not directly correlate with stated requirements in the Conditions of Participation. Interventions provided by home health agency staff, including the assessing clinician, may be reported in this item. o For example, if the RN finds a patient to be at risk for falls, and the physical therapist implements fall prevention interventions included on the Plan of Care prior to the end of the quality episode, the RN may Code \"Yes\" for row b: Falls prevention interventions. The M0090 - Date Assessment Completed should report the date the last information used to complete the comprehensive assessment and determine OASIS coding was gathered by the assessing clinician and documentation of the specific information/resp onses was completed. For row d, BOTH of the interventions (monitor and mitigate pain) must be both on the physician-ordered Plan of Care AND implemented for \"Yes\" to be selected. Coding Instructions Enter one Code (Yes, No or Not Applicable) for each ro w: b, c, d, e and f. Code Yes, if the physician- ordered Plan of Care includes the specified best practice interventions listed in each row, AND there is evidence of implementation in the clinical record, by the time the Discharge or Transfer assessment was completed. o Code \"Yes\" to M2401 b - e, if the specified clinical interventions were included in the physician ordered Plan of Care and implemen ted at the time of or at any time since the most recent SOC/ROC assessment whether or not a formal assessment was performed. Code No, if the interventions are not on the Plan of Care OR if the interventions are on the Plan of Care but the interventions we re not implemented by the time the Discharge or Transfer assessment was completed, unless \"NA\" applies. Code NA, according to the instructions in the last column of the item, for each row. Dash is not a valid response for this item. Chapter 3 Section Q: Participation in Assessment and Goal Setting OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 243 Coding Tips Falls prevention interventions (Row b) may include, but are not limited to environmental modifications, strengthening exercises, and consultation with the physician regarding medication concerns. Interventions for depression (Row c) may include but are not limited to new medications, adjustments to already -prescribed medications, psychotherapy or referrals to agency resources (for example, social worker). If the patient is already under physician care for a diagnosis of depression, interventions may include monitoring medication effectiveness, teaching regarding the need to take prescribed medications, etc. Interventions to monitor and mitigate pain (Row d) may include but are not limited to medication, massage, visualization, and biofeedback. Interventions to prevent pressure ulcers (Row e) may include but are not limited to teaching on frequent position changes, proper positioning to relieve pressure, careful skin assessment and hygiene, use of pressure -relieving devices such as enhanced mattresses, etc. Pressure ulcer treatments based on principles of moist wound healing (Row f) may include but are not limited to moisture retentive dressings.

Appendix D Description of Changes from OASIS -D to OASIS -E OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 373 APPENDIX D: DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES FROM OASIS -D TO OASIS -E OASIS -E is a major revision to the OASIS instrument and guidance manual resulting in significant instrument redesign and manual reorganization. The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act (IMPACT Act) of 2014, enacted October 6, 2014, direct s the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"specify quality measures on which Post -Acute Care (PAC) providers are required under the applicable reporting provisions to submit standardized patient assessment data\" in several quality measure domains including incidence of falls with major injury, skin integrity and changes in skin integrity, medication reconciliation, functional status, transfer of health information and care preferences when an individual transitions, and resource use and other measures 6. To align the items across the PAC settings, multiple new standardized items have been added to OASIS- E, sections have been added or renamed, items have been reorganized within the sections, and the format for item specific guidance (Chapter 3) has changed. OASIS -E reflects revisions based on proposals finalized in the Calendar Year (CY) 2019 Home Health (HH) Final Rule [CMS -1689-FC] effective January 1, 2020, and CY 2022 HH Final Rule, CMS [CMS-1747-F and CMS -553-F] effective January 1, 2023. The OASIS -D1 instrument, effective January 1, 2020, included minor revisions consisting of the addition of two existing items to the Follow-up assessment instrument (M1033 - Risk for Hospitalization and M1800 - Grooming), with corresponding revisions to the All -Items instrument. Additional guidance revisions included a change from \"required\" to \"optional\" data collection at certain time points for 23 existing OASIS items. The 2019 OASIS-D Guidance Manual was not revised; however, CMS published an OASIS -D1: OASIS Update for CY 2020 document that highlighted changes related to this optional data collection. With OASIS -E, made effective January 1, 2023, the items that were made optional with OASIS- D1 were removed from the specified time points. M2016 - Patient/Caregiver Drug Education Intervention was also removed from the OASIS instrument. OASIS-E includes the addition of certain Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements including those addressing certain Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). It is notable that the January 1, 2023 implementation of OASIS- E represents a two -year delay from the original compliance date finalized in the CY 2020 HH PPS final rule. This delay accompanied additional OASIS flexibilities that CMS provided to support home health agencies during the COVID-19 public health emergency - CY 2019 HH Final Rule, [CMS 1689-FC] effective January 1, 2020 This appendix includes a table outlining the changes made to the OASIS-E instrument compared to the previous OASIS -D Instrument (Table D.1). Table D.1 presents an overview of changes made to the OASIS items and instrument for the transition from OASIS -D to OASIS -E. The table columns and headings are explained below. 1.OASIS -E item section : Section in the OASIS -E where the item is located. 6 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 'IMPACT Act of 2014 Data Standardization & Cross Setting Measures', from OASIS -D to OASIS -E OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 374 2.OASIS -E item number: Item number in the OASIS -E.

When guidance changes occur, the newer guidance supersedes previously published guidance and providers are directed to utilize the most recent guidance. Examples of the more substantive guidance refinements that have been added to the OASIS-E Guidance Manual are summarized here. A focused review of Chapter 3 of this manual is encouraged to gain context and details regarding these and other guidance refinements which have occurred since OASIS -D. General Response Specific Instructions for GG0130/GG0170, guidance on how to code an activity when only a portion of the activity has been completed has been added: If the pat ient only completes a portion of the activity (e.g., performs a partial bath or transfers into but not out of a vehicle) and does not complete the entire activity during the assessment time frame, use clinical judgment to determine if the situation allows the clinician to adequately assess the patient'sability to complete the activity. If the clinician determines that this observation is adequate, code basedon the type and amount of assistance the patient requires to complete the ENTIRE activity. If theclinician determines the partial activity does not provide adequate information to support determinationof a performance code, select an appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code. Illust rations of how this guidance concept might be applied can be found in Chapter 3 coding instructions for GG0130E - Shower/ bathe self and GG0170G - Car transfer: Use cl inical judgment to determine if completing a partial bath or simulating the shower/bath allows the clinician to adequately assess the patient's ability to complete the activity of shower/bathe self(GG0130E) . If the clinician determines that this observation is adequate, code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the shower/bathing activity. Clinic ians may use professional judgment to determine if observing a patient performing a portion of the car transfer activity (e.g., getting into the car) allows the clinician to adequately assess the patient'sability to complete the entire GG0170G - Car transfer activity (transferring in and out of a car). If theclinician determines that this observation is adequate, code based on the type and amount of assistancethe patient required to complete the activity. Other examples of guidance added to specifi c GG activities include: An update t o coding tips for GG0170C - Lying to sitting on side of bed, corresponding to edits made to the OASIS item language: oIt is not required that the patient's feet be flat on the floor to consider the activity as beingcompleted. Note that the reference to the patient having their feet flat on the floor has beenremoved from GG0170C in the OASIS-E instrument. Guidance refinements for what is specifically assessed during GG0170G - Car transfer: oIf the patient remains in a wheelchair and does not transfer in and out of a car or van seat, the activity is not considered completed and the appropriate \"activity not attempted\" code would beused. Clari fying statements on when the walking versus wheelchair activities can be considered complete and how a helper may assist a patient in complete the activities: oThe walking activities cannot be completed without some level of patient participation that allows patient ambulation to occur for the entire stated distance. A helper cannot com plete a walking activity for a patient.Appendix D Description of Changes from OASIS -D to OASIS -E OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 382 oA helper can assist a patient to complete the wheelchair distance or make turns if required. When a patient is unable to wheel the entire distance themselves the activity can still be completed, and a performance code can be determined based on the type and amount ofassistance required from the helper to complete the entire activity. Guidance statements were added to the OASIS -E manual pages for M1033 - Risk for Hospitalization to clarify when certain response options should be selected. Examples include: Multipl e hospitalizations ( Response 3 ) defines hospitalization as the patient being admitted for 24 hours or longer to an inpatient acute bed for more than just diagnostic testing. Medicat ions ( Response 7 ) include prescribed and over-the-counter (OTC) medications, nutritional supplements, vitamins, and homeopathic and herbal products administered by any route and as noted onthe reconciled medication profile. Medications may also include total parenteral nutrition (TPN) andoxygen. Guidance modifying the definition of \"formal assistive services\" M2420 - Discharge Disposition was updated to support new Transfer of Health Quality Measures: Code 2, Pati ent remained in the community (with formal assistive services), now applies if, after discharge from your agency the patient remained a non- inpatient setting, receiving skilled services from another Medicare certified home health agency, (with or without other assistive services), or when anagency completes a discharge and new SOC OASIS due to a pay source change for a patient. Guidance was updated related to allowing orders to be received from select non-physician practitioners, as it impacts OASIS items where the presence of a physician's order affects the item coding: Section 3708 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act amended section 1861(aa)(5) of the Act, allowing nurse practitioners (NPs), clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), andphysician assistants (PAs) to certify eligibility and provide orders for home health services, where not prohibited by State Law. Accordingly, when coding OASIS items where the presence of a physician's order affects the item coding, orders from these allowed practitioners would satisfy the condition of having a physician's order. Illustrations of how this guidance concept might be applied can be found in Chapter 3 coding instructions for M0102 - Date of Physician -ordered SOC/ROC, M0104 - Date of Referral, M1021 - Primary Diagnosis, and M1023 - Other Diagnoses: The date s pecified by a physician/allowed practitioner order to start home care services (that is, provide the first covered service), or resume home care services (that is provide the first visit following aqualifying inpatient stay) regardless of the type of services ordered (for example, therapy only). When coding O ASIS items where the presence of a physician's order affects the item coding, orders from an allowed practitioner including physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or other advancedpractice nurse would satisfy the condition of having a physician's order A valid r eferral is considered received when the agency has received adequate information about a patient (such as name, address/contact info, and diagnosis and/or general home care needs) to initiatepatient assessment and confirmed that the referring physician/allowed practitioner or anotherphysician/allowed practitioner, will provide the plan of care and ongoing orders. The asse ssing clinician determine the primary and other home health diagnoses based on the assessment findings, information in the medical record including but not limited to physician/non-physicianpractitioner orders, medication list and referral information, and, input from the physician/non-physician practitioner. CMS invites stakeholders to review all guidance manual pages for new and refined guidance statements, and reference as needed to support OASIS data accuracy.

Its initial purpose was to provide a standardized home health item set and standardized quality measures for use in quality improvement activities within individual home health agencies. The uses for OASIS data quickly expanded beyond quality measurement to also include determining reimbursement under Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). The uses for OASIS data have continued to evolve over the years with significant quality and payment implications tied to OASIS data. The current uses for OASIS include: 1) Home Health Agency Medicare-certification surveys, 2) the quality measures on the consumer-focused Care Compare website, 3) the quality measures used in the Home Health Quality of Patient Care Star Ratin gs, 4) the quality measures used in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Home Health Value- Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model, and 5) the Quality Assessment Only (QAO) Metric used in home health pay- for- reporting (P4R). The OASIS instrument also plays a pivotal role in post- acute care quality improvement related to the mandates of the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act). HISTORY OF OASIS AND OUTCOME- BASED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (OBQI) In the early 2000s, CMS promoted a quality improvement process for home health called Outcome- Based Quality Improvement (OBQI). OBQI used OASIS-based quality measures as the foundation for home health quality improvement activities. CMS, through their contracts with state Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), provided training to home health agencies nationally on OBQI. Agency training and use of OBQI to improve quality was a preparatory step for the home health public reporting of quality measures. In 2002, CMS announced plans for public reporting of home health quality measures. In the fall of 2003, CMS launched the Home Health Compare website (www.Medicare.gov). This initiative encouraged consumers to use publicly available home health quality measures when selecting a home health agency. The launch of Home Health Compare was also a catalyst for agency quality improvement activities as well as the marketing and promotion of quality of care by individual agencies. The OASIS-based measures created the foundation for these early activities and advances in home health quality improvement. In 2021, CMS retired the Home Health Compare website and launched the Care Compare website ( https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare ). With Care Compare, CMS merged multiple setting -specific Compare sites into one consumer- friendly site that features information from providers across the continuum. At the time of the launch of Care Compare, CMS also launched another website related to publicly reported data: the Provider Data Catalog (PDC) (https://data.cms.gov/provider- data). While Care Compare is a consumer -focused tool, PDC is a resource geared toward providers, vendors, and researchers. The PDC website includes downloadable data from the Care Compare site as well as additional measure -specific information. UNDERSTANDING QUALITY & QUALITY IMPROVEMENT What is quality? The term \" quality\" in healthcare may have many different meanings. However, standard definitions are required to be able to measure quality and to then improve quality. The OASIS-based quality measures provide the home health industry with a framework for defining quality in terms of what matters to a patient and their caregivers. The home health quality measures have included many measures of activities of daily living (ADLs), patient status, and home health agency care processes. These include the measures of \"Impr ovement in Ambulation- Locomotion\", \"Stabilization in Grooming,\" \"Improvement in Bed Transferring,\" etc. These measures are important to patients as they symbolize quality of life and independence in a home setting. Quality measures also benefit clinicians by promotion of best practice interventions. Home health care Appendix F OASIS and Quality Improvement OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 388 quality is reflected in measures of agency best practices such as \"Drug Regimen Review Conducted with Follow- Up for Identified Issues.\" Agencies can measure their overall progress in each quali ty measure to determine if they are improving in the measure, worsening in the measure, or remaining unchanged. Through the internet Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (iQIES) reports, agencies can compare, or benchmark, their current performance to their prior performance on each quality measure and compare their performance to a national reference rate. OUTCOME AND PROCESS MEASURES The initial OASIS -based quality measures were risk adjusted outcome measures. Shortly after the 2010 implementation of OASIS -C, agencies were introduced to the first standardized process measures which were derived from OASIS data. OUTCOME MEASURES An outc ome is a health status change that occurs over time, where the change is intrinsic to the patient and change can be positive (improvement), negative (worsening) or neutral (no change). Outcome of care measures are one tool for examining changes in patient condition or functioning that may be impacted by home health care services. Thus, a change in the patient's environment, such as the provision of a walker or handrails in the patient's residence, is not considered an outcome according to this definition\u2014such changes are services or processes of care. The definition of an outcome does not include a presumed direction; therefore, any deviation (or non-deviation) in health status between the initial time point and the follow-up time point constitutes an outcome. For example, did the patient's ability to walk and move around improve by the time they finished working with the home health agency? A rate of 88% for that quality measure means that 88% of the time, the agency improved their patients' ability to walk and move around. An end -result outcome is a change in patient health status, such as physiologic, functional, cognitive, emotional, or behavioral health, between two or more time points. Examples of end- result outcome quality measures are: Improvement in Management of Oral Medications and Stabilization in Bathing. For example, did the patient's ability to manage their oral medications improve by the time they finished working with the home health agency? A rate of 80% for that quality measure means that 80% of the time, the patients' ability to manage their oral medications improved from the start to the end of their home care episode. A utilization outcome is a type of quality measure that reflects use of health care services presumably resulting from a change in the patient's health status. Examples of utilization outcomes include quality measures that identify hospital admission, use of hospital emergency department services, and discharge to the community. Utilization measures were initially computed using only OASIS data; however, current and potential future measures may be computed using Medicare FFS claims data. A complete list of quality measures and measure descriptions are available on the CMS Home Heal th Quality Reporting Program website. MEASURE EXCLUSIONS FOR OUTCOME MEASURES Some patients are excluded from the improvement or the stabilization computations. Any patient whose status at start (or resumption) of care is optimal for the health attribute u nder consideration is excluded from the improvement computation. Such a case is excluded because the patient could not possibly show improvement, since they are as \"good\" as they can possibly be for this attribute. All the patients included in the improvem ent computation had the potential to show improvement; the percentage (and the actual number of cases) listed at the end of the bar actually did improve. Appendix F OASIS and Quality Improvement OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 389 Similar to exclusions from the improvement measures, some cases are excluded from the stabilization computation. Any patient whose status at start (or resumption) of care is at the most severely impaired level for the health attribute under consideration is excluded from the stabilization computation. This patient could not possibly show worsening, and therefore is excluded. A quality measure may also have exclusions specific to that measure. Measure exclusions are noted on the Home Health Quality Measure Tables and in the Home Health Quality Measure User's Manual (found on the Home Health Quality Reportin g Program website.) Examples - Outcome Measures Quality Measure Name Consumer Language (on Care Compare) Measure Description Measure Focus (Numerator) OASIS Items Used in Measure Calculation Improvement in Ambulation - Locomotion How often patients got better at walking or moving around. Percentage of home health quality episodes during which the patient improved in ability to ambulate.

Percentage of home health quality episodes during which patients improved or stayed the same in ability to groom self. Number of home health quality episodes where the value recorded on the discharge assessment indicates the same or less impairment in grooming themselves at discharge than at start (or resumption) of care. Items Used to Compute Change: (M1800) Grooming. Items Used to Compute Exclusions: (M1700) Cognitive Functioning (M1710) When Confused (M1720) When Anxious PROCESS MEASURES Process quality measures evaluate the rate of home health agency use of specific evidence -based processes of care. The standardized home health quality process measures focus on high-risk, high-volume, problem-prone areas for home health care. These include measures pertaining to all or most home care patients, such as timeliness of home care admission/resumption of care and immunization rates. Appendix F OASIS and Quality Improvement OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 390 Process items represent actions taken by home health care providers that are designed to favorably impact patient outcomes. An example of a process measure is the percentage of home health quality episodes during which patients received the influenza immunization for the current flu season. An agency rate of 72% for that measure means that the agency's process of caring for patients included the recommended practice in 72% of the included quality episodes. The processes of care items in OASIS have been carefully developed to represent \"eviden ce-based\" practice. MEASURE EXCLUSIONS FOR PROCESS MEASURES The majority of the OASIS- based process measures have measure -specific exclusions. Exclusions are specific to each measure. For example, the process measure of \"Influenza Immunization Received for Current Flu Season\" excludes quality episodes in which no care was provided during October 1-March 31, or the patient died, or the patient does not meet age/condition guidelines for influenza vaccine. Quality episodes that are excluded are not counted favorably or unfavorably toward the measure calculation.

Today, agencies may decide to use other quality improvement methodologies in addition to or in place of OBQI. Examples include Six Sigma, Lean Methodology, and PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act). Appendix F OASIS and Quality Improvement OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 391 Although agencies may choose not to use the original OBQI process, many of the steps within OBQI are relevant to home health quality improvement today. A cyclical and ongoing quality improvement process may include the following steps: 1.Review Quality Measure Reports 2.Select Quality Measures \u2014for focused quality improvement activities 3.Investigate Care Processes (related to measures selected for quality improvement) 4.Develop a Plan of Action (a.k.a., Quality Improvement Plan) 5.Implement the Plan 6.Monitor the Plan 7.Revise/Update the Plan - as needed A majority of current home health quality measures are based on OASIS data. In addition to the OASIS- based quality measures, there are home health quality measures derived from Medicare FFS claims data and Home Health CAHPS\u00ae (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) data. Some agencies may have access to additional quality measures through their health system or payer affiliations, through other programs (such as benchmarking vendors, state collaboratives, etc.), or quality reports generated from their electronic health records. Home health agencies are encouraged to use any of these information sources in systematic efforts to continuously monitor and improve the care provided to their patients. However, CMS cannot provide guidance on data, analysis, or reports from software or data benchmarking from other sources such as software vendors or data benchmarking companies. QUALITY EPISODES Quality episodes are used in the calculation of the quality measures. Quality episodes are not the same as certification periods or Patient-Driven Groupings Model (PDGM) payment periods. A quality episode begins with either a Start of Care or Resumption of Care assessment and ends with a Transfer, Death at home, or Discharge assessment. A quality episode does not include Recertification (follow -up) or Other Follow-up assessments and may span payment periods. A quality episode is measured from: Start o f Care to the Transfer OR Start o f Care to the Death at Home OR Start o f Care to the Discharge Resumpt ion of Care to the Transfer OR Resumpt ion of Care to the Death at Home OR Resumpt ion of Care to the Discharge For example, let's look at a patient who was admitted on 1/1/23 and transferred to an inpatient facility on 1/15/23, then had a resumption of care on 1/20/23 and was discharged from the agency on 2/1/23. In this example, this patient had two quality episodes. The first quality episode began with the start of care on 1/1/23 and ended with the transfer to an inpatient facility on 1/15/23. The second quality episode began with the resumption of care on 1/20/23 and ended with the discharge on 2/1/23. CALCULATING QUALITY MEASURES Measuring quality first begins at the patient- level. Outcome measures indicate the change in patient status f rom one point in time to another point in time. For the OASIS- based quality measures, we use the OASIS items for Appendix F OASIS and Quality Improvement OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 392 this calculation. To calculate quality measures, we also need to understand the measure definition for each individual measure. The Quality Measure Tables found on the CMS Home Health Quality Reporting Program website include information on the measure numerator, denominator, and measure exclusions for each home health quality measure ( https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality in Dyspnea\" quality measure is the \"Percentage of home health quality episodes during which the patient became less short of breath or dyspneic.\" OASIS Item(s) Used in Quality Measure Calculation: The quality measure is calculated using the OASIS item: (M1400) When is the patient dyspneic? (M1400) When is the patient dyspneic or noticeably Short of Breath? 0 - Patient is not short of breath 1 - When walking more than 20 feet, climbing stairs 2 - With moderate exertion (for example, while dressing, using commode or bedpan, walking distances less than 20 feet) 3 - With minimal exertion (for example, while eating, talking, or performing other ADLs) or with agitation 4 - At rest (during day or night) Measure Exclusions: The first step in calculating quality measures is to determine the patients that are eligible for the measure. In this example, this quality measure excludes home health quality episodes for which the patient, at start/resumption of care, was not short of breath at any time, and also excludes quality episodes that end with inpatient facility transfer or death. Therefore, for this quality measure, all patients who at start of care or resumption of care are scored a \"0 - Patient is not short of breath\" on OASIS are excluded from this quality measure because the patient cannot improve. If the patient cannot improve, then Improvement in Dyspnea is not computed. Quality episodes that end with death are also excluded and quality episodes that end with a transfer to an inpatient facility are excluded. Quality episodes that are excluded are not counted favorably or unfavorably toward the quality measure calculation. Improvement: To improve in this quality measure, a patient must move from a higher numeric score on the OASIS response scale at start of care or resumption of care to a lower numeric score at discharge (e.g., M1400 start of care score of \"3\" and discharge score of \"2\" would be an improvement). The following table depicts how an individual patient's score at the beginning of a quality episode (start of care or resumption of care) and at the end of a quality episode (discharge for this quality measure) would be calculated for the Improvement in Dyspnea measure: OASIS RESPONSES & QUALITY MEASURE CALCULATION FOR IMPROVEMENT IN DYSPNEA MEASURE Start of Care OR Resumption of Care Discharge Calculation 0 0-4 Excluded Appendix F OASIS and Quality Improvement OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 393 Start of Care OR Resumption of Care Discharge Calculation 1 0 Improved 1 1-4 Did Not Improve 2 0-1 Improved 2 2-4 Did Not Improve 3 0-2 Improved 3 3-4 Did Not Improve 4 0-3 Improved 4 4 Did Not Improve Agency \"Improvement in Dyspnea\" Observed Rate : In determining the agency rate for each outcome measure, we also need to understand the definitions for the quality measure numerator and denominator. The numerator for this quality measure is the number of ca ses where improvement occurred. In the \"Improvement in Dyspnea\" measure, the numerator is number of home health quality episodes where the discharge assessment indicates less dyspnea at discharge than at start (or resumption) of care. The denominator is the entire population (i.e., patients who improved and who did not improve) for the quality measure. Therefore, the denominator is every patient in the reporting period that is not excluded from the measure. In the \"Improvement in Dyspnea\" quality measure, the denominator is the number of home health quality episodes ending with a discharge during the reporting period, other than those covered by generic or measure- specific exclusions. (Remember that for the \"Improvement in Dyspnea\" quality measure, home heal th quality episodes for which the patient, at start/resumption of care, was not short of breath at any time, are excluded from this quality measure as are quality episodes that end in transfer to an inpatient facility or death.) Sample Agency Calculation: If an agency had 100 patients during the reporting period that were discharged from the agency, and 10 of these patients scored \"0\" at start of care/resumption of care on M1400 (and therefore were excluded) and 70 of the remaining 90 patients improved in dyspnea (moved from a higher numeric score on M1400 to a lower numeric score), then 70/90 (or 0.777) which equals 77.77% scored favorably or improved in dyspnea.

MEASURING STABILIZATION In our example, we noted that with improvement in OASIS-based quality measures, the patient's status moved from a higher numeric score (at start of care or resumption of care) on the OASIS response scale to a lower numeric score (at discharge). A number of OASIS -based quality measures are calculated for \"improvement\" and/or \"stabilization.\" For example, there is a measure for \"Improvement in Bathing\" and there is also a quality measure for \"Stabilization in Bathing.\" How then is \"stabilization\" measured? Fo r the OASIS -based quality measures, stabilization is calculated as all patients who did not worsen for the measure. Stabilization includes all patients who remain numerically the same on the OASIS response scale (i.e., \"stabilized\") from start of care or resumption of care to discharge AND all patients who improved (moved from a higher numeric score to a lower numeric score). Appendix F OASIS and Quality Improvement OASIS- E Guidance Manual Effective 1/1/2023 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 394 As the stabilization quality measures include all patients who have stabilized AND all patients who have improved, the measure rates for the stabilization quality measures are much higher than the corresponding improvement quality measure rates. For example, at the time of development of this manual, the \"Improvement in Bathing\" national reference rate was approximately 82%. However, the \"Stabilization in Bathing\" national reference rate was approximately 98% as the stabilization rate includes patients who numerically stay the same for OASIS M1830 AND patients who numerically improve in the OASIS M1830 score. OASIS & QUALITY MEASURE REPO RTS CMS provides several quality measure reports. Home health agencies can obtain these reports from iQIES. Information on obtaining OASIS-based quality measure reports can be found on CMS's QIES Technical Support Office (QTSO) website https://www.qtso.cms.gov/hhatrain.html. Report Title Report Description Report Uses 1.Agency Patient -Related Characteristics (Case Mix) ReportThe average value of each OASIS patient -related characteristics (patient attributes or circumstances) measure for quality episodes that ended during a specified period for the agency, along with national observed values for the same period. Agencies can use this report as a companion to their Outcome Report and their Process Measures Report. 2. Outcome Report End Results Outcome measures, Utilization Outcome measures, and Claims Based Outcome measures are reported; End Results Outcomes are computed only for quality episodes ending with a discharge from agency (RFA = 09); OASIS -based utilization Outcome is computed for quality episodes ending with a transfer to an inpatient facility (RFA = 06 or 07), or a discharge from the agency (RFA = 09); Significance levels are presented for each quality measure when the sample size corresponding to the quality measure is at least 10. If the agency had nine or fewer patients on whom the outcomemeasure could be computed validly, statistical significance is not provided.Agencies can use this report to monitor their outcome measures. Agencies are encouraged to review this report no less frequently than quarterly and may choose to review monthly.

Home Health Review and Correct ReportsThese reports are available quarterly and then updated weekly to provide confidential agency -level and patient - level performance for the OASIS - based publicly reported quality measures. Agencies can use these reports in conjunction with the other iQIES quality measure reports to determine if they have any data submission errors that may affect agency -level pe rformance for one or more of the quality measures. RISK ADJUSTMENT OF QUALITY MEASURES Change in health status over a time interval during which care is provided (e.g., a quality episode) can occur either as a result of the care provided or the natural progression of disease and disability. The challenge in outcome analysis is to attempt to somehow separate changes due to care from those due to natural progression. Statistical risk adjustment refers to a collection of analytic methods designed to separate the relationship of outcomes with care provided from the relationship of outcomes with natural progression of disease and disability, which is critical to accurate outcome analysis. One of the major purposes of OASIS is to provide data items needed for risk adjustment. In essence, the general intent of risk adjustment is to compensate or adjust for differences in case mix or risk factors (between agency and a comparison sample) that should be taken into consideration if outcomes are to be compared validly. Risk adjustment compensates or controls for the potential influence of case mix variables (i.e., risk factors) that can affect outcomes. The OASIS -based quality measures are calculated using items from the OASIS assessments from Medicare FFS, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and Medicaid Managed care. For a set of these quality measures a logistic regression prediction model is created. Hundreds of risk factors are tested in development of the prediction models. Risk models are quality measure specific. A rigorous, multi-step process is followed that includes clinical review of the scientifically identified risk factors. Hence, the result of applying this prediction model for any episode of care is, in fact, the predicted value based on this logistic regression equation. A subset of the OASIS-based outcome quality measures is risk adjusted. The OAS IS-based process quality measures are not risk adjusted. Additional information on home health risk adjustment methodology is available on the CMS Home Health Quality Reporting Program website and in the Home Health Quality Reporting Program Measure Calculations and Reporting User's Manual found in the Quality Measures section of the Home Health Quality Reporting Program website.
