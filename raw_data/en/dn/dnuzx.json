Cities are our lives now, with [ urban areas serving as home to 84 percent of Americans](http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/us-cities-factsheet). In the brief history of our country, we've lost touch with nature and, perhaps more problematic, we've lost the space needed for nature to exist in our everyday lives. In 1790 [ the average number of Americans living in a square mile was 4.5](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf). By 1950, that number had grown nearly tenfold to 42.6. Today, it stands at a [ claustrophobic 92.9](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183475/united-states-population-density/). Now that nature isn't the norm, we don't prioritize let alone validate the human need for connection with trees, mountains, water, and sand - we prioritize the convenience of modernity. Most of us dismiss touching a tree as a way to reconnect with and heal ourselves, this despite [ our deep history as naturephiles](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_modern_life_became_disconnected_from_nature) and mounting evidence that nature is an effective tool to combat cancer, anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, ADHD, and stress. \"It's in our DNA,\" says Brooke Moran, professor of recreation and outdoor education, Western Colorado University. \"There are studies from all over the world that show the outdoors equals health.\" Studies vary about how much time it takes to reap the benefits, but with only 15 minutes spent in nature, Moran says there's [ a reduction in cortisol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21996763/) - the body's main stress hormone. \"The longer you stay out, of course, the better the benefits. Being in nature allows us to focus our senses. We're not looking at screens or hearing all the man-made noises in the world.\" Moran points to studies that show the ways nature can positively impact our health, including [ improving short-term memory by 20](https://www.spring.org.uk/2009/01/memory-improved-20-by-nature-walk.php) percent, [ increasing levels of Vitamin D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356951/), [ improving sleep quality](https://time.com/4656550/camping-sleep-insomnia/), [ decreasing anxiety and depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20337470/), [ lowering blood sugar in diabetics](https://www.ontrackdiabetes.com/live-well/diabetes-management/diabetes-ecotherapy-could-walk-nature-improveyour-blood-sugar), [ reducing inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22948092/), and even [ increasing creativity](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02225.x). \"It literally goes on and on and on,\" she says. How does nature provide these types of human therapies? \"I see nature as healing because of the conductive support the earth provides the human body,\" says [ Laura Koniver, MD,](https://www.intuition-physician.com/) author of The Earth Prescription. \"The earth pulses out an electromagnetic frequency - known as the Schumann Resonance - and the human body is fully conductive. Every single cell in our entire body becomes immediately grounded whenever we physically touch the earth directly. [ Twenty years of medical studies on grounding](https://www.intuition-physician.com/safe-grounding/) show that when we are connected to the earth's energy, our bodies naturally go into a healing state. Everything from our brain waves to our muscle tension to our heartbeat responds in a healing way to grounding.\" Perhaps we should touch a tree, stat. 'Bathing' in forests and mountains Mountains and forests are life-giving resources. The [ Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/why-mountains-matter-more-than-you-think/) reports that mountains host 25 percent of the biodiversity on earth, 28 percent of the earth's forests, and provide between 60-80 percent of the world's fresh water. Higher altitudes also have been found to cause [ weight loss without the need for exercise](https://www.wired.com/2010/02/high-altitude-weight-loss/) and reduce the risk of [ developing heart disease](https://jech.bmj.com/content/66/7/e17). \"We can learn that forests are an amazing resource,\" says Dr. Qing Li, author Forest Bathing: How Trees Can Help You Find Health and Happiness. \"They give us everything we rely on in order to exist. They produce oxygen, cleanse the air we breathe, and purify our water. They stop flooding rivers and streams and the erosion of mountains and hills. They provide us with food, clothing, and shelter, and with the materials we need for furniture and tools. In addition to this, forests have always helped us to heal our wounds and to cure our diseases.\" In response, Japanese researchers developed the concept of forest bathing in an effort to prevent the effects of lifestyle-related diseases. According to Dr. Li, shinrin in Japanese means \"forest\" and yoku means \"bath\", thus shinrin-yoku means bathing in the forest atmosphere, or taking in the forest through our senses. \"This is not exercise, or hiking, or jogging,\" he says. \"It is simply being in nature, connecting with it through our sense of sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Shinrin-yoku is like a bridge. By opening our senses, it bridges the gap between us and the natural world.\" Li says people can enjoy shinrin-yoku through five senses: Sight Gazing upon green color and lush forest landscapes Smell Inhaling the scents and fragrance of wooded areas Hearing Listening to forest sounds and birds' songs Touch Touching trees, putting your whole body in the forest atmosphere Taste Eating foods from the forest, tasting the fresh air in forest \"It is a total effect of the five senses,\" he says. \"However, the sense of smell is the key elements of forest bathing because of the effect of phytoncides [a substance released by plants and trees, generally meaning the aroma of the forest]. As we walk slowly through the forest, seeing, listening, smelling, tasting, and touching, we bring our rhythms into step with nature,\" says Dr. Li. All you need is access to a forest and an open mind. Forest bathing isn't a one-size-fits all solution, Dr. Li says. For some, healing will come from the sound of water flowing over pebbles in a stream or squirrels chattering to each other in the branches. For others, it's the scent of pine needles or the sight of the forest bursting into green at the beginning of spring. \"You also can reconnect with nature simply by the act of being there,\" he says. \"And yes - you should leave technology behind.\" The healing effects of water and sand Unlike the majestic, tree- and rock-covered terrain of mountains and forests, oceans and deserts offer something even scarcer to city dwellers - vast, open spaces. Deserts provide watercolor skies and sand-painted horizons seemingly without end, imbued with peculiar-looking plants, trees, and wildlife. Oceans, [ which produce at least half of earth's oxygen](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ocean-oxygen.html), appear limitless: the salt-water air, the sound of waves and tides rolling with the rhythms of the earth, the shores that extend beyond definition. Feet on the sand and hands in the water reconnect us to our power source - earth. \"Staying ungrounded all day and all night, year after year after year, without ever touching the earth is like using your cell phone battery down to nothing and then never plugging it back in and recharging it,\" Dr. Koniver says. \"We get frustrated and wonder why our body experiences pain, discomfort, inflammation, muscle tension, immune and metabolic dysfunction, and other issues, yet we never boost our body's resiliency through conductive support.\" She says reversing this is simple and instantaneous - simply touch the earth outside and you will be grounded, conductively supported by the earth's healing energy. Many natural destinations also draw people on a spiritual level. Spiritual vortexes Sedona, Arizona is an area thought be brimming with healing energy, [ especially from its infamous so-called vortexes](https://visitsedona.com/spiritual-wellness/what-is-a-vortex/). Millions of visitors each year make the trek - most notably to the vortexes found at Airport Mesa, Cathedral Rock, Bell Rock, and Boynton Canyon - to absorb the energy, meditate, and recharge. Joshua Tree National Park in California, host to [ three million people annually](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/national-parks/2019/10/31/joshua-tree-national-park-celebrates-25th-anniversary/4115405002/), is the intersection of the Mojave and Colorado deserts. The Joshua trees themselves were reportedly named by Mormon settlers for their resemblance to the Biblical story of Joshua reaching his hands to the sky. With roots that grow up to 38 feet into the earth, they've crawled their way through sand and rock over thousands of years and in the harshest of elements in search of water. They keep moving and pushing in an effort to survive at any cost. These iconic places often force us to acknowledge our small yet vital part in the world at large - we are simply one of the countless living elements that rely on earth for every aspect of our existences. \"You will find the importance of reconnecting with nature,\" says Dr. Li. \"You will find that we are part of the natural world. Our rhythms are the rhythms of nature.\" Dr. Koniver says making skin-to-skin contact with natural elements is the one true way to reconnect and recharge. \"Rubber is non-conductive, so rubber-soled shoes mean even if you are standing on the earth you are not grounded,\" she says. \"And most clothing is made from polyester blends, spandex, viscose, etc., and they all block grounding too, so your jacket, socks, pants, and exercise gear, mean even if you are outside laying on the earth, you are not grounded. You can actually be outside day and night camping, feeling totally immersed and surrounded by nature and still you will be completely disconnected.\" Simply taking off your shoes to walk on the ground or reaching out to touch a tree with your bare hand can help you connect with nature and reap the benefits of its energy. It's now-or-never for nature time Given the state of the world, perhaps there's never been a better time to set aside any lingering judgment and finally touch that tree or listen to the waves with bare feet in the sand - not just to heal ourselves, but to heal our earth. Dr. Koniver believes the most positive thing that has come out of this pandemic is how our collective \"forced pause\" has allowed people across the world to see that our wellness depends on the wellness of the planet. \"When we stop and pause, the planet heals. People are hearing birds singing again, noticing that springtime trees and flowers are waking up more vibrantly than ever before, the air is clearing as traffic decreases, global emissions are dropping dramatically, the water in rivers and bays are clearer, and consumerism and competition becomes obsolete as health and wellness become our deepest treasure. When we take healing the earth seriously we also take our own health seriously, and there is no better time to connect to our planet to support our collective healing than right now.\" Matthew M. F.
