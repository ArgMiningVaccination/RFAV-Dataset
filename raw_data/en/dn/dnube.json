Total research funding in the department was $6,305,292 (total costs). Although this is still a very healthy level of funding i t represents a decline of almost 17% from 2010- 2011. Based on the latest available data, our department was ranked 19th nationally in research funding among all public University Physiology Departments and 31st among 127 public and private medical schools. Nearly every faculty member's research program was supported by major external funding. It is a tribute to the dedication and talent of our faculty that the department has continued to do so well in spite of the increasing difficult federal and private r esearch funding environment. EDUCATION: Dr. Tarr continued to serve as Director of Medical Education in the department and director of two modules of the medical curriculum - Cardiopulmonary and Renal -Endocrine. To the credit of all the individual facul ty instructors and particularly to Merrill, the Cardiopulmonary and Renal -Endocrine modules were both rated highly by the students. This was again another very successful year in terms of teaching awards. At the \"Grande Affair\" celebration in April, Dr. J ohn Wood and Dr. Gustavo Blanco were recognized for excellence in teaching. They each won the Student Voice Award for \"Outstanding Lecturer\" in the first year of the medical curriculum. This continues what is now many consecutive years for each of them winning this award. We congratulate both John and Gustavo on their teaching success. And once again this year our department was the recipient of the \"Outstanding Module in the First Year\" award which went to Cardio- pulmonary. Dr. Tarr serves as director of this module and he deserves a lot of credit for its success. MORE STATE RESCISSIO N: The rescission continued this year with our department returning another 2% of state funding. This continues to be a painful exercise that has resulted in permanent elimination of faculty and staff positions. We look forward to better times in the future and hopefully a year with no more rescissions. TENURE TRACK APPOINTMENTS: We are pleased and excited to have added Dr. Shahid Umar to the department as a new associate professor. In addition to his appointment in our department, Shahid is a key member of the University of Kansas Cancer Center. Shahid's research is focused on the role of bacterial infection in colonic crypt hyperplasia, inflammation and cancer. He is also actively involved in chemoprevention studies. The colonic crypt model he developed provides an excellent opportunity to study the effect of dietary interventions on signaling pathways that affect mucosal priming for neoplasia and whether targeting these pathways may help ameliorate colitis or cancer. Shahid is a key member of a new thematic area within our department focusing on the pathophysiology of cancer. 2 RESEARCH TRACK APPOINTMENTS : There were no new appointments to the research track during the year. JOINT AND ADJUNCT APPOINTMENTS : Robyn Honea, Ph.D., was approved for a joint appointment as assistant professor in our department beginning July 1st, 2012. Robyn's primary appointment is assistant professor in Neurology. She is a neuroscientist who uses a variety of neuroimaging approaches to investigate brain aging and various aspects of neurodegenerative disease. FACULTY PROMOTIONS: Congratulations to Dr. Gustavo Blanco who was promoted to full professor. Dr. Blanco's work focuses on the Na,K -ATPase and its role in kidney function as well as sperm motility and its relevance to contraception. Also, congratulations to Dr. Phil Lee who was promoted to associate professor with tenure. Phil is also a key member of the Hoglund Brain Imaging Center. Phil's research interest is imaging approaches to understanding and diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. He also serves as a co- investigator on numerous grants bringing imaging methodology to bear on a wide range of research questions concerning the normal and diseased brain. FACULTY/STAFF DEPARTURES: Dr. Merrill Tarr retire d after a long and distinguished career . After 44 years and 88 days of service to the Physiology Department, Merrill Tarr officially retired from his position as Professor and Director of Medical Education in the department. As a physiologist, Merrill made numerous outstanding research contributions with landmark papers on single cardiac cell electrophysiology and mechanics. Later in his career, he focused on the medical education program of the department and excelled in every respect. He served as director of the Cardiopulmonary and Renal -endocrine modules for many y ears and under his leadership these modules have been outstanding. A tribute to Merrill's efforts is the fact that the Cardio- pulmonary module once again won the best module of the first year award from Student Voice, continuing a winning streak that has been going on for several years. We wish Merrill the best in retirement. He will be missed. FACULTY AWARDS/ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Numerous members of our faculty served on NIH grant review panels, editorial boards for journals and gave invited lectures at other Universities and at national and international meetings. GRADUATE PROGRAM AND PHYSIOLOGY SOCIETY: The graduate students in the department had another active year. The \"Physiology Society\" leadership included Valentine Agbor as President, David Guggenmos as Vice President and Will Messamore as Social Event Coordinator. We are very pleased with the growth of the graduate program in Physiology. In July of 2011, 7 new students were recruited to the department. Including students who are working at Stowers with faculty members who have their academic appointment in Physiology, we now have 40 doctoral students actively enrolled in the department. 3 New Students - Fall 2011 Swathi Iyer - Dr. Tomoo Iwakuma Jessica Kay - Dr. Scott Hawley (Stowers) Wei-Ting Hung - Dr. Lane Christenson Lei Pei - Dr. Alan Yu Robert Rogers - Dr. Paige Geiger New Students - Spring 2012 Amy Cantilena - Dr. Buddhadeb Dawn John McGinnis - Dr. Kausik Si (Stowers) Four students completed their degrees during the year.

Collaborations with Dr. Sam Kim (Ob/Gyn) and Dr. Brian Petroff (Medicine) are ongoing and explore the impact of chemotherapy, radiation, and endocrine disruptors on the function of the mammalian ovary. Projects underway include (1) the role of stem cells in the generation of germ line and somatic lineages in the ovary, (2) optimizing methodologies for the cryopreservation of oocytes and ovarian tissue, (3) establishing mechanisms that define oocyte and embryo quality as they pertain to assisted reproductive technologies and (4) defining modifications in cell cycle regulation that occur during the transition from meiosis to mitosis in the developing embryo.

My laboratory has been a leader in the identification of novel RNA binding protein proto- oncogenes and tumor suppressors. In addition, we have been leading the efforts on determining the mechanism by which natural and synthetic compounds affect cell signaling pathways in gastrointestinal cancer cells. My lab members primarily focus their work on gastrointestinal cancers.

Gustavo Blanco, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor Our laboratory studies the role of ion- transport proteins of the plasma membrane in cell function. Research is focused on the Na, K -ATPase, a plasma membrane enzyme system that uses the energy from ATP to establish high intracellular K+ and low intracellular Na+ concentrations which are essential for maintaining the proper function of cells. The Na,K -ATPase comprises a group of isozymes, each characterized by unique enzymatic properties and a cell -dependent and developmentally regulated pattern of expression. We are interested in the function of alpha4, a particular isoform of the catalytic subunit of the Na,K -ATPase that is selectively expressed in spermatozoa. We have found that this isoform, both in rats and humans has functional properties that are different f rom all other Na,K -ATPases. Alpha4 is expressed in the mid- piece of the sperm flagellum, and is important for sperm motility and fertility. A variety of molecular and cellular biology methods are being used to study the regulation, activity and mechanisms of action of alpha4 in sperm physiology. Also, we are searching for compounds that will inhibit alpha4 with the idea of using them as male contraceptive agents. These studies will help understand the importance of ion transport in male germ cell fertility and contraception. In addition, we are studying the role of the Na,K -ATPase in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Working with renal cells from patients with ADPKD and various mouse models of ADPKD, we have found that the Na,K -ATPase exhibits an abnormally increased sensitivity to ouabain, a hormone released by the adrenal glands. Importantly, ouabain stimulates cystogenesis in ADPKD cells and kidneys. Currently, we are investigating how ouabain affects cyst formation and progression in t he disease.

The spike (action potential) activity of single neurons is recorded in awake monkeys trained to perform various movement tasks. Computerized analysis techniques are used to reveal the functional contribution of a neuron or localized groups of neurons to movement. In another project, SIV infection in monkeys is used as model of neuro-AIDS. This model is used to investigate interactions between SIV infection and drugs of abuse using ne urobehavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical methods.

Chennathukuzhi, Ph.D. , Assistant Professor My research interests include uterine fibroids, fertilit y and contraception. Our laboratory is currently trying to understand the roles of GPR10, and its upstream regulator REST, in the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids. We identified that the loss of REST, a tumor suppressor protein, leads to the overexpression of GPR10 in fibroids. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing GPR10 in the myometrium in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of fibroids. Additionally, we have generated a conditional knockout mouse model for REST to understand it s role in the development of fibroids .

Christenson, Ph.D. , Associate Professor My research is focused on understanding the molecular processes of reproduction in order to enhance and inhibit fertility. My primary interest is focused on understanding the post -transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms (i.e., microRNA -mediated) that facilitate ovulation and luteinization of the ovarian follicle following the LH surge. These studies have identified LH -regulated microRNAs and their target transcripts; ultimately these genes may be useful in controlling fertility and/or underst anding diseases such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a major cause of human infertility. My laboratory also remains interested in understanding how cholesterol metabolism impacts ovarian function, we have established a collaborations with two other laboratories to pursue this line of study. In conjunction with Dr. Annabelle Rodiguez (John Hopkins) we currently are studying single nucleotide polymorphisms in the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) and the effects on cholesterol transport from H DL and LDL particles. Additionally, in conjunction with Dr. Brad Van Voorhis at U. of Iowa, we are identifying markers of embryo quality from spent medium of human in vitro fertilization (IVF) using high throughput proteomic approaches. Lastly, because of our interest in miRNA research, my laboratory has partnered with a clinician, Dr. Ajay Bansal at the Kansas City VA Hospital to use next generation sequencing and our established miRNA methods to identify biomarkers involved in the transition of gastric reflux disease (GERD) to the benign Barrett's Esophagus and ultimately esophageal cancer.

Geiger, Ph.D., Associate Professor Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. T2D is characterized by insulin resistance and is typically correlated with obesity and aging. In our lab, we study the molecular mechanisms underlying age- related and high fat diet -induced insulin resistance. We hypothesize that oxidative stress is responsible for inhibiting insulin signaling and for the impairment of glucose homeostasis. Stress kinases such as JNK and IKK - are activated by oxidative stress and have recently been implicated in inhibiting insulin signal transduction. Thus, we are examining the targeted inhibition of stress kinases to improve insulin sensitivity. We are also exploring therapeutic interventions such as heat therapy, exercise and anti -oxidant treatment in high fat-fed rats.

Gonzalez, M.D. , Professor My research centers on the mechanisms of adaptation of entire organisms to hypoxia. This includes the study of the effects of acute and chronic hypoxia, induced by a reduction on the levels of inspired oxygen, on each of the linked conductances of the oxygen transport system in resting and exercising animals, and the effects of exercise training on the strategies of acclimatization to hypoxia and their impact on the oxygen trans port system. Another important research line is the study of the underlying mechanisms of the microvascular inflammatory response to systemic hypoxia, which may have functional relevance to acute altitude diseases such as acute mountain sickness, high alt itude pulmonary edema and high altitude cerebral edema. Recent work in my laboratory has led to the novel observation that the ubiquitous inflammatory response to alveolar hypoxia is not triggered by the reduction of the local tissue PO 2, but rather by a m ediator, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein - 1 (MCP -1/CCL2) released by alveolar macrophages and transported by the circulation. Current research involves studies to evaluate the overall functional significance of this phenomenon in the adaptive strategies of entire animals to hypoxia. Committee Activities: Departmental Member, Promotion and Tenure Committee Editorial and Grant Reviews : Reviewer, The Journal of Applied Physiology Reviewer, Respiratory Physiology & Neurobiology Reviewer, Experimental Biology & Medicine Reviewer, Life Sciences Reviewer, American Journal of Physiology, Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology Reviewer, High Altitude Medicine and Biology Reviewer, International Journal of Sports Medicine Teaching Activities: Respiratory Physiology, Cardiopulmonary Module 5 lectures 2 small group meetings, Cardiopulmonary Module Trainees: Jie Chao - Graduate Student, received Ph.D. on August 20, 2010 Elizabeth Esco - Frontiers in Physiology Fellow 78 79 Vijayalaxmi Gupta, Ph.D. , Research Assistant Professor I joined the laboratory of Dr. Joseph Tash in 2007 after completing my Ph.D. on \"Molecular characterization of human sperm adhesion molecules using polyclonal/monoclonal antibody and their role in fertility\". With a bac kground in male reproductive physiology, The first project that I am working on is to synthesize and test reversible non- hormonal non- steroidal male contraceptive agents. Specifically, my role involves testing novel compounds (in- vitro as well in -vivo) as potential male contraceptives. I also work on determining the mechanism of action of potent compounds and facilitating toxicology, fertility studies for the compound likely to advance towards clinical trials. A second major research interest, concerns whether reproductive potential is affected by space flight. To this effect, we examined the effects of microgravity on the female reproductive tract of mice that were flown on the space shuttle on flights STS -131, STS - 133 and STS -135. Our studies on thes e three space shuttle missions were the first to examine the consequences of space flight on ovaries and uteri of mice. We found that with 12 -15 days of space- flight exposure, female mice showed significantly small ovaries. Histological analysis showed that flight mice ovaries had fewer corpora lutea and most of the growing follicles in flight ovaries were atretic, indicative of blocked estrous cycle. Ground and flight mice had no significant difference in number of uterine glands, but there was a trend to- ward smaller uteri in flight mice based on the gross pictures, which correlates with the low estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) level. This sets the foundation for our hypothesis that drop in estrogen in reproductive system may be the cause of other estrogen regulated effects seen in the body (bone and muscle loss, wound- healing, immune functions etc.) when exposed to space- flight.

Heckert, Ph.D. , Marion M. Osborn Professor for Reproductive Sciences The research in our laboratory focuses on the transcriptional and cell -signaling processes for proper function and development of the gonads. Sequence and structural information of the genome are queried to identify new proteins and regulatory pathways that direct cellular differentiation and gametogenesis, with the goal of extending our understanding of the mechanistic requirements for fertility as a means to improve the options for contraception as well as diagnosis and treatment of infertility. The curr ent research is focused primarily on genes that encode the follicle- stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and doublesex and mab- 3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1). FSHR is required for cells to respond to the pituitary hormone FSH and thus hormone signaling occurs only in cells that produce the receptor. FSHR expression is highly cell - specific, limiting FSH response to only somatic cells of the gonads. DMRT1 is a transcription factor that is essential for male fertility. It is found only in the testi s, where it is required for the differentiation and survival of both germ cells and Sertoli cells. Molecular approaches, comparative genomics, and transgenic mouse models are used to explore events regulating gene expression and function and high- throughput screening for inhibitors of DMRT1 binding. Project goals are to identify: 1) genomic and transcriptional requirements for cell -specific expression of Fshr, 2) DMRT1 binding sites in the genome of germ cells and Sertoli cells, their associated DMRT1 tar get genes and biological pathways, and 3) identify small molecule inhibitors of DMRT1 as potential contraceptive agents.

Meetings Attended: July 9 -27, 2012 - Spinal Cord Injury Research Training Program, Ohio State University 84 85 T. Rajendra Kumar, Ph.D. , Associate Professor Our laboratory studies developmental genetics of the mammalian pituitary -gonadal axis using both gain- of-function (transgenic) and loss -of-function (gene knockout) approaches. These unique genetic models mimic many of the human diseases and thus enable us to experimentally track them both in time and space. Specific projects include mechanisms of origin and development of human pituitary null cell tumors, mechanisms of secretion of pituitary gonadotropins, and delineating mechanisms of gonadotropin regulation of testis and ovarian development and function, with a special emphasis on how male germline stem cell niche regulat es male germ cell development and maintenance. These studies are clinically relevant and have significant impact in understanding the physiology and pathology of the mammalian reproductive axis including abnormal reproductive tract development, infertility , and cancer of the pituitary and gonads.

Nudo, Ph.D. , Professor & Director of the Landon Center on Aging Our laboratory is studying the brain's capacity for self -repair after damage. We utilize a non-human primate model of stroke recovery to determine the neurophysiologic, neuroanatomic, and biochemical bases for recovery. By tracking changes in the structure and function of motor areas of the cerebral cortex as a result of a focal vascular infarct, we are beginning to describe the cascade of events that give rise to the reorganized brain. We are also studying novel forms of treatment in chronic stroke to enhance and accelerate the recovery process. These treatment interventions include both physiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or device- based approaches, either alone or in combination. It is our goal to translate directly the information we gain through brai n plasticity research into effective clinical applications.

Current experimental MEG studies are focusing on the correlation between brain activity and behavioral profiles in autism spectrum disorders. Another area of research focuses on multi -channel biomagnetic recordings of the fetal heart activity. We are developing computational approaches to the analysis of fetal magnetocardiograp hic (fMCG) signals, using realistic volume conductor models derived from ultrasound images of the fetal -maternal anatomy. Our goal is to develop fMCG into a reliable technique for monitoring fetal heart electrophysiology and for early identification and diagnosis of congenital heart anomalies.

Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by RNA binding protein is a crucial mechanism in regulating the timing and the amount of expression of genes. Growing evidence indicate that the alteration of the expression and function of RNA binding proteins could potentially play a role in inflammation and cancer. Hence, it is indispensable to identify the RNA binding protein alterations accumulate during cancer progression as well as during the acquisition of metastatic potential in cancer cells. To understand the mechanisms behind the process of hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in metastasis. Metastasis entails the spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor throughout the body through the blood or lymphatic systems. Hence, blocking angiogenesis could be a strategy to arrest tumor growth. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis processes and their regulation will lea d to the discovery of pharmaceutical agents with anti -angiogenic activity.

Treatment and prevention of colon cancer is often unsuccessful and has an extremely high morbidity rate. T he major feature of solid tumors is hypoxia; the decreased availability of oxygen has been shown to increase chemotherapy resistance thereby favoring tumor progression. Hypoxia and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) stabilize HIF -1 (hypoxia inducible protein- 1), a endothelial factor (VEGF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase HSP90 inhibitors inhibit the expression of VEGF and iNOS suggesting that HSP90 is a critical player in HIF -1 mediated expression of these genes. My research focuses on understanding the mechanism of hypoxia- mediated regulation of cancer stem cells and the effect of hypoxia on on hypoxia inducible factor. In addition, to determine the effect of natural HSP90 inhibitors, celastrol and triptolide on the growth and tumor formation of cancer stem cells.

In turn, target cells provide molecular signals that govern the quantity and type of innervation they receive. Our research is concerned with this interplay between nerve and target in a variety of systems including the cardiovascular system, skin, and reproductive tract. We are particularly interested in the factors to regulate the densi ty of innervation of peripheral targets, and how abnormal increases in axon numbers can lead to pain syndromes associated with high estrogen status or low vitamin D.

Tash, Ph.D. , Professor, Director of U54 Interdisciplinary Center for Male Contraceptive Research & Drug Development My interests and involvement in research in reproductive biology and signal transduction began during my undergraduate years and have continued to the present time. I have felt for a long time that effective solutions to the problem of human overpopulation must include new male contraceptive approaches. Towards this end, a long term research goal is to understand the mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis, and the development and expression of sper m motility and fertility. This knowledge can be used to identify targets in sperm or the testis that could be used for development of male contraceptive agents.

Wolfe, Ph.D., Associate Professor Summary of Research: Proper regulation of the hypothalamo- pituitary -gonadal axis as well as development and regulation of the placenta are essential to mammalian reproduction. Research in my laboratory is directed towards understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pituitary and placenta function as well as tissue-specific and endocrine regulation of genes encoding hormones within these tissues. This involves studying the mechanisms regulating cell differentiation, elucidation of transcription factors regulating basal expression, and identifying the signal transduction pathways involved in gonadotropin- releasing hormone, retinoid, growth factor, cytokine and adipokine regulation of gene expression.

Wood, Ph.D. , Associate Professor Microvascular inflammation occurs in a variety of clinical settings and is a significant contributor to patient mortality in these situations. I am working with faculty and resident s in the Department of Surgery to study mechanisms involved in microvascular injury in hemorrhagic shock. I have continued my collaboration with Dr. Gonzalez, who examines mechanisms of microvascular inflammation during systemic hypoxia. I am also collab orating with Dr. Janet Pierce on a project studying the effect of coenzyme Q10, an antioxidant, on inflammation after shock/resuscitation. O ur major goal is to examine potential novel therapies to attenuate microvascular injury that may prove clinically r elevant.
