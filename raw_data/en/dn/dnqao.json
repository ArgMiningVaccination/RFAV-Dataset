The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)is a national program thatmonitors the safety ofvaccines after they are licensed. VAERS is managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). VAERS is part of a larger system that makes sure that vaccines are safe and work as intended. Steps to make sure that vaccinesare safe begin before a vaccine is licensed and continue afterward. Before a vaccine islicensed, FDA requires that it go throughextensive safety testing. After a vaccine islicensed,VAERS is used to watch for anyproblems, or \"adverse events,\" that happenafter vaccination. Even though careful andcomplete studies are done before a vaccine islicensed, rare side effects may not be founduntil a vaccine is given to millions of peoplewith different backgrounds and medicalhistories. VAERS helps to make sure that thebenefits of vaccines continue to be far greaterthan the risks. There are things that VAERS cannot do. VAERS cannot prove that a vaccine either did cause ordid not cause a problem. In fact, vaccines arenot the cause of many of the problemsreported to VAERS. Sometimes people whoget vaccinated coincidentally will get sick fromsome other cause\u2014they get a stomachache,cold, or flu\u2014and it has nothing to do with thevaccine. Rarely, people who have been vaccinated will get unexpected reactions thatare serious and should be reported to VAERS. Even though VAERS cannot prove that a vaccine caused a problem, it can give FDA andCDC important information that might signal aproblem. If it looks as though a vaccine mightbe causing a problem, FDA and CDC willinvestigate further. Does VAERS Provide Medical Advice? No,VAERS does not provide medical advice. For medical advice, please contact your healthcare provider or state health department. Who Can Report to VAERS? Anyone can report to VAERS. FDA and CDCencourage patients, parents, and others to report any significant problems experiencedafter vaccination, even if they are not certainthat a vaccine caused them. T o report a possible problem after vaccination,visit the VAERS web siteat www .vaers.org. Also see the section in thisbrochure on \"How Do IReport?\"Why Should I Report to VAERS? Better reporting helps keep vaccines safe for youand your family, and for everyone who receives vaccinations. Each VAERS report providesvaluable information that helps FDA and CDCmake sure that vaccines are safe. The moreaccurate and complete the VAERS reports, thebetter the system works. Remember, novaccine (or any medicine) is completely free ofrisk and some side effects are possible. What T ypes of Events Should BeReported? Y ou should report any serious problem that happens after getting a vaccine, even if you arenot sure that the vaccine caused the problem.It is especially important to report any problemthat resulted in hospitalization, disability, ordeath.
