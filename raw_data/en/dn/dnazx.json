The clinical units include abdominal, breast, thyroid, reproductive, obstetrics, musculoskeletal, paediatric, neonatal, and vascular medical ultrasound. The course resources are provided mainly online. The material is structured to guide you through the material on a weekly schedule with exercises that ensure the course retains a clinical focus. The final year of the course focuses on developing research skills via an ultrasound research project in collaboration with clinical partners. Postgraduate - Course Commencement year This course entry applies to students commencing this course in 2018 and should be read in conjunction with information provided in the 'Faculty information' section of this Handbook by the Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences.

Award Master of Medical Ultrasound Alternative exits Graduate Certificate in Medical Ultrasound Graduate Diploma in Medical Ultrasound Refer to 'Alternative exits' entry below for further requirements and details. Notes This course is not available to international students who are holders of an Australian student visa, for study onshore in Australia. However holders of some other categories of Australian visas living in Australia, and students studying off-campus by distance learning (where this option is available) and living outside of Australia, may be eligible for this course. Description Outcomes These course outcomes are aligned with the [Australian Qualifications Framework level 9 and Monash Graduate Attributes](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/alignmentofoutcomes.html)Australian Qualifications Framework level 9 and Monash Graduate Attributes ( [http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/alignmentofoutcomes.html](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/alignmentofoutcomes.html)). Upon successful completion of this course it is expected that graduates will be able to: - demonstrate a mastery of ultrasound knowledge and be able to reflect critically on ultrasound theory, practice and scholarship - demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the scientific concepts and principles underpinning ultrasound practice including optimisation of equipment, quality assurance and biological consequences - investigate, analyse, synthesise and reflect on complex information, problems, concepts and theories and to apply this knowledge and understanding to ultrasound practice - assume the role of a qualified/accredited medical sonographer, capable of independent and collaborative clinical decision making to perform the appropriate ultrasound procedures to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of illness and injury - demonstrate and apply a knowledge of research principles, evidence based, reflective and ethical ultrasound practice, as well as lifelong learning skills - communicate their knowledge, findings and rationale underpinning these to the professional and lay community clearly, ethically and unambiguously. Professional recognition The course is accredited by the Australian Sonographers Accreditation Registry (ASAR). Structure The course is structured in three parts: Part A. Ultrasound foundation studies, Part B. Applied ultrasound practice and Part C. Ultrasound research. Part A. Ultrasound foundation studies These studies will develop your understanding of the scientific and technical principles of diagnostic ultrasound scanning and scanning modes. You will develop an understanding of embryology, anatomy and pathophysiology as well as image evaluation skills related to cross-sectional and regional anatomy. Part B. Applied ultrasound practice These studies address clinical competencies required for ultrasound practice. You will learn the sonographic scanning techniques, interpretational skills and standard protocols related to examinations of breast, thyroid, abdominal, reproductive system, obstetric, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems as well as the paediatric brain, hips and abdomen. Part C. Ultrasound research The focus of these studies is to develop the knowledge and skills to locate, critically evaluate and conduct research relevant to medical ultrasound practice. You will gain an understanding of research theories and methods for health research and will focus on a range of practical, technical and management issues associated with the conduct of scientific research. Access to academics and clinicians offering projects will support you during all stages of the inquiry process. You will gain theoretical knowledge of research design and methods used in undertaking research with the practical skills to conduct your own research. Requirements The course comprises 72 points structured into three parts: Part A. Ultrasound foundation studies (12 points), Part B. Applied ultrasound practice (36 points) and Part C. Ultrasound research (24 points). You must complete Part A and Part B to be accredited to practise as a sonographer in Australia. Prior to admission to the applied ultrasound practice units (after completion of [SON4000](/pubs/2018handbooks/units/SON4000.html) and [SON4010](/pubs/2018handbooks/units/SON4010.html)), you must provide evidence verifying that you are actively engaged in supervised clinical ultrasound practice for the equivalent of at least three days a week. The majority of units within this course are clinically based and you must find yourself a placement as a trainee sonographer. The University does not assist with this process. You need a placement as a trainee sonographer in order to gain the experience that is required to be competent in each of the study areas. We do not recommend that you apply for this course unless you are certain that you can secure a clinical placement.

Unless otherwise stated units are 6 credit points. Part A. Ultrasound foundation studies (12 points) You must complete: [SON4000](/pubs/2018handbooks/units/SON4000.html)Physics of medical ultrasound and instrumentation [SON4010](/pubs/2018handbooks/units/SON4010.html)Embryology, anatomy and pathophysiology Part B. Applied ultrasound practice (36 points) You must complete: [SON5020](/pubs/2018handbooks/units/SON5020.html)Sonographic professional skills and sonography of the breast and thyroid [SON5021](/pubs/2018handbooks/units/SON5021.html)Sonographic abdominal imaging [SON5022](/pubs/2018handbooks/units/SON5022.html)Sonographic imaging of the Part C. Ultrasound research (24 points) You must complete: Alternative exits You may exit this course early and apply to graduate with one of the following awards, provided you have satisfied the requirements indicated for that award during your enrolment in this master's course: - Graduate Certificate in Medical Ultrasound after successful completion of 24 credit points of study, with a minimum of 24 credit points at level 4 or above - Graduate Diploma in Medical Ultrasound* after successful completion of 48 credit points of study including all of Parts A and B. * * This meets the qualification requirement to gain accreditation with the Australian Sonographer Accreditation Registry (ASAR) to practice as a qualified sonographer in Australia.
