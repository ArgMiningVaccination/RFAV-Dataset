Key Facts Pfizer said the FDA granted the firm priority review for its vaccine candidate designed to protect newborns and infants up to six months of age against severe disease and complications from respiratory syncytial virus, known commonly as RSV. The decision means the agency aims to review the application within six months instead of the standard 10. The FDA has set an \"action date\" on the vaccine for August, Pfizer added. The FDA [reserves](https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/priority-review) priority review for drugs that promise \"significant improvements\" over existing efforts to combat \"serious\" diseases and no RSV vaccine has ever been approved in the U.S. Annaliesa Anderson, senior vice president and chief scientific officer for vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said the maternal vaccine \"would help protect infants at their first breath from the devastating effects of this infectious disease.\" What To Watch For Though Pfizer's maternal shot could be the first RSV vaccine that protects children to be approved in the U.S., it is unlikely to be the first RSV vaccine to be approved for the disease. While researchers have [struggled](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03704-y) for decades to develop an RSV vaccine without success, pharma firms are now [racing](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rsv-vaccine-candidates-timeline-fda-approval-rcna70777) to usher a number of promising candidates through the approval process. Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline appear to be the [two](https://www.ft.com/content/b7d40a54-3417-47b0-ba0f-22d329d1d09d) top contenders for first place with vaccines designed for use in older adults, who are also at risk from RSV. Tangent Pfizer is the only firm with a maternal vaccine\u2014used in pregnant people to protect the infant from birth\u2014in late stage development but it is not the only product that promises to protect young children against RSV. The FDA is currently evaluating an antibody [injection](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/shot-protect-babies-rsv-almost-kids-need-trouble-getting-rcna68982) from Sanofi and AstraZeneca that helps neutralize RSV in the bloodstream. The shot, not technically a vaccine, was approved in Europe in December. The FDA is expected to decide in the third quarter of 2023 and AstraZeneca [said](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2023/nirsevimab-us-regulatory-submission-accepted-for-the-prevention-of-rsv-lower-respiratory-tract-disease-in-infants-and-children.html) it is aiming to roll the shot out for the 2023/2024 RSV season. Key Background RSV is a [common respiratory virus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/10/28/rsv-infections-are-spiking-among-kids-and-swamping-childrens-hospitals---heres-what-parents-need-to-know/?sh=3b6d8f5c42f5) that infects [almost all](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/high-risk/infants-young-children.html) people by the time they are two years old. For most, the infection will cause nothing more than mild, cold-like symptoms like a runny nose, coughing, sneezing and fever, [according](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/about/symptoms.html) to the CDC, and will be easily shrugged off. For very young infants, older adults and people with compromised immune systems, however, RSV can be deadly. In young children, particularly those under two years of age, inflammation of the airways triggered by infection can be enough to close them off or make breathing [harder](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rsv-dangerous-babies-not-others-rcna56551). Though RSV does not kill large numbers of children in the U.S. each year\u2014it [kills](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Frsv%2Fresearch%2Fus-surveillance.html) between 100 and 300 children under five annually\u2014it does hospitalize many, and the numbers can overwhelm [struggling](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/10/28/rsv-infections-are-spiking-among-kids-and-swamping-childrens-hospitals---heres-what-parents-need-to-know/?sh=969a59942f5b) hospitals, which happened last year. Globally, RSV is the [biggest](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/73/Supplement_3/S229/6362482) [killer](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/rsv) of young infants after malaria.
