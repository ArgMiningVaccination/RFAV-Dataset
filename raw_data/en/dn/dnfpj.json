The reasoning behind Clean Gut The book argues that what we call diseases are really just different forms of survival mechanisms for our body. Before chronic disease comes systemic inflammation. But before systemic inflammation comes gut dysfunction. Gut damage from leaky gut (hyperpermeability) and dysbiosis allow toxins to enter the body and cause havoc. This book discusses how to heal the gut and intestinal flora to improve your general health. Clean Gut diet plan - food list There are general [Clean Gut diet guidelines](#general) for phases 1 and 2, and specific guidelines for each: [Phase 1](#phase1) - 21 days - drink a liquid breakfast and eat meals from the Clean Gut diet, as well as taking [recommended supplements](http://www.cleanprogram.com/files/clean-gut-supplements.pdf) and practicing specific activities to enhance the process of gut repair [Phase 2](#phase2) - 7 days - reintroduce foods into your diet over the course of a week, which will allow you to identify the foods that do not promote long-term gut health Also guidelines for [testing triggers](#triggers) and for a [lifetime diet](#lifetime) Clean Gut general guidelines Clean Gut foods to eat during the program - general - \"The Clean Gut Diet\" - Fill 80% of your plate with greens and vegetables (raw, steamed, baked, cooked) and 20% with protein and good fats (meat, fish, avocado, etc.) - Stop eating when you are 80% full - this will help your body digest more easily - Daily protocol - First thing in the morning, have a glass of water with half a squeezed lemon - For breakfast, have a green shake plus supplements.

Once you've completed the Clean Gut program, they can be reintroduced into your regular diet Clean Gut phase 1 foods to eat - Eat foods from the groups listed in [Clean Gut diet foods to eat](#generaleat), above Clean Gut phase 1 foods to avoid - Avoid foods from the groups listed in [Clean Gut diet foods to avoid](#generalavoid), above Clean Gut phase 2 - reintroduction The reintroduction process is the last stage of the Clean Gut program, on days 22-28. While staying on the Clean Gut diet, reintroduce gluten and dairy over seven days. The purpose of the process is to identify your toxic triggers - foods that cause inflammation, acidity, irritation, or indigestion; also allergic reactions, food sensitivities, autoimmune reactions, mood swings, bloating, fatigue. Gluten and dairy are the most common toxic triggers. Others are processed sugar, caffeine, and alcohol Clean Gut phase 2 - foods to eat - Keep a journal to record any reactions you might have to the foods you reintroduce - anything that happens shortly after eating the food, energy levels, bowel movements, sleep, emotions - On the first and second days (days 22 and 23), eat gluten 2-3 times a day for two days, as well as general [Clean Gut diet Foods to Eat](#generaleat)(above). Don't include dairy or other excluded items yet - On the third and fourth days (days 24 and 25), eat from the Clean Gut diet Foods to Eat (above), without any gluten - On the fifth and sixth day (days 26 and 27), eat simple dairy foods (e.g. milk, cheese) 2-3 times a day for two days, as well as general Clean Gut diet Foods to Eat (above). Don't include gluten and don't include other excluded items yet - so stay away from cereal, ice cream, and baked goods at the moment - On day 28, reflect on how your reactions to the reintroduced foods have been. If you had no reaction, you can keep it in your diet. If you had a mild reaction, rotate your choices of foods so that you don't eat the irritating ones more than once a week. If you had a strong reaction, remove the food from your diet Clean Gut phase 2 - foods to avoid [General foods to avoid](#generalavoid)above - except gluten-containing foods and dairy on the days you're testing them Potentially healthy or toxic foods to test after phase 2 Once you've finished the program, you can test other foods apart from gluten and dairy. Other foods that are commonly healthy for some and toxic triggers for others include: - Corn - Eggs - Soy - Red meat - Nightshade vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant) As you've been avoiding corn and soy, you can test it at the end of the program. If you want to test eggs, red meat, and nightshade vegetables, avoid them for say 2-3 weeks and then reintroduce them for two days, one at a time while eating only Clean Diet foods, to find out your reaction. Lifetime diet - Fill 80% of your plate with greens and vegetables (raw, steamed, baked, cooked) and 20% with protein and good fats (meat, fish, avocado, etc.) - Stop eating when you are 80% full - this will help your body digest more easily - The Big Three - processed sugar, caffeine, and alcohol - remove dependency - Crowd out - eat good quantities of healthy food each day so you have less room for these foods - Pulse out - remove them from your diet for a period of time, so you can feel and remind yourself of the full effects. Do this regularly, for one week or one month - When you do eat these foods, enjoy them, and be aware of the present moment with each bite or sip - General food guidelines - Fruits and vegetables - purchase organic or chemical-free fruits and vegetables - Meat - purchase organic, pasture-raised, and grass-fed - Fish - purchase smaller, cold-water fish, such as listed above in the general what to eat guidelines - Eggs - purchase organic, free-range, and pasture-raised eggs - Grains - If you've reintroduced grains and found that they work for you, consider including nongluten grains in your diet, such as quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and rice - Oils and fats - look for organic expeller and cold-pressed, unrefined oils. Oils such as lard, coconut oil, and ghee are higher in saturated fats and better for high-temperature cooking. Olive oil is good for medium-temperature cooking but is best used in salad dressings or as a condiment. Nut and seed oils should not be used for cooking, instead use them in cold preparations - Nuts and seeds - look for raw varieties free of preservatives and sugar - Alternative eating habits to try - If you typically eat meat at most meals, take one weekend to go vegetarian. Then try it for one week. See how your body reacts - Once every month, for 2-4 days, go completely grain-free, both gluten and nongluten varieties. Or try removing grain for 2 weeks to see how you react - Try soaking grains overnight before cooking will make them easier to digest - Beans, lentils, and legumes can be difficult for many people to digest. Try soaking them first overnight to see if they're any easier to digest - Nuts and seeds can often be difficult to digest - soaking them for a few hours can help. If you feel heavy after eating them, reduce the amount you include in your diet. If you frequently snack on nuts and seeds, try reducing your quantity and frequency to one handful every other day, and see if this improves your digestion - Try using coconut oil for one week - cook with it, use it as a skin moisturizer, and add it to your shakes and recipes - Try removing corn and soy for two weeks - Fruit takes the shortest time to digest and leaves the stomach within thirty minutes. When you eat fruit with protein or starches, the digestion of fruit can be held up and start to ferment in the intestines - it looks like the recommendation is to eat fruit separately from meals - Try adding probiotics - a cup of raw, unpasteurized fermented vegetables, kimchi, or sauerkraut each day to your dinner for a week. Or add low-sugar probiotic drinks. Also add small amounts of kefir made from goat's milk or cow's milk if dairy is not a trigger food for you - Try adding 1-2 servings a day of a fresh green juice or green smoothie for two weeks - Mind your food combinations and don't food bomb - A food bomb results from mixing too many different types of food together in one meal, and often happens on holidays. Each type of food requires different enzymes in order to be digested, so mixing too many together at once causes poor digestion and creates fatigue - Eat nonstarchy vegetables and leafy greens with animal protein, grains, rice, legumes, and starchy vegetables - Avoid eating animal protein with grains, rice, or legumes - Eat fruit alone - Have a shake a day from the Clean Gut shake recipes Health benefits claimed in Clean Gut The diet in this book claims to reduce the risks for: abdominal distention, aches and pains, food allergies, seasonal allergies, arthritis, asthma, autoimmune diseases, back pain, bad breath, bloating, body odor, cancer, cholecystitis, constipation, GERD, gluten sensitivity, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, heart disease, hemorrhoids, hormonal imbalances, infertility, inflammatory bowel disease IBD, insomnia, iritis, irritable bowel syndrome IBS, lack of libido, leaky gut / hyperpermeability, mood swings, peptic ulcers, skin lesions, tiredness/fatigue, ulcerative colitis, yeast overgrowth; also premature aging As always, this is not intended to be a replacement for professional medical diagnosis or treatment for a medical condition.
