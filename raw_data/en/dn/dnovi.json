Risk for experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir is increased in patients carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele. Abacavir is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients. Screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele is required prior to abacavir initiation and when reinitiating therapy in patients with an unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. Discontinue abacavir and do not restart if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected or cannot be ruled out This Medicine: Abacavir is used together with other medicines to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Abacavir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or the symptoms of AIDS. It helps keep the HIV virus from reproducing, and appears to slow the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of serious health problems that are usually related to AIDS or HIV infection. Abacavir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have other problems related to AIDS or HIV infection. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
