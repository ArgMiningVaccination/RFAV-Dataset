Vaccination helps protect against mpox when given before or shortly after an exposure. This vaccine is currently available in the United States from the federal <a href=\"https://aspr.hhs.gov/SNS/Pages/JYNNEOS-Distribution.aspx\">Strategic National Stockpile</a>.<br></p>| [Who is currently recommended to receive the vaccine?]() |226||Who is currently recommended to receive the vaccine?||<p><strong>Any person who MAY be at risk for mpox infection or</strong><strong> persons who request vaccination</strong> may receive vaccination without having to report specific risk factors.<br></p><p>However, some individuals are at higher risk for mpox infection and/or complications of mpox infection. They should be considered a priority and are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to receive the vaccination to decrease infection spread, minimize serious illness, and prevent fatalities. This includes any of the following:<br></p><ul><li>Anyone living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is recommended that additional efforts be made to reach those with a CD4 count <350/mm<sup>3</sup>, an unsuppressed HIV viral load, or an opportunistic infection, due to increased risk for complications of mpox<br></li><li>Any man or trans person who has sex with men or trans persons</li><li>People who use or who are eligible for HIV<strong> </strong>pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) </li><li>Sex workers</li><li>Sexual partners of the above groups </li><li>People who have had direct skin-to-skin contact with one or more people AND who know others in their community that have had mpox infection</li><li>People who have been diagnosed with a bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) in the past 3 months</li><li>People who anticipate experiencing the above risks</li></ul><p><strong>Known close contacts of people who have mpox should be vaccinated as soon as possible.</strong> This is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).<br></p><p><strong>People in specific occupational groups should be offered vaccination. </strong>These include: </p><ul><li>Occupational groups recommended for vaccination by <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/smallpox.html\">Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices</a> (ACIP).<br></li><li>Healthcare workers (HCWs) who are likely to collect laboratory specimens from patients with mpox (e.g., persons working in sexual health clinics or clinical settings that serve at-risk populations).<br></li></ul><p>Please see CDPH <a href=\"/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Mpox/Considerations-for-Expanded-Mpox-Post-Exposure-Prophylaxis.aspx\">Considerations for for further details and guidance.<br></p><br>| [When should the vaccine be given after an exposure?]() |231||When should the vaccine be given after an exposure?||<p>The JYNNEOS vaccine should be given within 4 days from the date of exposure, if possible, to help prevent disease. If given 4-14 days after the date of exposure, vaccination may reduce the symptoms of disease, but may not prevent the disease. <br></p>| [How can I get the vaccine?]() |237||How can I get the vaccine?||<p>Contact your health care provider to see if they have the JYNNEOS vaccine. If your health care provider does not have the vaccine or you do not have a healthcare provider,<a href=\"/pages/localhealthservicesandoffices.aspx\"></a> use the <a href=\"https://mpoxvaxmap.org/\">Mpox Vaccine Locator</a> or <a href=\"https://myturn.ca.gov/\">MyTurn</a> to find a location. If you have trouble obtaining the vaccine, please contact your <a href=\"/pages/localhealthservicesandoffices.aspx#\">local health department</a> for further given?]() |227||How is the vaccine given?||<p>The JYNNEOS vaccine is given through a shot (injection). The JYNNEOS vaccine can be given in two methods:<br></p><ol><li>The standard method is a subcutaneous injection which is a shot given beneath the skin in the upper arm. This method has been approved for people 18 years or older and is also authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for people under 18 years of age.</li><li>Under new guidelines from the FDA and CDC, the vaccine can also be given through intradermal injection, in the skin layer underneath the epidermis (which is the upper skin layer) for people 18 years or older. Intradermal injection is typically given in the forearm and requires a smaller amount of vaccine than the subcutaneous injection to create a similar immune response. Intradermal injection can also be given in the upper arm or on the back below the shoulder blade.<br></li></ol><p>Public health jurisdictions and healthcare providers have the flexibility to offer the intradermal or subcutaneous regimen based on balancing optimal vaccine use and acceptance, feasibility of administration, and available vaccine supply. People of any age with a history of developing keloid scars, and individuals younger than 18 years of age, should receive the vaccine via the subcutaneous route. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/interim-considerations/special-populations.html\">CDC recommends </a>people get two JYNNEOS doses four weeks apart. <br></p>| [How protected am I after getting the vaccine?]() |229||How protected am I after getting the vaccine?||<p>Mpox vaccines are thought to be effective at protecting people against mpox or making symptoms less severe when given before or soon after exposure to mpox. Initial studies have shown some protection even from a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7140e3.htm?s_cid=mm7140e3_e&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM91088&ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2071%2c%20September%2030%2c%202022&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM91088#contribAff\">single dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine, however a person is not considered fully vaccinated until they have received 2 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine.</a></p><p>Because they may not be completely protected, even after receiving 2 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine, vaccinated individuals are still recommended to take additional measures to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/prevention.html\">protect </a>against catching or spreading mpox and to <a href=\"/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Mpox/Mpox-Home-Isolation-Guidance-for-the-General-Public.aspx\" title=\"CDPH Isolation Guidance\">isolate</a> at home when they have a rash or other symptoms until they have confirmed whether or not they have mpox.<br></p><p>CDPH will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the JYNNEOS vaccine during the current outbreak. <br></p><p><br></p>| [What is CDPH's policy on second doses?]() |228||What is CDPH's policy on second doses?||<p>CDPH strongly recommends that all eligible individuals complete their JYNNEOS vaccine series by receiving their second dose at least 28 days after their first dose. </p><p>A person who is diagnosed with mpox after their first dose of JYNNEOS should not receive a second dose at this time (unless they are immunocompromised). <br></p><p><br></p>| [When am I considered fully vaccinated?]() |230||When am I considered fully vaccinated?||<p>Individuals are considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after receiving their second dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine.<br></p>| [Who should NOT receive the vaccine?]() |232||Who should NOT receive the vaccine?||<p>People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine or a component in the vaccine should talk to their health care provider to see if it is safe to receive the vaccine.</p><p>While you may still be able to be vaccinated with JYNNEOS if you have the following conditions, please tell your vaccination provider if you:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Have any severe, life-threatening allergies</p></li><li><p>Are pregnant or think you may be pregnant</p></li><li><p>Are breastfeeding</p></li><li><p>Have a weakened immune system</p></li></ul><p></p><p>The JYNNEOS vaccine is not recommended for someone with symptoms or who has tested positive for mpox.</p>| [What are the side effects?]() |235||What are the side effects?||<p>Most people who get the JYNNEOS vaccine have minor reactions. These may include pain, redness, swelling, firmness, or itching where the shot was given, especially for intradermal injection (between layers of the skin). There may also be muscle pain, headaches, nausea, chills, or feeling tired. There is a small chance of fever. As with any medicine, there is a very small chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction.<br></p>| [What if I have a severe allergic reaction?]() |236||What if I have a severe allergic reaction?||<p>If you have signs of a severe allergic reaction (such as hives, swelling of the face or throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness), call 911 immediately or go to the nearest hospital.

While data on the risks of JYNNEOS vaccination during pregnancy are limited, mpox infection during pregnancy is associated with complications, including severe congenital infection, pregnancy loss, and maternal mortality.<br></p>| [Can I get the vaccine if I am breastfeeding?]() |234||Can I get the vaccine if I am breastfeeding?||<p>Yes, individuals who are breastfeeding may receive the JYNNEOS vaccine if exposed to mpox. It is unknown whether JYNNEOS is passed through human breast milk. Data is not yet available on the effects of JYNNEOS in a breastfed infant or on milk production. However, because JYNNEOS vaccine does not contain a virus that replicates, babies cannot get mpox through breast milk. Individuals should discuss risks and benefits of vaccination with their health care providers.<br></p>| [How can I lock my vaccine record so that it is only visible to my health care provider and public health authorities?]() |238||How can I lock my vaccine record so that it is only visible to my health care provider and public health authorities?||<p>Patients have the right to 'lock' their record in the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) so that immunization information is only visible to the patient's health care provider and public health authorities.
