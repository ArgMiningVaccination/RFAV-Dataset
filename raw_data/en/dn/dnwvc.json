Certain regulations or other policies included in Interim Final Rules with Comments (IFCs) will be modified with the ending the PHE. Certain policies, such as the Acute Hospital at Home initiative and telehealth flexibilities have been extended by Congress through December 31, 2024. Long Term Care and Acute and Continuing Care providers are expected to be in compliance with the requirements according to the timeframes listed below. Background: The Secretary's authority in Section 1135 of the Social Security Act (the \"Act\"), allowed CMS to issue several temporary emergency statutory and regulatory waivers and flexibilities to help providers respond to the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) and focus on the needs of beneficiaries while working to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Since the Secretary has announced the PHE will end on May 11, 2023, the authority to issue and maintain 1135 waivers ends on tha t date. This memorandum outlines the expiration of the emergency waivers issued during the PHE related to the minimum health and safety requirements for Long Term Care (LTC) and Acute and Continuing Care (ACC) providers. This memorandum also describes the timelines for certain regulatory requirements issued during the PHE through Interim Final Rules with Comments (IFCs). The guidance for the termination of emergency waivers and timelines for requirements issued through IFCs are grouped by provider type, starting with guidance that affects all provider -types. For all LTC and ACC providers/suppliers: Pages 2-3. For LTC facilities (i.e., nursing homes): Pages 3- 6. Page 2 of 23 For ACC providers: Pages 6-23 All Providers/Suppliers Staff Vaccination Requirements On November 5, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued an interim final rule ( CMS -3415- IFC) requiring Medicare and Medicaid -certified providers and suppliers to ensure that their staff were fully vaccinated for COVID -19 (i.e., obtain the primary vaccination series), which was a critical step to protect patients. On April 10, 2023, the President signed legislation that ended the COVID-19 national emergency. On May 11, 2023, the COVID-19 public health emergency is expected to expire. In light of these developments and comments received on the interim final rule, CMS will soon end the requirement that covered providers and suppliers establish policies and procedures for staff vaccination. CMS will share more details regarding ending this requirement at the anticipated end of the public health emergen cy. We continue to remind everyone that the strongest protection from COVID-19 is the vaccine. Therefore, CMS urges everyone to stay up to date with your COVID- 19 vaccine. Emergency Preparedness Training and Testing Program Exemption The following information supersedes the previously issued QSO-20-41- ALL -REVISED memo for all certified providers/suppliers. CMS regulations for Emergency Preparedness (EP) require the provider/supplier to conduct exercises to test their EP plan to ensure that it works and that staff are trained appropriately about their roles and the provider/supplier's processes. During or after an actual emergency, the EP regulations allow for a one-year exemption from the requirement that the provider/supplier perform testing exercises. The exemption only applies to the next required full- scale exercise (not the exercise of choice), based on the 12- month exercise cycle. The cycle is determined by the provider/supplier (e.g., calendar, fiscal or another 12- month timeframe). The exemption only applies when a provider/supplier activates its emergency preparedness program for an emergency event. Pro viders/suppliers are expected to return to normal operating status and comply with the regulatory requirements for emergency preparedness with the conclusion of the PHE. This includes conducting testing exercises based on the regulatory requirements for specific provider/supplier types as follows: Inpatient Providers and Suppliers 1: The provider/supplier must conduct a full-scale exercise within its annual cycle for 2023 and an exercise of choice. 1 Inpatient providers and suppliers include: Inpatient hospice facilities, Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (PRTFs), hospitals, Long- Term Care (LTCs) facilities, Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICFs/IIDs), and Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs). Page 3 of 23 Outpatient Providers2: The provider/supplier must conduct either a full- scale exercise or an exercise of choice within its annual cycle for 2023, if scheduled to conduct the full- scale exercise within 2023. The provider/supplier must conduct the exercise of choice, if scheduled during the annual cycle for 2023 and resume the full- scale exercise requirement in 2024. Long Term Ca re Facilities (Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) and/or Nursing Facilities (NFs)) CMS terminated many of the 1135 Emergency Waivers for Long Term Care in April 2022 (see QSO-22-15- NH & NLTC & LSC ). Information on the remaining regulatory waivers and IFC requirements for LTC facilities is listed below. 3-Day Prior Hospitalization Pursuant to the authority granted under section 1812(f) of the Act, CMS effectively waived the Medicare Part A SNF coverage requirement that a Medicare beneficiary must have a 3 -day qualifying hospital stay (QHS) to qualify for a covered Part A SNF stay (3- day QHS waiver). Additionally, by the same authority under section 1812(f) of the Act, CMS granted certain beneficiaries who exhausted their SNF benefits a one- time renewal of SNF Part A coverage, beginning a new benefit period, without first having the typical 60-day wellness period that must typically occur before a beneficiary to obtain a new benefit period. These waivers will terminate immediately with the expiration of the COVID -19 PHE. This means that all new SNF stays beginning on or after May 12th will require a qualifying hospital stay before Medicare coverage. Additionally, for any new benefit period that begins on or after May 12th, the beneficiary will need to have completed a 60 -day wellness period. Alcohol- based Hand- Rub (ABHR) Dispensers CMS waived t he requirement for ABHR dispensers for SNF/NFs at 42 CFR 483.90(a) during the PHE because of the need for the sudden increased use by staff and others of ABHR in infection control. The waiver of this requirement ends with the conclusion of the PHE. Preadmission Screening and Annual Resident Review: (PASARR) CMS waived 42 CFR 483.20(k), allowing nursing homes to admit new residents who have not received Level I or Level II Preadmission Screening. The waiver of this requirement ends with the conclusion of the PHE. 2 Outpatient providers and suppliers include: Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs), freestanding/home -based hospice, Program for the All -Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), Home Health Agencies (HHAs), Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (CORFs), Organizations (which include Clinics, Rehabilitation Agencies, and Public Health Agencies as Providers of Outpatient Physical Therapy and Speech -Language Pathology Services), Community Mental Health Clinics (CMHCs), Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), Rural Health Clinics (RHCs), Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and End -Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) facilities. Page 4 of 23 CMS expects all providers to be in compliance with the requirements for PASARR with all admissions taking place afte r May 11, 2023. The medical record for residents with a mental illness (MI) or intellectual disability (ID) must include evidence that PASARR Level I pre-screening is completed prior to admission and if the Level I pre- screening is positive, Level II screening is conducted prior to admission to the facility. If the State program permits the use of exceptions and the resident remains in the facility longer than 30 days, the medical record must include evidence of Level I pre- screening and a referral to the appropriate state-designated authority for Level II screening if the Level I pre- screening is positive on or before the 30th day of admission. Resident Roommates and Grouping CMS waived the requirements in 42 CFR 483.10(e)(5) and (7) solely for the purposes of grouping or cohorting residents with respiratory illness symptoms and/or residents with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and separating them from residents who are asymptomatic or tested negative for COVID -19. This waiver of these requirements ends with the conclusion of the PHE (note that Section (e)(6) was terminated on 05/10/2021 per QSO -21-17). Note: Surveyors may need to consider whether a resident who was transferred to a different room within a facility or to a different facility as part of COVID -related cohorting was given the option to move back to his or her original room or facility or to stay in the new room or facility, depending on room availability. The resident's room preference should not be based on payment source. R esident Transfer and Discharge CMS waived requirements in 42 CFR 483.10(c)(5) facility to provide advance notification of options relating to the transfer/discharge to another facility; 483.15, (c)(5)(i) and (iv), (c)(9), and (d) the written notice of transfer or discharge to be provided before the transfer or discharge. This notice must be provided as soon as practicable (with some exceptions); to allow a long- term care (LTC) facility to transfer or discharge residents to another LTC facility solely for cohorting purposes. This waiver of these requirements ends with the conclusion of the PHE. (note that 483.10 (e)(3) was terminated on 05/10/2021 per QSO-21- 17). Note: Surveyors may need to consider whether a resident who was transferred to a different facility as part of COVID -related cohorting was given the option to move back to the facility or to stay in the new facility, depending on room availability. The resident's preference should not be based on payment source. Nurse Aide Training Competency and Evaluation Programs (NATCEP) CMS waived the requirements which require that a SNF and NF may not employ anyone for longer than four months unless they met the training and certification requirements under 42 CFR \u00a7483.35(d) (except for 42 CFR \u00a7483.35(d)(1)(i)). CMS p rovided additional guidance for this waiver with the release of QSO-21-17- NH. T his memo strongly encouraged states and nurse aides, \"to explore ways to complete all training and certification requirements as soon as possible.\" CMS memorandum QSO-22-15- NH & Page 5 of 23 NLTC & LSC terminated this blanket waiver, however, individual States and facilities could apply for a separate time- limited waiver of these requirements for instances where the volume of nurse aides that must complete a state -approved NATCEP exceeded the availability of approved training and testing programs. All individual waivers granted to States and individual facilities will terminate at the conclusion of the PHE, unless a facility or State has been granted a waiver that expires prior to the end of PHE Uncertified nurse aides working in a Long Term Care facility covered by a waiver granted to a State or individual facility will have 4 months from the date the PHE ends (or from the termination date of the facility's or state's waiver, if earlier) to complete a state approved NATCEP program. This includes those LTC care facilities, or facilities in states that were granted an extension of the waiver after October 6, 2022. R equirements for Reporting related to COVID -19 CMS published an IFC ( CMS -5531- IFC) requiring all LTC facilities report COVID - 19 information using the Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) (42 CFR 483(g )). Additionally, facilities are required to inform the residents, their representatives and families following the occurrence of either a single confirmed infection of COVID-19 or three or more residents or staff with new-onset of symptoms. This requirement to report information was extended through a final rule (CMS - 1747-F ) and is set to terminate on December 31, 2024, with the exception of the requirements at \u00a7 483.80(g)(1)(viii), which will continue to be in effect as a requirement to support national efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. o The reporting requirements referenced above also include provisions for reporting COVID -19 information to residents, their representatives and families (per 42 CFR 483.80(g)(3)). The CMS final rule that set reporting requirements to terminate on December 31, 2024 (CMS-1747) was released in November 2021, and at that time, this type of reporting was necessary. However, CMS is concerned that the effort required to continue this reporting provision may outweigh the utility of the information provided. For example, we have heard that providing families with the total number of cumulative COVID -19 cases (from June 2020) is not useful information. Additionally, this information is now publicly available on CMS' COVID -19 Nursing Home Data Website . Therefore, CMS is exercising enforcement discretion and will not expect providers to meet the requirements at 42 CFR 483.80(g)(3) at this time. All other reporting requirements referenced above remain in effect until December 31, 2024. CMS issued an IFC ( CMS -3414- IFC) requiring facilities to report the COVID - 19 vaccination status of residents and staff through NHSN (\u00a7483.80(g)(1)(viii) . Through a subsequent rulemaking on November 9, 2021 at CMS - 1747- F, the requirement for reporting t he COVID -19 vaccine status of residents and staff through NHSN is permanent and will continue indefinitely unless additional regulatory action is taken. Page 6 of 23 Requirements for Educating about and Offering Residents and Staff the COVID-19 Vaccine On May 21, 2021, CMS issued an IFC ( CMS -3414- IFC) requiring all LTC facilities to educate residents and staff on the COVID-19 vaccine (including any additional doses) and offer to help them get vaccinated. Pursuant to section 1871(a)(3) of the Act, Medicare interim final rules expire 3 years after issuance unless the Secretary determines an earlier end date. Therefore, this requirement will remain in effect until May 21, 2024 unless additional regulatory action is taken. Requirements for COVID-19 Testing On August 25, 2020, CMS issued an IFC (CMS -3401- IFC) requiring LT C facilities to perform routine testing of residents and staff for the COVID -19 infection. As noted in the IFC, this testing regulation will expire with the end of the PHE. Note: CMS issued the testing requirements early in the COVID-19 PHE to ensure facilities were conducting the volume and frequency of tests needed to identify COVID - 19 cases and prevent transmission, such as surveillance testing of nursing home staff. Throughout the PHE, CDC and CMS have updated the testing guidance, including most recently, removing the recommendation for surveillance testing of staff. However, COVID -19 testing is still an important action and is a nationally recognized standard to help identify and prevent the spread of COVID- 19. Therefore, while this specific regulatory requirement will end with the PHE, CMS still expects facilities to conduct COVID -19 testing in accordance with accepted national standards, such as CDC recommendations. Noncompliance with this expectation will be cited at F-880 for failure to implement an effective In fection Prevention and Control Program in accordance with accepted national standards. Focused Infection Control (FIC) Surveys In QSO -20-31-All States are required to conduct FIC surveys in 20% of their nursing homes in fiscal year 2023. They are not required to conduct additional FIC surveys in fiscal year 2024. CMS will continue to make the FIC survey available for states to use at their discretion (e.g., to conduct complaint surveys when concerns related to COVID-19 infection control arise). Acute and Continuing Care (ACC) Provider Flexibilities CMS is ending the following emergency declaration flexibilities for ACC providers with the conclusion of the COVID -19 PHE. Providers are expected to take immediate steps so that they may return to compliance with the reinstated health and safety requirements as noted below. For Flexibilities Terminating and Returning to Pre -PHE Requirements upon the Conclusion of the PHE . CMS expects all providers to be in compliance with all applicable requirements after May 11, 2023, unless otherwise noted below. Page 7 of 23 Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) Ambulatory Surgical Centers & Licensed Independent Freestanding Emergency Departments (IFEDs) Temporary Hospital Conversion CMS allowed currently enrolled ASCs to temporarily enroll as hospitals and to provide hospital services to help address the urgent need to increase hospital capacity to take care of patients. Other interested entities, such as state -licensed IFEDs, could also pursue enrolling temporarily as a h ospital during the PHE. As of December 1, 2021, no new ASC or new IFED requests to temporarily enroll as hospitals have been accepted. Refer to QSO-22-03 fo r more information. ASCs must decide either to meet the certification standards for hospitals at 42 CFR part 482 or return to ASC status when the PHE ends. If they choose to return to ASC status, they can only be paid under the ASC payment system for services on the ASC Cove red Procedures List. Additionally, when the PHE ends, the temporary Medicare IFEDs can no longer bill Medicare for services as their temporary Medicare certification would end. V oluntary Termination of ASC's Temporary Hospital Status The temporarily enrolled hospital must submit a notification of intent to convert back to an ASC to the applicable CMS Survey and Operations Group (SOG) location on or before the conclusion on the PHE (May 11, 2023) via email or mailed letter. The notification should include the temporary hospital's and ASC's Legal Business Name, Tax Identification Number, National Provider Identifier, Provider Transaction Access Number and the requested deactivation date of the hospital's temporary billing privileges (that must be by or b efore May 11, 2023). Once the CMS SOG location receives the notification from the temporary hospital of its desire to convert back to an ASC, the location will terminate the temporary hospital CMS Certification Number (CCN) and send a tie-out notice to the applicable Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC). The MAC will deactivate the temporary hospital billing privileges and reinstate the original ASC billing privileges. The MAC will notify the ASC when their billing privileges have been restored. However, the ASC does not need to wait for this notification from the MAC to resume normal ASC operations. The ASC must come back into compliance immediately with all applicable ASC federal participation requirements, including the Conditions for Coverage. ASCs m ay refer to COVID -19 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Medicare Fee- for-Service (FFS) Billing (cms.gov) for m ore information on claims processing after the PHE ends. Conversion to Hospital If the ASC wishes to participate as a hospital, it must undergo the hospital enrollment process by submitting a form CMS -855A to begin the process of enrollment and initial certification as a hospital on or before the conclusion of the PHE (May 11, 2023). An initial certification hospital survey, either done by the State Agency (SA) or Accreditation Organization (AO), will be conducted to determine compliance with all applicable hospital Conditions of Participation (CoPs) before CMS issues a final determination letter for Medicare participation. Page 8 of 23 ASC Medical Staff - 42 CFR 416.45(b) CMS waived the requirement that medical staff privileges must be periodically reappraised, and the scope of procedures performed in the ASC must be periodically reviewed. The waiver of this requirement ends with the conclusion of the PHE. Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) Quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) - 42 CFR 485.917(a)- (d) CMS modified the requirements for CMHC's QAPI to provide flexibility for CMHCs to use their QAPI resources to focus on challenges and opportunities for improvement related to the PHE by waiving the specific detailed requirements for the QAPI program's organization and content. This waiver of these requirements ends with the conclusion of the PHE. Provision of Services - 42 CFR 485.918(b)(1)(iii) CMS waived the specific requirement that prohibits CMHCs from providing partial hospitalization services and other CMHC services in an individual's home so that clients can safely shelter in place during the PHE while continuing to receive needed care and services from the CMHC. This waiver is a companion to recent regulatory changes ( 85 FR 27550 (May 8, 2020) ) that clarify how CMHCs should bill for services provided in an individual's home, and how such services should be documented in the medical record. While this waiver allowed CMHCs to furnish services in client homes, including through the use of telecommunication technology, CMHCs continued to be, among other things, required to comply with the non-waived provisions of 42 CFR Part 485, Subpart J, requiring that CMHCs: 1) assess client needs, including physician certification of the need for partial hospitalization services, if needed; 2) implement and update each client's individualized active treatment plan that sets forth the type, amount, duration, and frequency of the services; and 3) promote client rights, including a client's right to file a complaint. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclusion of the PHE. 40 Percent Rule - 42 CFR 485.918(b)(1)(v) CMS waived the requirement that a CMHC provides at least 40 percent of its items and services to individuals who are not eligible for Medicare benefits. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclusion of the PHE. End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Facilities Training Program and Periodic Audits - 42 CFR \u00a7494.40(a) CMS waived the requirement related to the condition on Water & Dialysate Quality, specifically that on-time periodic audits for operators of the water/dialysate equipment are waived to allow for flexibilities. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclusion of the PHE. Emergency Preparedness - 42 CFR \u00a7494.62(d)(1)(iv) CMS waived the requirements for ESRD facilities to demonstrate as part of their Emergency Preparedness Training and Testing Program, that staff can demonstrate that, at a minimum, its patient care staff maintains current CPR certification. Additionally, CMS waived the requirement for maintenance of CPR certification during the COVID -19 Page 9 of 23 emergency due to the limited availability of CPR classes. The waiver of this requirement ends with the conclusion of the PHE. Ability to Delay Some Patient Assessments - 42 CFR \u00a7494.80(b) CMS waived the following requirements related to the frequency of assessments for patients admitted to the dialysis facility. CMS waived the \"on-time\" requirements for the initial and follow up comprehensive assessments within the specified timeframes as noted below. This waiver applies to assessments conducted by members of the interdisciplinary team, including: a registered nurse, a physician treating the patient for ESRD, a social worker, and a dietitian. Specifically, CMS waived: o 42 CFR \u00a7494.80(b)(1): An initial comprehensive assessment must be conducted on all new patients (that is, all admissions to a dialysis facility), within the latter of 30 calendar days or 13 outpatient hemodialysis sessions beginning with the first outpatient dialysis session. o 42 CFR \u00a7494.80(b)(2): A follow up comprehensive reassessment must occur within three months after the completion of the initial assessment to provide information to adjust the patient's plan of care specified in \u00a7494.90. The waiver of these requirements ends with the conclusion of the PHE. Time Period for Initiation of Care Planning and Monthly Physician Visits - 42 CFR \u00a7494.90(b)(2) and 42 CFR \u00a7494.90(b)(4) CMS modified the following two requirements related to care planning, specifically: 42 CFR \u00a7494.90(b)(2): requiring that the dialysis facility implement the initial plan of care within the latter of 30 calendar days after admission to the dialysis facility or 13 outpatient hemodialysis sessions beginning with the first outpatient dialysis session. This modification also applies to the requirement for monthly or annual updates of the plan of care within 15 days of the completion of the additional patient assessments. CMS will end this waiver at the conclusion of the COVID -19 PHE. 42 CFR \u00a7494.90(b)(4): requiring the ESRD dialysis facility to ensure that all dialysis patients are seen by a physician, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician's assistant providing ESRD care at least monthly, and periodically while the hemodialysis patient is receiving in -facility dialysis. CMS waived the requirement for a monthly in-person visit if the patient is considered stable and also recommends exercising telehealth flexibilities; e.g., phone calls to ensure patient safety. After the PHE ends, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 provides for an extension of telehealth flexibility through December 31, 2024. Dialysis Home Visits to Assess Adaptation and Home Dialysis Machine Designation - 42 CFR \u00a7494.100(c)(1)(i) CMS waived the requirement which requires the periodic monitoring of the patient's home adaptation, including visits to the patient's home by facility personnel. The waiver of this requirement ends with the conclusion of the PHE. Special Purpose Renal Dialysis Facilities (SPRDF) Designation Expanded - 42 CFR \u00a7494.120 CMS authorized the establishment of SPRDFs without requiring normal determination regarding lack of access to care at 42 CFR \u00a7494.120(b) as this standard has been met during the period of the national emergency. The waiver of this requirement ends Page 10 of 23 upon the conclusion of the PHE. Dialysis Patient Care Technician (PCT) Certification - 42 CFR \u00a7494.140(e)(4) CMS modified the requirement for dialysis PCTs to obtain certification under a state certification program or a national commercially available certification program within 18 months of being hired as a dialysis PCT for newly employed patient care technicians. CMS was aware of the challenges that PCTs are facing with the limited availability and closures of testing sites during the time of this crisis. CMS allo wed PCTs to continue working even if they have not achieved certification within 18 months or have not met on time renewals. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclusion of the PHE. Transferability of Physician Credentialing - 42 CFR \u00a7494.180(c)(1) CMS waived the requirement which requires that all medical staff appointments and credentialing are in accordance with state law, including attending physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and clinical nurse specialists. These waivers allowed physicians that are appropriately credentialed at a certified dialysis facility to function to the fullest extent of their licensure to provide care at designated isolation locations without separate credentialing at that facility, and ma y be implemented as long as they were consistent with a state's emergency preparedness or pandemic plan. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclusion of the PHE. Furnishing Dialysis Services on the Main Premises- 42 CFR \u00a7494.180(d) CMS waived the ESRD requirements for dialysis facilities to provide services directly on its main premises or on other premises that are contiguous with the main premises, allowing dialysis facilities to provide services to its patients in nursing homes, long- term care facilities, assisted living facilities, and similar types of facilities. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclusion of the PHE. Home Health Agencies (HHAs) Initial Assessments - 42 CFR \u00a7 484.55(a) CMS waived the requirements at 42 CFR \u00a7 484.55(a) to allow HHAs to perform Medicare- covered initial assessments and determine patients' homebound status remotely or by record review. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclusion of the PHE. Allow Occupational Therapists (OTs), Physical Therapists (PTs), and Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) to Perform Initial and Comprehensive Assessment for all Patients - 42 CFR \u00a7 484.55(a)(2) and \u00a7 484.55(b)(3) CMS waived the requirements that rehabilitation skilled professionals may only perform the initial and comprehensive assessment when only therapy services are ordered. This temporary blanket modification allowed any rehabilitation professional (OT, PT, or SLP) to perform the initial and comprehensive assessment for all patients receiving therapy services as part of the plan of care, to the extent permitted under state law, regardless of whether or not the service establishes eligibility for the patient to be receiving home care. Of note, as a part of the CY 2022 Home Health Prospective Payment System Final Rule (86 FR 62240 (November 9, 2021) ) to \u00a7 484.55(a) and (b)(2) to permanently allow occupational therapists to complete the initial and Page 11 of 23 comprehensive assessments for patients, in accordance with section 115 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA), 2021 (Public Law 116-260). Division CC, section 115 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) 2021. Detailed Information Sharing for Discharge Planning - 42 CFR \u00a7484.58(a) CMS waived the requirement to provide detailed information regarding discharge planning, to patients and their caregivers, or the patient's representative in selecting a post- acute care provider by using and sharing data that includes, but is not limited to, (another) HHA, skilled nursing facility (SNF), inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), and long- term care hospital (LTCH) quality measures and resource use measures. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclusion of the PHE. Waive Onsite Visits for HHA Aide Supervision - 42 CFR \u00a7484.80(h) CMS waived the requirements for a nurse to conduct an onsite visit every two weeks. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclus ion of the PHE. Of note, as a part of the CY 2022 Home Health Prospective Payment System Final Rule ( 86 23993.pdf , CMS finalized the provision for aide supervision for patients receiving skilled care every 14 days to now allow for one virtual visit per 60-day episode per patient and only in rare circumstances. For patients receiving non - skilled care, the registered nurse must make an onsite, in person visit every 60 days to assess the quality of care and services provided by the home health aide and to ensure that services meet the patient's needs; semi -annually the nurse must make a supervisory direct observation visit for each patient to which the aide is providing services. Clinical Records - 42 CFR \u00a7484.110(e) CMS extended the deadline for completion of the requirement for HHAs to provide a patient a copy of their medical record at no cost during the next visit or within four business days (when requested by the patient). The waiver of this requirement ends with the conclusion of the PHE. OASIS Reporting CMS has been providing relief to HHAs on the timeframes related to OASIS transmission through the following 1) extending the five-day completion requirement for the comprehensive assessment to 30 days; and 2) waiving the 30-day OASIS submission requirement. The waiver of this requirement ends with the conclusion of the PHE. Hospice Comprehensive Assessments - 42 CFR \u00a7418.54 CMS waived certain requirements related to the timeframes for updating the comprehensive assessments of patients. The waiver of this requirement ends with the conclusion of the PHE. Hospice Aide Competency Testing Allow Use of Pseudo Patients - 42 CFR \u00a7418.76(c)(1) Page 12 of 23 CMS waived the requirement that a hospice aide must be evaluated by observing an aide's performance of certain tasks with a patient. This modification allowed hospices to utilize pseudo- patients, such as a person trained to participate in a role -play situation or a computer-based mannequin device, instead of actual patients, in the competency testing of hos pice aides for those tasks that must be observed being performed on a patient. This increased the speed of performing competency testing and allowed new aides to begin serving patients more quickly without affecting patient health and safety during the PHE. Of note, as a part of the FY 2022 Hospice Wage Index and Payment Rate Update Final 86 FR 42528 (August 4, 2021)) https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR- 2021-08-04/pdf/2021-16311.pdf , CMS finalized the hospice aide requirements to allow t he use of the pseudo -patient for conducting hospice aide competency evaluations. We also finalized the hospice aide supervision requirements to address situations when deficient practice is noted and remediation is needed related to both deficient and related skills, in accordance with \u00a7418.76(c). Waive Non-Core Services - 42 CFR \u00a7418.72 CMS waived the requirement for hospices to provide certain non- core hospice services for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech language pathology. The waiver of this requirement ends upon the conclusion of the PHE. HHA/Hospice Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) - 42 CFR \u00a7418.58 and \u00a7484.65 CMS waived the requirements for hospices and HHAs, which require these providers to develop, implement, evaluate, and maintain an effective, ongoing, hospice/HHA-wide, data-driven QAPI program.
