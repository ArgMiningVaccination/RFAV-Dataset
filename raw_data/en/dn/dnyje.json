Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 1-14 2015 A recent interest in interaction design is towards the development of novel technologies emphasizing the value of mindfulness, monitoring, awareness, and self-regulation for both health and wellbeing. Whereas existing systems have focused mostly on relaxation and awareness of feelings, there has been little exploration on tools supporting the self-regulation of attention during mindfulness sitting meditation. This paper describes the design and initial evaluation of MeditAid, a wearable system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) technology with an adaptive aural entrainment for real time training of mindfulness state. The system identifies different meditative states and provides feedback to support users in deepening their meditation. We report on a study with 16 meditators about the perceived strengths and limitations of the MeditAid system. We demonstrate the benefits of binaural feedback in deepening meditative states, particularly for novice meditators. Mindfulness has been used as a component or independent treatment modality for a variety of mental and physical health conditions, ranging from stress to cancer. One application of mindfulness is in the area of emotion regulation. Emotions can be adaptive or potentially detrimental, and the regulation of emotions that cause distress in life functioning is critical for maintaining emotional homeostasis. Although studies have investigated the effects of mindfulness on emotion regulation, this research studied the impact of an intervention delivered in the form of a smartphone application. Such an intervention format falls under the umbrella of eHealth interventions, which hold promise due to the ubiquitous, portable, relatively affordable, and convenient nature of technology, which may reduce barriers to access and the availability of mental health services. A mixed-methods approach was used to examine relationships between mindfulness and smartphone usage, as well as the experience of using the intervention at least once daily for two weeks. Results showed that smartphone ownership was associated with lower mindfulness, but for smartphone owners, use of most downloaded apps was associated with higher mindfulness. Participants were more likely to download mindfulness apps if they were aged 21-29, believed yoga is an Eastern religious practice, regularly used mindfulness apps, and were aware of health and wellness apps. The intervention study revealed positive changes in mindfulness but no changes in emotion regulation or stress. Common qualitative themes included prior experience with mindfulness-based practice, and positive experiences of the intervention, but challenges such as life events and technical and logistical barriers that affected using the practice. Effects of a 12-Minute Smartphone-Based Mindful Breathing Task on Heart Rate Variability for Students With Clinically Relevant Chronic Pain, Depression, and Anxiety: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial 2019 Background: Mindfulness meditation (MM) is a commonly used psychological intervention for pain, mood, and anxiety conditions, but can be challenging to practice with severe symptoms without proper training. The Mindfulness Meditation app (MMA) is a supportive training tool specifically developed for this study to aid in the practice of mindful breathing using a smartphone. JMIR mhealth and uhealth Objectives: to assess the effectiveness of a mantra meditation (MM) programme at reducing burnout and other indicators of distress among Irish healthcare professionals (HCPs). Design: a pilot RCT with an intent-to-treat protocol, using two study arms (passive wait-list control and intervention) with single blind outcome assessors. Setting: emergency department (ED) of a large hospital in Ireland Participants: 60 ED staff (including doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and administrative staff) were assessed for eligibility, 58 were recruited with 25 (86% retention) and 17 (59% retention) remaining in the control and intervention groups respectively, upon study completion. Intervention: four session MM programme; daily meditation practice target of 20 minutes twice-daily. Practice compliance was measured by a bespoke smart phone application. Primary outcome measure: burnout (comprising emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment). Secondary outcome measures: depression, anxiety, stress, trait mindfulness, sleep quality, heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), pro-inflammatory cytokine expression from whole and salivary cortisol. Results: paired revealed and v T2; df=16, t=-2.3, p=0.04; Cohen's d[U3]=0.45[0.67]). No changes were observed in the control group. Furthermore, multiple comparison tests (one-way ANOVA) showed a significant increase in the HRV parameter, d[U3]= 1.2[0.88]) and an increase in high frequency (HF) power spectral domain values (paired Arm x time analysis of mean daily heart rate slope values showed a decrease for intervention group participants compared with their control counterparts over time (intervention group n=59, slope=-0.023; p=0.006). One-way ANOVA showed a significant increase in normalised daily sleep duration values for compliant meditators compared with control group (F=10; q=6; p<0.001; Cohen's There was a significant increase in TNF- mRNA (relative gene expression) for intervention group members when T1 was compared with T2 (t=1.8; df=16; paired t-test p=0.03; Cohen's d [U3]=0.5[0.69]). significant inverse correlation was detected when salivary cortisol (AM) from study participants (control and intervention, n=15) was compared with TNF- mRNA Conclusions: the data described here demonstrate a potential positive impact of a 4-session MM programme on ED staff burnout, stress, HRV, resting heart rate and sleep quality. Further trials with more participants are required to confirm these findings. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02887300. Mindfulness 2014 Behavioral Sciences 2019 This study is based on the relationship between meditation, the present moment, and psychophysiology. We employed the metronome task to operationalize the extension of the present moment. A pre-post longitudinal study was conducted. The performance in the metronome task was compared before and after the interventions (meditation, story). The aim was to assess whether physiological changes (heart, breathing) during meditation influence the temporal-integration (TI) of metronome beats. Mindfulness meditators either meditated (n = 41) or listened to a story (n = 43). The heart and breathing activity were recorded during the intervention and compared to a resting-state condition. By applying path analyses we found that meditation led to an increase of the duration of integration intervals at the slowest metronome frequency (inter-stimulus interval, ISI = 3 s). After meditation, the higher the heart-rate variability (i.e., the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD), the longer the duration of integration intervals at the fastest frequency (ISI = 0.33 s). Moreover, the higher the breathing rate during meditation, the greater the integration of intervals at ISI = 1 s. These findings add evidence to meditation-induced changes on the TI of metronome beats and the concept of the embodiment of mental functioning. Living mindfully helps one gain a deeper understanding into realities of life. It enables people to witness suffering, desire, attachments, and impermanence without any fear, anxiety, anger, or despair. This is considered the hallmark of true psychological insight. As a skill, mindfulness can be inculcated by anyone. Mindfulness helps in attending, getting aware and understanding experiences in a compassion and open-minded way. Research suggests that applying mindfulness in daily life has been known to tame our emotional mind and enabled people to perceive things \"as they are\" without ascribing expectations, judgments, cynicism, or apprehensions to them. This review unravels the therapeutic power of mindfulness meditation in the context of infertility distress. It serves to integrate the evidence on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based psychological interventions to improve the emotional well-being and biological outcomes in Infertility. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a vagal nerve-mediated biomarker of cardiac function used to investigate chronic illness, psychopathology, stress and, more recently, attention-regulation processes such as meditation. This study investigated HRV in relation to maladaptive perfectionism, a stress-related personality factor, and mindfulness meditation, a stress coping practice expected to elevate HRV, and thereby promote relaxation. Maladaptive perfectionists (n=21) and healthy controls (n=39) were exposed to a lab-based assessment in which HRV was measured during (1) 5-minute baseline resting phase (2) a 5-minute cognitive stress-induction phase, and (3) a post-stress phase. In the post-stress phase, participants were randomly assigned to a 10-minute audio-instructed mindfulness meditation condition or a 10-minute rest condition with audio-description of mindfulness meditation. Analyses revealed a significant elevation in HRV during meditation for controls but not for Perfectionists. These results suggest that mindfulness meditation promotes relaxation following cognitive stress and that the perfectionist personality hinders relaxation possibly because of decreased cardiac vagal tone. The results are discussed in the context of developing psychophysiological models to advance therapeutic interventions for distressed populations.
