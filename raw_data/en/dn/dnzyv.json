Fact #1: Energy Healing Is Thousands of Years Old In Japan, Reiki has been used as a traditional method of energy healing since the early 20th century. Ancient Hindu literature was the first to provide a description of the seven chakras, which are thought to be the body's energy transmission centers. Acupuncture was also created by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners using meridians, the body's energy thoroughfares. These ancient societies employed various techniques to promote the body's natural capacity for healing, but they all understood the vast potential of internal energy. Fact #2: Energy Healing is Based on Science Think back to high school psychics and you might remember that matter is made up of molecules that constantly vibrate. Humans vibrate too. When you meet someone and say that they have \"good vibes,\" you are describing their vibrational energy. Happy people have a higher vibrational energy. Places also have a vibe For example, the beach has a light vibe due to circulating air and salt, and it vibrates at a higher frequency than other areas. What kind of vibrational energy do you think the mountains would have? Or a field during a thunderstorm? Fact #3: Everyone Can Benefit from Energy Healing The best thing about energy healing is that you don't need to fully understand it before trying it.
