Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) was born in Kraljevec, now Croatia. He was intensely awake to nature, and was convinced of the reality of an inner life. He studied science and the classics and tutored pupils in the humanities. Philosophy, science, literature and the arts were his principal interests. The extraordinary originality of Rudolf Steiner's mind led him to a philosophy that linked up the world of science with spirituality. His revolutionary ideas (called 'anthroposophy') took form in a number of enterprises that included art and architecture, biodynamic agriculture (organic farming working with natural rhythms), anthroposophical medicine (an extension of orthodox medical practice including Weleda medicines and toiletries), Curative Education and Social Therapy (including the Camphill movement), speech and drama, eurythmy (an art of movement making speech and music visible), Virbela flowforms (water purification systems), and ethical banking and education. The Waldorf method of education The first Waldorf School grew out of the political and social devastation throughout Europe following the First World War. In 1919, Emil Moult, the founder and managing director of the Waldorf Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany, asked Steiner to provide an education which could offer a healing to mankind. 'It is essential that we develop an art of education which will lead us out of the social chaos into which we have fallen. The only way out of this is to bring spirituality into the soul of human beings through education,' Steiner wrote in 1924. After a period of intensive teacher training, the first truly comprehensive, non-selective, non-denominational school, 'which could provide for the children of workmen and employees the same teaching and education as that enjoyed by children of families with means', as Moult put it, was founded, enabling the growth of Steiner education throughout the world. This roused particular interest in England, where Steiner was invited to lecture. Here he met many educationalists and formed a warm and mutually respectful friendship with Margaret McMillan. Educational principles Steiner divided the broad principles of child development, and the educational methodology supporting it, into three psychological and physiological phases of childhood, each approximately seven years in length. Although each phase has a precise integrity, processes coming to a certain culmination in one phase of development transform into faculties in the subsequent one. An example of this is that the forces so strongly at work in building up the physical body in a child's first seven years become available as the basis for healthy cognitive development later on. This threefold approach involves an holistic support for the development of the all-round human qualities of willing (doing), feeling and thinking (semantic, affective and cognitive) - an education of the hand, the heart and the head. 'The need for imagination, a sense of truth and a feeling of responsibility, these are the very nerve of education... the great thing is to enable the human being to find his place in the world with due confidence in his own power of judgement' (M Steiner in introduction to R Steiner's lectures,1923). Waldorf Education and early years practice today There are now more than 900 Steiner schools and 1,800 kindergartens in more than 60 countries. In the UK, there are more than 90 kindergarten groups for age three to six that are independent or attached to all-age Steiner Waldorf schools. Many of the nurseries and kindergartens offer funded places and work towards the Early Learning Goals, while not losing sight of the Waldorf curriculum and philosophy. Parenting and parent-and-child groups are supported, and teacher training is offered for all stages of the curriculum. The kindergarten years 'Our highest endeavour must be to develop free human beings who are able to impart purpose and direction to their lives,' said Steiner in1923. Steiner Waldorf education aims to respect the essential nature of childhood and in the early years, a secure, unhurried environment enables children to develop a range of skills which provide a sound foundation for emotional, social and cognitive intelligence later. Highly trained Steiner practitioners encourage the child's creative play and self-motivated enquiry, and offer themselves as examples rather than instructors. Through free imitation, children naturally develop a sense of their own purposeful doing and creating alongside the working adult. Learning experiences are embedded within the business of daily living, and a great range of domestic and creative activities are offered, allowing enthusiasm and initiative to flourish. The kindergarten environment provides a quality sensory experience, equipped with simple natural materials and toys enabling the child to develop their spontaneous play. Within the rhythmical structure of the day and week, regular activities are repeated. A sense of familiarity enables the child to learn new skills without undue stress, allowing them to feel secure and confident. Opportunities for reverence, to experience awe and wonder, are developed through respect for each other and the environment. The oral tradition of storytelling, puppetry, music and movement, rhymes and songs develop memory and a rich imagination. In the first seven years, the education works with the developing child's innate rhythms in such a way that they develop a strong physical body, good motor skills, and a healthy regard and respect for other children and their world. These first seven years are a time for children to experience their childhood in a place where they can grow in peace and harmony, feeling safe, and not under pressure to perform or compete. Within this protective and homely environment a rich tapestry of essential life-learning experiences can be slowly woven, while formal teaching can be left for the second seven- year period. Main messages of Steiner's work on early education - To recognise and support each stage of child development - To work with the child's natural inclination to be active - To use imitation and example as an educational approach (rather than instruction and direction) - To support creative child-initiated play - To enable a good sensory experience in the equipment and homely environment provided - To support the child's personal, social and moral development - To work with rhythm and repetition, allowing the child to feel safe and secure - To encourage children to know and love the world through awe and wonder - To support the development of the child in co-operation with the parents - To protect the child's right to a healthy and appropriate childhood.
