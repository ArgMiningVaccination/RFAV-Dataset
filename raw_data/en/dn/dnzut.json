From depression to addiction, psychedelic drugs offer new hope for people with mental health disorders. \"Psychedelic drugs offer new mechanisms to address mental illness, and some have shown promise where other treatments have been ineffective,\" says [Itai Danovitch, MD](https://bio.cedars-sinai.org/danovitchi/index.html), a professor and the chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"This is a source of significant excitement.\" History of Psychedelic Drugs [psychiatrist](/psychiatrist/guide/)Humphry Osmond, who advocated that they be used under carefully controlled conditions as a treatment for [alcohol use disorder](https://www.everydayhealth.com/alcoholism/guide/). [anxiety](https://www.everydayhealth.com/anxiety/guide/), [depression](https://www.everydayhealth.com/depression/guide/), psychosomatic diseases, and [addiction](https://www.everydayhealth.com/opioids/). not well controlled,\" explains Dr. Danovitch. \"And changes in the law essentially stopped most research for the decades that followed.\" \"There is a growing recognition that there is no health without mental health, that the body and mind are integrally connected,\" says Danovitch. \"Our culture's current gravitation to natural substances probably also contributes to the current wave of openness to rediscovering agents that have long existed on the periphery of society and have powerful effects promoting self-reflection, empathic connectedness, and sometimes adaptive change.\" Types of Psychedelic Drugs Psychedelic drugs are taken recreationally in ways including smoking, snorting, injecting, and drinking them. In contrast, most research studies dispense psychedelics in pill form to ensure their purity and to allow for consistent dosing, both gold standards for clinical tests of treatments and drugs. Pill forms are also much safer than smoking or injecting psychedelic drugs. Diethylamide) [Matthew W. Johnson, PhD,](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/matthew-johnson)a professor of psychedelics and consciousness research in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) [post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ptsd/guide/). Ketamine [Ketamine](/drugs/ketamine), known on street as \"special K,\" has traditionally been administered intravenously as a surgical anesthetic in humans and animals. It has also been used in liquid, powder, or pill form as a date-rape drug that when added to someone's drink without their knowledge can cause confusion, [memory loss](/news/5-surprising-causes-memory-loss/), and other symptoms that render that person more vulnerable to sexual assault. In 2019, a nasal spray form of ketamine called esketamine won U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as medication for treatment-resistant depression. Peyote (Mescaline) How Do Psychedelic Drugs Work in the Brain and Body? All psychedelics produce a temporary altered state of consciousness, but researchers believe these experiences may generate lasting effects when it comes to treating mental health, says Dr. Johnson. \"There is evidence that the brain becomes more flexible or 'plastic' after a psychedelic,\" says Johnson. [Kelley O'Donnell, MD, PhD](https://centerforpsychedelicmedicine.org/kelley-odonnell-md-phd/), an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University (NYU) Grossman School of Medicine and a researcher at the NYU Langone Center for Psychedelic Medicine, puts it this way: Psychedelic drugs allow patients to access parts of themselves that are ordinarily inaccessible. As Dr. O'Donnell explains, \"The human brain is fundamentally a learning machine, and it derives its power from its ability to learn and recognize patterns and use those patterns to predict the future. It seems that psychedelics make that pattern much more flexible, so you have a window of opportunity to reopen a period of development, so even after the psychedelic experience, you can make choices and establish new patterns.\" How each psychedelic drug affects the brain and body depends on the drug class to which it belongs. [serotonin](/serotonin/guide/), which regulates your mood, senses, sleep, hunger, sexual behavior, and other functions. [glutamate](/glutamate/guide/), which regulates pain perception, emotion, learning, memory, and responses to your environment. MDMA is an entactogen, which works by flooding the spaces between brain cells with serotonin, Johnson explains. What Research Says About Psychedelics as Mental Health Treatments While the research on psychedelic medicine for mental illness is still considered new and emerging, some studies have shown compelling results. Psilocybin [major depressive disorder](/depression/major-depressive-disorder/)(MDD) compared with 12 adults in a waitlist control group (meaning a group that received no treatment). More than half the study participants were in remission four weeks after treatment. [antidepressant](/antidepressants/guide/)called [Lexapro (escitalopram)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/lexapro)among 59 people with depression. Thirty participants were randomly chosen to receive psilocybin and 29 to receive [escitalopram](/drugs/lexapro). Ultimately, the researchers found no significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram, but they noted that longer and larger studies were needed to confirm these findings. [quitting smoking](https://www.everydayhealth.com/stop-smoking-celebrities-pictures/), according to a pilot study coauthored by Johnson. LSD Ketamine and Esketamine [suicide](https://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/understanding-suicide-from-risk-factors-prevention-how-get-help/)risk, a small 2018 study found. [midazolam](/drugs/midazolam), a different anesthetic medication, among people with depression who were at risk of suicide. MDMA Some of the most compelling results for MDMA as a treatment for mental illness have come from clinical trials involving [people with PTSD](/ptsd/guide/symptoms/). In a study with 90 participants, investigators found that 67 percent of people treated with MDMA-assisted therapy no longer met the diagnostic criteria for [PTSD](/ptsd/guide/) 18 weeks after starting treatment. Supportive Therapy Is Essential, Too Although the research on psychedelic medicine is promising, it's important to note that these studies involved very careful administration of these drugs in a clinical setting under the supervision of doctors. Currently available research consists of very small, short-term studies, many of which are performed in specific groups of patients (such as people with life-threatening illnesses, for instance). This means that the findings from these studies may not be applicable to everyone being considered for psychedelic therapies. In addition, many studies also included supportive care in the form of [psychotherapy](https://www.everydayhealth.com/depression/guide/treatment/). \"For clinical indications, psychotherapy appears to be necessary to support and facilitate change,\" says Danovitch. He adds that therapy protocols typically involve the following phases: - Assessment phase During this phase, a mental health professional and the patient set goals for therapy. - Preparation phase This phase is intended to get patients physically and emotionally ready for treatment. - Experience phase During this phase, health professionals monitor patients carefully as they take the medication. - Integration phase This phase focuses on helping patients reflect and learn from the experience after treatment with the psychedelic has ended. O'Donnell says this type of support, including preparing the patient for what will happen when taking the medication, is vital for successful treatment. \"If someone has no idea what they're in for and someone gives them a psychedelic, that can be a really traumatic experience,\" O'Donnell says. \"A lot of people have the idea that it's a one-and-done and your life is transformed forever, and that's really not the case. That takes it out of the context of a therapeutic relationship, which is so important.\" Side Effects - Altered sense of time, such as feeling that time is passing by slowly - Anxiety or fear - Fast heart rate - Increased blood pressure - Mild headaches - Nausea - Intensified sensory experiences, such as seeing colors that are brighter than usual Johnson adds, \"A risk for anybody is a panic reaction during a 'bad trip.' But the potential for harms from this are mitigated through monitoring and a safe environment in medical trials.\" Which Psychedelic Drugs Are FDA-Approved for Use? [Spravato for treatment-resistant depression. It's administered as a nasal spray by a health professional. [psychedelic therapy](/integrative-health/psychedelic-therapy/guide/)where one is encouraged to pay attention to the altered state of consciousness and try to learn from it,\" says Johnson. Contraindications: Who Should Not Use Psychedelics? People with a history of mania, severe heart disease, or psychotic disorders such as [schizophrenia](/schizophrenia/guide/) should not be considered for psychedelic therapy, Johnson says. Individuals prescribed psychedelic therapies should always be clinically monitored and should never try to take the drugs on their own. \"It is important to have supervision anytime someone consumes anything that dramatically alters perceptions of reality,\" says Danovitch. The Future of Psychedelic Medicine for Mental Illness The recent surge in psychedelics research will likely continue gaining steam. \"It's receiving attention because of very large effects for very difficult to treat disorders \u2014 effects that often dwarf our best existing medications,\" Johnson says. \"That, combined with the fact that we are at peak levels of mental health trouble as a society and we're pretty desperate for breakthrough changes. This shows good promise of being a game-changer,\" he adds. Still, Johnson and others say more extensive, rigorous studies need to be done before psychedelic drugs can be considered a mainstream therapy. And although studies are showing positive results, there are still many unknowns, such as the ways these drugs will be administered if they become FDA-approved. \"There are so many questions we have to study that we don't know the answers to,\" O'Donnell notes. O'Donnell says she envisions specialized psychedelic clinics popping up in areas around the country where patients will receive guidance, support, and psychotherapy along with psychedelic treatment. While the future of psychedelic therapy offers exciting possibilities, O'Donnell emphasizes that overcoming mental health disorders is a process that often takes time and hard work. \"Changing one's life isn't something that happens in an instant. It's something we have to commit to and live out,\" O'Donnell says. \"Psychedelics give us an opportunity to settle into a new pattern, but we still have to choose that pattern and establish it consciously. There's a real responsibility, and it can be a lifelong journey.\" Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking - Nichols DE. Psychedelics.
