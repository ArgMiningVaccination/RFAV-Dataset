March 19 th, 2021 Feast of Saint Joseph, protector, model and guide of the human family \"I cannot put myself ahead of others, placing the laws of the market and patents above the laws of love and the health of humanity. I ask everyone: those responsible for states, companies, and international organizations, to promote cooperation and not competition, and to find a solution for everyone. Vaccines for everyone, especially for the most vulnerable and needy in all regions of the planet. Putting the most vulnerable and needy first! \" Urbi et Orbi Message from Holy Father Francis Christmas 2020 1. It is necessary to dream together. We cultivate a dream, which is neither utopia nor fantasy, but is based on the reasonableness demanded by the human condition of this time and that can be realized together with all citizens at a national and global level. This pandemic can become an opportunity to make us aware that no one can face life isolat ed: everyone must do their part in all fields of knowledge and human action: economy, culture, education, innovation and health. But it is important and necessary to dream together. Human life is the primary good from which other goods are derived, including profit, and that is why the vaccine, like any other health establishment that represents an effective solution to this pandemic, becomes a global common good. 2. The biggest crisis in our history. The health, economic and social impact of the COVID -19 pandemic is considered the largest in our contemporary history. There are many public policies necessary for the world in general , and the po orest in particular, to recover from this impact. However, the global consensus is that vaccination is the only measure that can achieve conclusive and sustainable results to reverse the current situation, and advance in the generation of employment and in mitigating the risk of a social upheaval. Universal vaccination (or herd immunity) not only saves people's lives and reduces the pressure of demand for hospital services, but is also the most effective action for economic recovery. The dimension of the ch allenge is enormous, public health experts estimate that, considering the age and prevailing health conditions, it will be required to vaccinate 3.2 to 4.1 billion people to reach herd immunity globally. 3. The gap between rich and poor. It is notable that the increase in the gap between the poorest and the richest that has been occurring with actual economic recovery policies , is also evident in the vaccination process and health responses to the pandemic. Rich countries with 15% of the world's population h ave contracted 60% of the world's vaccine production, according to Duke University Global Health Institute. There are 13 countries that produce vaccines and their components, which have established explicit and Academia Latinoamericana de L\u00edderes Cat\u00f3licos - Av. Jaime Guz m\u00e1n 3300, Santiago de Chile - (56 9) 8 4750 342 - contacto@liderescatolicos.net hidden limits to international vaccines ' transactions. 50% of the vaccine ingredients are exported by the United States and the European Union. At the international scope , universal vaccination times are very discrepant between poor and rich countries (non -producing and vaccine -producing countrie s). It is in rich countries that vaccines are produce d, where the technological and scientific research centers are located, as well as the large pharmaceutical companies. At the local level, with some exceptions, the same discrepancy is evident, since the poorest are excluded from access to medical care. 4. The poor have faces. The poor have a face in our countries, they are the vulnerable, those excluded from shanty towns, populations or human settlements of misery , migrants, refugees, those who depend on informal work, the elderly alone, indigenous people, the disabled and many women. All of them are the ones who will die at the door of hospitals, on the street or at home, if there are no priorities and campaigns aimed to their vaccinati on. 5. Universal vaccination is a moral imperative. The vaccine to defeat SARS -CoV-2 is the result of extensive public and private collaboration and cooperation , between different countries, so we should not implement myopic nationalist strategies. The global consequences are obvious and avoidable. Even a single non - immunized country can lead to a global blockade of trafficking, trade and the movement of people, as we saw with China at the beginning of the pandemic, creating enormous damage in all sectors. The delay in the immunization of the world population will also allow the development of variants of the virus that cannot be cured with current treatments, because the virus will continue to circulate and mutate and will affect the health of already \"vaccinated\" citizens. Universal vaccination is not a charity, but the consequence of a fundamental human right such as the right to health, through a preventive action par excellence; and it is also a duty of justice that is justified by all criteria (health, economic, financ ial, social and political). Vaccines are an international public good, which must be accessible to all, especially the poorest. Therefore, more than a public function, universal vaccination is an evangelical, humanitarian and solidarity requirement, beyond as a matter of National Security, since the greatest threats to life in the future will undoubtedly be health ones. It is clear that this pandemic is only the beginning of those to come . We have to be prepared for a coordinated, collaborative, solidary an d joint action , at all levels of management. Furthermore, universal vaccination is not only a moral imperative, but it is also convenient for world economic development, including the richest countries. The United States Treasury Secretariat, in a February 25th letter to its G20 colleagues noted: \"Containing the pandemic across the globe is essential for a robust economic recovery... A swift and truly global vaccination is the strongest stimulus that can be given to the global economy\" . A study by the United States National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has indicated that, if the current vaccination trajectory is maintained, world production in 2021 could decrease by 3.5%, that is, $ 4.5 trillion dollars (millions of millions of do llars). 6. The pandemic shows us how all men are brothers. There is no security for anyone if there is no security for everyone. As long as the virus continues in the poorest areas of the planet, it will periodically find ways to return to the richest as well. That is why we dare to ask for effective measures for the vaccination of everyone. Academia Latinoamericana de L\u00edderes Cat\u00f3licos - Av. Jaime Guz m\u00e1n 3300, Santiago de Chile - (56 9) 8 4750 342 - contacto@liderescatolicos.net 7. We ask for increased resources to the COVAX program. The COVAX program (formally known as the Global Access Mechanism to COVID -19 Vaccines), which is directed by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been insufficient, beca use with current resources, if manufacturers were to comply with their deliveries , barely 500 of the 1.7 billion inhabitants of poor countries and 20% of the inhabitants of low - and middle - income countries would be vaccinated . However, already in the first months of the year 2021, the production of vaccines has suffered delays. Therefore, adequate and sustainable production of the vaccine is urgently needed around the world, at a fair price and accessible to all countries, including the lowest - income o nes. It is also needed a simultaneous and coordinated distribution of the vaccine to reduce, in the shortest possible time, the circulation of the virus, avoiding sources of resistance and variants of the virus that are more deadly and resistant to treatme nt. Failure to vaccinate healthcare workers in developing countries will make it impossible to control the pandemic. Therefore, we ask the richest countries to urgently increase the resources for the COVAX program, since the 2 billion doses of the vaccine are insufficient since it would only reach 20% of the population of the 92 countries of low and middle income. We must ensure greater equity in the distribution and acquisition of the vaccine. 8. We ask for the suspension of the patent. Research costs for t he discovery of vaccines have already been financed by sales of the drugs to rich countries. The agreements for the management and protection of intellectual property rights -ADPIC - of the World Trade Organization allow, in a period of exceptionality and therefore of a pandemic, the suspension of the patent, with the possibility for States to directly produce medicines, in addition to access to complex technologies, also protected by patents, which are essential for the production of the vaccine ( mRna and lipid capsule). It is not a bout violating intellectual property rights , but of recognizing that the logic of profit must be subordinated to the protection of the global public good. That is why we ask for a temporary suspension of the rights related to pat ents and the freedom of production of vaccines. The WTO has not reached an agreement regarding the abolition of intellectual property rights related to vaccines, medicines and medical equipment during the pandemic. 9. We ask for agreements between pharmaceu tical companies and manufacturers in low - and middle - income countries. Governments need to promote and facilitate agreements between pharmaceutical houses and potential manufacturers in low - and middle -income countries. It should be taken into account that before the pandemic, India manufactured 62% of the world's vaccines, as well as the example of Chile's collaboration with manufacturers from China and the West. The work of governments facilitating communication and negotiation between pharmaceutical comp anies and manufacturers is very important. For this, it is essential to put an end to the limitations that countries that manufacture vaccines or components for them, as well as equipment and medicines for their treatment, have established on their export. It is very important to facilitate knowledge (explicit and not articulable) between pharmaceutical companies that own vaccines and potential manufacturers in poor and developing countries. 10. We ask for the promotion of scientific research and technologica l innovation. As Christians, we are called to promote, support and implement mass vaccination in a comprehensive way. Financial support must be sought from multilateral organizations and other sources of international cooperation to ensure the timely Academia Latinoamericana de L\u00edderes Cat\u00f3licos - Av. Jaime Guz m\u00e1n 3300, Santiago de Chile - (56 9) 8 4750 342 - contacto@liderescatolicos.net avail ability of vaccines for all. Likewise, it is necessary to promote a genuine spirit of collaboration and establish mechanisms to make the complex logistics of vaccine application effective, to share knowledge about the goodness and usefulness of vaccines an d for a consistent media awareness campaign. Latin American countries in particular, are called upon to promote scientific research and technological innovation in the field of health, to respond to the COVID -19 pandemic, and prepare common responses to the next pandemics. 11. Bethesda's crippled man in the current pandemic. In the Gospel according to Saint John, the healing of the paralytic from Bethesda is narrated (Jn 5, 1-18), who waited thirty -eight years of indifference from those who ignored him in their eagerness to reach a pond that was believed to be miraculous to heal diseases. Competition, isolation and indifference blinded those who could have helped him to regain his heal th and self -esteem with a simple gesture to assist him to move a few meters ; however, they didn't do it probably justified by the mistakes of their governments or institutions. Others preferred to politicize and polarize, escaping from the central issue, a s did the temple doctors who criticized Jesus for healing on a Saturday. However, the central issue is that the poorest and most vulnerable cannot wait any longer: if they do not die of the disease, they die of hunger, they die from closing their businesse s, their dignity dies. The effects of exclusion are not only health or economic, which are the most visible . The excluded also los e their self-esteem and hope , the most difficult traumas to heal. 12. Everyone should take the solidarity vaccine. We are facing a unique opportunity to bring the culture of Encounter and Solidarity to life. A culture of the Encounter that must be developed between countries, institutions, communities and, above all, between people. As Christ our Redeemer did with the paralyz ed man from Bethesda, it is necessary to look at the other person face to face and transform him /her , recovering his /her hope of better times, with health, with work and with dignity. The transformation has to start with each one of us, as leaders and as c hildren of God. First of all , it is necessary that each one of us take the vaccine of solidarity, so that we can conquer, on a global level, the \"herd immunization\" from isolation, poverty and death. We m ust be vaccinated from indifference, selfishness, id olatry of power and money viruses ; from \"all against all\" mentalities or \"every man for himself.\" Each leader in his /her level of responsibility (in multilateral institutions, churches, governments, companies, civil society organizations, individuals) must transform the universal vaccination process into one of the recovery of hope. In the future, what story do we want to t ell our children? That we were one of those who ignored the paralyzed man, without taking him to the Bethesda pool, or, better, that we were the Christ who brought physical, mental and spiritual healing to the most vulnerable? Ultimately, the vaccine is es sential but insufficient to solve all our ills. Our HOPE is found in the risen Christ, who carried all human suffering and misery on the Cross, but victorious over sin and death. We invite everyone, therefore, to this universal solidarity vaccination e ffort! Academia Latinoamericana de L\u00edderes Cat\u00f3licos - Av.
