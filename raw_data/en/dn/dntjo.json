Access to drinking water and efficient treatment methods for wastewater are essential for the prevention of various types of pollution and waterborne diseases. Water resources are also essential for wildlife and many human activities, such as in industry, for energy production, and in agriculture. Energy is essential for drinking water production, wastewater treatment, water transport and distribution. Water and energy usage have become global concerns, leading to the adoption of new technologies to reduce energy consumption while maintaining the quality of treated water. [2](#B2-energies-16-02433)]. Water and energy cannot be separated in the sense that energy is used to produce clean water and water is used to produce energy. Water and wastewater treatment plants are operated by energy: pumps, air compressors, surface aerators, dewatering machines, analysis equipment, mixers, moving parts and other machinery are essential units in any treatment plant. A water treatment plant with 20ML capacity consumes approximately 255,000 kWh per month at a cost of AUD 55,000, water pumps consume approximately 170,000 kWh, and a sewer treatment plant with 5 ML capacity consumes around 130,000 kWh per month worth at a cost of AUD 29,000. Therefore, it is evident that sewer treatment plants consume more energy than water treatment plants. A sewer treatment plant (one-quarter the size of a water treatment plant) still consumes 64% the amount of energy consumed by the water treatment plant. Additionally, according to data, the major costs in treatment plants are pumping (especially when the plants are located away from residential areas) and aeration. There is no compromise when it comes to the quality of water released as drinking water and/or in the environment; energy consumption should be optimised while maintaining the high quality of drinking water. [2](#B2-energies-16-02433)]. Depending on the technology, plant scheme and quality of the treated water, wastewater treatment plants consume approximately 0.5-2.0 kWh per cubic meter of treated water. The highest electricity consumer in the plant is the aeration of activated sludge due to the need for a continuous air supply for the biological reaction of organic matter digestion by microorganisms. In medium- to large-scale plants, the aerobic digestion system accounts for 50-60% of the total required electricity, followed by the sludge treatment (15-25%) and recirculation pumping (15%) sections [ [3](#B3-energies-16-02433)]. [4](#B4-energies-16-02433)]. Photovoltaics is another option; the synergy of small- and medium-scale treatment plants with PV is of great interest from a 3-E (energetic-environmental-economic) point of view. A PV system and storage battery need to be designed to maximize output as a function of irradiance [ [5](#B5-energies-16-02433)]. However, this will require large footprint and expensive power storage technology in the form of batteries. [6](#B6-energies-16-02433)]. [7](#B7-energies-16-02433)]. It is important to use any source of energy in sewer treatment plants to mitigate energy consumption, such as sewage sludge to produce an alternative source of energy (biogas) [ [2](#B2-energies-16-02433)]. As aeration consumes the most energy in wastewater treatment plants, optimization can be achieved by increasing aeration efficiency. This is achieved by looping water through piping with the help of a Venturi aspirator. In another example, chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) can increase biogas production by 21%, reduce the weight of sludge by 12%, and may reduce the energy demand for aeration by 8%. Nitrogen removal in an autotrophic manner may lead to a further reduction in energy consumption by 20%. It is possible to operate a sewer treatment plant with up to 93% self-sufficient energy. To improve energy recovery and reduce energy usage in wastewater treatment plants, it is essential to capture organic matter in the sludge phase [ [8](#B8-energies-16-02433)]. [8](#B8-energies-16-02433)]. As CEPT captures a large amount of carbon in the inlet wastewater, this leads to reduction in the C/N ratio, which makes it difficult to remove nitrogen via a nitrification-denitrification process. A typical nitrification-denitrification process requires a significant amount of organic carbon. In this case, such as recirculating the filtrate from sludge dewatering back to the plant inlet is required. The treatment can be achieved by partial nitrification with the anammox (PN/A) and is then combined with inlet water. This has become a well-established technology for reducing the amount of nitrogen arriving at the inlet. In the PN/A process, ammonium is oxidized to nitrite by aerobic nitrifiers, and, subsequently, anammox bacteria convert ammonium with the produced nitrite to nitrogen gas and trace amounts of nitrate. The autotrophic PN/A process can reduce the demand for organic carbon and aeration by 100% and 60%, respectively, compared to conventional processes. The expected energy demand of PN/A side-stream treatment systems ranges from 0.8 kWh/kgN to 2 kWh/kgN, while removal efficiency can be maintained at more than 85% [ [8](#B8-energies-16-02433)]. [9](#B9-energies-16-02433)]. Wastewater can be used for the irrigation of other energy plants for the production of ethanol and biodiesel without the need for fertilisers. Sludge-to-energy and sludge-to-matter treatments are attractive concepts as well. Our main focus should be on identifying suitable sewage sludge treatments (configuration) for the potential recovery of matter and/or energy from sewage sludge, while meeting technological and economic constraints [ [10](#B10-energies-16-02433)].
