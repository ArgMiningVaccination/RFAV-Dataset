Arsenic occurs naturally in rocks and soil across Minnesota and can dissolve into groundwater. Drinking water that contains arsenic can increase your risk of cancer and other serious health effects. Unfortunately, there is no way to know the arsenic level in water before a well is drilled. Arsenic levels can vary betwe en wells, even within a small area. You cannot taste, see , or smell arsenic in your water. Drinking Water Standard The maximum level of arsenic the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows in community water systems is 10 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/ L*). However, consuming water with arsenic at levels lower than the EPA standard over many years can still increase your risk of cancer. As a result, the EPA has set a goal of 0 \u00b5g/L of arsenic in drinking water. *1 \u00b5g/L is the same as 1 part per billion ( ppb). Health Risks Consuming water with even low levels of arsenic over a long time is associated with diabetes and increased risk of cancers of the bladder, lungs, liver, and other organs. A rsenic can also contribute to cardiovascular and respiratory dis ease ; reduced intelligence in children ; and skin problems such as lesions, discoloration, and the development of corns. Health impacts of arsenic may take many years to develop . Test Your Well Water Test for Arsenic at Least Once MDH recommends you use an accredited laboratory to test your water. Contact an accredited laboratory to get sample containers and instructions, or ask your county environmental or public health services if they provide well testing services. New Wells are Tested for A rsenic As of August 2008, well contractors test each new ly drilled well for arsenic and share the results with the well owner and the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) . Find existing test results: Use the online Minnesota Well Index or c ontact MDH for test result s for a well constructed since 2008. Consider Confirming the Arsenic Level If arsenic was NOT detected in the first sample , your water is unlikely t o have arsenic later. If arsenic was detected in your new well , you may want to re test your well about six months after construction. MDH research found that when arsenic is detected in a new well, the level may increase or decrease in the first few months after construction. MDH may recommend you test for additional contaminants based on where you live.Protect Your Family If arsenic is detected at any level, consider : Installing a treatment unit or Using a different drinking water source . Drinking water with arsenic over many years increases the risk of diseases such as cancer . MDH highly recommends you take action if arsenic levels are above 10 \u00b5g/L. Water treatment units that reduce arsenic: Reverse Osmosis Distillation Adsorptive Media Anion Exchange iltration Oxidation Filtration Chlorination and F iltration Learn more at the \"Home Water Treatment\" webpage . A water treatment specialist can help you select the best option for your household. Water with arsenic is safe to use for other things (unless the level is above 500 \u00b5g/L). Since your skin does not easily absorb arsenic , your water is safe for washing dishes and clothes, brushing teeth, showering, bathing, and waterin g plants (including vegetables). Tips for r educing other contact with arsenic : Do not burn wood treated with arsenic . Be aware of ingredients in medicationsand folk remedies. Seal arsenic -treated wood structures . Make sure children wash their hands . Wash and peel vegetables grownunderground (e.g. , potatoes, carrots). Eat less rice, cereal grains , or other foods that contain arsenic . Do not use old pesticides and soilsupplements if they contain arsenic. Arsenic in Minnesota Water Arsenic has been detected in about 40 percent of new wells drilled since 2008 in Minnesota .1 About 10 percent of Minnesota's private wells have arsenic levels higher than 10 \u00b5g/L. Arsenic is in groundwate r throughout the state , but it is more likely in some areas . The map on the front shows where arsenic is found most often in Minnesota wells .2 The way glaciers moved across Minnesota affects where arsenic is found in sediment and groundwater. Arsenic levels can vary between wells, even within a small area. Some wells have arsenic levels as high as 350 \u00b5g/L. Background Information For most people , food and water are the biggest sources of arsenic exposure . There are two forms of arsenic: Inorganic arsenic is the type found in drinking water and is the more harmful type of arsenic. It is also found in rice, cereal grains , and other foods. It forms when arsenic combines withmetals and elements other than carbon. Organic arsenic is the most common type of arsenic found in food. It is common in fish andshellfish and is less harmful to health thaninorganic arsenic. It is formed when arsenic combines with carbon. While most arsenic in Minnesota's environment occurs naturally, some comes from human activity. Arsenic was an ingredient in some pesticides and was used as a wood preservative in the past. 1 The detection level for arsenic is usually 2 \u00b5g/L.
