Chiropractic care has been shown to help a lot of people in many different ways. Back pain, headaches, neck pain, and even arthritis are common ailments that chiropractors are often able to treat. Another surprising benefit that many people are finding from chiropractic care is detoxification. Actually, many people stumble upon this as a nice secondary benefit to getting chiropractic care. While they go in for a different reason, detoxification becomes a nice bonus. Check out the specifics of detox and chiropractic care below. Why Does Detox Happen? Many people find that after an adjustment, they feel a bit sick. In fact, some believe this is a negative thing, and it may send them into a state of worry or panic. If you feel sick after an adjustment, however, it may be the result of detoxification. This happens after the vertebrae of the spine are put back into their proper alignment. Since your central nervous system can then work correctly, it sends the message to your body to rid itself of toxins. As these toxins are released, your body is flooded with them and you get a sick sensation. This usually passes within a day or 2, and afterward, you may find that you feel much better than previously. Will It Hurt Me? It's understandable to think that it hurts your overall health since it initially causes a bit of discomfort. Detoxification is generally a good thing. When your body gets rid of toxins, it can stay generally healthier and in better shape. Though the initial phases might feel worse, the long term effects will be much better and well worth it.
