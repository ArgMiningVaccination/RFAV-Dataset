Homeopathy looks at the general health condition of the person and then prescribes remedies that can stimulate the body to function to its optimum capacity and this can naturally eliminate diseased cells and tissues from the body. The remedies stimulate the body's natural healing procedures without introducing chemicals to kill the disease. Here are 5 reasons to switch to homeopathic medicine: - It is an individualized treatment: A homeopathic practitioner evaluates the patient's overall health and discusses his problems and expectations before prescribing treatment. All the homeopathic remedies are made with the individual's specific climatic conditions, allergies, [stress](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/stress-disorder)factors, food habits and lifestyle in mind. Homeopathy also optimizes the immune system and it is equally effective for physical and [psychological disorders](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/treatment-for-psychological-disorders). - There are no side effects: Homeopathic medicines are made from natural substances and so they are non-toxic and free from side effects. They are given to the patient in small doses and so, the healing approach is gentle and gradual. They can also be used by people of all ages and even those in delicate conditions like [pregnancy](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pregnancy), chronic diseases etc. Even if the wrong medicine is prescribed to the patient, it does not cause much harm to the body. - Homeopathic medicines are easily accessible: Homeopathic remedies are available in most places as they are made directly from the abundant natural resources. There are also several alternatives to a medicine depending on the kinds of plants and minerals found in a particular region. Moreover, the medicines do not have an expiration date and can be stored for a long period of time if they are kept properly. - The remedies are non-invasive: No homeopathic remedy involves surgical procedures or invasive techniques. So, there is absolutely no chance of [infection](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/infection)or further complication. The medicines and therapies are also aimed at eliminating the root cause of the disorder instead of just providing temporary relief from the symptoms. - Homeopathic medicines are not addictive: Once the disease is healed, the person can easily stop using the medicines since they have no addictive property. This is because the active ingredient is used in minute quantities in homeopathic medication. Hence, these remedies are also safe for infants, children, [pregnant](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-pregnant)and breastfeeding women, aged people and people with addiction problems. "}
