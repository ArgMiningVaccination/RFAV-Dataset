Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00963)]. A total of 183 vaccines have entered clinical trials (with 11 approved for market and currently in post-marketing Phase 4 clinical trials), and 199 vaccines are in pre-clinical research. Approximately 5 billion people have received two vaccine doses, while 5.5 billion have had at least one dose [ [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00963)]. However, substantial research data have confirmed that six months post-vaccination, neutralizing antibody levels produced by inactivated, mRNA, and adenovirus vaccines have decreased to varying degrees. Concurrently, the ongoing prevalence and evolution of the virus have resulted in new variant strains, and the neutralizing ability of vaccines against these variants has also diminished. The emergence of the Delta and Omicron strains, in particular, has significantly challenged the protective efficacy of vaccines based on prototype strains. [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00963), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00963), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00963)]. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that boosting with different vaccine types after primary vaccination significantly increases neutralizing antibody levels [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00963)]. However, the duration and spectrum of protection against variants provided by heterologous prime-boost strategies require further validation. On the other hand, intradermal immunization involves injecting antigens into the dermis using a specialized intradermal injection needle. Previous research on other vaccines has shown that intradermal immunization can achieve better immune effects with smaller antigen dosages. For example, our data from inactivated vaccines against hand, foot, and mouth disease suggest that intradermal immunization can provide effective immunity in both mice and monkeys [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00963), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00963), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00963)]. Studies on poliomyelitis have also highlighted the superior immunity provided by fractional doses of intradermal immunization [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00963)], which is highly significant for reaching as many people as possible in vaccine-deficient areas. Consequently, the World Health Organization recommends intradermal immunization for polio vaccination as an alternative administration route to the current strategy. In the context of COVID-19 vaccines, we conducted preliminary studies on the short-term immune effects of inactivated vaccines through intradermal immunization [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00963), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00963)], but the long-term immune effects induced by different antigen types as well as the cross-immunity against various variants remain unclear. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cells and Virus [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00963)]. Vero cells were cultured in MEM-5% FCS medium at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator to form monolayers for neutralization assays. CHO cells expressing the S1 protein with mutated sites were grown in RPMI 1640-8% FCS medium using a standard protocol [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00963)], as described previously [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00963)]. The SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain (Wuhan strain) KMS-1 (GenBank No: MT226610.1) was isolated from the Yunnan Infectious Hospital by IMB, CAMS, in January 2020, as described previously [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00963)]. The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, SARS-CoV-2/C-Tan-BJ202101(B1.1.7), CSTR.16698.06. NPRC 2.062100002) (B.1.351, GDPCC-nCOV84, CSTR.16698.06. NPRC CCPM-B-V-049-2105-8) from Chongqing CDC and Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 CCPM-B-V-049-2112-18) from Institute of laboratory animal sciences, CAMS&PUMC and stored at IMB, CAMS as described previously [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00963)]. 2.2. SARS-CoV-2 Protein Vaccine and mRNA Vaccine [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00963)]. Briefly, the vaccine comprises a recombinant protein based on the optimized S1 sequence from the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain, incorporating six key mutations from variants of concern: N501Y and D614G from the Alpha strain K417N the Beta strain (B.1.351); and L452R, E484Q, and P681R from the Delta strain (B.1.617.2). The recombinant S1 protein containing a His-tag was expressed in a CHO system, purified, and formulated at 10 g/dose with Al(OH)3 adjuvant (0.0175 mg of Al/dose) for the immunological study. The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, as described previously [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00963)], was based on the full length of the Spike gene from the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain and packaged in core-shell-structured lipopolyplex (LPP) nanoparticles. 2.3. Animal Ethical Approval 2.4. Animal Immune Study 2.5. Neutralization Assay for Wild-Type and Variant Strains of SARS-CoV-2 2.6. ELISA Assay for Wild-Type and Variant Strains of SARS-CoV-2 [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00963)]. The absorbance of each well at 450 nm was measured using an ELISA plate reader (Gene Company, Beijing, China). Antibody serum samples yielding OD values at least 2.1-fold higher than the negative control at a test sample dilution of 1:400 were considered positive. Endpoint titers (ETs) were defined as the highest serum dilutions yielding positive OD values. GMTs were calculated as the geometric mean of the ETs of positive serum samples in each group. ELISA assays assessing binding antibody levels against variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron) were conducted using commercial ELISA kits (ACRO Biosystems Co., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2.7. ELISpot Assays for Wild-Type and Variant Strains of SARS-CoV-2 2.8. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 WT Strain by Sera from S mRNA/S1 Protein Heterologous Immunization [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00963-f001)B) to test for SARS-CoV-2. [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-00963-f002)A), high-dose mRNA intradermal groups (Groups D F) exhibited the highest neutralizing antibody levels at T1 (21 days post-first dose), with a more than 20-fold increase, followed by intramuscular groups (Groups B and E) with a 10-fold increase ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-00963-f002)B). The intradermal and intramuscular protein groups (Groups G and H) had the lowest increase. After the second dose, the peak level appeared at T2 (7 days post-second dose); the highest neutralizing antibody level was observed in the homologous mRNA intradermal group (Group F), followed by the homologous mRNA intramuscular group (Group E). In the high-dose heterologous groups, the intradermal group (Group D) had a higher peak level than the intramuscular group (Group B). Notably, in heterologous groups, the first low-dose mRNA dose induced relatively lower antibody levels, and the second intramuscular protein vaccine dose could effectively boost immunity, compensating for the initial low dose and achieving antibody levels comparable to the high-dose group (Groups A and B). However, with intradermal injection, the second dose had a limited boosting effect, resulting in a significant difference in final antibody levels between low- and high-dose groups (Groups C and D). The peak time of antibody level in the low-dose group (Group C) was delayed to T3 (14 days post-second dose). The lowest neutralizing antibody levels were observed in homologous protein groups (Groups G and H). After the first vaccination, there was no significant difference between the intramuscular and intradermal groups, but the intramuscular group (Group G) showed better boosting after the second vaccination, resulting in a higher overall and peak level than the intradermal group (Group H). 3.2. Cross-Reactive Antibodies Targeting VOCs Promoted via Boosting with Recombinant S1 Protein [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00963-f003)A,B). Similar to the changes observed in neutralizing antibodies, binding antibody levels increased 5.7-25.4 fold across all eight groups at 21 days after the first vaccination. In the mRNA-initiated groups (Groups A-F), there was no significant difference between intradermal and intramuscular groups under the same dosage. However, in the protein-initiated groups (Groups G and H), the intramuscular group outperformed the intradermal group. After the second vaccination, the binding antibody levels in both the heterologous groups (Groups A-D) and the homologous mRNA groups (Groups E and F) were substantially boosted, while the homologous protein groups (Groups G and H) exhibited only a four-fold increase. Compared to the baseline level (T0), the highest fold increase, 724.1-fold, was observed in the homologous mRNA intradermal group (Group F) at 7 days after the second vaccination (T2). In the low-dose heterologous intradermal group (Group C), the peak was delayed to 28 days after the second vaccination (T4), whereas no delay was observed in the low-dose intramuscular group (Group A). The peak in Group A occurred 7 days after the second immunization (T2); however, the decline from the peak was faster, appearing 28 days after the second immunization (T4). The overall levels in the two homologous protein groups (Groups G and H) were the lowest. No significant difference was observed between these groups and others at T1; they even surpassed the low-dose heterologous intradermal group (Group C). However, after the second vaccination, these two groups fell behind the others, with the intramuscular group (Group G) outperforming the intradermal group (Group H). A peak-delay was also observed in the intradermal group (Group H), with the peak appearing 14 days after the second vaccination (T3). [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00963-f003)C-L). As with the WT strain, the GMT levels of binding antibodies against variant strains in all eight groups increased compared to the baseline at 21 days after the first vaccination (T1). The six mRNA-initiated groups (Groups A-F) showed a larger increase, while the two protein-initiated groups (Groups G and H) exhibited a smaller increase. At 7 days after the second vaccination (T2), the four heterologous groups (Groups A-D) displayed a lower fold increase compared to T1, and the two homologous mRNA groups (Groups E and F) showed slightly higher fold increases. The overall levels were the highest in the homologous mRNA groups (Groups E and F), with the intradermal group (Group F) outperforming the intramuscular group (Group E). In the four heterologous groups, no significant difference was observed in the high-dose groups (Groups B and D); however, in the low-dose groups, the peak time for the intradermal group (Group C) was delayed, and attenuation was accelerated in the intramuscular group (Group A). The lowest overall levels were found in the two homologous protein groups (Group G and H), in which the intramuscular group (Group G) outperformed the intradermal group (Group H). The results showed that the binding antibody levels against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta strains in the homologous mutant protein groups (Groups G and H) were significantly lower than those in the groups initiated with WT mRNA (Groups A-F). However, this difference was not as pronounced for the Omicron strain. The mutant protein effectively increased reactivity against the Omicron strain after the first and second vaccinations, resulting in final antibody levels comparable to those in the other groups. This suggests that immunization with an antigen containing mutations from multiple variants during the first vaccination could help develop immunity that favors more diverse strains (such as Omicron) than the WT. Moreover, while GMT values indicated differences between groups, statistical analysis substantiated significance only for the most apparent comparisons (e.g., Group E and F versus Group G and H). The small sample size might affect these results, and additional studies are required for confirmation. 3.3. Over Seven-Month, Long-Term Antibody Response Induced by S mRNA/S1 Protein Heterologous Immunization [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00963-f004)A), with less than a two-fold change compared to 28 days post-second vaccination (T4, [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00963-f004)B). Regarding binding antibody levels in the ELISA, reactivity against the WT S protein remained stable in groups initiated with mRNA (Group A-F), with a change of less than two-fold ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00963-f004)C,I). There was even a small increase in the high-dose heterologous intradermal group (Group B). However, homologous protein groups experienced a 2-4-fold decrease compared to T4. We then assessed the cross-reactivity of each group against other variants ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00963-f004)D-I). All groups displayed varying degrees of decrease, with more severe reductions observed for Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants, showing an up-to-eight-fold decrease against Omicron. Among these, the low-dose heterologous intradermal group (Group C), which had a delayed peak time, exhibited a more severe decrease in binding antibody levels against all variants. The two homologous protein groups (Groups G and H) also experienced severe decreases, even with lower overall antibody levels. [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-00963-f005)A,B). Overall, the GMT levels of neutralizing antibodies were higher in the groups with mRNA initiation (Groups A-F) and lowest in the homologous protein groups (Groups G and H). Within the heterologous intramuscular groups (Groups A and B), the high-dose group (Group B) demonstrated higher neutralization ability against multiple variants, significantly differing from the low-dose group (Group A). However, in the heterologous intradermal groups (Groups C and D), the low-dose group (Group C) exhibited a neutralization ability comparable to that of the high-dose group (Group D). This advantage of intradermal immunization was also observed in the two homologous mRNA groups (Groups E and F), corresponding to the highest overall antibody levels in the homologous mRNA intradermal group (Group F), as previously described. Although the two homologous protein groups (Groups G and H) retained a certain level of binding antibody, the neutralizing antibody levels were extremely low. Interestingly, after seven months, the high-dose heterologous intramuscular group (Group B), both high- and low-dose heterologous intradermal groups (Groups C and D), and the homologous mRNA intramuscular group (Group E) all exhibited increased neutralizing ability against the Alpha, Beta, and Delta strains compared to the WT strain, with the most pronounced increase observed for the Alpha strain ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-00963-f005)B). The neutralizing ability against the Omicron strain was reduced by tens of folds compared to the WT strain in all groups, with the smallest reduction being only 11-fold in the high-dose heterologous intradermal group (Group D). Analogous to the previous result in binding antibody level, statistical analysis on neutralizing antibodies revealed significance only for the most noticeable comparisons (e.g., Groups E and F versus Groups G and H), and the differences within Groups A-F were not always consistently statistically significant. Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the conclusions. 3.4. Over Seven-Month, Long-Term Cellular Immune Responses Induced by S mRNA/S1 Protein Heterologous Vaccine [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-00963-f005)C-E). Intriguingly, cellular immunity levels against multiple variants within each group displayed no substantial differences and were approximately the same: excluding the two homologous protein groups (Group G and H) with the lowest levels, the differences in cellular immunity levels against variants in all other groups were within a two-fold range compared to the WT strain ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-00963-f005)D). This observation suggests that, to some extent, although the antibodies produced by vaccination might not effectively neutralize emerging variants, cellular immunity maintains a broader and more effective response for a longer period than antibody immunity. 4. Discussion [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00963), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00963)]. The number of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific memory B cells remains stable for at least 6 to 12 months [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00963)], and B-cell clonal selection and accumulation accompanied by neutralizing antibody release [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00963)] support the persistence of humoral immunity after infection [ [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00963)]. In terms of vaccine-induced immunity, Moderna studies have demonstrated that clinical trial participants maintained high levels of antibodies within 6 months after receiving the second dose of their mRNA-1273 vaccine [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00963)]. Similarly, our results reveal that at seven months post-vaccination, all mouse groups that initiated with mRNA vaccines (heterologous mRNA/protein intramuscular/intradermal groups and homologous mRNA intramuscular/intradermal groups) retained stable binding antibodies, neutralizing antibody levels, and T cell responses against the WT strain. [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00963)]. Therefore, the combination of a vaccine capable of cross-reacting with past variants and a specific vaccine against the current variant is more likely to ensure a greater neutralization spectrum in naive hosts [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00963)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00963)]. The analysis of T cell epitopes also demonstrated that the T cell epitopes in the Omicron strain were largely conserved compared with the WT strain, suggesting that memory T cells may provide protection in reinfection or breakthrough infection of Omicron [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00963)]. Our results suggest that, seven months after vaccination, effective immune responses were established by homologous or heterologous vaccination initiated with the WT S mRNA vaccine. Although the differences in neutralization ability against variants were significant, the differences in T cell response levels against variants were not pronounced, even for Omicron, which had the lowest levels of neutralizing antibodies, but also detected significant and comparable T-cell responses. This result confirms the persistence and broad spectrum of T-cell responses. [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00963)]. Mateus et al. reported the results of a clinical trial, showing that a low dosage of Moderna mRNA vaccine can induce long-lasting neutralizing antibodies as well as memory CD4+ T cell immunity, including T follicular helper (TfH) and IFN--secreting cells [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00963)]. In our study, we designed a procedure of low-dose versus high-dose mRNA vaccination followed by the same dosage of protein vaccination. After comparing intradermal and intramuscular administration routes, we found that although the peak antibody levels in the two low-dose mRNA groups were similar, the peak time in the intradermal group was delayed to 28 days after the second vaccination, whereas no such delay was observed in the low-dose intramuscular mRNA group. In addition, at the end of seven months, the low-dose intradermal group exhibited the same or slightly higher neutralizing antibody levels as the high-dose group. This seems to indicate that low-dose intradermal heterologous immunization induces a slower increase, but ultimately long-lasting and broad-spectrum immunity. Furthermore, after high-dose mRNA vaccination, the boosting of a low-dose mRNA was effective enough to enhance immunity, and this high-low-dose prime-boost procedure performed better via the intradermal route. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00963)]. Our study demonstrated that although the homologous mRNA groups exhibited the highest peak level of antibodies, after a slow decay of seven months, antibody levels in the heterologous groups reached a level more comparable to that of the homologous mRNA groups, particularly evident when tested against the Delta and Omicron strains. In the homologous mRNA groups, the broad-spectrum was more apparent in the intradermal group than in the intramuscular group, and the intradermal route compensated to some extent for the limits on the broadness of the spectrum provided by homologous mRNA vaccination. This result suggests that intradermal and intramuscular routes appear to have inconsistent kinetics and mechanisms of action. In the homologous mRNA groups, under the same dosage, the effect of the intradermal route was superior to that of the intramuscular route. In heterologous groups, the dosage of the first mRNA had a stronger impact on the ultimate antibody level in the intradermal route than the intramuscular route. In the homologous protein groups, the intramuscular group performed better overall than the intradermal group. Taken together, these results suggest that mRNA could play a more effective role in the intradermal route, and the high dosage of the first vaccination could significantly increase the antibody level and the speed of antibody production during the entire immune process. Moreover, the protein can play a more effective role in the intramuscular route. The intradermal administration route has been used in many vaccines [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00963)], and there is evidence that it can elicit the same level of protection with a reduced amount of antigen [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00963), [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00963)], which is economically important for the goal of extending as many vaccines as possible to less developed areas in an emergency to achieve ultimate herd immunity. However, the immune mechanisms underlying the intradermal and intramuscular routes are still largely unknown, and further exploration on this topic will help to understand how the immune system responds to antigens from different routes and to formulate more targeted vaccine administration strategies corresponding to different types of antigens.
