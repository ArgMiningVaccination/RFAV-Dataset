Comparedto traditional drug carriers, which could only control the release of the agents in a monotonic manner, the newdrug carriers are able to provide a precise control over the release time and the quantity of drug introduced into the patient's body. To achieve this goal, scientists have introduced \"programmed \"and \"on-demand \"ap- proaches. The former provides delivery systems with a sophisticated architecture to precisely tune the releaserate for a de nite time period, while the latter includes systems directly controlled by an operator/practitioner, perhaps with a remote device triggering/affecting the implanted or injected drug carrier. Ideally, such devices can determine flexible release pattern and intensify the ef cacy of a therapy via controlling time, duration, dos- age, and location of drug release in a predictable, repeatable, and reliable manner.

Introduction The development of biodegradable/biocompatible materials and novel drug delivery systems (DDSs) represents a revolution in med- icine over the years and leading to considerable advancements in other biomedical domains including biomaterials science and tissue engineering [ 1-6], while developing interdisciplinary collaborations among chemists, biologists, clinicians, and engineers [ 7]. DDSs, the macro-/micro-/nano-carriers by which therapeutic agents are intro- duced into the patient body, play a critical role in addressing the de- ciencies of conventional drug ad ministration and improving drug safety, patient compliance, and convenience [ 8-10]. With increasing awareness of the importance of biodistribution and pharmacokinet- ics for an ef cacious treatment, the optimal design and application of DDSs have become more important now than it ever has been in the past [ 11]. In addition, the short half-life of the new bio-therapeutic agents such as proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids, and their non- speci c distribution, potential toxicity, and side-effects have been t h ed r i v i n gf o r c ef o rt h ed e s i g no fo p t i m a ld e v i c e sw h i c hp r o t e c t them from degradation and control their release at a predetermined rate [ 12-16]. The concept of sustained release was rst introduced in 1960s [17,18], while notable researchers including Folkman, Higuchi, Langer, Peppas, Heller, Ringsdorf, and Speiser have had signi cant contributions in the rapid development of the eld [19-33]. Although the initial DDSs, i.e. macroscopic drug depots, reduced the risk of systemic toxicity through maintaining the concentration of medications within a thera- peutic window, their application was eventually con ned as they re- leased their cargos over a limited period (e.g. ~one day) and their surrounding environment (i.e. pH, temperature, ionic strength) had un- desired effects on their performance [ 17,34,35]. Subsequently, DDSs, which can control the release of the agents at constant rates and with high reproducibility in-vitro and in-vivo, have been developed for local or systemic therapy and some have reached the stage of clinical tri-als [36,37]. The eld of controlled release is currently further maturated andnds many important applications in every eld of medicine for cancer [ 6,38,39], pain [ 40,41], diabetes [ 42 -44], ischemia [ 45-48], and myocardial treatments [ 49-52].Despite these signi cant achievements in drug delivery technologies over the past years, most carriers can only provide monotonic release proles irrespective of time, patients' needs, and changes in physiolog- ical circumstances. In other words, the encapsulating matrix does not have a speci c contribution in tuning the release rate, and only slows drug release. Moreover, speci c agents such as vaccines and proteins re- quire a particular administration strategy for a de nite period, which considerably affects their stability, bioavailability, and ef cacy [ 53-56]. Therefore, it is crucial to develop DDSs with particular architecture and physicochemical properties, which are able to adjust the release prole under different circumstances. Due to rapid advancement in materials science and manufactur- ing technologies, the fabrication of advanced DDSs with a custom- ized release pro le is not a dream anymore. The existing DDSs can roughly be categorized into two groups of \"controllable \"and \"un- controllable \"devices. In controllable devices, the release of drug can be adjusted through the interaction between smart materials and changes in their environment (i.e. pH and redox, oxidation, and enzyme concentrations [ 57-61]) or by an operator remotely controlling the conditions (temperature, magnetic force, light inten- sity, and/or ultrasound m agnitude and frequency [ 62-65]). More- over, the advancements in micro-/nano-fabrication technologies (e.g. microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), 3D printing, etc. [ 66-69]) have increased interests in the fabrication of devices with a programed (speci ct i m ea n d location) release pro les. In contrast, release rates for the non- programmed group of carriers mainly follow physicochemical prop- erties of the materials. For instance, the release of drug from conven- tional polymeric particles is generally controlled by diffusion mechanism, degradation, and surface erosion [ 70-72]. However, changes to the geometry and architecture of such devices may provide unique opportunity to fabricate simple carriers with tunable drug re- lease pro les. The aim of this review is to provide an informative account of phys- ical and chemical requirements for the development of advanced DDSs with desired release pro les. The conventional DDSs and preparation techniques with emphasize on polymeric particles will be introduced. Next, the mechanism of controlled release from those drug carriers105 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138through reviewing the mathematical equation describing the relations among physiochemical parameters will be focused. Particular attention will be paid to pulsatile (programmed and remotely controlled) DDSs using selected examples from the literature, as they have found numer- ous applications in chronotherapy. Finally, the paper will explore new technologies (microchips and 3D-printing) for the fabrication of novel DDSs with sophisticated pro les. 2. Drug delivery systems with conventional release pro les Various materials such as mesoporous silica, hydrogels, micelles, sugars, starches and biopolymers have been investigated for develop- ment of drug delivery devices. In this section, the role and development of biopolymers in drug delivery is evaluated. Biopolymers are widely used in development of drug delivery devices owing to their biocom- patibility and biodegradability [ 73-77], making it possible for the de- sign of tunable drug releasing systems for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs [ 78]. Diffusion-controlled models can be broadly applied to reservoir and monolithic (or matrix-based) drug delivery systems where drug release typically occurs before effects of polymer swelling and degradation begins [ 79]. Monolithic drug delivery devices make up a signi cant portion in the development of polymeric con- trolled release devices owing to their relatively straightforward methods for preparation (i.e. dissolution or dispersion of drug through- out the polymer matrix). The drug delivery devices are generally pre- pared by dissolving the drug and polymer in a suitable common solvent [ 80], followed by co-precipitation of the drug-polymer matrix via removal of the solvent by evaporation or using an anti-solvent. The well-established fabrication strategies for the preparation of mono- lithic drug delivery systems will be discussed in Section 2.4 . In diffusion- controlled systems, the rate of drug release can be in fluenced by the drug concentration in the polymer matrix [ 81], the average size of the drug delivery device, porosity, and the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the polymer matrix [ 79,82]. These factors can be tuned by the selec- tion of material used for the drug delivery device ( Section 2.2 )o rb y control of the fabrication technique selected for the preparation of drug delivery device. 2.1. Permeability and solubility of drugs 2.1.1. Hydrophobic drugs Under the biopharmaceutics classi cation system (BCS) by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [ 83], drug compounds can be classi ed ac- cording to permeability (Class 2); Low permeability and high solubility (Class 3) and Low permeability and low solubility (Class 4). Hydrophobic or poorly water-soluble drugs (Class 2 and Class 4) face challenges in their therapeutic applications due to poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability [ 80,84]. Micro/ nano-encapsulation in a polymer carrier is one of the strategies for im- proving the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic drug com- pounds by physical modi cation [ 84]. In the preparation of monolithic devices for hydrophobic drugs, it is important to understand the solubility of the drug in the wetted poly- mer matrix. For hydrophobic drugs having low solubility and dissolu- tion rates, release pro les from non-swelling and non-degrading polymers can be categorized into monolithic dispersion and monolithic solution systems [ 79]. Monolithic drug dispersion can lead to very slow and incomplete drug release after long release times as observed from in-vitro studies with hydrophobic drugs such as paclitaxel and lidocaine[85,86]. In-vitro release and mathematical modeling studies 86], nifedipine [ 87] and respectively in poly lactic acid (PLA) microparticulate systems validate the diffusion dissolution mechanism proposed by Harland [ 81].2.1.2. Hydrophilic drugs Hydrophilic or water-soluble drugs (Class 1 and Class 3) face chal- lenges in their therapeutic applications due to high aqueous solubility. In the preparation of monolithic dispersion, it is usually not possible to dissolve the drug in a common organic solvent as the polymer [ 82]. Typ- ically, a water-in-oil emulsion will be produced and subsequently proc- essed via one of the strategies in Fig. 1 to produce the drug loaded polymeric device. In the case of solvent evaporation from a water/oil/ water emulsion system, it is dif cult to attain high encapsulation ef - ciency due to the tendency for the hydrophilic drug to diffuse to the bulk aqueous phase during the emulsi cation/solvent evaporation step, leading to the loss of large amounts of drug [ 82]. Other strategies include using ultrasonic energy to disperse the hydrophilic drug in an organic solution containing the dissolved polymer [ 88,89]. Hydrophilic drug monolithic devices generally display large initial burst release proles. 2.2. Materials for polymeric drug delivery devices Since the development of drug delivery research, many natural and synthetic polymers have been studied and evaluated for its biocompat- ibility and application as a drug delivery carrier. A comprehensive over- view of polymers used for controlled drug release can be found in Uhrich et al. [ 73] and in the review article by Park et al. [ 77].Table 1 summarizes the biopolymers commonly used in drug delivery research for matrix-based microscale devices and the release pro le associated with its application. The nature of the biopolymer such as polymer chain length, func- tional groups, end groups, etc., in fluence the mechanism of drug release (diffusion, dissolution, swelling, surface erosion, bulk degradation, etc.)[73,77,86,100 -109]. Fabrication methods can in fluence the surface mor- phology, size and size distribution, and the shape of the drug delivery devices ( Section 2.4 ). In the review by Siepmann and Siepmann [ 79], mathematical equations for reservoir and monolithic drug delivery sys- tems with different geometries were presented, providing useful ap- proximate solutions for modeling microscale drug delivery devices such as microparticles (sphere), micro bers (cylinder), and micro lms (slab). Drug delivery systems with polymer blending [ 110], multi- layered polymer coating and stimuli-sensitive polymers [ 111]h a v e also been developed to achieve drug release pro les with \"zero order \" type release as elaborated further in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 . 2.3. Microscale drug delivery devices Microscale drug delivery devices can be broadly classi ed into the following categories: Microparticles (MP), Micro bers (MF), and Micro- porous scaffold (MPS). PLGA has been cited as the \"gold standard \"and most successful biodegradable polymer for drug delivery [ 73,100]. Ex- amples of each type of drug delivery devices based on model PLGA poly- mer is summarized in Fig. 1 . 2.3.1. Microparticle (MP) Drug-loaded biopolymeric microparticles have been developed sustained delivery via nasal delivery, pulmonary inhalation, oral deliv- ery [112] or implant delivery [ 113]. Microparticle drug delivery devices with PLGA, PLA and PGA are the most commonly investigated due to their promising applications for sustained release. Successful applica- tions include the development of Lupron Depot\u00ae, a sustained delivery microparticle-based depot for leuprolide [ 112,114,115]. 2.3.2. Micro ber (MF) and nano ber (NF) Common methods for fabrication of drug-encapsulated micro bers include wet spinning/extrusion and electrospinning. Micro bers from biopolymers as PLGA, etc., have potential biomedical applica- tions for wound dressings, surgical implants and use as scaffold mate- rial. Synthetic drugs and proteins can be encapsulated in micro- and106 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138nano- bers for sustained drug delivery [ 116]. Commercial applications of micro ber polymers drug delivery include the Absorv\u00ae systems by Zeus Inc. [ 117], and SNC BEST electrospinning technology [ 118].2.3.3. Microporous-structured polymer scaffold (MPS) Microporous polymeric structures can be used as implants for post- surgical biomechanical support as well as drug delivery [ 113]. Fig. 1.

Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138Microporous scaffolds can be produced by solvent casting or phase sep- aration/leaching methods [ 98]. Supercritical CO 2foaming has terest in the production of microporous biopolymeric foams for biomedical applications due to its potential for solvent-free or very low residual solvent nal product [ 99]. Supercritical CO 2foaming has been adapted for the [ 119], 5-fluorouracil [ 121]. 2.4. Fabrication methods for microscale drug delivery devices with normal release pro le Normal release systems or diffusion-controlled systems are mostly monolithic devices [ 78]. For simple diffusion-controlled systems, the drug is dispersed in a polymer matrix, which does not swell nor degrade during the drug release period. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the com- mon processing strategies used for fabrication of various microscale monolithic drug delivery devices. 2.4.1. Emulsi cation-solvent evaporation Solvent evaporation is a widely used technique for the production of drug microencapsulated polymeric systems. Typically, the steps in- volved in emulsi cation-solvent evaporation [ 82,122] include (1) disso- lution/dispersion of drug in organic solution with the polymer; (2) emulsi cation of the organic phase in an aqueous phase; (3) extrac- tion of organic solvent from dispersed phase followed by solvent evap- oration; (4) recovery and drying of microspheres. Examples of hydrophobic drugs encapsulated in PLGA 123] and paclitaxel [ 124]. The encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs typically requires an addi- tional step of dispersion an aqueous phase of dissolved drug into the or- ganic solution before emulsi cation in the aqueous [ 125]a n dg e n t a m i c i n [126]. Factors in fluencing the properties of microspheres (i.e. size, surface morphology and extent of agglomeration, etc.) produced by emulsi cation-solvent evaporation technique include the properties and ratio of materials (solvent, surfactant, drug, polymer, etc.) used in the process and the operating conditions such as temperature, pressure,geometry of the reactor and agitation (ultrasonic or stirring) energy. A comprehensive review of the factors can be found in Li et al. [ 82]. 2.4.2. Spray drying Spray drying can be applied to both aqueous and organic solutions for the production of microparticle drug delivery devices. Spray drying is a well-established process applicable for a wide range of formulations [127] for the food, pharmaceutical and materials industries. The rst step in spray drying for microencapsulation involves solution prepara- tion similar to step (1) of emulsi cation-solvent evaporation method described in Section 2.4.1 . This is typically followed by (2) atomization of the solution; (3) extraction of organic solvent or water from the at- omized droplets; (4) recovery of dried microparticles via a cyclone. In spray drying, the media of extraction of organic solvent can be hot air or nitrogen. Factors in fluencing the properties (size and surface mor- phology) of drug-loaded powders produced by spray drying include the properties and ratio of materials (solvent, drug, polymer, etc.) and the operating conditions such as the solution and drying gas flow rate, temperature of drying gas, geometry of the spray dryer and cyclone sep- arator, the geometry of the solution atomizer, etc. A comprehensive re- view for the particle formation by spray drying can be found in references [ 127,128]. 2.4.3. Electrospraying Electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA), also known as electrospray, involves the breakup of a solution jet into ne dropletsTable 1 Polymers commonly used in drug delivery systems. Classi cation Type of polymer Summary and release mechanism Polyesters Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)The most successful biopolymer in drug delivery. Physical properties and degradation pro le can be altered by varying the lactic to glycolic ratio and molecular weight of the polymer [ 77]. PLGA undergoes bulk erosion with pseudo- rst-order degradation kinetics [ 100]. Release mechanisms include drug diffusion, polymer swelling and bulk polymer degradation [ 100]. Polylactic acid (PLA) Naturally occurring poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) is highly crystalline with much slower degradation rate than PLGA. Drug diffusion-dissolution model has been applied for drug delivery devices developed using PLLA [ 86,101]. Polyglycolic acid (PGA) PGA has very fast degradation rates in-vitro and in-vivo . Release mechanism based on diffusion followed by bulk degradation. Poly ( -caprolactone) (PCL)Biodegradable, semi-crystalline polymer with very slow degradation. Suitable for long term delivery for period of over a year via drug diffusion [ 100]. Poly (phosphoesters)(PPEs)Degradation rate can be controlled by percentage of phosphate content in the polymer backbone. Combined degradation mechanism of surface and bulk erosion [ 77,102]. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)Biodegradable polymers that can be produced using bacteria [ 103,104]. Insoluble in water and stable in air. Complete degradation to water and carbon dioxide or to methane and carbon dioxide under aerobic and anaerobic conditions,respectively.Drug release and degradation via surface erosion [ 105]. The copolymer PHBV, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) is similar to PLA in processing [ 104]. Poly (orthoesters) (POEs) [ 106]POEs has high hydrophobicity and aqueous impermeability with degradation via surface erosion. POE I POE I is hydrolyzed under aqueous environment with autocatalytic hydrolysis reaction, which needs to be stabilized with a base such as sodium carbonate. POE II POE II is highly hydrophobic and requires incorporation of acidic excipients into the polymer matrix to increase surface erosion rate. However, this could accelerate the autocatalytic hydrolysis. POE III POE III exists as a semi-solid polymer at room temperatures. No autocatalytic hydrolysis reaction during degradation.POE IV POE IV is a modi ed POE II with a short segment of lactic or glycolic acid incorporated into its backbone. Erosion rate can be controlled by speci c adjustments of these segments in the polymer. Drug release is primarily by surface erosion. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) (also termed as polyethylene oxide (PEO))Hydrophilic polymer with good biocompatibility. PEG is commonly used to form copolymers such as the PLA-PEG copolymer, and also attached to therapeutic proteins for prolonged circulation in the body [ 73]. Poly(anhydrides) Poly(anhydrides) undergo erosion heterogeneously [ 73]. Poly (anhydride-imides) Poly (anhydride-imides) appear to undergo predominantly surface erosion in-vitro and have good mechanical properties [107]. Poly (anhydride-esters) Poly (anhydride esters) undergo hydrolytic degradation to release salicylic acid, a compound with medicinal properties [108]. Poly (ester amide)s (PEAs)PEAs are polymers with both ester and amide linkages in their polymeric chain, combining the degradability of polyesters with good thermo-mechanical properties of polyamides for biomedical applications [ 109].108 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138by the application of an external electrical eld at the nozzle [ 129 -132]. Controlling the droplet formation and subsequent solvent evaporation from the droplets lead to formation of microparticles of adjustable size and morphology [ 129,131]. EHDA can be applied to single or coaxial nozzles [ 133] for drug delivery microencapsulation. EHDA can be used to process a wide range of polymers ranging from cellulose, chitosan, PLA, PLGA, PCL, polystyrene, and even metals. The size of particles ob-tained is dependent on the droplet size formed at the nozzle or jet in EHDA. This can be in fluenced by the solution properties ( fluid viscosity, density, conductivity, etc.), the voltage applied, and the con guration of the nozzle. A comprehensive analysis for the development of drug deliv- ery microparticles can be found in the paper by Xie et al. [ 134]. 2.4.4. Supercritical fluids processing The non-toxic nature and highly tunable properties of supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2) present many opportunities for the development of drug delivery systems with minimal to zero residual organic solvent. In the design and fabrication of drug delivery devices, supercritical car- bon dioxide can act as a solvent, co-solvent, antisolvent, drying agent [135] or as a foaming agent [ 136] to produce microparticles or micro- structured polymeric systems. The most common technique using su- percritical fluid processing for drug delivery application is the supercrit- ical antisolvent process. In this process, drug-polymer solution is prepared similar to step (1) described in Sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 . Spraying the organic solution into a high-pressure chamber with super- critical carbon dioxide removes the organic solvent from the solution, leading to precipitation of the drug-polymer matrix as microencapsu- developed using supercritical CO2as an antisolvent. The process can be controlled by controlling the phase behavior of the feed material (drug, polymer, solvent) in super- critical CO 2, and also by extent of mass transfer between solvent and CO2. Various strategies for drug delivery formulations using supercriti- cal CO 2processing can be found in the review by Davies et al. [ 139]. A recent review by Nuchuchua et al. [ 135] provides a comprehensive summary of drug delivery particles formulated by supercritical CO 2 technologies. 3. Mathematical models for drug delivery systems Here, the mathematical models for reservoir and monolithic systems are described. The practical bene ts of developing a mathematical model for DDS are the elucidation of the governing mechanism of drug release and the simulation of the effect of the design parameters on the drug release pro le. In fact, the required composition (drug type and loading, polymer and additives) and geometry (size and shape) of DDS need to be experimentally formulated in order to deter- mine the drug release pro le. With a suitable mathematical model, such pro le may be theoretically predicted, thereby reducing the num- ber of experiments to be conducted. Overall, the development of new DDS can be greatly facilitated via mathematical models. 3.1. Modeling of drug release from single-polymer matrix The classi cation of monolithic solutions and monolithic dispersions can be differentiated based on the ratio of initial drug loading to drug solubility. Assuming uniform initial drug distribution, constant drug dif- fusivity, and perfect sink conditions, Fick's diffusion solutions for differ- ent geometries can be determined for monolithic solution DDS ( Table 2 , Eqs. (1) -(3)). Simpli ed expressions for initial and nal stages of drug release have been developed for the various geometries [ 140] instead of the in nite series described above. In monolithic dispersion where there is a high loading to solubility ratio, a portion of the drug is dissolved in the polymer matrix while the rest is distributed as crystalline and/or amorphous undissolveddrug particles. For a given initial total drug concentration ( c0), the dis- solved drug is maintained at its drug solubility concentration ( cs), while the undissolved drug is maintained at concentration c0cs.T h e dissolved drug at and near the surface is released and available for diffu- sion, but it can be rapidly replaced by dissolution of neighboring drug particles. There is a moving front of dissolution established inside the monolith. The mathematical treatment of this type of drug delivery sys-tem is rather complicated, and one can refer to other references for de- tails [ 141 -144]. A simple and accurate solution based on the Higuchi equation [ 145] for release from both faces of a thin slab is available as follows: M t\u00bc2A 2c0cs \u00f0\u00de csDtp \u00f04\u00de where Ais the surface area. The Higuchi equation has been applied to other geometries. Assum- ing i) initial drug concentration is much higher than drug solubility (i.e., c0cs), ii) undissolved drug particles are dispersed and much smaller in size than the dimension of the drug delivery device, iii) swell- ing or dissolution of the polymer matrix is negligible, iv) constant drug diffusivity, and v) under perfect sink conditions, the fractional drug re- lease for the different geometries can be expressed ( Table 2 ,E q s .( 5 ) - (7)). The upper time limits refer to points where the moving dissolution front reaches the center of the device, after which only dissolved drug remains. From this point onwards, in nite series expressions are used to describe the drug release. This typically corresponds to a minor part of the release process, especially when c0cs. The earlier described model does not consider the impact of polymer erosion on drug release. Several mathematical models attempt to eluci- date the polymer erosion process and could accurately depict the drug release obtained experimentally. In theory, the process encompasses chemical reactions that produce oligomers and monomers in the poly-mer matrix, and mass transport of drug and degradation products within the matrix. The process is often accompanied by multifaceted physical and chemical phenomena, such as porosity changes, micro- environmental pH changes, and autocatalytic polymer degradation. This complex interplay of multiple mechanisms impedes the establish- ment of a constructive and precise mathematical model that is able to predict all the different contributions on the resulting drug release ki- netics from a bio-erodible polymer matrix. While there have been several empirical models describing drug re- lease kinetics from a bio-erodible polymer matrix [ 146 -149], this paper will be focusing on mechanistic models describing the erosion process as a combination of polymer diffusion and reaction. Harland et al. [ 81] established the rst dissolution model for a bulk-eroding polymer ma- trix. The model takes into account the effective Fickian diffusion and dis- solution of the solute into liquid- lled pores. The drug transport model is expressed as t\u00bcDe2C effective diffusivity in liquid- lled pores, respectively, kis the drug dissolution rate constant, is the porosity of the polymer matrix and Csis the equivalent drug sat- uration concentration in the solution found in the pores. The solution for fraction of drug release under in nite mass transfer andnite convective mass transfer conditions at the surface may be ob- tained.

Under nite convective mass transcendental equation of nRcot(nR)+Sh1=0 . Some other models applied the Fick's second law, but de ned drug diffusivity as a function of polymer molecular weight to account for the increase in drug release during polymer erosion. These models are advantageous since the polymer molecular weight changes with time due to erosion, and the dependence of drug diffusivity on molecular weight can be experimentally determined, thus minimizing the number of parameters that need to be tted. During hydrolysis, water molecules attack the polymer chain bonds, leading to a decrease in the average molecular weight of polymer ma- trix. Charlier et al. [ 150] postulated that the change in the polymer mo- lecular weight ( Mw)f o l l o w sa rst-order kinetic process of polymer chain cleavage.

In addition, the drug diffusion coef cient ( De) during polymer ero- sion is assumed to correlate inversely to the polymer molecular weight as follows: De D0\u00bcMw;0 Mw\u00f013\u00de So, De\u00bcD0exp initial drug diffusion coef cient. By assuming a linear concentration gradient as predicted in the clas- sical Higuchi model, the rate of drug release is: Mt\u00bcS2C0CsD0ekdegt1/C0/C1 kdeg ! \u00f015\u00de where Sis the exposed surface area. In a similar study, Raman et al. [ 151] considered the presence of lag time in the exponential function. In their model, the drug diffusivity is approximated based on an empirical polynomial t, relating ln ( De) and ln ( Mw), and the initial radial drug distribution is established using data from confocal fluorescence microscopy. He et al. [ 152] also described the variation of Dewith time as an ex- ponential function, similar to Charlier's approach. In their model, they considered the diffusion solution developed by Baker and Lonsdale [153] and the pure matrix erosion ( FE)b yF i t z g e r a l da n dC o r r i g a n [154].

The upper time limits in Eqs. (5) to (7) refer to points where the moving dissolution front reaches the center of the device, after which only dissolved drug remains. From this point onwards, in nite series expressions are used to describe the drug release. This typically corresponds to a minor part of the release process, especially when c0cs.110 P.

The proposed model is able to describe the triphasic drug release ki- netics observed for bio-erodible polymer matrix, which included i) an initial burst phase, (typically caused by high initial drug release rate due to short diffusion pathways), ii) an intermediate phase of approxi-mately zero order drug release resulting from a combination of drug dif- fusion and polymer degradation, and iii) a second rapid drug release rate due to matrix erosion. 3.2. Modeling of drug release from reservoir devices In general, reservoir systems comprised of the drug segregated from a rate-controlling membrane layer (core-shell structure) and can be cat- egorized to have either a constant activity source or non-constant activ- ity source ( Fig. 2 ). For devices with a constant activity source, the initial drug concentration is higher than the drug solubility, and there is an ex- cess of undissolved drug particles within the core. This leads to an estab- lishment of saturated drug solution in the core region. The drug is dissolved and released, and rapidly replaced by partial dissolution of the remaining drug particles. As such, the drug concentration at the inner shell layer remains constant so long the drug is present in excess. For devices with a non-constant activity source, the initial drug concen- tration is lower than the drug solubility. Subsequently, the drug released across the shell layer is not replaced, and the drug concentration at the inner shell layer declines during the release process. Consider a drug delivery device comprising of a drug-containing core surrounded by a nearly slow-degrading or surface-erodingpolymer layer. The drug release can be accurately modeled based on a reservoir device with a constant activity source. Such drug delivery sys- tems have an outer layer providing a barrier to control the diffusion of water into the core region, allo wing drug dissolution. Upon water penetration, only a portion of the drug particles can be dis- solved due to limited drug solubility, resulting in a saturated drug concentration maintained at the inner polymer layer. While thepolymer layer is slowly degrading, its mechanical integrity is still retained, and the drug release follows a zero-order pro le as predicted from a reservoir device with a constant activity source. Assuming perfect sink conditions and negligible changes to the size and structure of the shell layer during drug release, the release rate of drug with a partition coef cient Kfor the differ- ent geometries can be expressed ( Table 2 ,E q s .( 1 7 ) -(19)). 3.3. Tuning drug release rate zero-order pro les 3.3.1. Bulk- and surface-eroding single-polymer microspheres An initial burst release of drug is typically observed in single- polymer microspheres. This phenomenon is a consequence of several possible factors [ 155] including: i) poor encapsulation/solubility of drug particles in the polymer matrix, particularly at high loading levels [ 156,157]. ii) signi cant drug transport to the particle surface caused by sol- vent diffusion in solvent evaporation method of particle fabrica- tion [ 158] or drying process [ 159,160]. iii) dynamic pore formation and closure, which transiently controls diffusion paths [ 161]. Fig. 2. Schematic representations of reservoir devices under perfect sink condition for diffusing drug through the rate-controlling membrane surroundin g the drug reservoir with (a) a constant activity source, and (b) a non-constant activity source. The former device consists of an excess of undissolved drug particles (circles), a nd the concentration of the dissolved drug molecules (stars) at the inner shell layer is maintained at the saturation concentration. The latter device exhibits a decreasing drug concentr ation at the inner shell layer. The shell layer thickness and permeability remained unchanged during the release process.Redrawn from [ 140].111 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138Despite the large number of studies investigating drug release from degradable single-polymer microspheres, limited success to obtain zero-order release has been achieved. Some general strategies that may attain the goal of zero-order release are highlighted in the follow- ing sections. 3.3.2. Drug release from events of diffusion-controlled and bulk- degradation One strategy is to utilize a timely optimization of drug release from diffusion-controlled and bulk-degradation processes to achieve a nearly zero-order release pro le [155]. Upon hydration of the polymeric ma- trix, the drug can be solubilized and released before the occurrence of polymer degradation. The drug diffusion rate is typically higher during the initial period, dependent on several factors such as polymer's wet state glass transition temperature, polymeric matrix's surface area and porosity, and drug particle's hydrodynamic radius. PLGA's glass transi- tion is near to the biological body temperature, resulting in enhanced plasticization and higher drug diffusion rate. The drug diffusion rate eventually decreases with time upon reaching the exhaustion of undis- solved drug particles. However, the bulk degradation of the polymer matrix would release the embedded drug and drive the increase in drug diffusivity. In this strategy, a careful selection of hydrophilic, diffus- ible drug, and bulk degrading nature of polymer would be required to achieve the goal of zero-order drug release ( Table 3 ). It is important to note that the goal of zero-order drug release for the desired application requires the relevance of the chosen in-vitro parameters as compared to in-vivo conditions. Zhao et al. [ 162] developed PLGA microspheres for the delivery of a novel antipsychotic isoperidone, a prodrug of paliperidone, with an aim to enhance liposolubility. Pharmacokinetic studies in-vivo indicated a one-week plateau phase, followed by a quasi-zero-order release for two weeks. The sustained release of isoperidone resulted in a signi cant suppressive effect in the established schizophrenic mice model as com- pared to the oral administration or blank control groups. The primary mechanisms by which the drug was released include diffusion and deg-radation. Vora et al. [ 163] prepared PLGA microspheres loaded with cholecalciferol, a more bioactive form of vitamin D, as an injectable con- trolled drug release system. The release pro les followed a zero-order release for over 35 days. The corresponding in-vivo pharmacokinetic study of cholecalciferol-loaded microspheres showed signi cantly higher t 1/2as compared to the control formulation with sustained plasma concentration for one month. Despite having four times higherin dose for the PLGA microspheres than the control formulation, the for- mer avoided acute toxicity with no death observed for the treatment group. The zero-order release of cholecalciferol may be attributed to the hollow geometry of the microspheres where the length of drug dif- f u s i o np a t h w a yf r o mm i c r o s p h e r e si sl e s s e rt h a nt h e lled spheres. 3.3.3. Drug release from blending bulk-eroding polymers In general, for hydrophobic drugs or large molecules, the access of huge amounts of water for drug dissolution or large pore sizes for drug diffusion is required. During the initial period, an absence of drug release or extremely slow release period is observed, often known as \"lag phase \", where drug diffusion is slow after initial hydration of the polymer matrix. Drug release will occur upon signi cant water penetra- tion and increase in porosity within the polymer matrix, translating into an\"S\"shaped drug release pro le. The degradation of bulk-eroding polymeric microspheres shows a clear association with the molecular weight of the polymer. Park [ 164] observed that low molecular weight oligomers were initially released from PLGA microspheres, followed by low molecular weight degradation products, regardless of the molec- ular weight of polymer used. For microspheres comprising of lower mo- lecular weight polymers, the degradation products increase with time and matrix exhibited a decrease in molecular weight. In contrast, for mi- crospheres comprising of high molecular weight polymers, the molecu- lar weight of the matrix remained constant for a longer period. Thus, the blending of high molecular weight polymer with a small portion of a low molecular weight polymer has been proposed as a strategy to en- sure continuous release of peptides and hydrophobic drugs. The blend of two polymers of different molecular weights allows the manipulation of the timing associated with the degradation release. Ravivarapu et al. [ 165] prepared leuprolide acetate loaded microspheres based on a mixture of 8.6 and 28.3 kDa molecular weight of PLGA using a solvent evaporation method. By increasing the content of the smaller molecular weight PLGA, the initial release of peptide was facilitated as compared to the 28.3 kDa PLGA. It was hypothesized that the more hy- drated domains of 8.6 kDa PLGA within the matrix accounted for the ini-tial release, and the more prominent 28.3 kDa PLGA domain dictated the subsequent release in the later period. In another study, Mi et al. [ 166] prepared chlorambucil-loaded microspheres based on a blend of 40 kDa PLGA and chitin using a solvent evaporation method. A two- phase release model was used to describe the drug release from the PLGA/chitin blended matrix, consisting of 60% drug release during the early stage, followed by slow release sustaining for over 200 h. Due to Table 3 Summary of recently published studies, in which various drug and polymer combinations have been selected to achieve zero-order drug release.

Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138the hydrophilic chitin matrix, it exposed the dispersed PLGA particu- lates and enhanced their hydrolysis which resulted in faster drug re- lease rate. The same effect could also be attained by blending the polymer matrix, preferentially in a water free preparation technique, with water-soluble polymers [ 167] or other porogens [ 168]. Drug release rate is highly dependent on the surface area to volume ratio of the microspheres. Small-sized particles typically exhibit shorterdiffusion lengths and are associated with high drug release rates. In con- trast, larger sizes of particles could exhibit a lag phase as time is required for water penetration and hence displaying slower diffusion rates. By blending preformed, uniform-sized single-polymer microspheres of dif- ferent sizes, a zero-order drug release pro le could be achieved [ 169]. Other studies have illustrated the release of peptide by mixing micro- particles of different individual release pro les, which were fabricated from various PLGA blend ratios and PLGA molecular weights [ 165]. 3.3.4. Drug release from surface eroding polymers It is dif cult to achieve zero-order drug release pro les for drugs that do not readily diffuse in bulk-eroding matrix or in materials that do not have a porous structure. It is often believed that surface-eroding poly- mers such as polyorthoesters (POEs) or polyanhydrides (described in Table 1 ) could achieve zero-order drug release pro les since degrada- tion products are not accumulated, and drug diffusion is not the rate- controlling factor. However, zero-order release may be theoretically possible for certain matrix geometries with a minimal change in surface area during erosion [ 170]. Studies on modi ed surface-eroding poly- mers have been investigated and illustrated to offer constant drug re- leases. Johnson and Uhrich [ 171] developed a polymer blend of antimicrobials in a salicylic acid-based poly(anhydride-ester) as adjunct treatment for periodontal disease. In-vitro release of each admixed an- timicrobial showed a zero-order pro le for over 140 h. In another study, Lopac et al. [ 172] developed ovalbumin-loaded polyanhydride microspheres showed a nearly zero-order pro le for over 30 days. 3.4. Double-walled and multi-layered microspheres The problems associated with using single-polymer microspheres are the initial burst release of water-soluble drugs found on or near the external surface and the dif culty in achieving zero-order drug re- lease. To attain well-controlled drug release rates, double-walled micro- spheres comprising of a polymeric shell layer surrounding a drug- encapsulating particle core may be introduced [ 175 -184]. The double- walled microspheres can offer greater freedom in controlling drug re- lease through the manipulation of various parameters such as shell layer thickness, structural con guration and polymer type, making zero-order drug release an achievable goal. From this perspective, double-walled or even multi-layered microspheres can provide an at- tractive and robust approach in drug delivery. Recently, these drug de- livery systems have been illustrated with the added advantage of allowing different drugs to be loaded in core/shell regions and releasing them in a parallel or sequential manner to attain synergistic therapeutic goals required in tissue engineering and tumor inhibition models [175 -177]. Several fabrication techniques on the production of core-shell struc- tured microspheres have been reported ( Table 4 ). By using a solvent evaporation technique, Lee et al. [ 185] synthesized double-walled PLGA(PLLA) microparticles loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and pacli- taxel (PTX) in the shell and core phases, respectively. Through careful adjustment of the shell layer thickness, there was a reduction in the ini- tial burst of DOX while sustaining the release of the two drugs over a two-month period in a near zero-order manner. The resultant micro- particles demonstrated a greater reduction in MCF-7 spheroid cellgrowth as compared to single-drug-loaded microparticles or free drug [186]. Double-walled or multi-layered microparticles may be fabricated using a coaxial electrospray technique [ 175,176,187 -190]. Nie et al. [176] demonstrated the versatility of loading hydrophilic and hydro- phobic with and SRM in core and shell phases, respectively, N70% of SRM was released within the rst three days, after which the release was nearly linear until day 30. PTX exhibited a slight initial burst, but was released nearly linear over 30 days. This microparticle formulation was illustrated to produce a greater tumor inhibition against subcutaneous U87 glioma xenograft in BALB/c nude mice as compared to the other microparticle or control formulations [ 175]. Double-walled microspheres may also be produced using a precision particle fabrication technique [ 191 -194]. In an attempt to enhance the therapeutic ef ciency of combined chemotherapy and gene therapy on human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, double-walled PDLLA(PLGA) microspheres were used to deliver p53 NPs and DOX loaded in the shell and core phases, respectively. This mi- crosphere formulation allowed the release of p53 NPs rst, followed by simultaneous release of DOX and p53 NPs at a near zero-order rate. Overall, the double-walled microspheres present a promising dual anti- cancer delivery system for such combined treatment. By using scanning electron microscopy, laser scanning confocal mi- croscopy and gel permeation chromatography, Xu et al. [ 195]e l u c i d a t e d the degradation behavior of double-walled PDLLA(PLGA) microspheres. During the initial period of incubation, the PDLLA shell layer was effec- tive in preventing the premature release of DOX into the aqueous me- dium. The PLGA core degraded signi cantly, which led to the acidic degradation products accelerating the erosion of the shell layer. Similar erosion time scale was observed for shell layers of different molecular weights. Lee et al. [ 196] examined the degradation of triple-layered PLGA/PLLA/EVA microparticles. It was found that the PLGA outermost shell layer degraded rapidly, leaving behind the double-walled PLLA (EVA) microparticles. However, the middle PLLA layer degraded more rapidly than expected because of the migration of PLGA oligomers that created a hydrophilic and acidic microenvironment in the PLLA layer. This could accelerate the release rate of the drug that is encapsulated in the middle layer or polymer core. These studies provide useful in- sights to the design of multi-layered microspheres for zero-order drug release pro les. 4. Drug delivery systems with programmed (pulsatile) release proles As previously mentioned, the ultimate goal of drug delivery systems is to maximize drug ef cacy and to minimize undesirable side effects [188,201,202]. Despite considerable progress in the development of sustained and controlled release devices, most are not so responsive to the dynamic behavior of biological systems and release their cargoes at predetermined rate irrespective of patient needs or changing physio-logical circumstances, where the release of the agents is controlled only by encapsulating matrices [ 203 -205]. In addition, there are many cases in medicine where controlled release systems with a non-uniform drug administration would be more bene cial [ 205]. Therefore, scientists have proposed pulsatile release patterns, particularly for the bioactive agents (e.g. hormones) that can be easily denatured by metabolic en- zymes and/or develop biological tolerance upon continuous availability at their target sites [ 206,207]. The pulse release may also improve the efcacy of the treatment for drugs with extensive rst-pass metabolism, and for those that require nighttime administration [ 208]. Pulsatile release is de ned as the rapid release of a drug after a well- dened lag time or time gaps [ 209]. No drug is released from the carrier within the off-release periods. Based on the biological and physico- chemical conditions, drug carriers used for pulsatile release can be clas- sied into \"on-demand \"and \"programmed \"drug delivery systems, where the drug release is triggered by changes in the physiologic113 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138environment or by the inner mechanisms of the carrier de ned during the preparation, respectively [ 210]. 4.1. Circadian rhythms Circadian rhythm is the physical, biological, or mental behavioral changes that regulates body functions in human beings on a daily basis ( Fig. 3 ). Sleeping in darkness (overnight) and resuming activities every day is the most common example for the circadian rhythm func- tions [ 211 -213]. The disease pathophysiology studies have revealed high-amplitude circadian rhythms with day-night patterns in patients. These circadian patterns can be expressed as short- ( tb0.5 h), intermediate- (0.5 h btb6 days), and long-period (6 days bt) oscilla- tions and show great contributions in the success of a prescribed ther- apy. Therefore, the recognition of the rhythms and their consecutive effects particularly on the treatment of acute and chronic diseases has become very interesting over the past few years [ 209]. The oscillations of less than and more than one cycle per 24 h are known as infradian and ultradian, respectively [ 214,215]. Due to considerable advancements in elds of biology, medicine, and pharmacology, the modern therapeutic delivery approaches have introduced a new concept of \"chronotherapy \"in which therapeutic agents are delivered to a patient in a staggered pro le. In chronother- apy, the knowledge of the (i) circadian time structure, (ii) circadian rhythms in disease pathology, (iii) chronopharmacology (i.e. chronodynamics and chronokinetics), and (iv) emerging technologies in drug delivery converge to develop a more precise DDS which pro- vides a right chronotherapeutic dosage to yield a better outcome and less side-effects. Pulsatile drug delivery is a concept that combinesTable 4 Summary of recently published studies on the production of core-shell structured microspheres using various techniques investigated to achieve ze ro-order drug release.

Over the past decades, the use of pulsatile DDSs is becoming more essential, particularly for the treatment of diseases in which a bi- ological rhythm and mechanisms have been scienti cally justi ed as summarized in ( Table 5 ). To achieve the desired release pro les based on the circadian rhythms of diseases or optimal treatment procedure designed byclinicians, various DDSs have been developed so far, as described in Section 4.2 -4.3. 4.2. Osmotic micropumping devices Osmosis is a fundamental mechanism, which adjusts the water bal- ance necessary for cell living and regulating cellular pathways. In gen-eral, when a semipermeable membrane separates two solutions with different solute concentrations, the solvent crosses the membrane to- ward the concentrated solutions and causes a hydrostatic pressure dif- ference between the two compartments [ 231](Fig. 4 a). An osmotic delivery system utilizes the abovementioned concept to adjust the delivery rate of drugs at a prescribed condition. Osmotic micropump comprises of a drug reservoir and/or osmotic agent, a sol- vent, a semipermeable membrane, a piston, and an osmotic engine that provides a pressure difference in response to the diffusion of mois- ture through the membrane [ 232](Fig. 4 b-d). Once a crucial pressure is produced, the osmotic engine pushes the piston forward and opens the orice for ejecting the drug. The decrease of pressure upon drug release drives the piston backward and closes the ori ce. The cycle repeats fre- quently until the drug reservoir is empty. The Van't Hoff equation, based on ideal diluted mixture, is com- monly used to predict the osmotic pressures. According to this theory, the solute concentration and temperature proportionally contribute to the osmotic pressure ( )( E q .

Eq. (22) ( Table 6 ) describes the net flow rate of solvent across the membrane. When the chambers are sealed, the hydrostatic pressure Pand the osmotic pressure are equal. Therefore, the net flow rate is zero. In drug delivery applications, the release of drug containing so- lution into the surrounding environment provides a driving force (pres- sure difference) between the compartments and causes dV/dtN0 (Eq. (22)), where the mass flow of the drug release is calculated via Eq. (23). As P, Eqs. (22) and (23) can be combined and simpli ed to obtain Eq. (24) which is a fundamental equation for all types of os- motic micro-pumps shown in Fig. 4 b-d. 4.2.1. The design of osmotic pumps According to the interior design, osmotic micropumps are classi ed into four different categories ( Fig. 4 b-d) known as single-compartment, double-compartment, multi-compartment, and monolithic systems. a)Single-compartment: In the single-compartment devices, the drug plays the role of osmotic agent and a semi-permeable layer sepa- rates it from the surrounding environment containing the solvent [233]. Therefore, the concentrations of the drug ( C)a n dt h eo s m o t i c agent are equal in Eq. (24). The LiRIS\u00ae, Lidocaine Releasing Intravesical System, is a single- compartment osmotic pump, where the encapsulated drug (lidocaine) is also used as the osmotic agent. The LiRIS\u00ae is an implantable and bio- resorbable device that provides the right dosage of the drug(s) for pa- tients suffering from interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/ BPS) (i.e. a painful bladder conditions) [ 234]. Based on a study pub- lished in 2011, N3.3 to 7.9 million women in the United State have diag- nosed with IC/PBS symptoms (bladder pain, urinary urgency, frequent voiding) [ 235,236]. Although lidocaine is recommended as a standard treatment for IC/PBS, its short half-life and urination compromise theTable 5 Examples of medical conditions with scienti cally established circadian rhythms. Medical conditionsExamples Reference Cancer Many clock genes are involved in regulatory loops. CLOCK: BMAL1 or NPAS2:BMAL1 protein dimmers are responsible for the activation ofPerand Cry(clock genes). Clock genes alterations may happen in cancer cells. The alterations in clock genes may cause the difference in cell cycles. In-vivo studies revealed the animal survival rates were greater for those received combi-nations of 6-mercaptopurine and methotrex-ate in evening dosing compared to morningdosing. The treatment of cancer through continuous infusion of 5-FU showed higher cytotoxicity side-effects compared to circadian pattern administrations at 4 a.m. and 10 a.m. Despite negligible changes in arterial blood pressure, tumor size, and body weight, thetumor blood flow is higher in night time than that of day time.[204,217 -220] Pain Pains show different circadian rhythms. In arthritis, the concentration of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 in plasma change over time. Brain concentration of opioid peptides such as substance P is the highest at night. Osteoarthritis patients feel less pain in the morning than at night. Rheumatoid arthritis pain is the highest in the morning and reduces throughout the day. Renal colic is more painful in the morning regardless of gender and presence of kidneystones.[221,222] Diabetes Insulin is released in cyclic pattern of 8-30 min and it is further regulated by a sec- ondary feedback signal.[223] Cardiovascular diseaseThe vascular reactivity and capillary resis- tance are higher in the morning and the risks decrease later. Due to higher platelet agreeability and bri- nolytic activity during morning to noon, thefrequency of sudden cardiac death and myo-cardial infarction is higher in that period. Atrial arrhythmias: a higher frequency in the daytime. Myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death are the morning, late afternoon, andearly evening.[224 -226] Bronchial asthmaAirway resistance is considerably higher at night.[227,228] Infectious diseasesThe elevation of body temperature due to bacterial infection is higher in the evening time. The endocrine glands, autonomous nervous system, and central nerve system diseaseexhibit complex time structures. In glaucoma, the intraocular pressure is gen- erally higher between 2 and 4 a.m. and lowerin the late afternoon.[215,229,230]115 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138efcacy of the therapy. In contrast, LiRIS\u00ae can provide the drug for an extended duration (~two weeks) to control the flare-ups of the disease. LiRIS\u00ae is a double-lumen tubular device in which an elastomeric (e.g. medical grade Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) drug reservoir lumen is lled with lidocaine tablets and the other is made of a shape-memorywire. The superelastic properties of the wire accommodate the inser- tion of the device through a non-invasive procedure using cystos- copy or catheter. Upon insertion, the PDMS cover plays the role of the semi-permeable membrane and facilitates the release of lido- caine from an ori ce made on its wall ( Fig. 5 a). This technology has Fig. 4.

Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138been employed for the treatment of bladder diseases such as overac- tive bladder and bladder cancer in pre-clinical stages [ 237]. In contrast, IntelliDrug is a single-compartment osmotic pump with a more sophisticated design compared to the LiRIS\u00ae. It was initially designed to operate in oral cavity for the controlled release of the drug to buccal mu- cosa. The system provides more patient compliance and eradicates the dis- advantages (poor bioavailability, unpredictable plasma levels, etc.) associated with the conventional treatment method. In this device, a micro-valve and flow sensor used for monitoring the flow rate and the drug concentration in the expelled solution controls the pressure of drug solution. Consequently, the concentration of the drug on the buccal side and the duration of the treatment can be precisely controlled by the clini- cians [ 231,238,239](Fig. 5 b). The device has also been utilized for treat- ment of Alzheimer's disease [ 240,241] and drug addiction [ 242].b)Double-compartment: This class of osmotic pumps was introduced by Theeuwes and Yum in 1976 [ 247]. In double-compartment os- motic pumps, the osmotic agent and the therapeutic formulation are stored into two compartments separated by a movable barrier, where the expansion of agent compartment causes the expelling of drug solution into the surrounding environment. As the osmotic agent and drug compartments are separated, the drug release rate is solely controlled by the osmotic properties of the agent and the pumps can be utilized for the controlled release of therapeutic solu- tions or suspensions with different physiochemical properties. In ad- dition, these devices reduce the risk of hydrolytic degradation of drugs due to the absence of water and protect temperature sensitive agents from pre-mature degradation at body temperature. In con- trast, the double-compartment devices have lower capacity for the Fig. 5. Single-compartment: (a) LiRIS\u00ae. Reproduced from [ 243]. (b) IntelliDrug .

Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138storage of drug formulations and require complicated technologies for the design and manufacturing compared to single- compartment devices [ 231]. The ALZET\u00ae osmotic pumps developed in 1970s are still one of the prominent examples of precise osmotic pumps [ 245,247]. The device was commercialized by DURECT Corp., Cupertino, CA, USA. As illus- trated in Fig. 5 c, the pump has a cylindrical shape made of a hydrocar- bon elastomer and a cellulose ester functioned as a semi-permeable membrane. The inner layer of the cylinder is covered with an osmotic agent and the drug reservoir is placed at the center of the cylinder. A cannula is connected to the pumps to adjust the flow rate of drug solu- tion, to minimize the pre-mature release of the drug during unpredict- able conditions, and to prevent water diffusion into the drug reservoir. The pump is commercially available at three different capacities (100 L, 200 L, 2 mL) and the delivery rates of 0.11 L/h-10L/h [ 245]. The pump with attached catheter can precisely and locally control the delivery of the therapeutic agent into any tissue or organs at pre- determined time intervals. Viadur\u00ae is an osmotic pump implant developed by ALZA that uti- lized DUROS\u00ae platform for drug delivery to prostate cancer. DUROS\u00ae consists of a titanium alloy cylinder (diameter: 4 mm; length: 45 mm) that incorporates an ori ce and a semi-permeable membrane at each end [ 246,248]. An osmotic agent compartment is placed next to mem- brane and is separated from the drug reservoir by an elastomeric piston. Based on the nal application of the device, the diffusion moderator and orice are designed as a simple capillary channel or a sophisticated path (Fig. 5 d). Although the implant demonstrated a zero-order delivery pro- le, not a pulse pro le, over one year at ~120 g/day [ 249], the explan- tation of the empty device may raise patient complaints after the treatment. The DUROS\u00ae platform has been also utilized by Intarcia Therapeutics for the long term delivery of -interferon and exenatide against Hepatitis C and type 2 diabetes, respectively [ 248,250,251]. c)Multi-compartment: Multi-compartment osmotic pumps have three or more storage chamber lling with osmotic agents, the drug, and the solvent. Therefore, they can provide a constant flow rate (e.g. 1 L/h) over a prolonged period of time (e.g. 1 year) requiring neither an external power nor body fluids [ 249]. The devices are able to pro- vide a constant rate of the drug in any orientation, elevated temper- ature, or high-pressure conditions observed during a treatment procedure. ACUROS is an osmotic pump ( Fig. 5 e) developed by Acuros GmbH (Germany), based on the osmoregulation concept [ 252]. The device consists of a salt chamber and hollow ber channel that connects the salt chamber to an extrusion chamber. Upon water penetration into the hollow ber channel and the elevation of osmotic pressure, the sol- ventflows to the extrusion chamber and pushes a moveable barrier for- ward. The movement of the barrier causes a constant flow of the drug solution and releases the drug to surrounding environment. However, to continue the process through providing a constant osmotic pressure, the connection of the hollow ber channel and extrusion chamber is de- signed to be permeable to water. Therefore, there is flow of water per- meating across the connection parts and into salt chamber. The release rate of the drug solution can be manipulated via adjusting the length of the hollow ber channel placed within the water chamber. The pump can provide flow rates range from 1 L/h to 2.0 mL/h. Due to the suf ciently high backpressure (~300 kPa), it can provide a contin- uous stream, independent of the injection site or blood pressure. Over the past decades, stimuli-responsive polymers have been ex- tensively utilized in controlled release devices where the drug is re- leased only in the presence of an external trigger such as pH or temperature [ 253]. Hydroscopic polymers that show a swellingtransition in the presence of a liquid can be used in osmotic pumps for fluid sampling and microdispensing in pulsatile fashion [ 248,254]. The polymers can be used as osmotic agents where the concentration of the polymer suspension continuously decreases due to absorption of water. Therefore, to achieve a constant drug dispensing over the predetermined period, the quantity of water provided has to be less than that the hydrogel needs for swelling to reach the equilibrium.Based on this theory, Richter et al. fabricated an osmotic pump that uses poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) as osmotic agent [255,256]. Once the swelling agent is provided to the hydrogel actuator, the pressure increases inside the chamber where the gel pushes the self- locking piston toward a drug ampoule (i.e. drug reservoir) and causes the drug release through the outlet. The drug release rate of the pump can be adjusted through controlling the swelling behavior of the hydro- gel and the stiffness of the spring that pressurizes the reservoir of the swelling agent. d)Monolithic systems: These systems are considered as single- compartment systems in which there is no separate semipermeable membrane. The particles encapsulating drugs used as osmotic agents are distributed within a polymeric matrix, which plays the role of a semi-permeable membrane. When the water penetrates into the polymer matrix, it dissolves the particles containing drug molecules, dilutes the drug solution inside the matrix, and causes swelling, microcracks, and rupture of the particles. By increasing the pressure inside the matrix, bigger cracks may form and the drug leaks out to the surrounding environment [ 55,68,257 -260]. Several factors including the density of encapsulated agent, osmotic activity, mechanical properties of the polymer matrix, and the disso- lution and diffusion of compounds may contribute to the perfor- mance of the device [ 68,261]. 4.3. Microparticle applications pulsatile release 4.3.1. Monolayer microparticles The application of microparticles with various architectures and functionalities as controlled release devices has gained considerable at- tention in biomedical domain, particularly in drug delivery and tissueregeneration. Depending on the ultimate application of the delivery sys- tems, different geometries (i.e. monolayer (single-compartment), core- shell (double-compartment), multilayer (multi-compartment)) and consequently different release pro les are required. For instance, a sin- gle dose immunization is the major goal in vaccination, where a pulsa- tile pro le can accommodate the prescribed condition. Cleland et al. [262 -265] fabricated monolayer microparticles with different PLGA compositions for the delivery of HIV-1 vaccine. The antigen release pro- le showed a signi cant initial burst release followed by a lag period of several weeks. Finally, the vaccine was gradually released over 4 weeks without demonstrating pulsatile behavior ( Fig. 6 a). The results of the study performed by Rosas et al. [ 266]r e v e a l e dt h e effect of polymer chemistry on the release pro le. Around 60% of the en- capsulated SPf66 malaria vaccine released from monolayer PLGA (75:25) microparticles over 120 days after an initial release of ~40%. While the monolayer PLGA (50:50) microspheres could control the initial burst release (~20%) and released the vaccine continuously over 120 days. In addition to polymer properties, the differences in pro- tein structures, charges, and molecular weights make each protein unique that require speci c formulation for the encapsulation and sub- sequent delivery. Therefore, based on the release pro les of proteins and vaccines from different monolayer microparticles, the carriers were classi ed into four different categories as de ned by Ye et al. [267]: i) high initial burst release plus negligible additional release. ii) low initial burst release plus negligible additional release.118 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138iii) high initial burst release plus a steady state release. iv) low initial burst release plus a steady state release. The story is almost similar for small molecule drug-loaded micropar- ticles. Depending on the physicochemical properties of the drugs, the prole shows an initial burst release, particularly for hydrophilic agents, where the drug molecules encapsulated on or near the surface of micro- particles are quickly dissolved in the surrounding medium. After the ini- tial step, the release pro les gradually move upward in which release rates depend on carrier degradation, water penetration, and drug disso- lution rate and diffusion. Overall, the results of these studies showed that monolayer microparticles with a simple geometry are not suitable to produce a pulsatile release pro le. To obtain a pulsatile release pro le, several approaches (e.g. co- administration of drug delivery devices with different controlled onset release, encapsulation of smaller particles in bigger particles, prepara- tion of core-shell microparticles) were developed over the -270]. In 1994, Khoo and Thiel [ 271] proposed PLGA-baseddelivery device for the pulsed-release of antigens. They encapsulated the antigen in a dibasic calcium phosphate coated with Eudragit S100, where a layer of PLGA/ethyl cellulose subsequently was coated on Eudragit S100 layer. Upon the hydration of the particles, PLGA degrades and forms porous shell, which facilitates the penetration of water into the inner matrix. Consequently, the dissolution of Eudragit layer causes the release of antigen. Their results con rmed the signi cant effects of Eudragit on the lag period, before initial release, while the agent re- leased quickly from the particles without the Eudragit layer upon hy- dration. To obtain pulsed release over a prolonged period (after 1 and 75 days), both coated and uncoated particles were administrated via a single injection. Over the years, biomacromolecules (e.g. proteins, DNA, siRNA) have been extensively used as therapeutic agents for disease treatment [15,272,273]. The pharmaceutical formulation of these agents in aque- ous solutions is highly desirable as it reduces destructive effects of or- ganic solvents on the molecule structure. However, it considerably connes the applications of polymers dissolved in organic solvents used for the encapsulation of those agents. In 1999, Franssen et al. [274] introduced degradable dextran (dex-HEMA) hydrogels for the Fig. 6. Different release pro les via designing microparticle/carrier structure.

Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138encapsulation of IgG. The microparticles were degradable at physiolog- ical conditions (37 \u00b0C, pH 7.0), where the carbonate ester bonds of the cross-linker were hydrolyzed in aqueous solutions ( Fig. 6 b). They con- trolled the premature release of the proteins through adjusting mesh size (smaller than the hydrodynamic size of the protein) and the crosslinking density. Increasing crosslinking density could delay the onset of release for ~15 days, whereas the booster protein release wasobserved over a week. To further adjust the release of the agents in a pulse manner, the group designed liposome-loaded dextran microparti- cles ( Fig. 6 c). Their results con rmed the preservation of liposomes in- tegrity during the microfabrication process and revealed the effects of initial water content, type of hydrolytically sensitive spacer present in the cross-linkers, and the degree of cross-linker substitution on the re- lease kinetics, while it was independent of liposomes size (0.1 -0.2m). 4.3.2. Core-shell carriers Despite the success of monolayer microparticles in encapsulating therapeutic agents, their simple structures con ne their applications where complicated release pro les are required. Therefore, the addition of a biodegradable polymer shell surrounding a polymeric drug-loaded microparticle and the formation of a core-shell structure provide an op- portunity to tune the release rate ( Fig. 6 d). 1) The thickness of the shell layer, 2) drug distribution inside the core and shell compartments, and 3) the degradation mechanism of the polymeric materials used for the core and shell layers are the main parameters directly in fluence the re- lease pro les (discussed in Section 3.4 ). In addition, the selection of sol- vent may alter the localization of the agent and its subsequent release prole. Use of a highly volatile solvent for the shell layer causes the rapid formation of a polymer-rich shell surrounding the core encapsu- lating the agent. Pack's group [ 191] studied the release pro les of BSA protein from core-shell microparticles where ethyl acetate (EtAc) and dichloromethane (DCM) were used to dissolve PLA. Their study re- vealed the effects of solvent volatility on the fast and slow formation of the shell layer whereas the slow shell layer formation allowed the BSA solution to migrate into the shell compartment and resided near the outer surface. While the use of EtAc quickly formed a polymer-rich layer and prevent the premature migration of BSA solution. Therefore, they observed a delay at the initial stage of the release pro le followed by a pulsatile release over an extended period. 4.3.3. Surface eroding carriers Polyanhydride and poly(ortho)ester matrices, shown in Table 1 ,u n - dergo degradation by surface erosion [ 275 -277]. As the surface hydroly- sis of the polymer is faster than the bulk degradation, mass is lost more rapidly from the surface than from the bulk. It has been suggested that the rate of surface degradation is more predictable in surface eroding than bulk degradation matrices. The degradation of polyanhydrides forms non-toxic diacid monomers [ 278]. They are also can be prepared from in-expensive resources via a single step (no puri cation) reaction of safe dicarboxylic acid building blocks. Polyanhydrides have been ex- tensively used as a candidate for controlled release applications includ- ing local anesthetics, neuroactive drug delivery, brain tumors treatment, and chemotherapy [ 279 -284]. Wuthrich et al. [ 276] investigated the release of lysozyme (model protein, molecular weight: 14,000) using a poly (ortho ester) matrix. They observed a pulsatile release pro le dependent on polymer molec- ular weight and could be extended to 3 -6 days. Although the protein molecules retained their activity over the release period, the 6-days re- lease may not be suf cient for many antigens. In addition, simple sur- face erodable carriers with a single depot have con nements in providing multiple pulses over an extended period. To overcome these dif culties, surface erodable materials were employed for the fabrication of complicated controlled release systems where a multilayer drug carrier that consisted of drug-containing and drug-free layer (de ning the length of lag time) was employed. How- ever, to achieve a desirable release pro le [285]:1) the drug diffusion/release from adjacent layers must be restricted. 2) the frequency of the lag phases must be controlled via drug-free layers. One of early studies on the use of multilayered surface erosion car- riers were reported by G\u00f6pferich [ 286] who fabricated implants consisted of a core and several coating layers with diameters of 4-6 mm. They fabricated three layered carriers of a poly[1,3 bis(carboxy phenoxypropane)-co-sebacic acid] (20:80), p(CPP-SA), core loaded with drug, surrounded by a drug-free layer of p(CPP-SA) which was coated with a PLA layer (via dip coating) used to con ne the early ero- sion and premature release of carboxy fluorescein (CF). Finally, an erod- able layer contained brilliant blue (BB) covered the construct ( Fig. 6 e). The polymers as p(CPP-SA) 20:80, p(CPP-SA) 50:50, and p(CPP- SA) 85:15 were reported to erode at constant rates [ 287]. The release tests showed an immediate release of BB, while CF was released after 2 weeks in a pulsatile manner. Their results also indicated the signi cant effects of drug hydrophilicity and the molecular weight. To achieve a complete pulsatile behavior (from 4 days to 70 days), PLGA or PLA coat- ings were treated in silicon oil to close pore. Another type of multi-layered devices used for pulsatile release have been proposed by Jiang and Zhu [ 288] for protein delivery. The device had a cylindrical shape lled with protein-loaded and isolating polyanhydride layers to provide lag-release sequences. The device was isolated with polycarbonate, while it kept open from one end. The pro- tein was released from this device at predetermined sequences, while the duration of the pulse release and the lag time could be tailored by varying composition of the layers and their thickness. Dang et al. [ 289] have recently reported the local pulsatile parathyroid hormone (PTH) delivery via a biodegradable drug delivery device consisting polyanhydride and compared the repair of calvarial bone defect after pulsatile or continuous treatment in a mouse. In pulsatile delivery de- vice, they used sebacic acid (SA), 1,3-bis (p-carboxyphenoxy) propane (CPP), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as isolating layer between two consecutive Alginate/PTH layers, and subsequently sealed it withpolycaprolactone (PCL) ( Fig. 6 f). Using the pulsatile release device pro- moted bone regeneration while the continuous delivery suppressed the healing process. It also reduced the systemic side-effects compared to standard PTH injection. 5. Exogenous stimuli for on-demand release Stimuli-responsive DDSs release their therapeutic payloads upon physical and/or chemical changes imposed by external or internal trig- gers. These DDSs have been widely used in the treatment of various dis- eases such as diabetes [ 290 -293], cancer [ 294,295], and stroke [ 296], where triggers [ 297]( e . g .l i g h t[ electrical [ [ 301], and ultrasound [ 302]) allow to precise control of time, magnitude, duration of drug release. The external stimulus cause changes in the level of various energy sources, transform the chain dy- namics and alter molecular interactions at critical onset point [ 303]. Moreover, the spatial control of drug exposure can be achieved through the precise control of triggers over a particular organ tissue. In this sec- tion, we only review the methods of active triggering which refers to the devices that are induced to release their payloads by a decision made by a physician, patients or prede ned algorithms. 5.1. Temperature regulated release systems Temperature elevation is the only type of stimulus that can be con- sidered as both a physiological stimulus and an external stimulus. A key difference between tumor tissue and its surrounding healthy tissue lies in the distinct temperature gradient, which can be considered as an internal (passive) trigger. Besides, arti cially applying heat at speci c locations using an external source can increase blood flow and improve vasculature leakiness, which yield higher extravasation of drug/nano-120 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138carriers. This type of triggering signal is the most studied in stimuli- responsive DDSs [ 304]. Over the past decades, extensive research has been done on thermo-responsive hydrogels for pulsatile release [305 -307]. These exhibit volume changes, due to the alteration in the polymer hydration states with change in temperature. The threshold at which the solution changes into a gel is known as the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), whereas the temperature at which thesethermo-responsive polymers become soluble is called Upper Critical So- lution Temperature (UCST), and this phenomenon is called sol-gel tran- sition. Below the LCST of the polymer, the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the functional groups attached to the polymer, make these polymers swollen, however, with the increase in tempera- ture, the hydrophobic segments are strengthened and hydrogen bonds are broken due to entropy reasons and the polymer shrinks, causing gel formation [ 308]. In contrast, polymeric solutions may undergo sol- gel transition after reducing the temperature and form hydrogels, which will exhibit UCST behavior. Fig. 7 includes the various thermo- sensitive drug vehicles and their most commonly used shapes, thermos-responsive polymers and their release pro le. McBride et al. [ 312] patented a solute delivery system comprising of a thermo-sensitive cellulose gel structure loaded with a solute to be re- leased. This gel structure is placed over a medical device. The tempera- ture of the solute carrying gel structure is increased after positioning it near its target location. Increase in temperature of the gel, causes it to deswell, thereby releasing the solute. The temperature of the gel carry- ing the biologically active solutes such as proteins, genes, heparin and cisplatin, with the medical device as the substrate, can be increased be subjecting it to the body temperature or external fluid. In contrast, thermally activated reservoir devices were developed by Santini et al. in 2003 [ 313]. It is an implantable biocompatible medical device comprising of a minimum of one substrate with numerous reser- voirs which are lled with molecules and sealed by reservoir caps.When these reservoir caps are subjected to suf cient heat, they rupture and release the molecules. ThermoDox developed by Celsion Corporation, uses lysolipid ther- mally sensitive liposome to carry doxorubicin for breast cancer and pri- mary liver cancer [ 314](Fig. 8 ). When subjected to radio frequency ablation, temperature at the tumor site increases and the temperature sensitive DOX-loaded liposomes changes structure at 40 -45 \u00b0C, thereby releasing the drug into the targeted tumor. 5.2. Light regulated release systems This type of pulsatile release systems can be realized using biocom- patible material attached with photosensitive functional groups (deriv- atives of azobenzene, nitrobenzene etc.) which enable them to absorb light of a speci c wavelength ( Fig. 9 ). These materials can be tuned to absorb electromagnetic radiation especially in UV, visible and NIR [318]. When subjected to electromagnetic radiation, photo-responsive DDS can release its entire therapeutic payload all at once due to irrevers- ible structural damage. Pulsatile release pro le can be developed by ap- plying alternating light/dark cycles, thereby causing reversible structural damage and controlled release of the encapsulated drug. Studies have shown the human body can be subjected to electromag- netic radiation having wavelengths 2500 -380 nm, hence photosensi- tive DDS can be used for localized drug delivery especially in parts of the body, which are dif cult to access [ 319 -321]. Radiation of wave- lengths below 700 nm (visible and ultrasound region) cannot penetrate N1 cm into the tissue as the major tissue chromophores such as melanin, hemoglobin, and myoglobin have strong absorption in these regions [322 -325]. Hence is used to treat conditions located on or under the skin or on the external layers of some organs. Similarly, radiation above 900 nm has low tissue penetration due to light absorption by Fig. 7. Temperature controlled drug delivery. (a) Various thermo-sensitive carriers. (b) Chemical structures of common thermo-sensitive polymers. (c) T ypical release pro le of a temperature-controlled DDSs. (d) Commonly used shapes of gold nanoparticles. Rysmon\u00ae TG is a temperature responsive eye drop for the treatment of gl aucoma developed by Wakamoto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. It is a timolol maleate formulation based on methylcellulose (MC), polyethylene glycol and sodium citrate, which are used to reduce the LCST of MC [ 309]. Normally, the temperature of the eye is 32 -34 \u00b0C [ 310], but MC has an LCST of 50 \u00b0C [ 311]. Hence, the LCST of MC should be lowered, to gel to the eye after administering it as eye drops.121 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138Fig. 8.

Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138water [ 326]. However, NIR light has a wavelength of 650 -900 nm and is a suitable triggering signal as the endogenous absorbers (hemoglobin, lipids and water) have the lowest absorption coef cient in the NIR re- gion but often lack suf cient energy to cause photo-responsive chemical reactions. Recently, studies have shown it is possible to upconvert pho- ton energy from NIR wavelength to visible/UV wavelengths ( Fig. 9 ). Ex- tensive research is being conducted on gold nanomaterials as they canabsorb light of different wavelengths depending on their shape [327,328]. Scientists are working on gold nanorods that can absorb radi- ation in the NIR region to study their photothermal ablation properties and their potential for cancer treatment [ 298,329]. Visudyne\u00ae is a liposomal formulation containing vertepor n, a pho- tosensitizer, developed by QLT Ophthalmics, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, U.S. for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization due to AMD, for 10 min and a cold laser is used to release the encapsulated vertepor n, thereby closing the abnormal blood vessels without damaging the surrounding healthy cells in the retina ( Fig. 10 a). Santini et al. developed implantable microchip device arrays con- taining numerous reservoirs loaded with molecules, which can conform to curved surfaces such as the eye [ 330]. In one embodiment, this device can be implanted onto the surface of the eye of the patient, it is then subjected to light energy such as ophthalmic laser which could pass through the reservoir caps and cause the release of the drug. On Demand Therapeutics, Menlo Park, CA, U.S. developed a multi- reservoir implantable device to achieve ocular drug delivery to the back of the eye by using laser activation. The preclinical product consists of a biocompatible injectable rod containing multiple discrete reservoirs that are hermitically sealed to protect the stability of the drugs contained in the reservoir ( Fig. 10 b ) .T h i sd e v i c ei si n t r a v i t r e a l l y injected into the periphery of the vitreous in the region of the parsplana. A Goldmann mirror and a slit lamp are used to locate the implant and concentrate the laser on the speci c drug loaded reservoir, causing it to disintegrate and thereby releasing the drug into vitreous. 5.3. Magneto responsive release systems Magnetic carriers such as magnetoliposomes, core-shell nanoparti- cles, and porous metallic nanocapsules used in magnetic eld DDS are made by incorporating inorganic materials such as iron, cobalt, nickel etc. These materials are used for causing local hyperthermia or magnetic guidance which is achieved by focusing an extracorporeal magnetic eld on the drug carrier. The magnetic eld exerts a translational force together with the existing rotational torque on the drug carrier, thereby trapping it in the target site and pulling it toward the magnet [ 334,335]. Pulsatile release pro le can be realized through the heat generated by an alternating magnetic eld (AMF) due to hysteresis loss and/or Neel's relaxation. A typical magnetic nanoparticle consists of a magnetic core coated with organic or inorganic materials and are attached to the targeting ligands by organic linkers ( Fig. 11 ).Fig. 11 briefly describes the preparation of magnetic nanoparticles. Although magnetic eld in- duced DDS have been studied for decades, they have numerous disad- vantages such as there should be a relatively strong magnetic gradient and as soon as the drug is released from the magnetic carrier it is unre-sponsive to the applied magnetic eld and adopts the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. This prevents precise local distribu- tion of the drug and may cause systemic toxicity to an extent. Hsieh et al. developed a controlled release system by incorporating magnetic steel beads in an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer matrix using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the payload to be released [336]. They concluded that on application of an external oscillating mag- netic eld, the release of BSA was increased by almost 100%. When Fig. 10. (a) i. Visudyne photodynamic therapy.

Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138subjected to the magnetic eld, the magnet moves against the polymer causing alternating compression and tension shear [ 337]. This pulsatile stimulus acts as a pump, pushing out the encapsulated payload. Pirmoradi et al. developed a magnetically regulated micro- electromechanical ocular implant that can be used to treat diabetic ret- inopathy ( Fig. 12 a) [338]. The prototype consists of a docetaxel loaded micro-reservoir, sealed by an elastic magnetic polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) membrane, and a laser drilled opening. The device is proposed to be implanted in the posterior segment of the eye. When subjected to a magnetic gradient, the magnetic PDMS membrane deforms, releasing the contained drug. NanoTherm therapy developed by MagForce Nanotechnologies AG is a novel treatment which involves introducing magnetic nanoparticles directly into the tumor [ 339]. These nanoparticles are then subjected to an alternating magnetic eld causing local hyperthermia. These nano- particles comprise of iron oxide core coated with aminosilane. They have also developed NanoPlan, a temperature simulation software which would help the physician to decide the treatment plan for NanoTherm therapy, such as estimating the treatment temperatures or magnetic eld strength to be used. Handy et al. developed a method in which single domain magnetic particles modi ed with a target speci c ligand is contained in magnetic material composition which gets heated up when subjected to AMF [340]. In one embodiment, this method can be used to cause an apopto- sis, necrosis or deactivation of the pathogen. Ishikawa et al. developed a magnetic body and a drug delivery con- trol device using the magnetic body [ 341]. The magnetic body consists of a magnet and a cover part made of a material with high magnetic per- meability, attached to the edge of the magnet. Drug delivery control de- vice consists of the magnetic body, head for supporting the magnetic body, and a drive mechanism for the head. It applies a magnetic eld from the magnetic body to the speci c location where the magnetic drug is administered. Cai et al. developed a magnetically actuated biodegradable poly- meric multi-reservoir microchip device for the pulsatile release ofvitamin B2 and DNA by incorporating magnetic Fe 2O3particles as switch carriers and poly-( D,L-lactic acid) as the polymer substrate (Fig. 12 b) [342]. When the device is subjected to the magnetic eld, the magnetic Fe 2O3particles move toward the pores of the polycarbon- ate membrane which is lled or emptied depending on the position of the magnetic eld with respect to the membrane. Huang et al. devel- oped a similar magnetic eld-controlled device by electrodepositing core-shell Fe 2O3/SiO 2nanoparticles electrically conductive polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate ( Fig. 12 c) [343]. 5.4. Electro-responsive release systems Electro-responsive pulsatile release pro les can be obtained by ap- plication and removal of electrical eld. The magnitude of the electric current, the interval between pulses and direction of the current flow can be precisely controlled, making electric e l dt r i g g e r e dD D Sap r o m - ising candidate for innovative research in the future. Electro-responsive hydrogels are developed from polyelectrolytes, which are polymers that have many ionizable functional groups attached to its backbone chain, and hence exhibit pH responsiveness as well [ 344]. When subjected to an electric eld, they bend or deswell depending on the shape of the gel and its position with respect to the electrodes. Iontophoresis is a non-invasive and needle free technique which involves the application a small external electrical potential gradient that drives the charged molecules across the membrane ( Fig. 13 ). EyeGate\u00ae II Delivery System developed by Eyegate Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Waltham, MA, US) is a device which utilizes transscleral iontopho- resis for delivering optimal dosage of drug to the targeted ocular tissue (Fig. 14 a). It is used to deliver EGP -437, which is used to treat anterior uveitis, dry eye syndrome, macular edema and to control post-cataract surgery in flammation. It involves placing a small electrode on the patient's forehead and loading the ocular applicator with the drug. The drug delivery process begins when a very small preset electric current is applied using the handheld generator to the electrode embedded Fig. 13. (a) Pulsatile release pro le for electric eld-controlled drug delivery. (b) Iontophoresis. (c) Various ultrasound triggers. (d) Schematic representation of cavitation property of microbubbles.125 P. Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138within the applicator. At the electrode, the current electrolyzes water molecules within the applicator converting them to either hydronium or hydroxide molecules depending on whether anodic or cathodic po-larity is employed. The electro-repulsion between the newly created ions and like charged drug molecules drives the drug molecules into the targeted ocular tissue. Iontophoresis is limited to drug molecules of ionic nature, small size and low molecular weight; hence the drug should be reformulated to confer an electric charge which may affect its bioactivity. Iontocaine is a device developed by IOMED Inc. in 1995 to deliver lignocaine by iontophoresis. However, the company stopped its produc- tion in 2005. IontoPatch is an electronic transdermal drug delivery med- ical device developed by Travanti Medical. It consists of a built-in battery which provides the small electric current required to carry the drugs through the skin into the subcutaneous layer. It shuts off when the preset dosage of the drug has been delivered. It is single use and disposable. IsisIQis a programmable iontophoretic patch developed by Isis Biopolymer, Providence, Rhode Island. It consists of polymer thick elec- trodes, a drug loaded hydrogel layer, and a permeable membrane which can selectively facilitate or prevent the transport of drugs ( Fig. 14 b). It has been studied for delivery of cefazolin, methylphenidate, L-Dopa and ibuprofen. was therst FDA-approved migraine patch. It is a battery powered patch which delivers sumatriptan by using a mild electrical current merely by pressing a button ( Fig. 14 c) [345]. Recently, its sales and distribution have been stopped after reports of it causing sever skin reactions such as redness, blistering etc.The Medicines Company developed IONSYS\u00ae, a pre-programmed fentanyl delivery system to treat acute post-operative surgical pain in- stead of administering an opioid analgesic, by employing an impercep-tible electric current ( Fig. 14 d) [346]. LidoSite\u00ae developed by Vyteris, is another technology that utilizes iontophoresis. It is an active transder- mal patch used for topical delivery of lidocaine to act as an analgesic for venipuncture [ 347]. Similarly, Alza Corporation developed E- TRANS\u00ae fentanyl an electronic transdermal patch to deliver fenta- nyl [348]. Reversible valves prepared from polymer actuators, which are also called 'articial muscles 'can control the release of the contained drug from the 'smart pill 'single reservoir implant. The implant contains poly- mer rings of micrometer size, which when subjected to an electric cur- rent through a conducting polymer, modulates the flow of the drug from the reservoir [ 349]. Macroesis is another drug delivery method developed by Buckeye Pharmaceuticals, Beachwood, Ohio that uses alternating current to de- liver the therapeutic payload to the targeted tissues. Singh et al. con- ducted the feasibility studies for using macroesis to deliver triamcinolone acetonide and ranibizumab to ocular tissues [ 350]. Both iontophoresis and macroesis have numerous advantages compared to intravitreal injections. However, they concluded that macroesis is a more viable method compared to DC iontophoresis as it does not in- volve heat generation and the drug molecules need not be reformulated. This technique has been used to deliver anti-fungal drugs for a condition called onychomycosis. It has shown promising results in the treatment of other conditions such as herpes labialis and catheter infections. Uhland et al. patented a drug delivery device using electrothermal ablation [ 351]. The reservoir cap in the device used to contain the Fig. 14.

The electrical input lead and the electrical output lead are connected to the same reservoir cap, and when subjected to an electrical potential gradient, the reservoir cap heats up and ruptures, thereby releasing the reservoir contents. 5.5. Ultrasound regulated release systems Ultrasound is often used as an enhancer to facilitate drug perme- ation through biological barriers such as blood vessels, skin etc. Ultra- sound can be used to attain spatiotemporal control of the drug release by regulating its tissue penetration depth by altering its duty cycles, power density, frequency, and time of exposure. Pulsatile release pro- les can be realized by on/off application of ultrasound. Ultrasound can trigger the release of the encapsulated drug from the carrier by in- crease in temperature due to absorption of ultrasound or growth and oscillation of gaseous activities, known as cavitation. Fig. 13 illustrates the two types of cavitation effects, namely, stable cavitation and inertial cavitation. SonoPrep is a low frequency ultrasonic permeation device de- veloped by Sontra for topical lidocaine delivery and continuous trans- dermal glucose monitoring. It consists of a hand piece containing an ultrasonic probe, return electrode, coupling medium disposable car- tridge and battery-operated power and control unit. The ultrasonic probe vibrates at 55 kHz to apply a low frequency ultrasound to the skin through the liquid coupling medium for 30 s. This causes cavitation bubbles to oscillate and disorder the lipid bilayer of the stratum corneum, forming reversible micro-channels in the skin through which drugs can be delivered or interstitial fluids can be extracted for diagnostic purposes such as glucose monitoring. The current moving through the return electrode measures the reduction in skin impedance and once the level of skin permeation is attained, the device automati- cally switches off. Extensive research is being conducted on using ultra- sound to improve drug transport via transdermal patch [ 358].So far, the basic principles associated with each of the external trig- gers and their recent advancements in terms of their clinical transla- tional potential have been presented. Although the preparation of stimuli-responsive carriers has a long history, there are a few products approved by FDA ( Table 7 ). 6. Advances in the design of drug delivery systems In the previous sections, we have described the different technolo- gies for fabricating drug carriers with different release pro les. Each of these technologies, however, can usually fabricate only a type of drug carrier that provide only one speci c type of release pro le. It is impor- tant to construct a single platform for fabricating customizable drug car- riers (e.g., particles or tablets), such as for designing drug tablets that flexibly deliver any type of release pro les. In the eld of personalized medicine, the medical needs of each and every individual are recog- nized to be different: individuals may have different biological charac- teristics (e.g., age, sex, size, and genome), working/living environment, dietary habits, and/or variations of a similar type of illness [359,360]. Despite knowing that the medical needs of every individual are different, it is currently still technologically challenging to be able to create a single platform for fabricating customizable carriers that can be programmed to release any type of pro le. Fabrication of unique types of drug tablets of any shape and size for customizable release may be possible through many advanced methods (e.g., micromachining and photolithography); however, the challenge lies in the cost and logistics of preparing the customizable tablets for mass populations of people. There is a need to devise a technological simple and low-cost platform that can allow the customization of drug carriers to be conducted in a typical setting (e.g., a drug store or clinic) for the drugs to be as widely accessible to the public as possible. In this section, new technologies that enable drugs to be released with customizable release pro les will be described. These technologies Table 7 Exogenous stimuli-responsive DDSs which are FDA approved or in clinical trials.

Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138include microchips technology, mixtures of particles with different sizes, inkjet printing technology, and 3D printing technology. Through these technologies, different types of release pro les have been demon- strated; they include constant, pulsatile, and linear. 6.1. Microchip technology Oneflexible way of controlling the release of drug was proposed by Robert Langer and coworkers using microchips [ 361]. The microchip is a device with several small (i.e. micron-sized) reservoirs loaded with the drugs to be released ( Fig. 15 a). The reservoirs are sealed with a poly- meric membrane for controlling the release of the drug [ 361]. In their study, PLGA was the material of choice for the membrane because of its long degradation time and biocompatibility. Through the use of PLGA with different molecular weights, the rate of degradation of the membrane can be tuned. Four types of PLGA were chosen in their study: PLGA4.4 64 kDa). Higher molecular weight PLGA has a slower degradation rate. Therefore, by sealing the micro-reservoirs with these four types of PLGA, it is possible to release the drug with four pulses (Fig. 15 b). Due to the long degradation time of PLGA, the duration of re- lease can last as long as a few months. The polymeric microchip isproposed to be implanted into a patient's body via surgery for providing sustained release of drug [ 361]. Recently, a more advanced type of microchip which allows the re- lease of drug to be controlled wirelessly or in a programmed manner [362,363] was reported. The drug can be released immediately upon re- ceipt of a command from an operator. In this design, the devices with many small reservoirs are sealed by an impermeable, thin metallic membrane instead of the previously mentioned polymeric membranes. This metallic membrane can be removed electrothermally via an inter- nal electronic circuit. The images of the microchip are shown in Fig. 15 c, d[362,364]. This technology is useful for patients with conditions that require frequent administration of drug (e.g., chronic diseases, or regular pain- management needs). For example, these programmable chips can change the treatment for many kinds of diseases, such as cancer, osteo- porosis and multiple sclerosis. These diseases usually require patients to have a strict regimen of taking pills at regular periods of time, which can be inconvenient or impossible to maintain for certain patients (e.g., patients with disabilities). Through implanting the microchip into the patient's body, the drug can be programmed to be released at the desired times automatically for a duration of several months; hence, the patient will be able to bene t from the release of drug with- out effort from their part [ 361,362,365]. A clinical trial has been Fig. 15. (a) A prototype microchip for controlled release. Reproduced from [ 361] with permission from Springer Nature.

Davoodi et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 132 (2018) 104 -138reported in which the device was implanted in human subjects for de- livering drugs in vivo. 6.2. Mixtures of uniform-sized microspheres Methods of fabricating microspheres with uniform size had been re- ported for many years, using techniques such as micro fluidic [ 366], spraying [ 367,368], and emulsion [ 369]. Although drug-containing mi- crospheres can usually only release drugs with a decreasing pro le as mentioned in the previous sections, it is possible to release drugs with customizable release pro les by mixing uniformly-sized microspheres with different size and properties [ 370]. Basically, the release pro les that can be achieved through mixing these microspheres is the superpo- sition of the release pro les resulting from the individual type of micro- spheres. For example, Kyekyoon et al. combined uniformly-sized microspheres of different sizes to produce zeroth-order release of rho- damine and piroxicam. The uniform microspheres were generated by the precision particle fabrication (PPF) method ( Fig. 16 a). This PPF tech- nology breaks a stream of polymer into a continuous series of uniformly-sized droplets by an acoustic wave along the liquid jet [370]. The size of the droplets was controlled by various process param- eters, such as flow rates and acoustic frequency. Different release pro- les are obtained by controlling the ratio of two types of microspheres (e.g., combinations 10 and 50 m piroxicam-containing microspheres; Fig. 16 b) [370]. These results showed that mixing microspheres with uniform sizes can be a general method for controlling drug release rates [ 371 -373]. The method, however, may depend greatly on the type of release pro le desired. For example, if a complex release pro le is required, it may be needed to select and mix many different types of microspheres to- gether; a task that can be challenging to implement. 6.3. Inkjet printing technology Conceptually, the perception of the technology that involves inkjet printing of drug is similar to that of inkjet printers commonly found in ofces and homes. The printer is usually loaded with a reservoir of liq- uid that contains the drug. When in demand, the printer dispenses small volumes (e.g., nano-liter or pico-liter) of drug-containing liquid droplets onto a substrate [ 374]. Through this method, the release of the drug can be customized through various means. For example, the dosage of the drug in the droplet can be varied [ 375]. Another example involves using different substrates or an additional polymeric coating of different thickness on the droplets after they are dispensed on the sub- strates [ 376]. Genina et al. reported a customized oral dosage forms by combining inkjet and flexographic printing technology together. Inthis study, the release of drug can be tuned by the coating layer and sub- strates. Ribo flavin sodium phosphate was used as the model drug. The tablets with different ethyl cellulose (EC) coating layer were printed onto three different substrates, including uncoated wood-free paper, triple-coated inkjet paper and double-coated sheet fed offset paper. Re- sults showed that the release pro les were different when different substrates were used. In addition, the release can differ from decreasingto constant depending on the number of layers of the coating. ( Fig. 17 ) [376]. Because of the various flexibility to print the drug-containing droplets, inkjet printing has been proposed to be an inexpensive method for customizing drug dosage and release pro les [377]. This method also has the advantage that it can accurately print small vol- umes of fluids with high throughput. 6.4. 3D printing technology Three-dimensional (3D) printing has recently gained much of inter- est in the scienti c community due to its versatility in fabricating cus- tomizable drug tablets, including customizable release pro les [378 -380]. In addition, 3D printing has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States for fabricating drug tablets [ 381]. One of common methods to print drug tablets in- volves two main steps. First, a layer of powder is spread out on a plat- form for printing the tablets. Subsequently, a drug-containing liquid is ejected onto the powder through the nozzle of the 3D printer; this liquid binds the powder together to form the tablet. The cycle then continues: another layer of powder is spread again on top of the previous layer of powder, followed by the ejection of the drug-containing binder until the whole 3D structure of the drug tablet is formed. In order to custom- ize the release pro les, many parameters (e.g., the dimensions, mate- rials, and the design of the tablets) can be changed [ 66]. One of the earliest designs involved constructing the geometry of the tablet as il- lustrated in Fig. 18 a[378]. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and lactose monohydrate were used for this study. Basically, it consists of an innermost circular core surrounded by multiple concentric annu-lar regions. The top and bottom surfaces of the tablet were coated with an impermeable layer of coating such that the tablet releases drug only via the radial direction. By fabricating each region with a spe- cic concentration of the drug, it was possible to customize the desired type of release pro le. For example, if a constant (zero-order) pro le is desired, the concentration of the drug of each region is calculated to be proportional to 1/ r 2,w h e r e ris the radial distance from the center of the tablet. For other types of release pro les, the dependence of the concen- tration of the drug in each region can be calculated. As an illustration, if a tablet consists of a circular core and four outer annular regions (Fig. 18 a), the cumulative amount of drug, Q, can be calculated using Fig. 16. a) Scheme of the dual-nozzle precision particle fabrication (PPF) technology for producing uniformly-sized microsphere, b) In-vitro release of pi roxicam from mixtures of 10- m and 50- m diameter PLG microspheres.

In this equation, QTotalis the total amount of drug in the tablet, kr,region is the rate of erosion of that region, Cregion is the concentration of drug of that region, and trefers to the time of release. Each term in the square bracket on the right side of the equation represents the release of each respective region. This equation thus illustrates that by varying the concentrations, Cregion , in the different regions from zero to a highconcentration, it is possible to achieve many different types of pro les. The experimental results with different ratios (Lactose to HPMC = 70:30 and 80:20) and the theoretically predicted curves for the constantrelease pro le is shown in Fig. 18 b. Another type of 3D printing technology is lament-based printing. This method involves rst fabricating a lament that contains the drug Fig. 17. Release pro les of ribo flavin sodium phosphate.

The tablet is formed after directly printing the material onto a planar sub- strate layer by layer [ 382]. The lament containing the drug can be pre- pared by melting a polymer with the drug and other excipients; alternatively, the drug can be impregnated directly into the polymeric laments by soaking the polymer laments in highly concentrateddrug solutions. Alvaro et al. reported that the release of drug can be con- trolled by the geometry of the tablets ( Fig. 18 c). Model drug and poly- mer (polyvinyl alcohol, PVA) were mixed by dissolving both in an aqueous solution. The mixed liquid was then extruded through a la- ment extruder for preparation of the drug loaded polymer lament. The tablets with different geometries were printed using the lament- Fig. 19.

The plot on the left shows the case in which one dye released according to an increasing pro le, while the other dye released according to a decreasing pro le.

The release pro les of tablets with different geometries are shown in Fig. 18 d. technology, however, have several disadvantages [ 66,384]. Ex- amples include clogged nozzles, low dosage of drugs, uncontrollable ini- tial burst release, poor mechanical property, and/or complex structures that need to be printed for the different types of release pro les. It also requires complex mathematical modeling and/or iterative algorithms in order to obtain a speci c release pro le, and may involve the fabrication of complex (e.g., layer-by-layer) structures [ 378,384]. Because of the difculties related to printing of drug tablets using the 3D printer, an al- ternative method was developed [ 385]. Instead of printing the drug tab- lets directly using the 3D printer, the 3D printer was used to print the molds of unique shapes. A dye and a surface-eroding polymer for con- trolling the release of the dye were used in this development. Brie fly, the procedure involved rst printing the mold of a desired shape using a 3D printer. The liquid that contained the dye and the pre- polymer liquid is then poured into the mold. After polymerization, the dye-containing polymeric matrix is extracted from the mold and coated with a layer of impermeable polymer on all but one side. The remaining void space was subsequently lled with the same surface-eroding poly- mer that does not contain the dye. Hence, the tablet consisted of three main components: the dye-containing polymer with the desired shape, the polymer that did not contain the dye, and the impermeable coating ( Fig. 19 a, b). Because the tablet was coated on all but one side, the release of the dye is only in a single direction (i.e., the uncoated side). This one-dimensional degradation of the surface-eroding polymer and the release of dye ensured that the rate of release is directly propor- tional to the shape of the dye-containing polymer. This approach has been demonstrated to work for a variety of release pro les, including constant, increasing, decreasing, pulsatile, and an arbitrary pro le (Fig. 19 c and d). These release pro les correspond directly to the shape of the dye-containing polymer. In addition to the release of a sin- gle type of drug, it was demonstrated that the concept could be ex- tended for the release of multiple drugs. By stacking the polymers of different shapes into the tablet, it is possible to customize the release prole of each of the drug in the tablet. The rate of degradation (i.e., the total duration of release) can be tuned by varying the properties of the surface-eroding polymer. Hence, this approach allows a range of customization of the drug tablets, including the customization of release proles, dosage (i.e., as a direct consequence of the ability to customize release pro les), duration of release, and release of multiple drugs. Fur- ther work will be needed to demonstrate that the technology can be used for drug molecules and biocompatible polymeric matrices. 7. Conclusions and perspective remarks Many of the available delivery systems cannot provide an accurate dosage of a therapeutic compound at a target organ over a speci cp e - riod. The unacceptable or sub-optimal performance of these delivery systems may be due to poor drug biodistribution (physicochemical properties), underestimating the effects of physiological barriers and surrounding tissue on biodistribution of the drug, limitations in material selections and fabrication technologies, and/or miss-matching between an optimal therapy (i.e. prede ned drug administration intervals) and the release behavior of commercial DDSs. To address allabovementioned obstacles, scientists can rst describe the required properties of a DDS and work backward to nd out what they should do and how they should direct their research toward that goal. With the translation of a number of polymeric DDSs to clinic, the develop- ment of smarter carriers with more precise and tunable release pro les is indispensable. Therefore, based on our entire discussion in this review article, the future DDSs should have a sophisticated architecture andcontrollers (e.g. sensors), which can precisely regulate the release of drugs on \"On-Off \"manner as prescribed by clinicians. Although the practical experience in the use of real DDSs is helpful for optimization of new devices, the mechanistic studies and mathe- matical modeling can greatly improve our understanding of drug re- lease mechanisms and predict the distribution of the compound in- vivo, which consequently accelerate the preparation of an optimal depot. It will be highly bene cial if scientists can theoretically predict the favorite parameters of release pro les via mathematical models or computer-based simulations. This information can then be used for evaluating the appropriateness of a payload for a DDS and further opti- mization of size, shape, therapeutic dose required, and in-vivo biodegra- dation of a carrier. In addition, the compatibility of materials with new manufacturing technologies such as 3D-printing will be a key for greater miniaturiza- tion of drug delivery devices and implants with a speci c functionality. As the ultimate goal is to develop personalized DDSs comprising a closed-loop diagnosis controller for long-term drug delivery, new de- vices should employ biocompatible materials with long-term stability, which can continuously monitor physiological changes and release a sufcient amount of therapeutic agent. However, not only manufactur- ing and reproducibility is a highly challenging step, the in-vivo assess- ment of stimuli-responsive materials and the highly variable conditions of patients or even the site of a disease may adversely affect the standardization and commercialization of a new product. Despite numerous challenges in full utilization of available technol- ogies and materials in healthcare and pharmaceutical products, the drug delivery products have had a considerable impact on enhancing medical therapies and are bringing new hopes for the treatment of life-threatening diseases.
