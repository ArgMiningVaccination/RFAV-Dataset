Program Overview The Summer Internship Program (SIP) provides experience in biomedical and/or public health research to students from all backgrounds - including students from racial/ethnic groups underrepresented in science and medicine, students from low-income/underserved backgrounds, and students with disabilities. The program provides research exposure for those interested in potential careers in science, medicine, and public health. Benefits Participants gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in research, scientific experimentation and other scholarly investigations under the close guidance of faculty or research mentors. SIP students take part in a range of professional and career development activities, networking events, and research discussions. Students also have the opportunity to present their work in oral or poster format at the conclusion of the program. In addition, SIP students often go on to present their summer research at national conferences throughout the year. The program runs approximately ten weeks and students receive a minimum stipend of $3,000. Housing is provided at no cost to participants. Overall, SIP interns can expect an experience similar to that of a first-year graduate student who does a three-month rotation in a laboratory. SIP interns become acquainted with their lab's scope of exploration, investigative techniques, and fellow researchers working on that topic. Before arrival, each SIP intern receives several papers related to their specific research project. Interns are assigned their own lab project, and the goal of the project and its relationship to other work in the area will be discussed. Participants also receive training in the techniques necessary to conduct their research activity. The projects that SIP students take on provide students a sense of ownership of their work. Besides daily interactions with others at the lab or project site, most teams have a more formal meeting once or twice a week to discuss research problems, work progress and developments reported in the scientific literature. While the focus of each research site varies, all are composed of highly dedicated mentors who are fully devoted to the professional development, advancement, and success of our SIP scholars. This summer internship program requires a full-time commitment. It is not permissible to take academic classes or hold other employment during the internship. Students are required to participate for the full period of the program. The Complete Application There are multiple divisions of SIP, each providing a unique experience. Applying is free, there is no cost to the applicant. To apply to a SIP division, you will need: - Two letters of recommendation (faculty and/or research mentors preferred) - Transcripts for each undergraduate institution attended (transcripts can be unofficial) - Current CV or resume - Personal Statement* - (CSM applicants only) Proof of family income *The personal statement should be no longer that 1.5 pages, single-spaced using at least an 11-point font.
