They say there is no rationale in such tests as vaccine is anyway working. The more people get coverage of it the better are the chances of getting back to normalcy. It has come to the fore that many people want to know whether they have developed antibodies against coronavirus after being fully vaccinated. They are doing so on discovering that people are contracting the virus and are landing in ICUs even after being inoculated. Ranjan Joshi, who is tasked to head the Paediatric Critical Care for coronovirus pandemic for south Australia, said people shouldn't rush to get antibody test done. \"The vaccination drive has to do with containing the pandemic in larger sense by way of mass coverage. It is not about who gets how much antibody against the virus. Instead of stressing the mind and worrying about the vaccine's efficacy, we all should stick to the Covid norms,\" he observed. He further said people may need booster doses, which the scientists are working on. Mrinalini Darswal, an [Odisha](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/odisha) cadre IAS officer, who is pursuing doctoral study on public health at [Harvard University](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/harvard-university) in the US, said common antibody test doesn't detect potential protection against Covid-19 as immunity against the infection is provided through an admixture of mechanisms that are yet to be studied. \"People shouldn't rush to the labs for antibody test. Vaccine definitely is helping and there shouldn't be any doubt about that. As we never did any antibody test for diseases like tuberculosis or hepatitis after being inoculated, there is no such need in case of Covid as well,\" Darswal added. She added that country like Israel has fully opened because of vaccine coverage. \"The data on vaccine clearly indicates they are very effective. Look at UK where death rate is now almost zero despite detection of all variants of concern,\" Darswal added. "}
