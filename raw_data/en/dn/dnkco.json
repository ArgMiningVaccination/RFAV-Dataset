This is not a complete list and Ashley advises to also check the [Mindat ](https://www.mindat.org/)website. If you are unsure if a crystal is safe, do not use it. -A- Abalone - Harmful or toxic stone. Organic, may contain bacteria as well as pollutants from toxic materials from the water it forms in. Acanthite - \"This mineral's softness precludes its use in the normal method of preparation of an elixir\" (Love is in the Earth - Updated 79). Actinolite - \"Fibrous form is a type of asbestos. Not recommended for elixirs\" (Healing Crystals). Adamite - \"Toxic or harmful stone.
