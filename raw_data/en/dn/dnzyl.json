A Patient Resource Library, located near the entrance, offers patients and families access to current information about cancer, treatment options and more. Various ancillary staff are here to support you and your family at the time of diagnosis and through treatment. Patient Financial Advocate Financial Advocates are responsible for identifying and helping to mitigate financial toxicity for patients with cancer, caregivers and their families. We do this by proactively identifying and evaluating how to maximize the patient's health insurance benefits, proactively reducing economic barriers to care by having working knowledge of available patient assistance programs, financial advocacy tools, and resources, and accurately explaining insurance coverage. If you are interested in speaking with one of our Oncology Patient Financial Advocates in the Cancer Center about your specific situation, please call (360) 788-8233. Nutrition Management Nutrition services can be essential as part of a comprehensive plan providing safe and effective nutrition care. This includes prevention, coping with the side effects of treatment and survivorship. Good nutritional intake can help improve tolerance to cancer therapies and improve quality of life. If there are any concerns about your nutritional risk, our oncology-specialized dietitian can provide a free assessment in setting nutrition related goals. Complementary Therapies Patients receiving treatment at PeaceHealth Cancer Center for cancer may be able to receive complementary therapies to aid in reducing stress and increasing relaxation during treatment. These calming therapies are available in a comfortable and supportive setting to increase your sense of well-being. Some examples of complementary therapies are Massage, Acupuncture and Reiki. Social Services Medical Social Workers are available to help support patients and their loved ones on their cancer journey, adjusting to life during treatment as well as side effects from treatment. Our staff is available to help with access to transportation, caregiver needs, career-related legal rights and disability paperwork. Social workers are also able to facilitate referrals for rehabilitation, home care, grief support, pastoral/spiritual care, palliative care and hospice as well as many other community programs. Our staff members lead our support groups which offer an environment for patients and families to receive support and encouragement from others on a similar journey. Resource Center Our Resource Library is conveniently located off of the lobby. It is staffed full-time by volunteers who can assist patients and their families with many services. The Resource Library contains informational brochures, a lending library of books and DVDs/CDs, and a wig, hat and scarf bank with a private room for trying things on. Survivorship - Life After Treatment Completing cancer treatment can be a difficult transition for many patients. Depending on your cancer type, stage of disease, and response to treatment, you may be eligible for survivorship services available through the Cancer Center. Talk with your care team to discuss a plan for survivorship as you complete your treatment to determine if you may be eligible for these services. "}
