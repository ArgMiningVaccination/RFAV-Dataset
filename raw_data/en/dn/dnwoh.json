Many men have spent many hours pondering the elusive seat of the soul, including Rene Descartes, who fe lt that it was in the pineal gland (in the center of the brain--it is responsible for much of our circadian rhythms, amongst other things). He may have been right, he may have been wrong. The seat of the soul may be as elusive as the origins of autism itself. As a gastroenterologist, I am inclin ed to believe that it's in the intestine, and I'll try to explain why. A Brief History of Autism Leo Kanner first described autism in eleven children in 1943. 1 The presenting features in patients were so new and so consis tent and also so different from everything that had been seen before that they merited publication as a new di sease syndrome. There were no controls because it wasn't known what to control against. This is in the nature of the original description of human disease syndromes. The symptoms as desc ribed by Kanner still serv e as the template for our understanding of autism. In sp ite of the fact that more than half of the children had clear symptoms of possible intestinal disease, he interpreted the sy mptoms as psychologically-based\u2014 a misconception that persists today. In the 1950s Bruno Bettelheim was considered a leading expert on autism, despite the fact that he had no formal training of any ki nd (he held a PhD in philosophy). He propagated Kanner's theory that autism was a psychological disorder caused by emotionally cold parents (the \"refrigerator mother\" theory). As recently as 1981 he wrote, \"All my life I've been working with children whose lives were destr oyed because their mothers hated them.\" 2 It is tragic that for decades this notion was universally accepted, and ind eed it still lingers. A paper written in 2002 (I regret to say from my own medical school) states, \"Many ch ildren with autism have unusual diets, often associated with constipation, which might lead to non-specific abnormalities of the 1 Kanner, Leo. Nervous Child , \"Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact.\" 1943. 2 Madness on the Couch: Blaming the Victim in the Heyday of Psychoanalysis , Edward Dolnick, p.216. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 2bowel.\"3 The implication remains that it's the parent 's fault, for feeding the children what they feed them. Kanner and Bettelheim's legacy of bl aming the parent hasn't left us altogether. In the presence of a disease as elusive and enigmatic as autism, it has often surprised me that so many people claim to be experts. We are inundated with \"expert\" opinion, even though so little is really known about the di sease itself. The opinions are many: There is no epidemic, we're simp ly better at ma king the diagnosis . Now, those of you who live with autism every day know that it is clinically striking--it is not something that we could ever have missed in the past. The greatest clinicians in medicine were not even practicing in the 20th century, but the century before: people like Charcot from the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re in Paris, and his colleague Pierre Marie; these were among the truly great clinicians . There was not much they could do about the diseases they enc ountered, but they described th em in meticulous detail. Had autism existed before the time of Le o Kanner, I suspect we would have had vivid descriptions in the medical literature prior to him. * In his paper, Kanner himself wrote, \"Since 1938, there have come to our attention a number of children whose condition differs so markedly and uniquely from anything reported so far, that each case merits\u2014and, I hope, w ill eventually receive\u2014a detailed consideration of its fascinating peculiari ties.\" If the prevalence rates were constant, Mark Blaxill has calculated th at from the known population of the world thus far we would have had some 300 million patients with autism before Leo Kanner. These facts lead me to believ e that it is not an ancient disease. There is no bowel disease in children with ASD--bowel symptoms are simply to be expected in children with autism, and are therefore irrelevant . As a gastroenterologist, I fail to understand this at all. There is no link between the gut and the brain . I tell my colleagues who say this that we should go out for a beer. They think I'm offering to buy them a drink, but 3 Taylor B, Miller E, Lingham R, Andrews N, Simmons A, Stowe, J. Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and bowel problems or developmental regression in children with autism: population study . BMJ . 2002;324:393-396. * Dr. J. Langdon Down, best known for having described Down's Syndrome, also gave the first major description of savant syndrome in 1887 at a lectur e to the London Medical Society documenting ten cases of patients with extraordinary musical, artistic, a nd numbers ability, coupled with phenomenal memory. Savant syndrome has been found in non autistic individuals. It is unclear if the people he described were autistic or not. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 3they're missing the point. If they drink a pi nt of beer, within five minutes or less they will feel the impact in their brains. Toxins from the gut reach the brain very, very quickly. The temporal link to vacci nation is purely coincidental . Now this may be true\u2014it may absolutely be true, but it is not a conclusion that we can reach a priori . A connection must be excluded by due diligen ce and investigation, a nd if that is the conclusion we come to, we can exonerate the vaccines. And perhaps most insulting to common sens e, there are \"experts\" telling us that Thimerosal\u2014nearly 50% ethyl mercury-- on e of the most toxic substances known to man, is actually safe in vaccines \u2014a harmless and appropriate addition to the bloodstream of an infant. Our belief systems in medicine and in scie nce exist to be demolis hed, mine no less than anyone else's. Erich Honecker, the late leader of the German Democratic Republic, comes to mind. He said in 1989, \"The Wall will be standing in fifty and even in one hundred years,\" and of course the wall that divided Berlin is gone today. What was true yesterday may not be true tomorrow. Understanding Autism Where can we begin to untangle this complex di sease? The answer is very, very simple. We must listen to the parents' story. I cannot emphasize the importance of the clinical history enough. The first lesson I learned on the ward is that the most importa nt thing to hear is the first thing the patient (or the patient's parents) tells you. What they tell you gives you the first clue to their diagnosis. The day you forget that, the day that in your arrogance you assume you know more than the patient does, is the day you should walk off the ward and pursue some other career. The patient's history is the starting point. Only after taking the history and examining the patient can you proceed with special investigations indicate d by the findings. These are the sources that ultimately lead you to the diagnosis. There are four features of th e clinical history that we have heard from parents again and again, starting in the clinic back in 1995. The fi rst is that the child was developing normally, consistently meeting their first-year milestones. Experts in autism have repeatedly told parents, \"Your child was never really quite right. You may have thought they were speaking but they The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 4weren't. That wasn't the word 'helicopter' you heard, it was just a grunt.\" This is an appalling perception of the accuracy of the parents' view of their own child. Parents know their children-- they have known them for thousands and thousands of years. To make the assumption that they did not recognize that th eir child was not normal is difficult to comprehend. (Alternatively, they tell parents of children who have recovered from autism, \"Your child was never really autistic.\") In fact, there's a paper that's just come out from the Univer sity of Washington indicating that parents are extremely astute observers of their children's development.4 The second feature is regression into autism, often in close temporal relation to a vaccine (usually MMR) or an infectious episode. There has often been a marked clinical reaction to the vaccine, including prolonged high fever and debilita tion, from which the child does not appear to recover. The third feature we hear about is the appe arance of gastrointestinal symptoms. When parents first came to me asking for help, I couldn't imagine why they had sought out a gastroenterologist. I kn ew nothing about autism. But the fact is that at the sa me time as their regression into autism, these children developed hard neurological and GI symptoms. I will go into the GI symptoms in some detail later. Th e neurological symptoms we re striking--the child would start bumping into things , their gait would become uns teady and broad-based, they no longer wanted to walk upstairs. So it wasn't just that there was developmental regression-- disintegration of cognitive faculties--there was also ataxia, a hard neurological feature. The fourth feature has been reiterated by parents to whom I've spoken around the world\u2014a propensity in autistic ch ildren to recurrent upper respirat ory tract and ear infections. The rest of the family develops an infection and recovers easily, but the child with autism gets it and can't shake it. The result is a history of mul tiple antibiotic use going b ack to the first year of life. I think this may be important in the dis ease process, or it may be a proxy for an immune system that is not working well. So if in doubt, examine the patient. We have to look carefully at what 's right in front of our eyes. This slide shows us a patient of Dr. Krigsman's. This is what is called abnormal posturing. It's a subtle physical sign that was ascribed previ ously to maladaptive behavior\u2014to autistic behavior. In fact it is an entirely appr opriate behavior. This child has discovered that 4 Werner E, Dawson G.. Validation of the phenomenon of autistic regression using home videotapes. Arch Gen Psychiatry . 2005 Aug;62(8):889-95. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 5 when he applies pressure to his lower abdomen, it helps to relieve his pain. We now know this because children stop posturing when they receive appropriate bowel treatment. Here's a little boy I've been seeing in England. Here he is on the left at the age of one, perfectly happy and healthy, and on the right at the age of six. He looks like a child from a famine z o n e i n E a s t A f r i c a . H e has no muscle mass at all, he has a hugely distended abdomen--this child has an underlying gastrointestinal disease until proven otherwise. And yet pediatric gastroenterologists to whom this child was referred would not see him on the basis The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 6 that his condition was too controversial. There is nothing controversial about this child. The person who is under investigation in this family is not the child, but the mother, for starving her child. He has two brothers and a sister (behind him in this picture), and they be lie that contention because they are perfectly well-nourished. This is the awkward position in which medicine has placed itself\u2014practitioners fail to treat children because of the prevailing dogma, choosing to blame the parents for the disease instead. Here is a little girl on the left with whom Dr. Krigsman and I have been concerned. She is perhaps one of the sickest children I have ever met. She manifests several classic features of typical inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. She also has uveitis (inflammation of her eyes), severe arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, a possible blood-clotting problem associated with a platelet abnormality, severe bruising due to a combination of the latter with self- injury, and regressive autism. Once again it has been exquisitely difficult to get clinical care for this child's physical symptoms, simply because she has autism. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 7The Gastrointestinal System Returning to the question, where is the seat of the soul? My suspicion is that, if one exists, it is somewhere in the gastrointestinal tract: : The gastrointestinal tract starts with the esophagus, which leads into the stomach, through the duodenum, into the small intestine, then into th e colon (the large bowel), and down into the rectum and the anus. I believe it to be of primary importance in the origins of many cases of autism. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 8Now let's have a look at th e lining of the intestine: We're looking at the main functional compartm ent of the small inte stine in this slide . Most people are not aware that the inte stine is the largest part of the body's immune system. The red peaks in the background as well as the paler peaks you see in the foreground are the finger-like villi; they carpet the lining of the intestine and form the enormous absorptive surface of the small intestine. The gastrointestinal tract is man's most impor tant interface with his environment. It's full of bacteria, food, and toxins, pa rticularly in the colon. They're usually friendly bacteria that are necessary for good health and immune system function. More and more papers are emerging (specifically from Gibson and Sandler) stressing th e important role of intestinal bacteria in normal immune development and function, and the role of these issues in the genesis of developmental disorders. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 9Autistic Enterocolitis We published a paper in the Lancet in 1998, describing twelve children who presented with both GI symptoms a nd developmental disorders.5 A follow-up paper confirming this syndrome in sixty children was published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology .6 Karoly Horvath at the University of Maryland publishe d a paper describing in flammation in the upper GI tract of these children.7 Next, there was a series of pape rs from our group at the Royal Free Hospital in London characterizing th e immunological and histological aberrations in the intestine of these children, starting in the colon and th en working progressively through the intestine.8 9 10 In characterizing the nature of the inflamma tory infiltrate in the intestine, we began asking the question, is this similar to diseases that we have seen before or is it different? If it is similar to something we have seen before, where have we seen it? Dr. Krigsman and his colleagues from New York University School of Medicine presented their research at the Internationa l Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR) in 2004.11 They described the first 147 cases that they had seen, confirming precisely the same disease that we had first described in the United Kingdom. And then more information came from Dr. Federico Balzola in Italy, who presented at the American Gast roenterological Association in Chicago in 200512 and published a paper in the American Journal of Gastroenterology13 describing exactly the same bowel disease in patients with autism from northern Italy.

Am J Gastroenterol. 2005 Apr;100(4):979-81. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 10performed capsule enteroscopy in th ese children. For the first time, we could see disease of the small intestine that we hadn't been able to see before with traditional endoscopy: (Given Imaging) The patient swallows a capsule (or has it inse rted using the endoscope ) that contains a tiny camera; it passes through the intes tine taking two pictures a second. A further fascinating study suggesting that lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is pervasive across the range of developmental disorders came from Aderbal Sabra, the professor of pediatric The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 11gastroenterology in Sao Paolo, Brazil, and Joe Bellanti, professor of pediatric immunology at Georgetown University.14 It showed that the same bowel disease was present in some children with ADHD and ADD, and interestingly in some girl s with anorexia nervosa as well. So it may be that for many children across the entire spectr um of developmental disorders there is at the core an underlying gastrointestinal problem. Replication of these striking findings is ongoing and far-reaching. Just last weekend I was given a paper that was presented to the Ven ezuelan Society of Peri natology and Pediatrics by a pediatric immunologist who won first prize fo r his efforts. He found inflammatory bowel disease in 100% of the autistic children studied.15 So this idiosyncratic bowel disease is seen all around the world in children with a variety of deve lopmental disorders. It has been gratifying to watch the replication unfold since our first observation. What have these studies shown? Firstly that there is expansion of the lymphoid follicles, particularly in the small intes tine, in addition to lymphoid nodul ar hyperplasia. Rather like having a lymph gland in the neck that swells up when you have a sore throat, the lymph glands in the intestine swell enough that they encroach upon the lumen of the intestine, and in this way may be responsible for partial obs truction and pain (rather like havi ng a throat so sore that it hurts to swallow anything). This is also asso ciated with an increase in the number of inflammatory cells and immune cells within the in testine. There appears to be an autoimmune attack against the lining of the intestine. In as sociation with this we get a compromise of the barrier function of the intestine. There are di gestive enzymes on the surface of the villi, which are essential for the normal digestion of food a nd the maintenance of intestinal health. When these enzymes are not working properly--as in ch ildren with various infectious enteropathies (following a rotavirus infection, for example)--t hen the consequence may well be malabsorption and diarrhea. The presence of undigested food in the stool is something that we commonly see in these children. This has been demonstrated in children with autism both by Dr. Tim Buie at 14 Sabra A, Bellanti J, Hartmann D, Zeligs B, MacDowe ll-Carneiro AL, Menendez F, Colon A, Guo Wu A, Sabra LF, Romero M, Sabra S, Ebecken R, Madi K.

There is dy sbiosis, which is an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the colon a nd in the small bowel. This reportedly leads to the proliferation of Paneth cells as a source of antibacterial peptid es. This is the conste llation of pathology in the intestine that forms the disease we now call autistic enterocolitis. We also see grossly disordered cytokines in these children.18 These are the chemicals that mediate cross-talk among immune and other cells , or regulate the inflammatory process. For example, in this slide, we can see tumo r necrosis factor-al pha-producing cells (TNF ) at an unexpectedly high level in the intestinal lining, compared with developmentally normal controls: TNF is a very powerful pro-inflammatory mediator , and we'd usually only expect to see levels this high in children with Crohn's disease. Ther e is also an increase in interferon gamma (IFN- 16 Kushak R, Winter H, Farber N, Bu ie T. Gastrointestinal symptoms a nd intestinal disaccharidase activities in children with autism .

Elevated cytokine levels in children with autism spectrum disorder. J Neuroimmunol . 2006 Mar;172(1-2):198- 205. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 13), which is a major pro-inflammatory mediator. On the other side of the equation, in children with autism we see a diminution of interleukin- 10 (IL-10). IL-10 is the anti-inflammatory--it's like the aspirin of the immune syst em. So as you can see, there is a gross imbalance between the pro-inflammatory drive and the anti-inflammatory molecules in children with autism that you don't see in other inflammatory bowel diseases or in normal children. The ratio of pro- inflammatory to anti-inflammatory molecules, fo r example IL-12 to IL- 10, clearly distinguishes these children and may be a biological marker of this derangement. We do not see this same pattern in other inflammatory bowel diseases. A paper from Becker at the National Instit utes of Health casts light on the genetic contribution of the dysregulated immune function.19 Becker examined the idea that if autism is an autoimmune disease, then there should be overlaps between the genes that encode for susceptibility to autoimmune diseas es such as colitis, rheumatoid ar thritis, or lupus, for example, and autism. And he looked at genome-wide scan s and made these comparisons. His review of the literature in this respect was fascinating: \"...of particular note, gi ven suggestions of bowel inflammation in autism, are co-localization of markers including identical markers linked to both autism and celiac disease (a primary inflammatory bowel disease associated with an allergic sensitivity to gluten), and autism and Crohn's diseas e.\" The results suggest that in this group of autistic children we are looking at a new variant of inflammato ry bowel disease that shares common genetic susceptibility determinants with other known inflammatory bowel diseases. A Primary Intestinal Disease? The data suggest a primary inflammatory bowel disease in many of these children (clearly not all children with autism, but certai nly a large percentage of the children with the regressive type of autism). Have we seen this bowel disease\u2014a combination of LNH and mucosal inflammation--before? We have seen something very like it, and that is in HIV enteropathy. When we examine the intestine in patients who are known to be infected with HIV, we find no other cause for their enteropathy (such as cryptospor idium, for example), and yet 19 Becker, KB, Friedlin B, Simon RM. Comparativ e genomics of Autism, Tourette Syndrome, and autoimmune/Inflammatory Disorders (in press). The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 14what we do find is HIV and a very similar pattern of inflammation. What this suggests to us is that the bowel disease we see in children with autism is consistent with a vir al cause. What is driving the intestinal pathology? For the first time we have a starting point, and that is the swelling of the lymph glands within the intestine. We know that if we take a patient with HIV infection and we biopsy those lymph glands and stain a section of that biopsy with an antibody against one of the HIV proteins, we find the HIV antigen. If we take a patient with new-variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (mad cow disease) and we look for prion protein in the intestine of these patients, we find the prion agent in the center of those reactive lymphoid follicles. S o we are developing our ideas based upon known hu man disease syndro mes. If we take a patient with acute measles virus infection who has diarrhea and we scope and biopsy them, we find the measles virus protein in the intestine, causing lymphoid hyperplasia. When we take a biopsy from the gut of a child with autis m and we stain it with an antibod y that is specific for measles virus , we find it in the same place. If we take World Healt h Organization reference monoclonal antibodies against measles virus that have been extensively tested for specificity and apply them to the same tissues, we find the same thing. If we take those antib odies and look at those tissues disaggregated into single cells by a techniq ue called flow cytometry, we find the same thing. And so the measles virus protein appears to be presen t in these reactive lymphoid follicles. I stress that that does not make it the cause of autis m, but it makes it an interesting candidate. When we look for other viruses such as adenovirus, herpes simplex 1 and 2, HIV, mu mps, rubella--we don't find the m in these kids--we find measles. Professor John O'Leary in Dublin did a large study (ninety-one children) using the latest molecular technology in order to find out whether not just the protein but also the gene of the virus is present in the intestine.20 Measles virus geno mic RNA was present in seventy-five of those children (82%), compared with 7% of seventy develop mentally normal controls. At the very least, this confir ms a statistical association betwee n the presence of the virus and this disorder. Again, this is not a causal association, it is a statis tical association. If it were causally associated with measles virus, then what would we expect ? We would expect there to be a histor ical association between measles exposure and develop mental disorders. In 1956, at the Section of General Practice in the Royal Society of Medicine, Dr. 20 Uhlmann V, Marti n CM, Sheils O, Pilkington L, Silva I, Killalea A, Murch SB, Walker-Smith J, Thomson M, Wakefield AJ, O'Leary JJ.

The Seat of the Soul: Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 15Daynes stated: \"Typically a child between one and five years become s naughty and difficult a few days after the onset of an acute infectious illness.... such as measles or gastroenteritis.... he's irritable, negativistic and sp iteful, sleep is disturbed and he wakes up in the night and often screams: his appetite is poor, he fails to gain weight, his abdo men is often distended and the stools may become bulky, pale, and offensive.\" Does that sound familiar? Dr. Daynes continued, \"The study of over forty cases ha s led me to formulate a syndrome, pre-celiac syndrome... This condition, if left untreated, usually rights itsel f after a month or two, but it may last for much longer in which case slight petit mal attacks may de velop in addition to worsening of the other symptoms.... I have been placing these ch ildren on a gluten-free diet at the earliest opportunity and the symptoms respond dramatically, usually within two or three days. They relapse if a premature return to a normal diet is made.\"21 Further on the historical association, in 1979 at the Harvard School of Public Health, Deykin and MacMahon showed that atypical pa tterns of measles, and rubella (perinatally or in utero) are a ssociated with autism in the offspring.22 Ring and Barak from Israel have shown that children born duri ng epidemics of measles are at greater risk of autism. And so these historical associations provide the rationale for pursuing this line of research. Measles Virus: Effects on the Immune System If developmental regression were associated with measles, what would we expect in terms of the immune system response? We need to look at what we know about the immune system and the effects of measles upon it. Because measles is prof oundly immunodisruptive or immunosuppressive, following the induction of measles antibody we would expect that the lymphocyte numbers and function in the blood might be depressed. We would expect that there would be a decrease in the response of lym phocytes to provocation from antigens such as tetanus, for example, and that, paradoxically, the immune system would be in a state of chronic activation. Certainly we find lymphopenia: 21 Daynes G. Bread and tears; naughtiness, de pression and fits due to wheat sensitivity. Proc R Soc Med . 1956 Jul;49(7):391-4. 22 Deykin EY, MacMahon B.

The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 1600.511.522.5 Abs CD3 Abs CD4 Abs CD8 Abs CD19 Abs CD16 This graph shows the levels of various immune cell populations in the blood of children with autism (blue), and developmentally normal children (red). Levels of all of these immune cells, with the exception of CD-16 natural killer (NK) cells, are significantly lower in the autistic children. Elevation of the number of NK cells in these children is a common finding. When we look at the function of NK cells (anti-viral cells), however, we see that although they may be increased in number, they are depressed in their activity, i.e., their ability to kill target cells. These data from six autism clinics across the US (provided by Dr. Elizabeth Mumper) look at the percentage of childre n with low natural killer cell cytotoxicity (killer activity) compared with developmentally normal controls: The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 17 Another fascinating study, which really re -defined the way we look at anti-viral immunity and its induction, comes from Dr. Appay a nd colleagues at the Univ ersity of Oxford. These authors looked at the differentiation of an tiviral (CD8) cells following exposure to, and subsequently during the chronic phase of, certain viral infections, includ ing HIV, Epstein Barr virus, and hepatitis C virus. Specifically, th ey examined the expression of molecules CD38, CD27, and CD28 on the surface of CD8 (anti-viral) lymphocyt es as a marker of their differentiation status.23 23 Appay V, Dunbar PR, Callan M, Klenerman P, Gillespie GM, Papagno L, Ogg GS, King A, Lechner F, Spina CA, Little S, Havlir DV, Richman DD, Gruener N, Pape M, Cerundolo V, McMichael AJ, Rowland-Jones SL. Memory CD8+ T cells vary in differentiation phenotype in different persistent virus infections . Nat Med . 2002 Apr;8(4):379-85. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 18 We start with a na\u00efve CD8 T cell that has never s een a virus. It's like a new recruit in the army. We then expose it to a virus and it differe ntiates to become the fu lly cytotoxic activated CD8 T cell. As that happens, the cell change s expression of the molecules on its surface to become CD38-, CD28+, and CD27+. In the persis tent phase of the infection, when the body has failed to clear the virus, there is an excess of these cells s een in the blood. The continued expression of these molecules seems to repres ent a state of chronic viral activation and exhaustion of the ineffective antiviral T-cells. Therefore if we are looking in these children for evidence of a persistent viral infection, we should expect to see an excess of this population of cells. When we look at these ce lls in children with autism comp ared with both non-inflamed and inflamed developmentally normal contro ls, that is precisely what we find. The data are certainly consistent with chronic immune system activation a ssociated with a persiste nt viral infection. In The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 19other words, the immune system under normal circumstances is vigorous and causes viruses to wish they had not invaded the body. However, under certain circumstances it may fail in its mission to get rid of the infection. This frus trated response can be associated with an autoimmune attack directed against the host, as is often seen in AIDS. Next question: is there a specific antiviral immune response in children with autism? Dr. Singh at the University of Utah Medical School has now published three papers showing consistently abnormal antibody profiles with an elevated measles virus antibody titer in children with autism, compared with controls, that is not seen for antibodies ag ainst other common viral infections.24 25 26 James Oleske at the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) has found the same thing, as has Paul As hwood at the University of California/Davis. Dr. Ashwood took a large group of children with autism and a similar number of controls, and looked at their total IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody titers in the blood. He compared these with general population controls , sibling controls, and di sease controls. First he showed that there were low levels of circulati ng antibody in the blood of children with autism compared with controls, as has been reported by others: 24 Singh VK, Lin SX, Newell E, Nelson C. Abnormal meas les-mumps-rubella antibodies and CNS autoimmunity in children with autism . J Biomed Sci 2002 Jul-Aug;9(4):359-64. 25 Singh VK, Jensen RL. Elevated levels of measles antibodies in children with autism . Pediatr Neurol Serological association of measles virus in autism. Clin Immunol Immunopathol Oct;89(1):105-8. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 20 Then, when he looked at antibodies to common an tigens, in this case the vaccine antigens of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria, he found they were depressed in the children with autism, consistent with the low levels of IgG: The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 21Again, with common environmental agents such as CMV and influenza A and B, they were depressed in the children with autism. And yet when he came to the antigens of measles, mumps, and rubella, they were elevated in the children with autism: The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 22Low antibody titers were also seen against co mmon environmental infections such as CMV (Cytomegalovirus) and influenza A and B. Thes e were also depressed in the children with autism. And yet when he looked at antibodies ag ainst measles and rubella , these were elevated in the children with autism. In summary, at this stage what we have is a novel intestinal dis ease in these children consistent with a viral etiology, and at least the suggestion of a measles vi rus source that needs to be resolved in follow-up studies. MMR How do we determine whether the associa tion between MMR vaccine and autism is causal or not? One way is to compare the effect s of different brands of the MMR vaccine to see if there is a systematic difference in the pattern of autism among brands. In the UK, unlike the US, three brands of the MMR vaccine were introduced simultaneously in 1988: MMR2, Pluserix, and Imravax. The adve rse reaction profiles of the th ree vaccines were different-- indeed, two of them were withdrawn because they caused meningitis due to the particular strain of the mumps virus. So given that the differe nt brands of MMR had different adverse reaction profiles, we were able to form the hypothesis that if there is no relation between MMR and autism, there should be no systematic differe nces between MMR vaccine brand and autism phenotype, recovery, and associated features su ch as immune status, bowel disease, and persistence of the measles virus. In fact Pluserix, the vaccine that was withdrawn, was asso ciated with a significantly greater risk of measles virus persistence as detected by TaqMan PCR in both the bowel tissue and in the blood, compared with MMR 2. Plus erix and measles virus persistence were associated with lesser degrees of recovery from autism. The presence of measles virus in the intestine predicted the presence of measles virus in the blood, and the presence of measles virus was also associated with more obvious immunodeficiency. These data suggest that an effect of brand predicts an effect of the vaccine, By way of contrast, I want to draw your a ttention to a study conducted by Dr. Smeeth and colleagues in the UK. They predicted that if MMR were linked to autism, there should be a higher rate of MMR uptake in auti sm cases compared to non-autist ic controls. In a letter to The Lancet in 1992, they stressed the im portance of looking at the regr essive subgroup. Smeeth et al. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 23understood that the key question is whether MMR vaccine exposure is linked to autism of the regressive subtype. However, wh en it came to publication of th eir paper two ye ars later, the subgroup of patients with regression was not identifia ble, because they lumped them all together. The paper fell at the very first hurdle.27 But there was an even more significant probl em--the matched design analysis they chose to use required that if they were going to be able to detect a difference (i f indeed there was a real difference) they would need a wide disparity in MMR vaccine uptake between cases compared with controls. They used a conditional logistic al regression analysis, wh ich works by removing cases and controls with the same exposures. First you take out the matched cases and controls that both got MMR, and then you take out the matc hed cases and controls that did not get MMR, and then you analyze what is left. So rather than having a study of 1,500 children with autism, as we were led to believe, the analysis was act ually conducted on a very small proportion of those cases because of the striking similarity in vaccine uptake between cases and controls\u2014 the study did not have sufficient power to detect a differen ce even if one existed. The authors must have known this from the outset. If an association between MMR and autism genuinely existed, then in order to detect this asso ciation, the study woul d have needed between 8,000 and 40,000 cases of autism, rather than 1,500. The study should never have been published. And yet it is precisely this paper that the British government refers to a nd relies on when they say the investigation of the rela tionship between autism and MMR should be concluded. In summary, many children with developmental disorders have a systemic disease with an underlying and potentially primary inflammatory bowel disease. The disease has the features and characteristics of an infectious cause. In some children with autism, there may be a link between primary GI inflammation and secondary central nervous system immune activation and tissue injury. Plainly there is convergence of biological evidence towards causation. It is far from being there yet, but this is most certa inly not the time to st op looking. My opinion on MMR vaccine safety is shared by Dr. Jefferson whose paper, published in the journal Vaccine , stated, \"The design and reporting of safety out comes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate,\" and \"W e found limited safety of MMR compared to its 27 Smeeth L.

The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 24single-component vaccines from low risk of bias studies.\"28 These are not my words. I am wholly in favor of protecting ch ildren against infectious dise ase with the judicious use of vaccines that are safe and effective. Nonetheless I do believe that with certain vaccines, such as MMR, there were shortcuts ta ken which were imprudent. Mercury What is the role, if any, of mercury in autism? Let me present to you one biologically plausible example of how thimerosal and other toxic exposures might influence the risk of autism in the context of an infectious cause. In the Russian steppes there is a very interesting ground squirrel . This little creature may tell us a great deal about the origin of autism. He carries in his throat the organism for plague (yersinia pestis), and he can live year on year in the steppes carrying this organism in his throat with no problem at all. Just down the road, however, whole colonies of his colleagues di e in annual epidemics of plague. Why is this ag ent benign in some areas and in other areas a pathogen that kills? The Mo scow Institute of Ecology and Evolution put forward the hypothesis that it was act ually the toxic metal c ontent of the forage plants they were eating that pr edicted whether this agent was going to be a harmless freeloader or a killer. They tested this hypothesis in a sixt een-year study and demonstrated precisely that. Where animals were dying, there was an excess of toxic metals and/or a deficiency in metals beneficial to the immune system, compared w ith other areas where the organism was benign. They suggested that the toxic metals interacted with the immune system and turned the plague organism into a pathogen. This was a fascina ting ecological study on the synergistic interaction of potential etiological or causative agents.29 In the laboratory, we see the same thing. Let' s look at mercuric chlori de. Here we see an animal that, by virtue of his genetic makeup, is protected against the pa thological effects of leishmaniasis. But another, w ho is genetically susceptible, de velops immune disease when you give him leishmaniasis; he can't clear the pathog en, and he may die. However if you take this genetically resistant animal and give him sub-toxi c doses of mercuric chloride and then give him 28 Jefferson T, Price D, Demicheli V, Bianco E; Eu ropean Research Program for Improved Vaccine Safety Surveillance (EUSAFEVAC) Project.

Immunology . 2001:23:633- 640. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 25leishmaniasis, he too succumbs to immune disease.30 Interaction between two agents in the environment potentiates the effects of the infectious agent. Thimerosal, the ethylmercury-containing pr eservative recently used in childhood vaccines, produces the same phenomenon in mice. 31 Thimerosal has initial immunosuppressive effects similar to those of methyl mercury. However, in contrast to methyl mercury, thimerosal treatment leads to a second pha se with a strong immunostimulat ion and T-cell dependent IFN- and IL-4 mediated autoimmunity in genetically susceptible mice. And so there it is, it can happen. There is biological coherence. I believe that in these children, for genetic or environmental reasons, the immune system is compromised, which may then lead to an increased risk of an adverse response to a vaccine. Despite the emerging coherence, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) said, \" STOP\u2014no more research regarding thimerosal or vaccines is n ecessary.\" I fail to understand how in heaven's name, faced with those data, th ey could possibly have come to that conclusion. This is an extraordinary situation. 30 Hathaway CA et al Experimental colitis increases blood-b rain barrier permeability in rabbits American Journal of gastrointest liver physiol 1999.276:1174-1180. 31 Havarinasab S, Haggqvist B, Bjorn E, Pollard KM, Hultman P. Immunosuppressive and effects of mice. Toxicol Appl Pharmacol . 2005 Apr 15;204(2):109-21. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 26 The IOM based their position not upon the biologi cal data or the clinical findings that were emerging in affected children, but on the popul ation-based studies that had failed to find an association. Let's look at some of those stud ies (I owe a debt of gratitude to Mark Blaxill for providing this analysis). Let us look first at the prevalence of autism--the number of children affected in the population. Data presented by Dr. Eric Fombonne suggests that th e situation is very confusing and therefore it is uncertain whether the prevalence is rising or not. Dr. Fombonne presents the data by year of publicati on. It is uncertain why one would ever present data by year of publication sin ce it tells you nothing wh atsoever about the population represented in those papers, and inevitably causes confusion. (Fombonne, E.)

That is , a striking upward trend in the prevalence of autism in children born in th e US in the mid to late 1980s and in the UK in the same time period: If alternatively one holds geography constant (looking at, for example, California) and graphs autism by age group, a similarly clear pattern emerge s. Autism is uncommon in twenty-one year olds, but it is becoming increasingly commo n in the younger age groups. (Of course, the numbers fall off in the youngest children, many of whom have not yet been diagnosed.) In this way one can dissect out the true trend in disease prevalence. Let's consider hypotheses that have been put forward to account for the increasing prevalence of autism, and how they have been d ealt with. One of the earliest was the hypothesis of diagnostic oversight (\"We just missed the cas es in the past\"). Seve ral studies have now The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 28examined this issue, and determined that diagnostic oversight cannot account for the rise.32 33 34 35 Then there is the hypothesis of diagnostic substitution. It has been suggested that children are being diagnosed with autism when previously they w ould have been diagnosed with mental retardation. This should lead to a rise in the diagnosis of autism and a diminution of the number of children being diagnosed with mental retardation. Croe n et al. published findings that claimed to demonstrate diagnostic substitution,36 but subsequently had to print a retraction of their interpretation37 after it was clearly demonstrated38 that diagnostic substitution did not account for the changes. What about the possibility that the increase was caused by diagnostic broadening--that we have broadened the diagnostic concept of autism and therefore we're including more children? In fact in 1994 there was what was called a \"corrective narr owing\" of the DSM-IV, the diagnostic criteria, and yet the in cidence or the preval ence of autism has con tinued to increase. Furthermore, the MIND Institute at UC/Davis pub lished a detailed report refuting this theory.39 So these hypotheses have been examined and not one of them has held up to close scrutiny. Primary Inflammatory Bowel Disease? Are we looking at a primary inflammatory bowel disease--a systemic disease that has secondary consequences for neuroimmune system function? Can a primary inflammatory bowel disease lead to secondary activa tion of areas in the brain that are involved in autism? This hypothesis was tested by Martha Welch and coll eagues at Columbia University, who looked at 32 Burd L, Kerbeshian J, Klug MG, McCulloch K.

The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 29an animal model of IBD induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS).40 This is a standard experimental model of inducing intestinal inflammation. In pos t-mortem brain sections, Dr. Welch looked for evidence of imme diate-early gene activation ( Fos), which was increased in certain areas of the brain that are known to be im portant in autism, such as the amygdala. This was not seen in control animals that had saline exposure instead of TNBS. This same model has been used to demonstrate other central nervous sy stem changes in response to primary intestinal inflammation, including increased blood-brain barrier permeability and central autonomic activation that is indepe ndent of the vagus nerve. 41 So in answer to the question: can a primary intestinal inflammation cause secondary brai n activation? The answer is yes. Next question: what might be the conseque nces of such secondary activation in the brain? An important paper in this respect comes from Vargas and colleagues at Johns Hopkins.42 The study looked for evidence of im mune activation in the brain and spinal fluid of patients with autism and in controls. The principal cells of in terest were microglia cells, which form part of the resident innate immune syst em of the brain. Vargas and colleagues showed activation of these cells in areas of neuronal damage. This slide shows contro l cerebellar cortex from a non- diseased post-mortem specimen (A), and tissue from the patient with autism (B), that highlights damage to the Purkinje cell layer of the brain in association with adjacent microglial activation. This HLA-DR molecule (C) expressed on the surface of microglia is a marker of activation of the resident innate immune system: 40 Welch MG, Welch-Horan TB, Anwar M, Anwar N, Ludwig RJ, Ruggiero DA.

Neuroglial activation and neuroinflammation in the brain of patients with autism. Ann Neurol . 2005 Jan;57(1):67-81. The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 30The source of the activation of the microglia was not evident; nor was there evidence of infiltration of the brain by inflammatory or i mmune cells from the blood. However, what they found in the spinal fluid were high levels of certain inflamma tory cytokines, including IFN- , derived from lymphocytes. Yet there were no ly mphocytes in the brain tissue and no excess of the cells in the spinal fluid. The conclusion of Vargas and colleagues, and indeed our own conclusion, is that the cytokine s are coming from somewhere else . Vargas did not consider a source outside the central nervous system. (Ir onically, in the very same week that they published, we also published a paper in the Journal of Clinical Immunology showing these same cytokines coming from the inflamed intestine.43) Is it possible that what we are observing is a systemic in flammatory response from the intestine leading to secondary immune activation in the brain, and cell damage? We've seen this before, in celiac disease--a primary immunopathol ogy of the intestinal mu cosa associated with an allergic sensitivity to gluten. Celiac disease is associated with a wi de variety of secondary neurological complications, includ ing autistic behavior, dementia, peripheral neuritis, focal and generalized seizures, an d cerebral calcification.44 Celiac disease provides a perfect example of a primary gut disease leading to secondary brain damage. Placing patients on a gluten-free diet may lead to some amelioration of these neurological features. Convergence and Consolidation Finally, what we have at this stage in autism research is peer-reviewed, published literature demonstrating a converg ence of biological findings concerning a possible mechanism and cause in some children. We've known for so me time, both anecdotally and from one single- blind, randomized, controlled study45 that a gluten-free diet can produce amelioration of behavioral symptoms in children w ith developmental disorders. Wh ile this may be related to an opioid phenomenon, we are also aw are, from the work of Dr. Jyonouchi at UNJMD, that peripheral blood immune cells of these children are hyper-responsiv e to peptides derived from 43 Ashwood P, Anthony A, Torrente F, Wakefield AJ., Spontaneous mucosal lymphocyte cytokine profiles in children with regressive autism and gastrointestinal symptoms: Mucosal immune activation and reduced counter regulatory interleukin-10. of Clinical Immunology . 2004:24:664-673.

The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 31gluten and milk proteins, in terms of pro-inflammatory cytokine production.46 47 48 This finding was particularly the case in autistic children wi th gastrointestinal symptoms, and it provides a further biological rationale for the efficacy of a gl uten-free, casein-free di et in such children. Data from the laboratory of Jill James and colleagues from the University of Arkansas indicate that there is oxidative stress in thes e children, associated with depletion of reduced glutathione.49 Then we have the observation that a prim ary inflammation of the intestine, as seen in celiac and TNBS-induced colitis, can produce sec ondary brain changes, a nd finally there is the Vargas study showing neuroglial activation in the brain. And so you can see that although science, like nature, appears to abhor consensus (preferring diversity, at lead initially), there is a growing consensus and consolidation of information, a coherence about what appears to be happening in these children with autism: intestinal immunopathology, a proinflammatory cy tokine profile, a hyperi mmune response to dietary proteins, dysbiosis, autoimmune phe nomena, and possible opioid toxicity. From the historical perspec tive we have a body of evid ence supporting an association between measles virus and deve lopmental disorders, including autism. We also have the demonstration of an abnormal immune response to the measles virus, and more recently, in Medical Veritas ,50 the demonstration that in children who have had two shots of the MMR vaccine instead of just one, the bowel disease is worse\u2014in other words, we see a biological gradient effect in these children. But as we know, causation is rarely simple. More work is needed. So, where is the seat of the soul--in the bowel or the brain? It's the wrong question and always was. This little boy holds the answer. He looks extremely well now (left), and he is 46 Jyonouchi H, Sun S, Itokazu N.

His mother instinctively knew he was suffering, yet could no t convince anyone in the medical profession to respond appropriately. Because his mother trea ted his underlying gastrointestinal disease appropriately and diligently (by a special exclusi on diet) we now have the Superman that you see on the left. This child is the seat of soul - the soul of this Nation. So I appeal to the conscience of this gr eat country: unless we take this sufficiently seriously, unless we address this issue now, unless we prevent th e subversion of the scientific process in favor of political and financial expedien ts, then we are in terrible trouble. Vaccination policy is nothing more than words on paper w ithout public confiden ce. If we undermine confidence in the vaccination program by sticki ng our heads in the sand, then we have done children everywhere a huge disservice. Autism is a national economic and spiritual emer gency, one that will tear the very fabric of society if we let it. It is a world emergency, and we need to start treating it as such. I leave The Seat of the Soul: the Orig ins of the Autism Epidemic 33you with the words of Ronald Reagan, who said \"...government is never more dangerous than when our desire to have it help us blinds us to its power to harm us.\" In this instance, I, for one, take that to heart.
