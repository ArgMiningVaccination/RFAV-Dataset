She believes in the body's ability to heal itself and that detoxification is a lifestyle practice, not a protocol. Lauren has worked with many different healers and practitioners on her own journey, learning the importance of the mind-body connection, and believes the root cause of our body's imbalances begins with trauma and stored negative emotions. Lauren has years of experience healing herself from an eating disorder, poor mental health, and various autoimmune responses within her body such as chronic fatigue, chronic inflammation, IBS, hypothyroidism, and 'leaky gut'. She now acts as a guide for individuals on their own health journey by holding their hand every step of the way to a more empowered, intuitive, and fulfilling life filled with laughter and joy. "}
