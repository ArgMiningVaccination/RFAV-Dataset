I have been working with adults and children during and after their cancer therapy for over 20 years. Prior to working at Fred Hutch, I worked first as an acupuncturist, then served as program manager for the Integrative Therapies Program at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. As a long-time educator, I am deeply committed to helping acupuncturists learn about the unique considerations and best practices for safe and effective care for cancer patients and survivors. My research and interests are in studies that will contribute to expanded access for patients to utilize East Asian medicine during all phases of cancer treatment and survivorship. Outside of work, I enjoy practicing internal martial arts and spending time with my friends and family. My clinical approach is rooted in the principles and theories of East Asian medicine and informed by advances in biomedical research.
