It is important to utilize Network benefits whenever possible in order to receive the maximum benef it available to you. Medical : The Blue Options Network is where you will find preferred providers for in -network medical services. 1. Network Care Network care is care You receive from Providers in the program 's Network.

However, Your Benefits will be paid at lower, Non -Network levels. If You go to a Florida Blue Traditional indemnity Provider that is not in the PPO Network, You may have less of a financial obligation than going to a Non-Network Provider that does not participate in any Florida Blue Network.

If You receive a Covered S ervice from a Network Provider they will submit the Claim on Your behalf. Pre-Service Claim - This is a request for Precertificati on or prior approval of a Covered Service , which under the terms of Your coverage , must be approved before You receive the Covered Service. All Inpatient Services at a Hospital or other facilit y must be Pre -certified. A Network Provider will take care of the Pre -Service Claim. If You use a Non -Network Provider , You are responsible to submit the Pre -Service Claim. In order to ensure that the proposed elective treatment you are scheduling is a co vered expense, your doctor can request a Voluntary Pre -Service Review in order to help you make better -informed decisions. These are non-life-threatening -non-emergency services that may not be covered under the ICUBA Plan. By asking your doctor to reques t a pre -service review, you'll know in advance the costs you may be responsible for. Together you and your doctor or health care provider can choose the best approach for your individual needs. Some of the procedures available for pre -service review incl ude breast reduction mammoplasty, rhinoplasty, and TMJ surgery. Ask your doctor beforehand! Urgent Care Claim - This is a Pre-Service Claim that, if decided within the time periods established for making a non-Urgent Care Pre -Service Claim decision could seriously jeopardize Your life, health , or ability to regain maximum function or, in the opinion of a Physician with knowledge of Your medical condition, would subject You to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the service. Post -Service Claim - This is a request for payment or reimbursement of the charges or costs associated with a Covered Service that You have already received. These are typical Claims. If You use a Network Provider , Post-Service Claims will be submitted by the Provider. If You use a Non -Network Provider , You will be responsible for submitting the Post -Service Claim. 18 Experimental or Investigative - The use of any Experimental or I nvestigative treatment, service, procedure, facility, equipment, drug, device , or supply ( collectively, I ntervention) that is determined by The Plan to not be medically effective for the condition being treated will not be c overed. The Plan will consider an Intervention to be Experimental or Investigative if: (1) the Intervention does not have FDA approval to be marketed for the sp ecific relevant indication(s); (2) available scientific evidence does not permit conclusions con cerning the effect of the Intervention on health outcomes; (3) the Intervention is not proven to be as safe and as effective in achieving an outcome equal to or exceeding the outcome of alternative therapies; (4) the Intervention does not improve health ou tcomes; or (5) the Intervention is not proven to be applicable outside the research setting. If an Intervention, as defined above, is determined to be Experimental or I nvestigative at the time of the service, it will not receive retroactive coverage, even if it is found to be in accordance with the above criteria at a later date. The Plan recognizes that situations may occur when You elect to pursue Experimental or Investigative treatment. If You are to receive a service that The Plan may con sider to be Experimental or Investigative, You or the Hospital and/or Provider may contact Florida Blue's Member Service (1-800-955-5692 ), Care Consultant Team (1-888-476-2227), MHNet Behavioral Health Services (1 -877-398-5816) or Cata maran Clinical Services (1-877-665-6609) to determine whether The Plan considers such service to be Experimental or Investigative. If The Plan determines the treatment is Experimental or Investigative, the treatment will not be covered. Health Dialog\u00ae - A 24 -hour health care assistance number for access to nurses who provide health education and support services is 1 -877-789-2583. Medically Necessary and Appropriate - Services or supplies provided by a Provider are Medically Necessary and Appropriate if The Plan determines they are: ( 1) appropriate for the symptoms and diagnosis or treatment of Your condition, Illness, disease or Injury ; (2) provided for the diagnosis or the direct care and treatment of Your condition, Illness, disease or Injury; ( 3) provided in accordance with standards of good medical practice; ( 4) not primarily for Your or Your Provider's convenience; and ( 5) the most app ropriate level of service or supply that can safely be provided to You. When applied to hospitalization, this further means that You require acute care as an Inpatient due to the nature of the services that must be rendered for Your condi tion, and You cannot receive safe or adequate care as an Outpatient . The Plan reserves the right to determine, in its sole judgment, whether a service is Medically Necessary and Appropriate. No Benefits will be provided unless The Plan determines that the service or supply is Medically Necessary and Appropriate. Precertification - This is t he process through which certain services are pre -approved by Florida Blue or MHNet Behavioral Health and the Covered Person is covered for services. All Inpatient services at a Hospital or other facilit y must be Pre -certified by calling the Florida Blue's Admission Notification at 1 -800-955-5692. All Inpatient services at a Behavioral or Substance Abuse facility must be Pre -certified by calling MHNet at 1 -877-398-5816 . In order to be Pre -certified for Inpatient Adult Rehabilitation for a substance -related disorder, demonstration of alternative levels of care such as partial hospitalization must have been attempted and relapse has occurred within 6 months of You or Your dependent's active participation in such a program. Some drugs may require prior authorization through Cata maran . You can determine whether prior authorization is required by calling Cata maran at 1-800-207-2568. Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Program - This is a program that does not require the selection of a Primary Care Physician , but is based on a Provider Network made up of Physicians, Specialists, Hospitals and other health care facilities. Using this Provider Network helps ensure that Covered Persons receive maximum coverage for eligible services. All ICUBA medical p lans are PPO s. 19 Benefit Period: April 1, 2015 - March 31, 2016 Benefits PPO 70 Network PPO 70 Non -Network Preferred PPO Network Preferred PPO Non-Network 80/20% after Deductible 60/40% after Deductible Lifetime Maximum No maximum No maximum Out-of-Pocket Maximum s (includes deductible, coinsurance and Family Practice, Pediatrician , OB/GYN ) 100% after $20 Co -payment ;

This means that a Covered Person or Provider is required to call the Precertification Provider number on the Participant ID Card ( 1-800-955-5692 for Medical; 1-877-398-5816 for Behavioral Health ). The purpose of a Precertification is to determine (1) that an Inpatient stay in the Hospital or other facility service is Medically Necessary and not Experimental or Investigative ; (2) that the facility is the appropriate facility for the service ; and (3) the standard length of stay allowed for the condition. CAUTION Please remember that Precertification does not verify a Covered Person's eligibility for Benefits nor guarantee payment of Benefits under the Plan. It is in the Covered Person's best interest to go through the Precertification process in order to ensure Medical Necessity and appropriateness of care. Precertification does not constitute a guarantee or warranty of the qu ality of the m edical treatment that a Covered Person will receive . Actual payment of Benefits is governed by the Plan's terms, conditions, limitations , and exclusions . Please note that a Precertification Claim may be an Urgent Care Claim and will be h andled as set forth in Article Thirteen - the Claims and Appeals Procedure Section . To determine that care will be provided in the appropriate setting, Florida Blue , MHNet or its designated agent administers a care utilization review program comprised of prospective, concurrent , and/or retrospective reviews. In addition, Florida Blue , MHNet or its designated agent assists Hospitals with discharge planning. These activities are conducted via phone or on -site by a Care Coordinator working with a Physician advisor. Here is a brief description of these review procedures: 5.01 PROSPECTIVE REVIEW Prospective review, also known as Precertificatio n or pre -service review, begins upon receipt of treatment information. After receiving the request for care, Florida Blue , MHNet or its designated agent: a. reviews available information regarding the Covered Person's eligibility for coverage and/or availab ility of Benefits; b. reviews the information provided, including patient demographics, diagnosis, and plan of treatment; c. assesses whether care is Medically Necessary and Appropriate ; d. determines whether the proposed treatment is Experimental or Investigative ; e. authorizes care or refers the request to a Physician advisor for determination; and f. assigns an appropriate length of stay for Inpatient admission. 25 5.02 CONCURRENT REVIEW Concurrent review may occur during the course of on -going treatment and is used to assess the Medical Necessity and A ppropriateness of the length of stay and level of care Florida Blue , MHNet or its designated agent: a. reviews Your progress and ongoing treatment plan with the fac ility staff; and b. decides, when necessary, to either: extend Your care; offer an alternative level of care; or refer to the Physician advisor for a decision. 5.03 DISCHARGE PLANNING Discharge planning is a process that begins prior to Your scheduled Hospital admission. Working with You, Your family, Your attending Physician (s) and Hospital staff, Florida Blue , MHNet or its designated agent will help plan for and coordinate Your discharge to ensure that You receive safe and uninterrupted care when needed at the time of Your discharge. In planning for discharge, Florida Blue , MHNet or its designated agent assesses Your : a. level of function pre - and post -admission; b. ability to perform self -care; c. primary caregiver and support system; d. living arrangements pre - and post -admission; e. special equipment, medication, dietary needs , and safety needs; f. obstacles to care; g. need for referral to Care Con sultant or condition management; and h. psychological needs. 5.04 RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW Retrospective review may occur when a service or procedure has bee n rendered without the required Precertification . 5.05 CARE CONSULTANT SERVICES You are not alone when recovering from an Illness or Injury - Care Consultants can help. When You are recovering from a Hospital admission, experiencing multiple medical problems , or facing catastrophic needs, You want to be able to concentrate on dealing with Your health needs so that You can relax and recover. However, You have to schedule follow -up visits, fill Prescription Drugs, and perhaps arrange Therapy. Care Consultants can assist You in ensuring that the necessary steps are in place for Your treatment and recovery. Care Consultants work with You and Your family, caregiver s, and health care Providers to help You recover to the fullest extent possible. Care Co nsultant s are professionals who can offer assistance if You are planning a hospitalization, are being discharged from a Hospital , or have been advised that You have a condition that will require additional treatment. Care Consultants provide educational support and coordination of care (such as Home Health Ca re or Durable Medical Equipment) and can assist in the coordination and resolution of administrative iss ues, as well as assist You in determ ining the cost of a procedure across various settings . 26 Should You experience a serious Injury or Illness, or need hospitalization or assistance in coordinating Your care needs, the Care Coordination pro gram will provide assistance. The Care Consultants will: a. work collaboratively with You, Your family or significant others, and all Your Providers to coordinate and implement a plan of care which meets Your holistic needs; b. help identify community -based support and educational services to assist with Your ongoing health care needs; c. assist in the Coordination of Benefits and alternative resources; and d. assist with discharge planning and care o nce You have been released from the Hospital. The Care Consultants may be reach ed by calling 1-888-476-2227 . 5.06 CARE COORDINATOR NURSE When You are scheduling a n Inpatient Hospital admission or if You have had an Inpatient Hospital admission, You will be contacted by a Care Coordinator to (1) ensure that You have received and understand Your Discharge instructions and have obtained Your Prescription Drugs , (2) coordinate any additional services You may require, and (3) explain what to expect durin g Your recovery. Care Coordinators can also be of assistance if You are in need of more complex care issues, are newly diagnosed with a debilitati ng Illness or Injury, or have multiple medical problems or end -of-life issues. Care Coordinators assist You in understanding Your Plan and can help You (1) with financial issues, (2) obtain a Home Health Care Provider, (3) get in touch with valuable community resources, or (4) coordinate a plan for Your care. The Care Coordinators will keep in touch with You on a regular basis to follow up on Your condition and answer any questions You may have about Claims or Plan Benefits. Care Coordinators are available at no cost to Plan Participants. If You would benefit from Care Coordination , You will be contacted as pa rt of the Plan's outreach program. The program is completely confidential and no information will be shared with Your Employer. You are also free to request Care Coordination assistance by calling 1-877-789-2583 for Medical or 1 -877-398-5816 for Behavioral Health/Substance Abuse . 5.07 UTILIZATION REVIEW P ROCESS INFORMATION a. Authorized Representatives You have the right to designate an authorized representative to file or pursue a request for Precertification or other Pre -Service Claim on Your behalf. The Plan reserves the right to establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on Your behalf. Procedures adopted by The Plan will, in the case of an Urgent Care Claim, permit a Physician or other Professional Provider with knowledge of Your medical condition to act as Your authorized representative. You will need to complete a HIPAA Authorization form in order to have informat ion released to a third -party. This form can be accessed by logging onto http://icubabenefits.org . 27 b. Decisions Involving Requests for Precertification and Other Non -Urgent Care Pre -Service Claims You will receive written notice of any decision on a request for Precertification or other Pre -Service Claim, whether the decision is adverse or not, within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the medical circumstances involved . Such period of time will not exceed 15 days from the date Florida Blue or MHNet receives the Claim from You or Your Provider . However, this 15 -day period of time may be extended one time by Florida Blue or MHNet for an additional 15 days, provi ded that Florida Blue or MHNet determines that the additional time is necessary due to matters outside its control, and notifies You of the extension prior to the expiration of the initial 15-day Pre -Service Claim determination period. If an extension of time is nec essary because You failed to submit information necessary for Florida Blue or MHNet to make a decision on Your Pre-Service Claim, the notice of extension that is sent to You will specifically describe the information that You must submit. In this event, You will have 45 days in which to submit the information before a decision is made on Your Pre-Service Claim. c. Decisions Involving Urgent Care Claims 1. If Your request involves an Urgent Care Claim, Florida Blue or MHNet will make a decision on Your request as soon as possible, taking into account the medical exigencies involved. You will receive notice of the decision that has been made on Your Urgent Care Claim no later than 72 hours following receipt of the Claim from Y ou or Your Provider . 2. If Florida Blue or MHNet determines in connection with an Urgent Care Claim that You have not provided sufficient information to determine whether or to what extent Benefits are provided under Your coverage, You will be notified of the specific information needed to complete Your Claim within 24 hours following Florida Blue's or MHNet's receipt of the Claim. You will then be given no less than 48 hours to provide the specific information to Florida Blue or MHNet . Florida Blue or MHNet will thereafter notify You of its determination on Your Claim as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the earlier of ( A) its receipt of the additional specific information, or ( B) the date Florida Blue or MHNet informed You that it must receive the additional specific information. 3. In those cases where Your Urgent Care Claim request seeks to extend a previously approved course of treatment and is made at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the previously approved cours e of treatment, the timeframe may be shortened. In such a situation, Florida Blue or MHNet will notify You of its decision concerning Your Urgent Care Claim to extend th e course of treatment not later than 24 hours following receipt of Your request. d. Notice s of Determination Involving Precertification Requests and Other Pre -Service Claims Any time Your request for Precertification or any other Pre -Service Claim is approved, You will be notified in writing tha t the request has been approved. If Your request for Precertification or approval of any other Pre-Service Claim has been denied, You will receive written notification of that denial which will include, among other items, the specific reason or reasons for the Adverse Benefit Decision and a statement describing Your right to file an appeal. You may only file an appeal once the Claim has been incurred.

Individuals can enroll in a Medicare Prescription Drug plan when they first become eligible for Medicare and each year from October 15 through December 7 . Beneficiaries leaving Employer coverage may be eligible for a Special Enrollment period to sign up for a Medicare Prescription D rug program.

You should also know that if You drop or lose coverage with the Plan and don't enroll in Medicare Prescription Drug coverage after Your current cover age ends, You may pay a penalty to enroll in Medicare Prescription D rug coverage later.

If You are age 65 or o lder and A ctively at Work , You may elect not to be covered under the Plan . In such case, Medicare will be Your only coverage. If You choose this option, You will not be eligible for any Benefits under the Plan nor will You be offered r etiree coverage if Your age and years of service would have otherwise made You eligible for retiree coverage unless You are a Participant in the Plan three months before You retire. d. If You are Actively at Work , Your spouse has the same choices for Benefit c overage as indicated above for an Employee age 65 or older. e. Regardless of the choice made by You or Your spouse, each one of You should apply for Medicare Part A coverage about three months prior to turning age 65. If You choose the Plan as primary, You may wait to enroll in Medicare Part B . You will be able to enroll in Medicare Part B later during special enrollment periods without penalty. 44 III. The ICUBA Prescription Drug B enefit is Creditable Coverage , which means that You will r eceive credit towards Medicare Part D upon Your retirement if You choose to e nroll in Medicare Part D. Creditable Coverage means that the amount the Plan expects to pay on average for Prescription Drugs for individuals covered under the Plan in the applica ble year is the same or more than what standard Medicare Prescription Drug coverage would be expected to pay on average. This is important because t he Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) imposes a late enrollment penalty on individuals who do not maintain Cr editable Coverage for a period of 63 days or longer following their initial enrollment period for the Medicare Part D P rescription Drug benefit. MMA mandates that certain entities offering Prescription Drug coverage, including employer and union group health plan sponsors, disclose to all Medicare eligible individuals with Prescription Drug coverage under the plan whether such coverage is \"creditable \". This information is essential to an individual 's deci sion whether to enroll in a Medicare Part D Prescription Drug plan. The Plan pays for other health expenses in addition to Prescription D rugs. If You or Your Dependent enroll in a Medicare Part D P rescription Drug plan, You and Your eligible Dependents wi ll still be able to receive all of Your current health and Prescription Drug benefits under this Plan . 7.02 DEPENDENT ENROLLMENT AND ELIGIBILITY a. Initial Enrollment. If an Employee enrolls a Dependent within 3 0 days of his or her date of hire, the Dependent's Effective Date shall be the same day as the Participant 's Effective Date. If You Terminate Employment and are rehired within 60 days of Your Date Of Termination , Your Depe ndent 's Benefits shall be reinstated, effective as of Your date of Termination Of Employment and there shall be no break in coverage. You will be responsible for paying the required contributions toward the cost of coverage for Your Dependent(s) during th e period beginning on Your date of Termination Of Employment and ending on the date that coverage is subsequently reinstated . b. Participant or Dependent Contributions . A Participant or Dependent may be required to make periodic contributions toward the cost of coverage under the Plan in an amount determined by the Employer or the Plan Administrator. The amount of the respective contributions shall be set forth in notices from the Plan Administrator, and may be changed from time to time by ICUBA. 7.03 SPECIAL ENROLLMENT The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA ) provides special enrollment opportunities for certain events . If an Employee or the Employee's Dependents are eligible to participate in the Plan, but are not already enrolled in the Plan, the Employee may request Special Enrollment mid -Plan Year (4/1 - 3/31) upon either (1) the loss of other group health plan coverage or (2) the addition of a new Dependent; provided, however, that the Plan is notified of the Special Enrollment request within 3 0 days of the event. The special enrollment rights provided by HIPPA rules include the right to select among all of the benefit options available under the Plan. For example, if an employee 's spouse loses other coverage and qualifies for special enrollment, the employee may add the spouse to the plan and also may elect to switch to another benefits option under the Plan. Similarly, when a covered employee marries, the employee may not only ad d his or her new spouse to the Plan, the employee may select among the plan's coverage options. a. Loss of Other Group Health Plan Coverage . An Employee or Dependent who is eligible to participate in the Plan, but not enrolled in the Plan, may enroll if the Employee or Dependent was covered under another group health plan or had health insurance coverage at the time he or she became eligible for coverage under this Plan; and 45 The other coverage of the Employee or Dependent ended because: A. The other coverage was COBRA Continuation Coverage that was exhausted. COBRA Continuation Coverage is considered exhausted when it ceases for any reason other than the person's failure to pay premiums on a timely basis or for improper or illegal acts (such as making a fra udulent claim or an intentional misrepresentation); or B. The other health coverage was not COBRA Continuation Coverage and was terminated due to either a loss of eligibility for the coverage ( i.e., due to legal separation, divorce, death, termination of employment, or reduction in the number of hours of employment) or because employer contributions for the other coverage were terminated or significant cost Increase or Decrease occur . An individual will not have Special Enrollment rights if the other cove rage ended due to the individual's failure to pay premiums on a timely basis or for cause ( e.g., such as making fraudulent claims or intentional misrepresentations). b. Newly -Acquired Dependents 1. An Employee's newly -acquired Dependents may enroll in t he Plan if: (i) the Employee is a Participant in this Plan or, if not a Participant at the time, the Employee has met the waiting period applicable to becoming a Participant and is eligible to be enrolled under this Plan; and (ii) the person becomes a Depe ndent of the Employee through marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption (this included foster children and/or other children in court -ordered custody of the Employee). 2. If the Employee is not yet a Participant, the Employee must enroll during th e Special Enrollment Period in order for the newly acquired Dependent to be eligible for coverage. In the case of birth or adoption of a child, the spouse of the covered Employee may be enrolled as a Dependent of the covered Employee if the spouse is elig ible for coverage. The Special Enrollment Period is a period of not more than 3 0 days that begins on the date of the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. 3. The coverage of the Employee or Dependent enrolled during the Special Enrollment Period will be effective: (i) in the case of marriage, from the date of marriage; (ii) in the case of a Dependent's birth, as of the date of birth; (iii) in the case of a Dependent's adoption or placement for adoption, the date of the adoption or placement for adoption; (iv) in the case of foster children, as of the date of placement in the residence; and (v) in the case of children in court -ordered custody of the Employee, as of the date of the order; provided, however, that in each case, the individual is enrolled within 3 0 days of becoming eligible for such enrollment and the Employee substantiates within that timeframe by providing the necessary documentation to the Plan Administrator or Employer. 4. If a Dependent is acquired other than at the time of bir th, due to a court order, decree, or marriage, that Dependent will be considered a Dependent from the date of such court order, decree, or marriage, provided that this new Dependent is properly enrolled as a Dependent within 3 0 days of the court order, dec ree, or marriage and proof of the court order, decree, or marriage is provided to the Plan Administrator or Employer within that timeframe. In order to change benefits mid-Plan Year (4/1 -3/31) due to a Special Enrollment event, You must complete, sign, and return an application to Your Employer or enroll online at http://icubabenefits.org within 30 days after the date of the event . You must provide the Plan Administrator or Your Employer with documentation substantiating the event within the same 3 0-day period . Once You have provided substantiation of the event, You and/or Your Dependents (as applicable) shall be enrolled in the Plan, effective as of the dates set forth above. 46 VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: Actual enrollment is necessary for a newborn, adopted child, child placed for adoption, foster child, or other child in court -ordered custody to be covered under the Plan. This means that You must obtain, complete, sign, and return a new enrollment form or make Your election online to add a newborn, adopted child, foster child, or other child in court -ordered custody to the Plan and provide substantiation. If you fail to complete, sign, and return an enrollment form within 30 -days after the Special Enrollm ent event, the Dependent will not have coverage or be able to enroll in the Plan until the next Open Enrollment (unless a subsequent Special Enrollment event or Change in Status event occurs). Claims for maternity expenses or maternity leave do not cons titute notification or enrollment of a new Dependent for coverage. If you do not enroll Your Dependent within 3 0 days from the date of the Special Enrollment event, Your Dependent will not be covered under the Plan and will not have coverage for any conditions other than for the charges covered under the maternity coverage of a newborn's mother. 7.04 CHANGE IN STATUS I. Once enrollment elections are made, either during the initial or Special Enrollment periods or during the annual Open Enrollment per iod, those elections may not be changed and will remain in effect for the entire Plan Year. However, there are some important mid -Plan Year exceptions: a. Change in Status. Employees may revoke or modify their enrollment elections mid -Plan Year only if the y experience a Change in Status that affects their or their Dependent's eligibility under this Plan. An election change will be approved only if it is consistent with the Change in Status. An election change is \"consistent with\" a Change in Status if the change is both the result of, and corresponds with, the Change in Status. For example, if a child ceases to be eligible for coverage because of age, it would be consistent with the Change in Status to drop coverage for the child. However, it would not b e consistent with the Change in Status to drop coverage for the Employee. b. Change in Cost or Coverage. If the cost of Benefits increases or decreases during a Plan Year, the Plan Sponsor may automatically change Employee premium contributions. When the change in cost is significant, Employees will be given the opportunity to either increase their contrib utions or elect a less-costly option (if available). If there is a significant overall reduction in the Plan's coverage, Employees may elect another benefit option (if available). If a new Benefit option is added under the Plan, Employees will have the r ight to change their election to the new Benefit option. c. Qualified Medical Child Support Order (\"QMCSO\") or Qualified Domestic Relations Order (\"QDRO\"). A child may become eligible for coverage as set forth in a Qualified Medical Child Support Order or Qualified Domestic Relations Order. An Employee may change his or her Plan enrollment elections if the Employee becomes subject to a QMCSO or a QDRO that requires the Employee to provide (or cancel) health care coverage for the Dependent child; provided, h owever, that the Plan Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine whether a medical child support order and/or domestic relations order is qualified and for administering the provision of Benefits under the Plan pursuant to a QMCSO and/or QDRO. The Plan Administrator may seek clarification and modification of the order, up to and including, the right to seek a hearing before the court or agency, which issued the order. 47 ERISA Section 206(d)(3)(B) defines the term Qualified Domestic Relations O rder as a domestic relations order , which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the Benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and which meets the requirements of ERISA Section 206 (d)(3)(C) and (D). The term domestic relations order is defined in ERISA Section 206(d)(3)(B)(ii) as any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement), which relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child or other Dependent of a participant, and is made pursuant to a state domestic relations law (including a community property law). The term alte rnate payee is defined by ERISA Section 206(d)(3)(K) to mean any spouse, former spouse, child or other Dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the Benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant. d. Entitlement to Medicare or Medicaid. An Employee may change his or her elections for Plan coverage if the Employee or any Dependent becomes entitled to or loses Medicare or Medicaid coverage. In such cases, an emp loyee shall be given 60 days for this special enrollment period. e. Change in coverage under another employer plan . An employee may make a prospective election change that is on account of and corresponds with a change made under another employer plan (including a plan of the Policyholder or of another employer) if: 1. The other cafeteria plan or qualified benefits plan permits participants to make an election change that would be permitted under the applicable provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 125; or 2. The cafeteria plan permits participants to make an election for a period of coverage that is different from the period of coverage under the other cafeteria plan or qualified benefits plan. f. Loss of coverage under other group health coverage . An employee may make an election on a prospective basis to add coverage under the group policy/plan for the employee or employee's dependent if such employee or dependent loses coverage under any group health coverage sponsored by a governmental or educationa l institution, including a: 1. State children's health insurance program under Title XXI of the Social Security Act; 2. Medical care program of an Indian Tribal government , the Indian Health Service, or a tribal organization; 3. A State health benefits risk pool; or 4. A foreign government group health plan. In such cases, an employee shall be given 60 days for this special enrollment period. II. If an Employee experiences an event that allows the Employee to make a mid -Plan Year enrollment change, the Employee must enroll online at http: //icubabenefits.org or submit a completed enrollment change form to the Employer no later than 3 0 days after the event occurs , except for sections (d) and (f) above . If the Employee does not request the coverage change within the specified time limit, the Employee will lose the right to make a change allowed by that event. If approved, the Employee's enrollment change(s) shall take effect on the date of the event . 48 Consistency Rule : In all cases, any election change as a result of any change in status must be on account of and correspond with a change in status that affects eligibility for coverage under the plan. For example, if the change in status is the employee's divorce, annulment or legal separation from a spouse, the death of a spouse or dependent child, or a dependent ceasing to satisfy the eligibility requirements for coverage, an employee's election to cancel health coverage will apply only to the spouse involved in the divorce, annulment or legal separation, th e deceased spouse or dependent child, or the dependent that ceased to satisfy the eligibility requirements. 7.05 TERMINATION OF COVERAGE A Participant's and/or covered Dependent's coverage under the Plan shall terminate on the earliest of the following dates : a. The date on which the Participant Terminates Employment with the Employer unless the Employer is obligated to continue to make contributions on behalf of the Participant by terms of an employment agreement; b. The da te on which the Participant ceases to be eligible for the Plan due to a reduction in his or her number of hours of employment ; c. The date on which the Participant loses his or her status as a Participant, or a Dependent loses his or her status as a Covered Dependent ; d. The date on which the Participant ceases to be in a class eligible for coverage ; e. The date on which this Plan is terminated (or in the case of any Benefit under this Plan, the date of termination of the specific benefit) ; f. The date following the date the Participant dies; provided, however, that any Covered Dependent may remain a Dependent for the applicable period of COBRA Continuation Coverage set forth in Article Eight , provided that the Covered Dependent complies with th e conditions therein ; g. The date the Participant, while on an y Approved Leave of Absence , including Approved Disability Leave, or Approved Sabbatical, becomes employed full -time by another employer, or fails to return from such Approved Leave of Absence within 12 months of the date the Approved Leave of Absence commenced ; h. The date the Participant fails to timely pay any required contributions; in such case, coverage shall terminate on the last date for which the required contributions were paid by the Employer and or Employee, as the case may be, and as determined by the Plan Administrator ; i. The date that the Participant fails to return from a leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 after the maximum period allowed under the Act has expired; j. The date that the Participant fails to return from a Leave of Absence under the Uniformed Se rvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 after the maximum period allowed under the Act has expired; or 49 k. The date the Participant's request to revoke or modify coverage due to a Change in Status is approved. The Participant must notify the Plan Administrator or Employer of a Change in Status, either in writing or online, within 3 0 days of the Change in Statu s. Coverage is terminated on the last day of employment, or on the effective date of the Change in Status. If coverage is terminated during Open Enrollment, coverage terminates on the last day of the month of the Benefit Plan Year (4/1 -3/31). 7.06 LATE ENROLLEES Late Enrollees may enroll in the Plan only during Open Enrollment as set forth in the Open Enrollment Section . The Effective Date of the Late Enrollee's coverage is the first day of the Plan Year (4/1 -3/31) following enrollment. 7.07 THE GENETIC INFORMATION NON DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2008 (GINA) GINA prohibits discrimination in group health plan coverage based on genetic info rmation. GINA provides that group health plans cannot base premiums for an employee or group of similarly situated individuals on genetic information. GINA also prohibits plans from requesting or requiring an individual to undergo a genetic test. There i s a research exception that permits a plan to request but not require that a participant or beneficiary undergo a genetic test. GINA also restricts the Plan from collecting genetic information (including family medical history) prior to or in connection w ith enrollment. Under GINA, the Plan is generally prohibited from offering rewards in return for collection of genetic information, including family medical history collected as part of a Personal Health Assessment ( PHA). The Plan will not discriminate a gainst participants or beneficiaries eligible to participate in the Plan's wellness programs and do not require individuals to meet any standards related to a health factor in order to obtain a reward, as specified in 29 CFR 2590.702(f)(2)(iii). Rewards f or completion of a PHA are available whether or not the individual answers the questions regarding genetic information (e.g., family history). If it is unreasonably difficult due to a medical condition for You to achieve the standards of the reward by attend ing a health fair under this program , call ICUBA at 1-866-377-5102 and we will work with You to develop another way to qualify for the reward. 7.08 OPEN ENROLLMENT The Plan shall conduct an Open Enrollment each year. During Open Enrollment, Participants may make any of the following changes regarding participation in the Plan, subject to other governing provisions of this Plan Document. a. Enroll as a Late Enrollee; b. Add Dependents not able to enroll during the Plan Year of April 1 through Marc h 31 as Special Enrollees; and; c. Make such other changes as permitted by this Plan Document (including dropping coverage). 50 7.09 ELIGIBLE RETIREE'S PARTICIPATION Retirees must meet a Member Institution's definition of Eligible Retiree in order to be covered under the ICUBA Retiree Plan. Retirees and their Dependents MUST enroll in medical coverage within 30 days of retirement unless the Eligible Retiree or Depende nt chooses COBRA Continuation Coverage in lieu of the Retiree Plan. See Article Eight for COBRA Continuation Coverage enrollment rights. An Eligible Retiree Dependent shall participate in the Plan as of the date of the Eligible Retiree's retirement from a Member Institution, subject to the following: a. If Your Dependent spouse is not a Covered Person at the time You become an Eligible Retiree, Your Dependent spouse may not thereafter become a Cov ered Person in the Plan unless You and Your spouse acquire a new Dependent by adoption, placement for adoption, or birth (see Dependent Enrollment for further information) or Your Dependent spouse submits a request for Special Enrollment in writing to the Plan Administrator no later than 30 days after the date of a qualifying event (e.g., spouse loss of employer provided coverage); b. During any open enrollment period an Eligible Retiree may elect any ICUBA Retiree Plan as long as the Eligible Retiree was covered in an ICUBA Retiree Plan prior to the open enrollment period; c. Upon Your death, any Covered Dependent may remain a Dependent for the applicable period of COBRA Continuation Coverage set forth in Article Eight, provided that the Covered Dependent complies with the conditions therein; and d. If You terminate participation in the Plan for any reason other than for death, Your eligible Dependents shall terminate p articipation in the Plan as of Your termination date. 7.10 ELIGIBLE RETIREE'S PREMIUM An Eligible Retiree will be offered coverage at a premium rate, which is based upon attained age at the time of retirement. An Eligible Retiree who is under the age of 65 will be offered the Active Employee Plan at 100% cost. Upon attainment of age 65, the Eligible Retiree shall be offered a choice between the ICUBA Retiree Plan or the Monumental Life Medicare Supplement Plan. Eligible Retirees who are age 65 and older shall be offered a choice between the ICUBA Retiree Plan or the Monumental Life Medicare Supplement Plan. Both plans pay secondary to Medicare and the Monumental Life Medicare Supplement Plan is age banded. Upon attainment of an age in a different age b and, an Eligible Retiree's premium will change on the first day of the Plan Year following his or her attainment of an age in a new age band. 51 ARTICLE EIGHT CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE Coverage that would otherwise terminate may be continued due to eligibility for COBRA Continuation Coverage . 8.01 COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE COBRA Continuation Coverage shall be permitted in the following circumstances: a. COBRA Continuation Coverage for Employees. A Participant may elect COBRA Continuation Coverage, at the P articipant's own expense at 102% of the total cost of the coverage elected under the Plan, if the Participant's participation un der the Plan terminates as a result of Termination of Employment or reduction of hours with a Member Institution . The COBRA Administrator will not offer COBRA Continuation Coverage where the COBRA Administrator determines that the Terminatio n of Employment was due to gross misconduct. b. COBRA Continuation Coverage for Dependents. A Dependent may elect COBRA Continuation Coverage, at the Dependent's own expense at 102% of the total cost of the coverage elected under the Plan, if the Dependent's participation under the Plan would terminate as a result of one of the following Qualifying Events: 1.

The Participant becomes enrolled in Medicare benefits; 5. Divorce or legal separation of the Participant (If an Employee cancels coverage for his or her spouse in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation, and a divorce or legal separation later occurs, then the divorce or legal separation will be considered a Qualify ing Event even though the ex -spouse lost coverage prior to the date of divorce or legal separation . If the ex -spouse notifies the COBRA Administrator within 60 days after the divorce or legal separation and can establish that the E mployee canceled the coverage earlier in anticipation of the divorce or legal separation, then COBRA coverage may be available for the period after the divorce or legal separation.); 6. A Dependent child ceases to qualify as a Dependent und er the Plan; or 7. Bankruptcy. Sometimes, filing for bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code can be a Qualifying Event . If a bankruptcy is filed by the sponsor of this Plan, and that bankruptcy results in th e loss of coverage of any retired Participant under the Plan, the retired Participant is a Qualified Beneficiary with respect to the bankruptcy. The retired Participant' s spouse, surviving spouse, and Dependent children will also be Qualified Beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under this Plan. 52 c. Other individuals who may be Qualified Beneficiaries include: 1. Recipients under Qualified Medical Child Support Orders . A child of the Participant who is receiving Benefits under the Plan pursuant to a Qualified Medical Child Support Order received by the COBRA Administrator during the Participant's period of employment wit h the Employer is entitled to the same rights under COBRA as a Dependent child of the Participant, regardless of whether that child would otherwise be considered a Dependent. 2. Children born to or placed for adoption with a Participant during COBRA period . Children born to, adopted by, or placed for adoption with a Participant during a period of COBRA Continuation Coverage is considered to be a Qualified Beneficiary provided that, if the Participant is a Qualified Beneficiary, the Participant has elected COBRA Continuation Coverage for himself or herself.

The period of COBRA Continuation Coverage shall be the same as that for the Participant, or as set forth below. 4. Contribution Requirements for COBRA Continuation Coverage . Participants and Dependents who elect COBRA Continuation Coverage as a result of one of the Qualifying Events specified above must make Continuation Coverage Payments . The first Continuation Coverage Payment is due prior to the first day on which COBRA Continuation Coverage will take effect. However, a Participant or Dependent has 45 days from the date of the affirmative election to pay the Continuation Coverage Payment .

The Participant and/or Dependent shall have a 30-day grace period to make the Continuation Coverage Payments due thereafter. Continuation Coverage Payments must be postmarked on or before the completion of the 3 0-day grace period.

The 3 0-day grace period shall not apply to the 45 -day period for payment of initial COBRA premiums as set out in this subsection . If premiums are not paid by the first day of the period of coverage, the Plan has the option to cancel coverage until payment is received and then reinstate the coverage retroactively to the beginning of the period of coverage if the payment is received within the allowable 3 0 day grace period . 56 If the amount of the payment made to the Plan is made in error , but is not significantly less than the amount due (the lesser of $50 or 10% of the premium amount) , the Plan is required to notify You of the deficiency and grant a reasonable period (for this purpose, 30 days is considered reasonable) to pay the difference. The Plan is not obligated to send monthly premium notices. COBRA Qualified B eneficiaries remain subject to the Plan 's rules. 5. Limit ation on Participant 's Right to COBRA Continuation Coverage A. If a Dependent loses, or will lose coverage under the Plan as a result of a divorce or ceasing to be a Dependent, the Participant or Dependent is responsible for notifying the COBRA Administrator within 60 days of the divorce or loss of Dependent status. Failure to make timely notification will terminate the Dependent 's rights to COBRA Continuation Cov erage under this Article. B. A Participant or Dependent must complete, sign and return the required enrollment materials within 60 days from the later of: I. Loss of coverage, or II. The date the COBRA Administrator or its authorized representative sends notice of eligibility for COBRA Continuation Coverage . C. You will be given the option to continue your Health Care Spending Account (HCSA) through COBRA at 102% of the monthly deposit amoun t until the end of the current plan year. You will not have the option of increasing or decreasing your HCSA election amount during the COBRA enrollment period. If your COBRA coverage continues beyond the current plan year, you wi ll not have the option to elect the HCSA during open enrollment. The Dependent Care Spending account (DCSA) is not eligible for continuation through COBRA. D. You will be given the option to continue your Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) through COBRA at 1 02% of the monthly deposit amount. Vesting calculation will end on your last day of employment even if the HRA is continued through COBRA. E. Failure to enroll for COBRA Continuation Coverage during this 60 -day period will terminate all rights to COBRA Continuation Coverage under this Plan. An affirmative election of COBRA Continuation Coverage by a Participant or Participant's spouse shall be deemed to be an election for that Participant's Dependents who would otherwise lose coverage under the Plan. 57 6. Multiple Qualifying Events. If a second Qualifying Event which would entitle the Spouse and Dependents to 36 months of Continuation Coverage occurs during an 18-month extension explained above, coverage may be continued for a maximum of 36 months from the date of the first Qualifying Event provided that the Qualified Beneficiary notifies the Plan Administrator within 60 days of the second Qualifying Event. Such second Qualifying Events include the death of an Employee , divorce from an Employee, an Employee's enrollment in Medicare , or a Dependent child ceasing to be Eligible for coverage as a Dependent under the Plan. You must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the second Qualifying Event using the Notice Procedures described in Secti on 8.01( d). Failure to provide timely notice will result in non -extension of COBRA Continuation Coverage. 7. Medicare Entitlement. If a spouse or Dependent loses coverage due to a Qualifying Event , and the Employee later becomes entitled to Medicare, the spouse or Dependent shall be eligible for up to 36 months of coverage measured from the date of the Qualifying Event, which cause d the loss of coverage. However, if the Employee was entitled to Medicare within 18 months prior to the Qualifying Event, then spouse or Dependent shall have up to 36 months of coverage measured from the date of entitlement to Medicare. 8. Extension of COBRA Continuation Period for Disabled P articipants. The period of continuation shall be extended to 29 months (measured from the date of the Qualifying Event ) in the event: i. The Participant is Disabled (as determined by the Social Security Administra tion) within 60 days after the date of the Qualifying Event , and ii. The individual provides evidence to the COBRA Administrator or its authorized representative of such a determination by the Social Security Administration prior to the earlier of 60 days after the date of the Social Security determination, or the expiration of the initial 18 months of COBRA Continuation Coverage . In such event, the Plan may charge the individual up to 150 % of the cost of the coverage for all months after the 18th month of COBRA coverage . The Participant must notify the Plan Administrator if the Participant is deemed no longer disa bled, in which case COBRA Continuation Coverage ends as of the first day of the coverage period that is more than 3 0 days after the Social Security Administration 's determination. 9. Extension of COBRA Continuation Coverage Period for Disabled Dependents. The period of continuation shall be extended to 29 months (measured from the date of the Qualifying Event ) in the event the Dependent is Disabled as determined by the Social Securit y Administration within 60 days after the date of the Qualifying Event and the individual provides written evidence to the Plan Administrator or its authorized representative of such Social Security determination 60 days after th e date of such determination and prior to the expiration of the initial 18 months of COBRA Continuation Coverage . In such event, the Plan may charge the individual up to 150% of the cost of the coverage from all months after t he 18 months of coverage . 58 g. Cost of Continuation Coverage . Generally, each Qualified Beneficiary is required to pay the entire cost of COBRA Continuation Coverage. The amount a Qualified Beneficiary may be required to pay may not exceed 102% of the cost to the group health plan (including both Employe r and Employee contributions) for coverage of a similarly -situated Plan Participant or Beneficiary who is not receiving COBRA Continuation Coverage (or in the case of an extension of COBRA Continuation Coverage due to a Disability, 150%). COBRA premiums may be increased if the costs to the P lan increase but generally must be fixed in advance of each 12-month premium cycle. h. Non-sufficient Funds. 1. If a Participant sends a check for a monthly COB RA premium that is returned for non-sufficient funds (NSF), the Participant is notified by letter and asked to resubmit the payment plus a bank fee of $15. The Participant is advised that a NS F check is considered non-payment of premium, and is given 15 days from the date of the letter to send replacement payment. The payment is adjudicated by the postmark. 2. If a second check is also returned for Non -Sufficient Funds, the Participant is sent a second letter and asked to re -submit payment plus a fee of $15 within 15 days of th e date of the second letter. The Participant is advised that a Non -Sufficient Funds check is considered non-payment, and that their coverage has been cancelled until payment plus the bank fee is received and funds are verified. The Participant is notifie d that any further NSF checks will result in termination of COBRA coverage with no reinstatement . If there are any further Non-Sufficient Funds payments, coverage is terminated and there is no opportunity for reinstatement of coverage. This notice is sent certified mail/return receipt. 8.02 INITIAL NOTIFICATION OF YOUR COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE RIGHTS You are receiving this Notice because You have recently become covered under the Independent Colleges and Universities Benefits Association, Inc. Medical , Employee Assistance, and Prescription Drug Plan (the \"Plan\"). This Notice contains important information about Your right to COBRA Continuation Coverage , which is a temporary extension of group health coverage under the Plan under certain circums tances when coverage would otherwise end. This Notice generally explains COBRA Continuation Coverage, when it may become available to You and Your Family, and what You need to do to protect the right to receive it. COBRA (and the description of COBRA Continuation Coverage contained in this Notice) applies only to the group health plan benefits offered under the Plan. The right to COBRA Continuation Coverage was created by a Federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA Continuation Coverage can become available to You when You would otherwise lose Your group health coverage under the Plan. It can also become available to Your spouse and Dependent children, if they are covered under the Plan, when they would other wise lose their group health coverage under the Plan. This Notice does not fully describe COBRA Continuation Coverage or other rights under the Plan. For additional information about Your rights and obligations under the Plan and under Federal law, You s hould review the Plan Document/Summary Plan Description or contact the Plan Administrator. 59 What is COBRA Continuation Coverage? COBRA Continuation Coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualifying event\". Specific qualifying events are listed later in this Notice. After a qualifying event occurs and any required notice of that event is properly provided to Your Employer, COBRA Continuation Coverage must be offered to each pe rson losing Plan coverage who is a \"qualified beneficiary\". You, Your spouse, and Your Dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries and would be entitled to elect COBRA if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Certai n newborns, newly adopted children, and alternate recipients under QMCSOs may also be qualified beneficiaries. This is discussed in more detail in the separate paragraphs below. Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA must pay for COBRA C ontinuation Coverage. Who is Entitled to Elect COBRA? If You are an Employee, You will be entitled to elect COBRA if you lose Your group health coverage under the Plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: 1. Your hours of employment are reduced; or 2. Your employment ends for any reason other than Your gross misconduct. If You are the spouse of an Employee (Participant) of ICUBA or a Member Institution , you will be entitled to elect COBRA if you lose group health coverage under the Plan because of any of the following qualifying events occurs : 1. your spouse dies; 2. your spouse's hours of employment are reduc ed; 3. your spouse's employment ends for reasons other than his or her gross misconduct ; or 4. you become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Also, if your s pouse (the Employee) reduces or eliminates your group health coverage in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation, and a divorce or legal separation later occurs, then the divorce or legal separation may be considered a qualifying event for you even though your coverage was reduced or eliminated before the divorce or separation . A person enrolled as the Employee's Dependent will be entitled to elect COBRA if he or she loses group health coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events occurs : 1. the parent -Employee dies; 2. the parent -Employee's hours of employment are reduced ; 3. the parent -Employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gro ss misconduct ; or 4. the child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a \"Dependent child\". When is COBRA Coverage Available? When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment or death of the Employee, the Plan will offer COBRA coverage to qualified beneficiaries. You need not notify Your Employer or the Plan Administrator of any of these qualifying events. 60 You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For the other qualifying even ts (divorce or legal separation of the Employee and spouse or a Dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a Dependent child), a COBRA election will be available to You only if You notify the Plan in writing within 60 days after the later of: (1) the date of the qualifying event; and (2) the date on which the qualified beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage under the terms of the Plan as a result of the qualifying event. Electing COBRA Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA. Covered Employees and spouses (if the spouse is a qualified beneficiary) may elect COBRA on behalf of all of the qualified beneficiaries, and parents may elect COBRA on behalf of their children. Any qualified beneficiary for whom CO BRA is not elected within the 60-day election period specified in the Plan's COBRA election notice will lose his or her right to elect COBRA and his or her group health insurance coverage will end. How Long Does COBRA Continuation Coverage Last? COBRA Co ntinuation Coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage. When the qualifying event is the death of the Employee, the covered Employee's divorce or legal separation, or a Dependent child's losing eligibility as a Dependent child, COBRA Continuation Cov erage under the Plan can last for up to a total of 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the Employee's hours of employment, and the Employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the quali fying event, COBRA coverage under the Plan for qualified beneficiaries (other than the Employee) who lose coverage as a result of the qualifying event can last until up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if a covered Employe e becomes entitled to Medicare 8 months before the date on which his Employment Terminates, COBRA Continuation Coverage for his spouse and children who lost coverage as a result of his termination can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitle ment, which is equal to 28 months after the date of the qualifying event (36 months minus 8 months). This COBRA coverage period is available only if the covered Employee becomes entitled to Medicare within 18 months before the termination or reduction of hours. Otherwise, when the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the Employee's hours of employment, COBRA Continuation Coverage under the Plan generally can last for only up to a total of 18 months. The COBRA coverage periods describ ed above are maximum coverage periods. COBRA Continuation Coverage can end before the end of the maximum coverage periods described in this Notice for any of the following five reasons: 1. Independent Colleges and Universities Benefits Association no longer provides group health coverage to any of its members; 2. The premium for COBRA C ontinuation Coverage is not paid on time; 3. The qualified beneficiary becomes covered \u2014 after the date he or she elects COBRA Continuation Coverage \u2014 under another group health plan; 4. The qualified beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare after the date he or she elects COBRA coverage; 5. The qualified beneficiary extends coverage for up to 29 months due to disability and there has been a final determinatio n that the individual is no longer disabled. 61 There are two ways in which the period of COBRA Continuation Coverage resulting from a Termination of Employment or reduction of hours can be extended : Disability Extension of COBRA Continuation Coverage If a qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to be disabled (for Social Security disability purposes) and You notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, all of the qualified beneficiaries in Your family may be enti tled to receive up to an additional 11 months of COBRA Continuation Coverage, for a total maximum of 29 months. This 11 -month extension is available only for qualified beneficiaries who are receiving COBRA Continuation Coverage because of a qualifying eve nt that was the covered Employee's Termination of Employment or reduction of hours. The disability must have started at some time before the 61st day after the covered Employee's Termination of Employment or reduction of hours and must last until the end of the period of COBRA Continuation Coverage that would be available without the disability extension (generally 18 months, as described above). The disability extension is available only if You notify the Plan Administrator in writing of the Social Secur ity Administration's determination of disability within 60 days after the latest of: 1. the date of the Social Security Administration's disability determination; 2. the date of the covered Employee's Termination Of Employment or reduction of hours; and 3. the dat e on which the qualified beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage under the terms of the Plan as a result of the covered Employee's Termination of Employment or reduction of hours. You must also provide this notice within 18 months after the covered Employee's Termination of Employment or reduction of hours in order to be entitled to a disability extension. If notice is not provided to the Plan Administrator during the 60 -day notice period and within 18 months after the covered Employee's Termination of Employment or reduction of hours, then there will be no disability extension of COBRA Continuation Coverage. Second Qualifying Event Extension of COBRA Coverage If Your family expe riences another qualifying event while receiving COBRA Continuation Coverage because of the covered Employee's Termination Of Employment or reduction of hours (including COBRA coverage during a disability extension period as described above), the spouse an d Dependent children receiving COBRA Continuation Coverage can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA Continuation Coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if notice of the second qualifying event is properly given to the Plan. This extension may be availab le to the spouse and any Dependent children receiving COBRA Continuation Coverage if the Employee or former Employee dies or gets divorced or legally separated, or if the Dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a Dependent child, but only if the event would have caused the spouse or Dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. (This extension is not available under the Plan when a covered Employee becomes entitled to Medicare after his or her T ermination of Employment or reduction of hours). This extension due to a second qualifying event is available only if You notify the Plan Administrator in writing of the second qualifying event within 60 days after the date of the second qualifying event. If the notice is not provided to the Plan Administrator during the 60 -day notice period, then there will be no extension of COBRA Continuation Coverage due to a second qualifying event. 62 More Information About Individuals Who May Be Qualified Beneficia ries Children Born to or Placed for Adoption with the Covered Employee during the COBRA Coverage Period A child born to, adopted by, or placed for adoption with the covered Employee during a period of COBRA Continuation Coverage is considered to be a qualified beneficiary provided that, if the covered Employee is a qualified beneficiary, the covered Employee has elected COBRA Continuation Coverage for himself or herself. The child's COBRA Continuation Coverage begins when the child is enrolled in the Plan, whether through Special Enrollment or Open Enrollment, and it lasts for as long as COBRA Continuation Coverage lasts for other family members of the Employee. To be enrolled in the Plan, the child must satisfy the otherwise applicable Plan eligibili ty requirements ( e.g., regarding age). Alternate Recipients under QMSCOs A child of the covered Employee who is receiving Benefits under the Plan pursuant to a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) received by the Plan during the covered Employee 's period of employment with the Employer is entitled to the same rights to elect COBRA as an eligible Dependent child of the covered Employee. If You Have Questions If You have any questions about COBRA Continuation Coverage , You may call the COBRA Administrator toll free at 1-866-377-5102, O ption 2 or contact the COBRA Administrator via mail at P.O. Box 1517 Des Moines, IA 50305 . Also, if Your marital status has changed , or You or Your spouse ha ve changed addresses, please notify ICUBA at the above address.

In addition to the rights that You have under COBRA, You are entitled under USERRA to continue the coverage You had under the Plan. Uniformed Services means the U.S. Armed Services (including the Coast Guard), the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard (when engaged in active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full -time National Guard duty), and the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service. The President is authorized to expand the categories of Uniformed Services through the exercise of emergency or war pow ers. Your Rights Under COBRA and USERRA (Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act) Your rights under COBRA and USERRA are similar but not identical. Any election that You make pursuant to COBRA will also be an election under USERRA. COBRA and USERRA will both a pply with respect to the continuation coverage elected. If COBRA or USERRA give You or Covered Dependents different rights or protections, the law that provides the greater benefit will apply. USERRA does not provide coverage for Dependents. 63 Service in the Uniformed Services or Service means the performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in the Uniformed Services under competent authority, including active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training, i nactive duty training, full time National Guard duty, and the time necessary for a person to be absent from employment for an examination to determine the fitness of the person to perform any of these duties. a. Employee must give advance notice. A Participant leaving for Service in the Uniformed Services must give the Member Institution /Employer advance notice of the absence from employment for Service. Notices can be written or oral. No such notice is required if the notice is precluded by military necessity or if the giving of notice is impossible or unreasonable under the circumstances. b. Employee absence must not exceed 5 years. The cumulative le ngth of absence and all previous absences from the employment of the current Employer for periods of Service in the Uniformed Services must not exceed 5 years. The 5 -year period does not include periods when an individual : 1. is required to complete an initial period of obligated service; 2. is unable to obtain release orders through no fault of his or her own ; 3. required to complete specific training requirements; 4. is ordered to , or retained on , active duty because of war or nati onal emergency declared by the President or by Congress; 5. is ordered to active duty in support of an operational mission or in support of a critical mission; or 6. is called into Service as a member of the National Guard. c. Employee must report to work within specific timeframes after service ends. Upon completion of Service in the military, the Employee must notify the Employer of the intention to return to work. The following chart identifies the notification req uirements under USERRA : Period of Absence Return to Work Requirement Less than 30 days Report to work at the beginning of the first regularly scheduled work period following the end of service plus eight hours, or as soon as possible thereafter if satisfying the deadline is unreasonable or impossible through no fault of the Employee . More than 30 days but less than 181 days Submit an application for employment not later than 14 days after the completion of the service, or as soon as possible thereafter if satisfying the deadline is unreasonable or impossible through no fault of the Employee . More than 180 days Submit an application for employment not later than 90 days after the completion of t he service. Any period, if the absence was for purposes of an examination for fitness to perform service Report to work at the beginning of the first regularly -scheduled work period following the end of service plus eight hours, or as soon as possible thereafter if satisfying the deadline is unreasonable or impossible through no fault of the Employee . Person who is injured or ill as a result of (or Injury or Illness was aggravated by) military service Apply for work or submit applicati on as described above (depending on length of absence) when recovery is complete , provided that recovery time is limited to two years. The two -year period is extended by any minimum time required to accommodate circumstances beyond the Employee 's control that make compliance with these deadlines unreasonable or impossible. 64 d. Employee 's undesirable conduct. Rights under USERRA will be terminated if service in the military ends under any of the following circumstances: 1. Separation from service with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge; 2. Certain less -than-honorable circumstances as characterized by the Department of Labor; 3. For a commissioned officer, dismissal in connection with a court -martial; and 4. The dropping of a commissioned officer from the rolls as a result of an unauthorized absence for at least three months or as a result of a sentence imposed after a court -martial or a conviction in another court. e. USERRA coverage maximum twenty -four (24) months. When a Participant takes a leave for Service, continued coverage under the Plan, as required by USERRA will begin the day after the Participant lose s coverage under the Plan, and will continue for up to twenty -four (24) months. There are situations in which USERRA coverage will terminate before the maximum USERRA period expires. f. COBRA and USERRA cove rage are concurrent. This means that both COBRA Continuation C overage and USERRA coverage begin upon commencement of the Participant 's leave, and continue for up to twenty -four (24) months. COBRA coverage (but not USERRA coverage) may continue for longer, as described in the COBRA section of this Article Nine. g. If You continue Your medical coverage pursuant to USERRA , You will be required to pay 102% o f the full premium for the coverage elected (the same rate as COBRA). However, if Your Uniformed Service Leave of Absence is less than thirty (30) days, You are not required to pay more than the amount that You pay as an active Participant for that coverage. h. USERRA leave time will count toward FMLA eligibility. A Participant who was called to qualifying military service and is re -employed under USERRA's provisions is credited with the time he or she would have worked, but for his or her military service, when determining eligibility for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. I. If coverage is not continued during a USERRA Leave Of Absence, when the Employee returns to Actively At Work status no new Waiting Period will apply . 8.04 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE AC T If an Employee is on a family or medical leave , the Employee may continue coverage in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Plan will continue coverage, as if the Employee were Actively At Work , if the following conditions are met: 1. The required contribution is paid; and 2. The Employee has written approval of leave from the Member Institution . Coverage will be continued for up to the greater of : 1. The leave period required by the Family and Medical Le ave Act of 1993 , and any amendments thereto or regulations promulgated thereunder ; or 2. The leave period required by applicable state law. 65 If coverage is not continued during a family or medical leave , when the Employee returns to Actively At Work status no new Waiting Period will apply . 8.05 THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATON ACT The National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 adds two types of FMLA leave for the families of service members who are called to duty in the Armed Forces. The Service member Caregiver Leave provides up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave in a single 12 -month period for any Eligible Employee who is the spouse, parent or next of kin of a covered service member who suffered a serious Injury or Illness in line of duty while on active duty that renders the service member medically unfit to perform the duties of his/her office, grade, rank , or rating. An Eligible Employee can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a 12 -month period as the result of any qualifying exigency because the Employee's spouse, son, daughter or parent is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call of duty in the Armed Forces in support of a \"contingency operation.\" If an Employee is on a leave provided for under the National Defense Authorization Act , the Employee may continue coverage under the Plan a s if the Employee were Actively at Work if the following conditions are met: The required contribution is paid; and The Employee has written approval of the leave from the Member Institution . Coverage will be continued for up to the greater of: The leave period required by the Family and Medical Le ave Act of 1993 , and any amendments thereto or regulations promulgated thereunder; or The leave period required by applicable state law.

If a medical expense is not a Covered Expense, or is subject to a Limitation or Exclusion, a Covered Person still has the right and privilege to receive such medical service or supply at the Covered Person's own personal expense. Similarly, if the Provide r is Non -Network , the Covered Person still has the right and privilege to utilize such Provider at the Plan's reduced Coinsurance level with the Covered Person being responsible for a larger percentage of the total medical expense. 91 ARTICLE ELEVEN COORDINATION OF BENEFITS COORDINATION OF BENEFITS Most health care plans, including Your PPO program, contain a Coordination of Benefits provision. This provision is used when You, Your spouse or Your covered Dependents are eligible for payment under more than one health c are plan. The object of Coordination of Benefits is to ensure that Your Covered Expenses will be paid, while preventing duplicate benefit payments. 11.01 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS PROVISION a. When Your other coverage does not mention \"Coordination of Benefits ,\" then that coverage pays first. Benefits paid or payable by the other coverage will be taken into account in determining if additional Benefit payments can be made under this Plan. b. When the person who received care is covered as an Employee under one contract and as a Dependent under another, then the Employee coverage pays first. c. When a Dependent child is covered under two contracts, the contract covering the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year pays first. However , if both parents have the same birthday, the plan which covered the parent longer will be the primary program. If the Dependent child 's parents are separated or divo rced, the following applies: i. The paren t with custody of the child pays first. ii. The coverage of the parent with custody pays first , but the stepparent 's coverage pays before the coverage of the parent who does not have custody. iii. Regardless of which parent has custody, whenever a court decree s pecifies the parent who is financially responsible for the child 's health care expenses, the coverage of that parent pays first. iv. When none of the above circumstances appl y, the coverage You have had for the longest time pays first ; provided , however, that the benefits of a plan covering the person as an Employee (other than a laid -off or retired employee ) or as the dependent of such person shall be determined before the benefits of a plan covering the person as a laid -off or retired employee or as a dependent of such person . If the other program does not have this provision regarding laid -off or retired employees, and, as a result, plans do not agree on the order of benefits, then this rule shall be disregarded. Coordination of Benefits prevents duplication of Benefits and works to the advantage of all Covered Persons in the Plan. Coordination of Benefits applies when a Participant is covered under more than one group health benefits program. It requires that payment of Benefits be coordinated by all programs to eliminate over insurance or duplication of Benefits. If a Covered Person is covered under more tha n one group plan, benefits will be coordinated. The Covered Person will be responsible for meeting the Plan 's Co-payment, Deductible , and Coinsurance that would otherwise be the Covered Person's responsibil ity if the Plan were primary. 92 The Benefits paya ble under this Plan for any Claim determination period will be either its regular Benefits or reduced Benefits which, when added to the benefits of the other plan, will equal 100% of the Allowable Expenses, as defined below. At no time is a Covered Person responsible for more than the applicable Co -payment, Deductible , or Coinsurance. 11.02 DEFINITIONS The following terms have special meaning in Article Eleven - Coordination of Benefits : 1. Allowable Expenses. Any Medically Necessary , Reasonable and Customary expense incurred by a Covered Person , which is covered at least in part under this Plan. 2. Claim Determination Period. The portion of the Pla n Year (4/1 -3/31) during which a Covered Person who submitted a Claim , or for whom a Claim has been submitted, has been covered under the Plan. 3. Other Plan. Any plan under which medical or dental benefits or services are provided by: a. Group, blanket , or franchise insurance coverage; b. Any group Hospital service pre -payment, group medical service pre -payment, group practice or other group pre -payment coverage; c. Group coverage under labor -management trusteed plans, union welfare plans, employer organization plans or employee benefit plans; or d. Coverage under governmental programs or coverage required or provided by any statute (including no-fault auto insurance), except Medicaid and Medicare . (Refer to the Coordination of Benefits with Medicare provision under Article Twelve .) 11.03 EFFECT OF HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) COVERAGE This Plan will not consider , as an Allowable Expense , any charge (1) that would have been covered by an HMO had a Covered Person for whom the HMO would be primary payer used the services of an HMO participating provider or (2) in excess of what an HMO provider has ag reed to accept. 11.04 RECOVERY If the amount of the payment made by this Plan is more than it should have paid, the Plan has the right to recover the excess from one or more of the following: a. The person this Plan has paid or for whom it has paid; b. Insurance companies; and c. Other organizations. 11.05 PAYMENT TO OTHER CARRIERS Whenever payments, which should have been made under this Plan in accordance with the above provisions, have been made under any Other Plans, this Plan will have the right, in its sole discretion , to pay any organization making those payments any amounts it determines to be warranted in order to satisfy the intent of the above provisions. 93 Amounts paid in this manner will be considered to be Be nefits paid under this Plan and , to the extent of these payments, this Plan will be fully discharged from liability. 11.06 REIMBURSEMENT, ASSIGNMENT , AND LIEN If the Plan makes payments and a Participant later receives a settlement , or is otherwise compensated by a third-party as a result of the Participant's Injuries, the Participant must reimburse the Plan for payment the Plan made. Each Covered Person also hereby grants the Plan a lien and assignment of any sums or proceeds recovered from any third -party (or his or her insurance carrier) whose negligent or intentional conduct was responsible in whole or in part for the Covered Person's need for Medical Care. The amount of such lien and assignment shall be equal to the sums paid by the Plan to , or on behalf of , the Covered Person for medical expenses arising out of such third-party's conduct, plus any attorney's fees incurred by the Plan in enforcing th is lien and assignment. 11.07 SUBROGATION Subrogation means that if You incur health care expenses for Injuries caused by another person or entity, the person or entity causing the Accident may be responsible for paying these exp enses. For example, if You or one of Your Dependents receives Benefits under the Plan for Injuries or Illness caused by another person or organization, the Plan has the right, through subrogation, to seek repayment from the other person or entity or any applicable insurance company for Benefits already paid. The Plan will provide eligible Benefits when needed, but You may be asked to show documents or take other necessary actions to support the Plan and Florida Blue in any subrogation efforts. In the ev ent of any payment of Covered Expenses under the Plan, the Plan may , to the extent of such payment, claim the right of subrogation to all the rights of recovery of the Covered Person , or any other party claim ing through the Covered Person, arising out of any claim or cause of action that may accrue because of the alleged negligent conduct of a third -party. If the Covered Person brings a claim against a third -party, Benefits payable under th e Plan must be included in s uch claim as well as in any recovery the Covered Person obtains, either by judgment, settlement, or otherwise, and the Covered Person must reimburse the Plan for the full amount of Benefits paid under the Plan, regardless of whether the Covered Person has been \"made whole\" as a result of such payments by such third -party. This means that the Plan's right of subrogation and reimbursement, as set forth herein, will not be affected, reduced, or eliminated by the \"made whole doctrine\" or any other equitable doctrine or law which requires an insured to be \"made whole\" before subrogation rights are allowed. Furthermore, it is prohibited for a Covered Person or beneficiaries to settle a claim against a third -party for certain elements of damages, but eliminating damages relating to medical expenses incurred. The Plan's subrogation, reimbursement, and lien rights apply to any recoveries made by a Covered Person as a result of Injuries sustained or Illness suffered for which Benefit payments were made, including but not limited to , the following: a. Any award or settlement or benefits paid under any workers' compensation law or award. b. Any and all payments made directly by a third -party tortfeasor, person, ent ity, or any insurance company on behalf of the third -party tortfeasor or any payments or installments made to the Covered Person on behalf of the third -party tortfeasors, person, or entity responsible for indemnifying the third -party tortfeasors. 94 c. Any arbi tration awards, payments, settlements, structured settlements, or other benefits paid by an insurance company under an uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage policy, whether on behalf of the Covered Person, his employer, or any other person. d. Any othe r payments designated, delineated, earmarked, or intended to be paid to a Covered Person as compensation, restitution, or remuneration for Injuries sustained or Illnesses suffered as the result of the negligence, or liability, including contractual, of a t hird-party. Subrogation does not apply to any individual insurance policy that You may have purchased for Yourself or Your Dependents or where subrogation is specifically prohibited by law. The Plan will not be responsible for any expenses, fees, costs, or other monies incurred by the attorney for the Covered Person, commonly known as the \"common fund doctrine\". The Covered Person is specifically prohibited from incurring any expenses, costs, or fees on behalf of the Plan in pursuit of his or her rights of recovery against a third-party or the Plan's subrogation/reimbursement rights as set forth herein. No court costs, experts' fees, attorneys' fees, filing fees, or other costs or expenses of a litigation nature may be deducted from the Plan's recovery w ithout the prior written consent of the Plan. In addition, the Plan's right of subrogation and reimbursement will not be reduced or affected as a result of any fault or claim on the part of the Covered Person, whether under the doctrines of imperative cau sation , comparative fault or contributory negligence, or any other similar doctrine in law. Accordingly, any so -called \"lien reduction statutes\" which attempt to apply such laws and reduce a subrogating Plan's recovery for any reason will not be applicabl e to the Plan and will not reduce the Plan's subrogation recovery. The Benefits provided under this Plan are secondary to any benefits or coverage provided under any no -fault laws or similar legislation or no -fault-type insurance. Furthermore, as a Cover ed Person, You hereby agree to the following terms and conditions: a. Each Covered Person shall take such action, to furnish such information and assistance, and to execute and deliver all necessary instruments as the Plan Administrator may require to facilitate the e nforcement of the Plan's rights hereunder . b. No Covered Person shall prejudice the Plan's right of subrogation or reimbursement . c. Each Covered Person shall do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan's right of subroga tion to be exercised , including cooperate with the Plan and/or any and all representatives of the Plan, including subrogation counsel, in completing discovery, attending depositions, and/or attending or cooperating in trial in order to affect the Plan's su brogation rights . Furthermore, the Covered Person shall do nothing after loss to prejudice the Plan's subrogation rights. d. No covered person may assign any rights or causes of action that he or she might have against a third -party tortfeasor , person, or e ntity, which would grant the Covered Person the right to recover medical expenses or other damages, without the express, prior written consent of the Plan and the Plan Administrator. The Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights apply even if the Covere d Person has died as a result of his or her Injuries and is asserting a wrongful death or survivor claim against the third -party tortfeasor under the laws of any state. The Plan's right to recovery by subrogation or reimbursement shall thus apply to any s ettlements, recoveries, or causes of action owned or obtained by a decedent, minor, incompetent, or disabled person. The Plan Administrator shall pay reasonable fees and costs associated with the enforcement of the Plan's rights . No Plan Benefits will be paid until liability has been established by the Plan Administrator. 95 Each Covered Person , and any other party to whom such payments have been assigned by such Covered Person, shall hold such payments in tru st and reimburse the Plan for any payment the Plan made for which such person recovers payments, including attorneys' fees, regardless of the damages designation in any settlement document or court order. Each Covered Person must cooperate at e ach stage under the Plan, including Claims investigation, recovery of overpayments, and subrogation. Failure to cooperate or prejudicing a right of the Plan may result in a loss of Benefits. 11.08 RELEASE OF INFORMATION For the purpose of determining the applicability of , and implementing , the terms of the above provisions of this Plan or any similar provision of an Other Plan, Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran may, without the consent of , or notice to, any Covered Person , release to , or obtain from , any other insurance company or other organization or individuals, any information concerning any Covered Person that is necessary for those purposes. Any person receiving Benefits under this Plan must furnish to Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran information about other coverage, which may be involved in applying th e Coordination of Benefits ' provision s. 96 ARTICLE TWELVE COORDINATION OF BENEFITS WITH MEDICARE 12.01 ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE A Participant may have coverage under the Plan and under Medicare . Medicare means benefits offered under Title XVII of the Social Security Act, and includes all of the benefits provided by Parts A and B of Medicare. When a Participant has coverage under both the Plan and Medicare, the Plan will pay Benefits primary to Medicare for: a. An active Employee who is age 65 or over; b. An active Employee 's covered spouse who is age 65 or over; c. An active Employee or covered spouse who is under age 65 and entitled to Medicare because of a Disability; or d. The first 30 months of treatment for end stage renal disease received by any Participant . If a Participant does not fall into one or more of the categories above, the Plan will pay Benefits secondary to Medicare . When the Plan pays secondary to Medicare , the Participant must first submit a claim to Medicare. After Medicare makes payment, the P articipant may submit the Claim to the Plan for payment. When a Participant files for Social Security benefits, the Participant automatically becomes eligible for Medicare Part A Hospital coverage, which has no premium expense. A Participant must voluntarily enroll in Medicare Part B medical coverage and pay premiums. 12.02 ELECTION BY PARTICIPANT A Participant who is covered under Medicare and the Plan, and who falls into one of the categories above, may elect to waive coverage under the Plan. If coverage is waived under the Plan, the Plan will no longer provide coverage for that person. If a Participant waives coverage under the Plan, the Participant may later reapply for coverage under the Plan during Open Enrollment as a Late Enrollee. However, t he rules governing Late Enrollees will apply. If a Participant elects Medicare as the primary coverage, the Participant wi ll have no further coverage under this Plan. 12.03 HCFA REGULATION This Article is based on regulations issued by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), now known as Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and may be amended or changed at any time. It is the intent of the Plan to abide by the Medicare Secondary Payer rules. The Plan will coordinate with Medicare to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If the Plan in any way conflicts with regulations iss ued by CMS, the Plan will pay Benefits in accordance with CMS regulations. 97 12.04 COORDINATION OF MEDICARE WITH THE ICUBA MEDICAL PLAN Active Employees and Dependents An E mployee who is over the age of 65 and enrolled in Medicare will be Covered under the Plan as the primary payer if that Employee is still Actively At Work . Medicare is secondary to the Plan for these Actively At Work Employees. Medicare uses a Coordination of Benefits (CO B) Contractor which consolidates the activities that support the collection, management, and reporting of other insurance coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. The purposes of the COB program are to identify the health benefits available to a Medicare benef iciary and to coordinate the payment process to prevent mistaken payment of Medicare benefits. The COB Contractor does not process claims, nor does it handle any mistaken payment recoveries or claims specific inquiries. The Medicare intermediaries and carr iers are responsible for processing claims submitted for primary or secondary payment. Medicare's Coordination of Benefits Agreement Program establishes a nationally standard contract between the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and other h ealth insurance organizations that defines the criteria for transmitting enrollee eligibility data and Medicare adjudicated claim data. The CMS will transfer the claims crossover functions from individual Medicare contractors to a national claims crossover contractor, the Coordination of Benefits Contractor (COBC). This consolidation will allow for the establishment of unique identifiers (COBC IDs) to be associated with each contract and create a national repository for COB information. Employees over the age of 65 enrolled in Medicare , will be covered under the ICUBA Plan as the primary payer, if that Employee is still Actively At Work . Medicare is secondary to the ICUBA Plan for these Actively At Work Employees. You must supply the social security number of any dependent over the age of 45 at the time of enrollment. Retirees Plan coverage is available for Eligible Retirees. If You retire before the attaining age 65, You will be provided with the opportunity to remain covered under the Plan. Upon attaining age 65, You will be offered a choi ce to remain on the ICUBA Plan or switch to the Monumental Life Retiree Supplemental Plan and You have thirty (30) days to enroll . The premium for the Monumental Plan is age banded and Your premium will change the first day of the plan year following Your birthday if Your birthday results in a change of Your age band. Under the comprehensive benefits program, health care Benefits are provided under one integrated program. These Benefits include coverage for Hospital Services, Physician services, and man y other Covered Services. Most Benefits are subject to Deductible and Coinsurance provisions which require You to share a portion of the medical costs. Below are the specific Benefit levels. These Benefits will be a pplied after Medicare Parts A and B have paid their portion for Covered Services. As a Medicare Participant, You have a right to access and to review a fee schedule with a complete listing of fees used by Medicare to pay doctors or othe r providers/suppliers. This comprehensive listing of fee maximums is used to reimburse a Physician and/or other Providers on a fee -for-service basis. CMS develops fee schedules for Physicians, Ambulance Services, clinical laboratory services, and Durable Medical Equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies. This fee schedule is available at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/FeeScheduleGenInfo/ . Note: The Plan requires that all retired Covered Persons eligible for Medicare enroll in Medicare Parts A and B and pay any associated premiums. The Plan will pay Benefits based on the premise that the retired Covered Person has elected coverage under Medicare Parts A and B, regardless of whether the retired Covered Person actually has. 98 The ICUBA Prescription Drug benefit is Creditable Coverage , so You will receive credit towards Medicare Part D upon Your retirement if You choose to elect Medicare Part D. Cred itable C overage means that the amount the Plan expects to pay on average for Prescription Drugs for individuals covered under the Plan in the applicable year is the same or more than what standard Medicare Prescription Drug coverage would be expected to pay on average. This is important because the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) imposes a late enrollment penalty on individuals who do not maintain Creditable Coverage for a period of 63 days or longer following their initial enrollment period for the Medicare Prescription Drug benefit. MMA mandates that certain entities offering Prescription Drug coverage, including employer and union group health plan sponsors, disclose to all Medicare eligible individuals with Prescription Drug coverage under the plan whether such coverage is 'creditable. \" This information is essential to an individual 's decision whether to enroll in a Medicare Part D Prescription Drug plan. The Plan pays for other health expenses in addition to Prescription Drugs. If You or Your Dependent enroll in a Medicare Prescription Drug plan, You and Your eligible Dependents will sti ll be able to receive all of Your current health and Prescription Drug Benefits. 99 Benefit Period: April 1, 201 5 - March 31, 201 6 General Provision: PPO 70 Plan, Preferred PPO Plan BENEFITS PPO 70 Plan Preferred PPO Plan Deductible Individual Family $1,000 $2,500 $2,000 $4,000 Coinsurance 70/30% after Deductible 80/20% after Deductible Lifetime Maximum No maximum No maximum Out-of-Pocket Maximum (includes deductibles, coinsurance and medical copays) Individual Family $3,000 $6,000 $3,500 $7,000 Physician Office Visits (General Practice, Internal Family Practice, Pediatrician , OB/GYN ) 100% after $20 co -payment;

Filing Benefit Claims i) Authorized Representatives : You have the right to designate an authorized representative to file or pursue a request for reimbursement or other Post -Service Claim on Your behalf. Florida Blue , MHNet and/or Cata maran reserve the right to establish reasonable procedures for determining w hether an individual has been authorized to act on Your behalf. ii) Requests for Precertification and Other Pre -Service Claims : For a description of how to file a request for Precertification or other Pre -Service Claim, see the Utilization Review and Care Coordination Section in Article V. Please review the C overed Benefits as detailed in S ection 9.01 prior to requesting Precertification or Pre -Service Claims to ensure that the procedure You are planning is a covered Benefit under the Plan. If the planned procedure is listed under the Limitations and Exclusion s in Section 10.01, the procedure will not be covered except as otherwise explained herein. If the Plan does not require Precertification for the Claim for which the approval is being requested, it is not a \"claim for benefits\" governed by ERISA regulation. iii) Requests for Reimbursement and Other Post -Service Claims : When a participating Hospital, Physician , or other Provider submits its own reimburseme nt Claim, the amount paid to that Participating Provider will be determined in accordance with the Provider's agreement with Florida Blue , the local Blue Cross Blue Shield Plan , MHNet , or Cata maran serving Your area. Florida Blue or MHNet will notify You of the amount that was paid to the Provider. Any remaining amounts that You are required to pay in the form of a Co -payment , Coinsurance , or program Deductible will also be identified in that Expla nation of Benefits (EOB) or notice.

Deadline To be Eligible for coverage, You must submit all requests for reimbursement and other Post -Service Claims within 12 (twelve) months from the Date of Service. d. Determinations on Benefit Claims For a description of the time frames in which requests for Precertifica tion or other Pre -Service Claims will be determined by Florida Blue and the notice You will receive concerning its decision, whether adverse or not, see the Utilization Review and Care Coordination Section in Article V. 105 13.04 DEFINITIONS 1. Claim. A Claim is any request for a Plan Benefit or Benefits made in accordance with these Claims and Appeals Procedures. A communication regarding Benefits that is not made in accordance with these Claims and Appeals Procedures will not be treated as a Claim. 2. Claimant. A Claimant is an individual who makes a request for a Plan Benefit or Benefits in accordance with these Claims and Appeals Procedures . 3. Incorrectly Filed Claim. Any request for Benefits that is not made in accordance wit h these Claims and Appeals Procedures is called an Incorrectly -Filed Claim. 4. Day. When used in these Claims and Appeals Procedures , the term Day means a calendar day. 5. Authorized Representative. An Authorized Representative may act on behalf of a Claimant with respect to a Claim or appeal under these Claims and Appeals Procedures. However, no person (including a treating health care professional, except as noted below) will be recognized as an Au thorized Representative until the Plan receives an Appointment of Authorized Representative form signed by the Claimant, except for Urgent Care Claims. The Plan shall, even in the absence of a signed Appointment of Authorized Representative form, recognize a health care professional with knowledge of the Claiman t's medical condition ( i.e., the treating Physician ) as the Claimant 's Authorized Representative unless the Claimant provides specific written direction otherwise. An assignment f or purposes of payment ( i.e., to a health care professional) does not constitute appointment of an Authorized Representative under these Claims and Appeals Procedures . Once an Authorized Representative is appointed, the Plan shall direct all information, notification, etc. regarding the Claim to the Authorized Representative. The Claimant shall be copied on all notifications regarding decisions, unless the Claimant provides specific written direction otherwise. Any reference in these Claims and Appeals Procedures to Claimant is intended to include the Authorized Representative of such Claimant appointed in compliance with the above Claims and Appeals Procedures. 13.05 TYPES OF CLAIMS 1. Different R ules Apply. There are four categories of Claims, each with somewhat different Claim and appeal rules. The D epartment of Labor regulations set forth different requirements based on the type of Claim involved. The primary difference is the timeframe within w hich Claims and appeals must be determined. 2. Pre-Service Claim. A Claim is a Pre -Service Claim if the Plan Document specifically conditions receipt of the Benefit, in whole or in part, on receiving approval in advance of obtaining the Medical Care unless the Claim involves Urgent Care, as defined below. Benefits under this Plan that require approval in advance are specifically noted in this Plan Document as being subject to Precertification. 3. Urgent Care Claim. An Urgent Care Claim is a special type of Pre -Service Claim. A Claim involving Urgent Care is any Pre -Service Claim for Medical Care or treatment with respect to which the application of the time periods that otherwise apply to Pre -Service Claims could se riously jeopardize the Claimant 's life or health or ability to regain maximum function or would, in the opinion of a Physician with knowledge of the Claimant 's medical condition, subject the Claimant to severe pain that cannot be adequate ly managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the Claim. 106 The prudent lay person standard applies to these determinations. If a treating Phys ician determines the Claim involves Urgent Care, the Claim shall be treated as an Urgent Care Cl aim. However , in order to file an Urgent Care Claim, You must be requesting to have a procedure which is a Covered Benefit as defined in Section 9.01 of this Plan Document . The procedure must not be a procedure that is a Limitation or Exclusion as define d in Section 10.01 of this Plan Document . On receipt of a Pre -Service Claim, Florida Blue , MHNet or Catamaran will make a determination of whether it involves Urgent Care ; provided , however, that if a Physician with knowledge of the Claimant 's medical condition determines that a Claim involves Urgent Care, the Claim shall be treated as an Urgent Care Claim. 4. Post -Service Claim. A Post -Service Claim is any Claim for a B enefit under this Plan that is not a Pre -Service Claim or an Urgent Care Claim. Post -Service Claims are Claims that involve only the payment or reimbursement of the cost for Medical Care that has already been provided. 5. Concurrent Care Claim . A Concurrent Care Claim occurs where the Plan approves an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or for a specified number of treatments. There are two types of Concurrent Care Claims: Where reconsideration of the approval results in a reduction or termination of the initially -approved period of time or number of treatments; and Where an extension is requested beyond the initially -approved period of time or number of treatments. 6. Change in Claim Type. The Claim type is determined initially when the Claim is filed. How ever, if the nature of the Claim changes as it proceeds through these Claims and Appeals Procedures , the Claim may be re-characterized. For example, a Claim may initially be an Urgent Care Claim . If the urgency subsides, it may be re-characterized as a Pre -Service Claim. 7. Questions about Claim Type. It is very important to follow the requirements that apply to the particular type of Claim. If You have any questions regarding what type of Claim and/or what Claims and Appeals Procedure to follow, contact the Plan Administrator . 13.06 TIMEFRAME FOR DECIDING INITIAL BENEFIT CLAIMS 1. Pre-Service Claims. Florida Blue , MHN et or Cata maran shall decide an initial Pre -Service Claim within a reasonable time appropriate to the medical circumstances, but no later than 15 days after receipt of the Pre-Service request for authorization. If the Plan does not require Pre certification for the Claim for which the approval is being requested, it is not a \"claim f or benefits\" governed by ERISA and the Department of Labor regulations . 2. Urgent Care Claims. Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran shall decide an initial Urgent Care Claim as soon as possible, taking into account the medical exigencies, but no later than 72 hours after receipt of the Claim. 3. Concurrent Care Extension Request. If a Claim is a request to extend a Concurrent Care Claim (defined above) involving Urgent Care and if the Claim is made at least 24 hours prior to the end of the initially approved period of time or number of treatments, the Claim shall be decided within no more than 24 hours after receipt of the Claim. Any oth er request to extend a Concurrent Care Claim shall be decided in the otherwise applicable timeframes for Pre -Service, Urgent Care, or Post -Service Claims. 107 4. Concurrent Care Early Termination. A decision by Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran to reduce or ter minate an initially approved course of treatment is an Adverse Benefit Decision that may be appealed by the Claimant under these Claims and Appeals Procedures, as explained below. Notification to the Claimant of a decision to reduce or terminate an initial ly approved course of treatment shall be provided sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the Claimant to appeal the Adverse Benefit Decision and receive a decision on review under these Claims and Appeals Procedures prior to the r eduction or termination. 5. Post -Service Claim. Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran shall decide an initial Post -Service Claim within a reasonable time but no later than 30 days after receipt of the Claim. 6. When Extensions of Time Are Permitted. Despite the se specified timeframes, nothing prevents the Claimant from voluntarily agreeing to extend the above timeframes. In addition, if Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran , due to matters beyond its control, is not able to decide a Pre -Service Claim or a Post-Service Claim within the above timeframes, one 15 -day extension of the applicable timeframe is permitted, provided that the Claimant is notified in writing prior to the expiration of the initial timeframe applicable to the Claim. The extension notice shall include a description of the matters beyond the Plan 's control that justify the extension and the date by which a decision is expected. No extension is permitted for Urgent Care Claims. 7. Incomplete Claims. If any information needed to process a Claim is missing, the Claim shall be treated as an Incomplete Claim. 8. How Incomplete Urgent Care Claims Are Treated. If an Urgent Care Claim is incomplete, Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran shall notify the Claimant as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours following r eceipt of the Incomplete Claim. The notification may be made orally to the Claimant, unless the Claimant requests written notice, and it shall describe the information necessary to complete the Claim and shall specify a reasonable time, no less than 48 hou rs, within which the Claim must be completed. The Plan shall decide the Claim as soon as possible , but no later than 48 hours after the earlier of: Receipt of the specified information; or The end of the period of time provided to submit the specified information. 9. How Other Incomplete Claims Are Treated. If a Pre -Service or Post -Service Claim is incomplete, Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran may deny the Claim or may take an extension of time, as described above. If Florida Blue , MHNet or Catamaran takes an extension of time, the extension notice shall include a description of the missing information and shall specify a timeframe, no less than 45 days, in which the necessary information must be provided. The timeframe for deciding the Claim shall be suspe nded from the date the extension notice is received by the Claimant until the date the missing necessary information is provided to Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran . If the requested provided, Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran shall decide th e Claim within the extension period specified in the extension notice. If the requested information is not provided within the time specified, the Claim may be decided without that information. 13.07 NOTIFICATION OF INITIAL BENEFIT DECISION 1. Pre-Service and Urgent Care. Written notification of Florida Blue 's, MHNet's or Cata maran 's decision on a Pre -Service or Urgent Care Claim shall be provided to the Claimant whether or not the decision is Adverse. 2. Definition of Adverse. A decision on a Clai m is \"Adverse \" if it is A denial, reduction, or termination of; or 108 A failure to provide or make payment (in whole or in part) for a Benefit. 3. Notification of Adverse Benefit Decision. Written notification shall be provided to the Claimant of the Plan's Adverse Benefit Decision on a Claim and shall include the following, in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant: A statement of the specific reason(s) for the decision; Reference(s) to the specific Plan provision(s) on which the decision i s based; A description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the Claim and why such information is necessary; A description of the Claim s and Appeals Procedures and time limits for a ppeal of the decision, the right to obtain info rmation about those Claim s and Appeals Procedures, and the right to sue in federal court; A statement disclosing any internal rules, guidelines, protocol or similar criterion relied on in making the Adverse Benefit Decision (or a statement that such infor mation will be provided free of charge upon request); If the decision involves scientific or clinical judgment, disclose either: An explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment applying the terms of the Plan to the Claimant's medical circumstance, or A statement that such explanation will be provided at no charge upon request; and In the case of an Urgent Care Claim, an explanation of the expedited review methods available for such Claim. Notification of the Plan 's Adverse Benefit Decision on an Urgent Care Claim may be provided orally, but written notification shall be furnished no later than 3 days after the oral notice. 13.08 YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL A Claimant has a right to appeal an Adverse Benefit Decision under these Claims and Appeals Procedures. After an initial benefit decision has been made with regard to a Claim by Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran , then an appeals process is offered under the Plan which has two levels (each level is referred to as a \"level of review \") with the exce ption of Urgent Care Claims (which are subject to one level of review): (1) the first level of review (Your first opportunity to appeal an Adverse Benefit Decision ; and (2) the second level of review (Your second opportunity to appeal an Adverse Benefit Decision) . For information regarding the Prescription Drug Clinical Appeals Program, see Article S ix. 13.09 HOW TO APPEAL A N ADVERSE BENEFIT DECISION 1. First Level of Review. If the Claimant is dissatisfied with an Adverse Benefit Decision by Florida Blue , MHNet or Catamaran , the Claimant may request a first level of review by Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran . The first level of review is Your first opportunity to appeal the Adverse Benefit Decision . 109 How to File Your Appeal. Except for Urgent Care Claims, discussed below, the first level of review of an Adverse Benefit Decision is filed when a Claimant (or Authorized Representative) submits a written request for review to Florida Blue , MHNet or Catamaran at the address listed below: Florida Blue MHNet Behavioral IL 60532 In order to file an appeal for a first level of review of an Adverse Benefit Decision , the request must pertain to a covered Benefit as detailed in Section 9.01 of the Plan and not listed as a Limitation or Exclusion as detailed in Section 10.01 of the Plan . Such request must be filed within 180 days of receipt of an Adverse Benefit Decision. The Claimant should state why the appeal should be approved and include any infor mation supporting the appeal. The appeal will be reviewed and the decision made by a medical Claims reviewer not involved in the initial decision. Appeals involving Medical Necessity or clinical appropriateness will be considered by a health care profess ional. A decision in writing will be made within 15 days after Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran receives a request for appeal of a Pre -Service Claim or Concurrent C are Claim and within 30 days of a Post -Service Claim determination. A request for expe dition may be requested if the time frames listed above would jeopardize the life, health , or ability to regain maximum functionality, or in the opinion of the Physician , would cause severe pain. Important Appeal Deadline. The appeal of an Adverse Benefit Decision must be filed within 180 days following the Claimant 's receipt of the notification of Adverse Benefit Decision, except that the appeal of a decision by the Plan to reduce or terminate an initially -approved course of treatment ( see the definition of Concurrent Care Claim) must be filed within 30 days of the Claimant 's receipt of the notification of the Plan 's decision to reduce or terminate. Failure to comply with these important deadlines may cause the Claimant to forfeit any ri ght to any further review of an Adverse Benefit Decision under these Claims and Appeals Procedures or in a court of law. Urgent Care Appeals. In light of the expedited timeframes for decision of Urgent Care Claims, an appeal for an Urgent Care Claim may be submitted to Florida Blue Member Services at 1 -800-664-5295 for Medical, to MHNet at 1-877-398-5816 for Behavioral Health or Cata maran at 1-800-207-2568 for Prescription Drugs. The appeal should include at least the following information: The identity of the Claimant; A specific medical condition or symptom; A specific treatment, service or product for which approval or payment is requested; and Any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis. 2. Seco nd Level of Review. If the Claimant is dissatisfied with the outcome of the first level of review, the Claimant may voluntarily initiate an additional, second level of review upon receipt of an Adverse Benefit Decision from Florida Blue , MHNet or Catamar an. For certain types of Claims (such as Claims involving Medical Necessity), the second level of review will be performed by a n Independent Review Organization . (This second level of review is referred to as \"external review\".) The Claimant will receive a notice from the Plan addressing how to initiate a second level of review (i.e., external review). The Claimant will be notified in writing of the external reviewer 's decision within the timeframes required under applicable law. 110 For certain other typ es of claims (such as Claims involving eligibility for Benefits under the Plan), the second level of review will be performed by Florida Blue, MHNet or The Claimant will be notified in writing of the reviewer's decision within the timeframes required under applicable law . In certain circumstances, You have the right to receive copies of any and all documentation that the Plan Administrator examined in making its determination. 13.10 HOW YOUR APPEAL WILL BE DECIDED The first level of review of an Adverse Benefit Decision will be performed by the Florida Blue , MHNet or Cata maran appeals board, which may include a medical director or other Clinician . If the Claimant's appeal under the first level of review results in anothe r Adverse Benefit Decision by Florida Blue , MHNet or Catamaran , the Claimant may then request a second level of review by an Independent Review Organization (IRO) or Florida Blue, MHNet or Catamaran as applicable . Generally, t he person(s) who reviews and d ecides an appeal will be a different individual than the person who made the initial Adverse Benefit Decision and will not be a subordinate of the person who made the initial Adverse Benefit Decision. If applicable, under the second level of review, the pr ocedures to be followed by an Independent Review Organization (IRO) with regard to claims submitted for external review will be carried out in accordance with applicable law. If applicable under the second level of review, Florida Blue, MHNet or Catamaran may consult with the Plan Administrator or its delegate regarding eligibility. In addition, under the second level of review, the Plan Administrator will follow these procedures when deciding any appeal: 1. Consideration of Comments. The review will take into account all information submitted by the Claimant, whether or not presented or available at the initial Adverse Benefit Decision. No d eference will be given to the initial Adverse Benefit Decision. 2. Consultation With Expert. In appropriate circumstances, the Plan Administrator will consult with a health professional with appropriate training and experience. The health care professional who is consulted on appeal will not be the same individual who was consulted, if any, regarding the initial Adverse Benefit Decision or a subordinate of that individual. 3. Access to Relevant Information. A Claimant shall, on request and free of charge, be given reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevan t to the Claimant 's Claim. If the advice of a medical or vocational expert was obtained in connection with the initial Adverse Benefit Decision, the names of each such expert shall be provided on request by the Claimant, regardless of whether the advice wa s relied upon by the Plan Administrator . 4. Expedited Methods for Urgent Care.

Your personal doctor or health care provider may have different policies or notices regarding the doctor's use and disclosure of Your health information created in the doctor's office or clinic. This Notice will tell You about the ways in which we may use and disclose Your PHI. It also describes our obligations and Your rights regarding the use and disclosure of Your PHI. We are required by law to: Make sure that health information that identifies You is kept private; Give You this Notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to health information about You; and Follow the terms of the Notice that is currently in effect.

We may use or disclose Your PHI to facilitate medical treatment or services by providers. We may disclose Your PHI to providers, including doct ors, nurses, technicians, medical students, or other hospital personnel who are involved in taking care of You.
