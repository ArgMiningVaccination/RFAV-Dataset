Chiropractors provide their patients with vital, preventative, and non-invasive health care through regular checks and adjustments. At the center of that specialized and trained care is an expert understanding of the science of vertebral subluxation. A vertebral subluxation occurs when one or more vertebrae in the spine become misaligned, compressing spinal nerves and disturbing optimal nerve function. Chiropractic's primary focus involves locating, analyzing and correcting these misalignments. Vertebral Subluxation in the History of Chiropractic The term \"subluxation\" has a long history in the healing practices, dating back to the time of Hippocrates, the ancient Greek physician regarded as the \"Father of Medicine.\" The word refers to a dislocation or displacement and has been integral to chiropractic education since the very beginning. Chiropractic's founder, D.D. Palmer, reasoned that even a slight misaligned vertebra could cause pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. Chiropractors use adjustments to restore joint function and support the nervous system. They help patients maintain optimal health while avoiding unnecessary drugs or surgery. To learn more, enjoy the video below: Understanding Chiropractic \"Chiropractors have found in every disease that is supposed to be contagious, a cause in the spine,\" wrote B.J. Palmer, the famous developer of chiropractic, in 1909. \"In the spinal column, we will find a subluxation that corresponds to every type of disease.\" As chiropractic science is concerned with preserving and restoring health, it focuses particular attention on subluxations of the tiny bones of the spine. A vertebral subluxation happens when one or more of bones of the spine are out of position and compress spinal nerves. These nerves are the primary communication link between the body to the brain. Pressure on these nerves interferes with the communication between the body and the brain, which may cause organs, tissues, and cells not to function properly. Chiropractic identifies, analyzes and helps correct these disturbances to restore the body's natural balance and the potential for self-healing. How a Subluxation Interferes with Optimal Health A subluxation interrupts the proper operation of the body's nerve system, compromising the maintenance of optimal health. The human body consists of several interrelated systems, functioning with an innate intelligence to adapt to changes in our internal environment and the world around us. Every moment, impulses are delivered between the brain and the body's 100 trillion cells to coordinate every movement and function. Impulses send this intricate information through the nerve connections in our spine. When vertebrae become subluxated because of any number of factors, interference results in the body's communication process, negatively affecting functions and performance.
