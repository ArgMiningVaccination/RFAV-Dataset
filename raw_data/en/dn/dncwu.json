{"title": "Diet and Vitiligo: The Story So Far", "author": "Rajoshee R Dutta; Tanishq Kumar; Nishikant Ingole", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Vitiligo is an acquired skin pigmentation disease with a global burden of 0.5 to 2 percent of the population. Vitiligo therapy frequently poses a difficulty, which has sparked interest in alternative treatment modalities, including multivitamins and herbal supplementation. It has previously been established that nutrition plays a crucial role in developing, amplifying, or rehabilitating an array of human disorders. However, the correlation between diet diversity and immune-mediated skin diseases is still up to interpretation. Several supplements have been studied, including vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements. Most studies agree that combining vitamin B12, folic acid, and sun exposure is good for inducing repigmentation. Supplementation of zinc and phenylalanine when used in conjunction with topical steroids or UV-B (ultraviolet B) treatment shows therapeutic effects on vitiligo due to their role in the melanin synthesis pathway. Investigations conducted on herbal supplements have revealed that most of them contain antioxidants, which aid in repigmentation. This narrative review's purpose is to discuss nutrition's function in immune-mediated inflammatory skin diseases from the perspective of the most recent and reliable information available.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-08-28", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
