Plain Language Summary COVID-19 is a public health emergency, causing serious illness in the U.S. Many people with disabilities and people of color have already had barriers accessing healthcare and other things they need. COVID-19 has had an even greater impact on these communities, especially people who are Black, Hispanic/Latino, Native, and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). Even though the COVID-19 vaccine is effective and safe, not everyone has access to the vaccine or has trust in it. In this paper, we discuss how we developed a model for vaccine decision making for people with I/DD. We reviewed research and talked with communities to help us understand what affects vaccine decisions. The findings show how complex the decisions are, especially since people with I/DD do not always make health decisions on their own. Many factors like history, communication, and the news affect people's vaccine decisions. Because barriers still exist for people with I/DD, fairness and trust can help people feel supported in their decisions. This model can help public health and policymakers learn what works to build confidence and better support people's needs.
