Special Considerations The IHS Division of Oral Health offers approved [clinical recommendations ](/doh/documents/Recommendations for Acute Dental Pain Management.pdf ) [PDF - 767 KB] [ to reinforce evidence-based acute pain management strategies, including optimizing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as acetaminophen, as well as topical/local pain strategies to avoid or reduce opioid exposure.

To support frontline clinicians within the ED, IHS has collaborated with the American College of Emergency Physicians who hosts an IHS Toolkit as one of their [Pain and Addiction Care in the Emergency Department (PACED)Resources](https://www.acep.org/paced/resources/), Many people use health care approaches considered to be outside of mainstream Western or conventional medicine for specific conditions, overall health maintenance, and/or well-being, in addition to conventional treatments. The boundaries between complementary and conventional medicine often overlap and change over time. For example, guided imagery and massage, both once considered complementary or alternative, are used regularly in some hospitals to help with pain management. Integrative Therapy Treatments include: - Movement therapy and exercise: therapists teach various exercises to improve flexibility, strength, core stability, endurance, and range of motion - Manual therapy using hands or tools on soft tissue - Massage and Deep Tissue Mobilization targeting spasms and chronic muscle tension - Manipulation of joints and bones - Dry Needling: a technique used to decrease pain and movement impairments through insertion of a thin needle (without medication) or injection into muscle, fascia and connective tissue - Pain Science Education: educating patients about the nervous system to improve pain beliefs and physical performance - Mind Body Strategies: use of mind-body interventions such as mindfulness training, yoga, guided imagery and Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) - Modalities of electrical stimulation to nerve and muscle to alleviate pain - Ultrasound - Cold laser therapy to alleviate inflammation and pain and release endorphins - Microcurrent stimulation to alleviate pain Other approaches include deep breathing, yoga, tai chi, qigong, chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, meditation, special diets, homeopathy, and progressive relaxation. The NIH's [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://nccih.nih.gov/) The Therapist Professional Advisory Committee (TPAC) published a paper that examines the opioid crisis and focuses on how to best care for patients with chronic pain. An abstract is available for free: [Physical rehabilitation therapists' perspective of the opioid crisis with evidence-based recommendations (Abstract)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=physical rehabilitation therapists perspective of the opioid crisis with evidence-based recommendations&cmd=correctspelling) Results from a number of studies suggest that acupuncture may help ease types of pain that are often chronic such as low-back pain, neck pain, and osteoarthritis/knee pain with minimal safety risk. Studies also suggest that acupuncture may help reduce the frequency of tension headaches and prevent migraine headaches. The IHS has partnered with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to utilize the innovation of the Defense and Veterans Center for Integrative Pain Management (DVCIPM). The DVCIPM auricular acupuncture model is titled 'Battlefield Acupuncture' and includes an inter-professional training component as well stepped-care models.
