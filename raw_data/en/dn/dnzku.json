Section 8: Coordination of Benefits Provision Benefits will be coordinated with any other eligible medical, surgical, or hospital Plan or coverage so that combined payments under all programs will not exceed 1 00% of Allowa ble Expenses incurred for covered services and supplies. Definitions 1. Allowable Expenses: Any health care expense, including Coinsurance, or Copays and without reduction for any applicable Deductible that is covered in full or in part by any of the Plans covering the Insured Person. If a Plan is advised by an Insured Person that all Plans covering the Insured Person are high -deductible health Plans and the Insured Person intends to contribute to a health savings account established in accordan ce with section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the primary high -deductible health Plan's deductible is not an allowable expense, except for any health care expense incurred that may not be subject to the deductible as described in s 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service is considered an allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense or service or a portion of an expense or service that is not covered by any of the Plans is not an allowable expense. Any expense that a provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging an Insured Person is not an allowable expense. Expenses that are not allowable includ e all of the following. The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital rooms. COL-17-GA (PY22 ) CERT 16 For Plans that compute benefit payments on the basis of usual and cus tomary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement or other similar reimbursement methodology, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specified benefit. For Plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, any amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees. If one Plan calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement or other similar reimbursement methodology and another Plan calcul ates its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary Plan's payment arrangement shall be the Allowable Expense for all Plans. However, if the provider has contracted with the Secondary Plan to provide the benefit or service for a spec ific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the Primary Plan's payment arrangement and if the provider's contract permits, that negotiated fee or payment shall be the allowable expense used by the Secondary Plan to determine its benefits. The amount of any benefit reduction by the Primary Plan because an Insured Person has failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an Allowable Expense. Examples of these types of Plan provisions include second surgical opinions, precertification of admission, and preferred provider arrangements. 2. Plan : A form of coverage with which coordination is allowed. Plan includes all of the following: Group insurance contracts and subscriber contracts. Uninsured arrangements of group or group -type coverage. Group coverage through closed panel Plans. Group -type contracts, including blanket contracts. The medical care components of long -term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care. The medical benefits coverage in automobile no fault and traditional automo bile fault type contracts. Medicare or other governmental benefits, as permitted by law, except for Medicare supplement coverage. That part of the definition of Plan may be limited to the hospital, medical, and surgical benefits of the governmental progra m.

A governmental Plan, which, by law, provides benefits that are in excess of those of any private insurance Plan or other nongovernmental Plan. An Individual Health Insurance Contract. 3. Primary Plan : A Plan whose benefits for a person's health care coverage must be determined without taking the existence of any other Plan into consideration. A Plan is a Primary Plan if: 1) the Plan either has no order of benefit determination rules or its rules differ from th ose outlined in this Coordination of Benefits Provision; or 2) all Plans that cover the Insured Person use the order of benefit determination rules and under those rules the Plan determines its benefits first. 4. Secondary Plan : A Plan that is not the Primar y Plan. 5. We, Us or Our : The Company named in the Policy. Rules for Coordination of Benefits - When an Insured Person is covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are outlined below. COL-17-GA (PY22 ) CERT 17 The Primary Plan pays or pro vides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits under any other Plan. If an Insured is covered by more than one Secondary Plan, the Order of Benefit Determination rules in this provision shall decide the order in w hich the Secondary Plan's benefits are determined in relation to each other. Each Secondary Plan shall take into consideration the benefits of the Primary Plan or Plans and the benefits of any other Plans, which has its benefits determined before those of that Secondary Plan. A Plan that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision that is consistent with this provision is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. This does not apply to coverage t hat is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples o f these types of situations are major medical coverages that are superimposed over base Plan hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a closed panel Plan to provide out of network benefits. If the Pr imary Plan is a closed panel Plan and the Secondary Plan is not a closed panel Plan, the Secondary Plan shall pay or provide benefits as if it were the Primary Plan when an Insured Person uses a non-panel provider, except for E mergency Services or authorized referrals that are paid or provided by the Primary Plan. A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is secondary to that other Plan. Order of Benefit Determination - Each Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: Non-Dependent/Dependent. The benefits of the Plan which covers the person as an employee, member or subscriber are determined before those of the Plan which covers the person as a Dependent. If the person is a Medicare beneficiary, and, as a result of the provisions of Title XVII of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations, Medicare is both (i) secondary to the Plan covering the person as a dependent; an d (ii) primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a dependent, then the order of benefit is reversed. The Plan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber, policyholder or retiree is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan covering the person as a dependent is the Primary Plan. Dependent Child/Parents Married or Living Together. When this Plan and another Plan cover the same child as a Dependent of different persons, called \"parents\" who are married or are living together whether or not they have ever been married: o the benefits of the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earli er in a year exclusive of year of birth are determined before those of the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year. o However, if both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the Plan which covered the parent longer are determined before those of the Plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. Dependent Child/Parents Divorced, Separated or Not Living Together. If two or more Plans cover a person as a Dependent child of parents who are divorced or separated or are not living together, whether or not they have ever been married, benefits for the child are determined in this order: If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care services or expenses of the child and that Plan has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is Primary. If the parent with financial responsibility has no coverage for the child's health care services or expenses, but that parent's spouse does, the spouse's Plan is the Primary Pla n. This item shall not apply with respect to any Plan year during which benefits are paid or provided before the entity has actual knowledge of the court decree provision. If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the child's health care expenses or coverage, the order of benefit shall be determined in accordance with part (2). If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or coverage o f the child, the order of benefits shall be determined in accordance with the rules in part (2). If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the child's health care expenses or coverage, the order of benefits are as follows: o First, the Plan of the parent with custody of the child. o Then the Plan of the spouse of the parent with the custody of the child. o The Plan of the parent not having custody of the child. COL-17-GA (PY22 ) CERT 18 o Finally, the Plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child. Depen dent Child/Non -Parental Coverage. If a Dependent child is covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the order of benefits shall be determined, as applicable, as if those individuals were parents of the child. Active/Inactive Employee. The benefits of a Plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's Dependent) are determined before those of a Plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired employee (or a s that employee's Dependent). If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. COBRA or State Continuation Coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under COBRA o r under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law also is covered under another Plan, the following shall be the order of benefit determination: o First, the benefits of a Plan covering the person as an employee, member or subscriber or as tha t person's Dependent. o Second, the benefits under the COBRA or continuation coverage. o If the other Plan does not have the rule described here and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the Plan which covered an employee, member or subscriber longer are determined before those of the Plan which covered that person for the shorter time. If none of t he provisions stated above determine the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans. Effect on Benefits - When Our Plan is secondary, We may reduce Our benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans d uring a plan year are not more than the total Allowable Expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Plan will calculate the benefits it would have paid in the absence of other health care coverage and apply that calculated a mount to the Allowable Expense under its Plan that is unpaid by the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not exceed the total Allowable Expense for that claim. In addition, the Secondary Plan shall credit to its Plan Deductible any amounts it would have credited to its Deductible in the absence of other health care coverage. Right to Recov ery and Release of Necessary Information - For the purpose of determining applicability of and implementing the terms of this provision, We may, without further consent or notice, release to or obtain from any other insurance company or organization any in formation, with respect to any person, necessary for such purposes. Any person claiming benefits under Our coverage shall give Us the information We need to implement this provision. We will give notice of this exchange of claim and benefit information to the Insured Person when any claim is filed. Facility of Payment and Recovery - Whenever payments which should have been made under our coverage have been made under any other Plans, We shall have the right to pay over to any organizations that made such o ther payments, any amounts that are needed in order to satisfy the intent of this provision. Any amounts so paid will be deemed to be benefits paid under Our coverage. To the extent of such payments, We will be fully discharged from Our liability. Wheneve r We have made payments with respect to Allowable Expenses in total amount at any time, which are more than the maximum amount of payment needed at that time to satisfy the intent of this provision, We may recover such excess payments. Such excess payments may be received from among one or more of the following, as We determine: any persons to or for or with respect to whom such payments were made, any other insurers, service plans or any other organizations.

President It is hereby understood and agreed that the Policy to which this endorsement is attached is amended as follows : Pediatric Dental Services Benefits Benefits are provided under this endorsement for Covered Dental Services, as described below, for Insured Persons under the age of 19. Benefits under this endorsement terminate on the earlier of: 1) last day of the month the Insured Person reaches the age of 19; or 2) the date the Insured Person's coverage under the Policy terminates. Section 1: Accessing Pediatric Dental Services Network and Non -Network Benefits Network Benefits - these benefits apply when the Insured Person chooses to obtain Covered Dental Services from a Network Dental Provider. Insured Persons generally are required to pay less to the Network Dental Provider th an they would pay for services from a non -Network provider. Network Benefits are determined based on the contracted fee for each Covered Dental Service. In no event, will the Insured Person be required to pay a Network Dental Provider an amount for a Cover ed Dental Service that is greater than the contracted fee. In order for Covered Dental Services to be paid as Network Benefits, the Insured Person must obtain all Covered Dental Services directly from or through a Network Dental Provider. Insured Persons must always check the participation status of a provider prior to seeking services. From time to time, the participation status of a provider may change. The Insured Person can check the participation status by calling the Company and/or the provider. The Company can help in referring the Insured Person to Network Dental Provider s. The Company will make a Directory of Network Dental Providers available to the Insured Person. The Insured Person can also call Customer Service at 877 -816-3596 to determine wh ich providers participate in the Network. The telephone number for Customer Service is also on the Insured's ID card. Non-Network Benefits - these benefits apply when the Insured Person decides to obtain Covered Dental Services from non-Network Dental Providers. Insured Persons generally are required to pay more to the provider than for Network Benefits. Non -Network Benefits are determined b ased on the Usual and Customary Fee for similarly situated Network Dental Providers for each Covered Dental Service. The actual charge made by a non -Network Dental Provider for a Covered Dental Service may exceed the Usual and Customary Fee. Insured Person s may be required to pay a non -Network Dental Provider an amount for a Covered Dental Service in excess of the Usual and Customary Fee. When the Insured Person obtains Covered Dental Services from non -Network Dental Providers, the Insured Person must file a claim with the Company to be reimbursed for Allowed Dental Amounts. COL -17-GA (PY22) END PEDDENT 2 What Are Covered Dental Services? The Insured Person is eligible for benefits for Covered Dental Services listed in this endorsement if such Dental Services are Necessary and are provided by or under the direction of a Network Dental Provider. Benefits are available only for Necessary Dental Services. The fact that a Dental Provider has performed or prescribed a proced ure or treatment, or the fact that it may be the only available treatment for a dental disease , does not mean that the procedure or treatment is a Covered Dental Service under this endorsement. What Is a Pre -Treatment Estimate? If the charge for a Dental Service is expected to exceed $500 or if a dental exam reveals the need for fixed bridgework, the Insured Person may notify the Company of such treatment before treatment begins and receive a pre -treatment estimate. To receive a pre -treatment estimate, th e Insured Person or Dental Provider should send a notice to the Company, via claim form, within 20 calendar days of the exam. If requested, the Dental Provider must provide the Company with dental x -rays, study models or other information necessary to eval uate the treatment plan for purposes of benefit determination. The Company will determine if the proposed treatment is a Covered Dental Service and will estimate the amount of payment. The estimate of benefits payable will be sent to the Dental Provider a nd will be subject to all terms, conditions and provisions of the Policy. Clinical situations that can be effectively treated by a less costly, clinically acceptable alternative proced ure will be assigned a benefit based on the less costly procedure. A pre-treatment estimate of benefits is not an agreement to pay for expenses. This procedure lets the Insured Person know in advance approximately what portion of the expenses will be considered for payment. Does Pre -Authorization Apply? Pre-authorization is required for all orthodontic services. The Insured Person should speak to the Dental Provider about obtaining a pre -authorization before Dental Services are provided. If the Insured Person does not obtain a pre -authorization, the Company has a right to de ny the claim for failure to comply with this requirement. Section 2: Benefits for Pediatric Dental Services Benefits are provided for the Dental Services stated in this Section when such services are: A. Necessary. B. Provided by or under the direction of a Dental Provider. C. Clinical situations that can be effectively treated by a less costly, dental appropriate alternative procedure will be assigned a benefit based on the least costly procedure. D. Not excluded as described in Section 3: Pediatric Dental Exclusions of this endorsement . Benefits for Covered Dental Services are subject to satisfaction of the Dental Services Deductible. Network Benefits : Benefits for Allowed Dental Amounts are determined as a percentage of the negotiated contract fee between the Company and the provider rather than a percentage of the provider's billed charge. The Company's negotiated rate with the provider is ordinarily lower than the provider's billed charge. A Network provider cannot charge the Insured Person o r the Company for any service or supply that is not Necessary as determined by the Company. If the Insured Person agrees to receive a service or supply that is not Necessary the Network provider may charge the Insured Person. However, these charges will no t be considered Covered Dental Services and benefits will not be payable. Non-Network Benefits : Benefits for Allowed Dental Amounts from non -Network providers are determined as a percentage of the Usual and Customary Fees. The Insured Person must pay the amount by which the non -Network provider's billed charge exceeds the Allowed Dental Amounts.
