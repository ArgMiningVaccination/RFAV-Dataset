Went through the trouble of breaking taboos on conventional medicine and opened up the field for a healing method that is unfortunately known to only a few medical opinion leaders. The fact that she does not do this with the fanaticism of homeopaths who are uncritically convinced of this method, but always looks for scientific approaches that lead to amazing findings, is respectable.
