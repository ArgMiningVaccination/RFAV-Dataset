But with another flu season rapidly approaching as healthcare facilities continue to manage the current surge from the Delta variant, Atrium Health infectious disease physicians like Dr. Anupama Neelakanta are anxious for the public to understand what to expect this flu season and how to stay healthy as it approaches.", "sitename": "atriumhealth.org", "date": "2021-09-29", "cleaned_text": "Last year, there were very few cases of flu, but between the three prior seasons, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/past-seasons.html) (CDC) estimates that over 118 million people contracted the flu, 55.5 million visited a healthcare provider for treatment, 1.7 million were hospitalized and 117,200 died because of this seasonal . That's why [Anupama Neelakanta, MD](https://atriumhealth.org/provider-profile/anupama-neelakanta-1619135092), an infectious disease physician with [Atrium Health Infectious Disease Kenilworth](https://atriumhealth.org/locations/detail/atrium-health-infectious-disease-kenilworth), is apprehensive about the upcoming flu season. \"Our COVID-19 numbers are pretty high right now with the Delta variant, and we expect they will remain that way for a few more weeks,\" Dr. Neelakanta says. If you add the flu on top of that surge, it's going to mean even more hospitalizations. If we don't minimize that risk, we could overwhelm an already strained healthcare system, she warns. Explaining Last Year's Flu Phenomenon Every flu season is different and can be hard to predict, according to Dr. Neelakanta. Prior to last year's season, public health experts worried about a possible twindemic in which both COVID-19 and the flu would be circulating in communities at the same time. The twindemic never materialized, which many physicians attribute to COVID-19 restrictions. The stay-at-home orders, social distancing protocols, remote work, virtual schools and mask mandates in effect during last year's season essentially kept the [influenza virus](https://atriumhealth.org/health-library/diseases-conditions/influenza) from gaining any kind of foothold and spreading through the population. Understanding This Year's Flu Conditions This year, COVID-19 restrictions have been loosened or lifted, [kids are back in school](https://atriumhealth.org/dailydose/2021/08/20/back-to-school-during-delta-an-expert-shares-covid-19-advice-with-parents) and many businesses and communities have returned to pre-pandemic activities. As people reemerge after 12 to 18 months without typical social interaction and exposure to circulating germs, their immunity to things like the flu may have been impacted. Given these conditions, Dr. Neelakanta thinks we're going to experience a more severe flu season this year compared to last. Data from the southern hemisphere showed that flu cases this year was higher than last year but still below usual flu season numbers. A few other factors to keep in mind are: - Both the flu and COVID-19 can spread before a person is symptomatic. - They share many of the same symptoms, even the loss of taste and smell, although it's more common with COVID-19. - It's possible to have them at the same time or with another respiratory illness. Protecting Yourself Against the Flu (and COVID-19) Anyone who has ever had the flu knows it's no fun.

If you're not already [vaccinated against COVID-19](https://atriumhealth.org/dailydose/2021/08/31/fda-gives-full-approval-of-the-pfizer-vaccine-instilling-confidence-for-many), the CDC says it's safe to get both vaccines at the same time.
