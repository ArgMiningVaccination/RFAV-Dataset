Identifying salary and compensation ranges of naturopathic physicians, especially as they relate to tenure in the profession, state licensure, and full-time/part-time commitments. Understanding best practices in the industry for increasing business opportunities and number of patients. Uncovering reasons for not practicing after obtaining a designation in naturopathic medicine. Examining how dual/multiple degrees or diplomas affect salary/ compensation, and satisfaction with the practice of naturopathic medicine. Ascertaining perceptions of the profession. Creating a profile of the \"successful\" naturopathic professional; i.e. one satisfied with their career and career choices. Supporting incorporation of findings into academic and clinical curricula. Updating the results from the survey conducted in 2015.Research objectives included: Alumni from all AANMC member schools were invited to participate in this study. Overall, the responses closely matched the proportion of alumni reported by each member school. The survey did not experience overrepresentation by any one institution. 7 6Alumni Statistics Time to Graduate Over 96% of graduates completed their naturopathic degree or diploma in five years.Alumni Gender Distribution Advanced Degree(s)/Diploma(s) Held: 1%2% 23% 74%74% of graduating students were female 23% were male 2% wished not to identify 1% chose to identify as other 34% held at least one additional advanced degree/diploma 66% did not hold an additional advanced degree/diploma on top of their ND designationThe average age upon graduation was: 32The median age upon graduation was: 30 9% graduated in less than 4 years \u00b9 64% graduated in 4 years 23% graduated in 5 years 3% graduated in 6 years \u00b2 1% graduated in 7 years34% 66% 1. Students with advanced standing or prior credit may graduate in less than 4 years. 2. Dual degree tracks may take additional time for degree completion.9 8Employment Settings Employment Settings In the US, group and solo private practice were the most common employment settings. However, many graduates pursued other career paths as well. It is common for NDs to work in multiple employment settings so the percentages do not add up to 100%It is common for NDs to work in multiple employment settings so the percentages do not add up to 100%In Canada, group private practice is the most common employment setting.

Institutions were encouraged to send at least one reminder each week. The survey remained open for just a little under a month before closing on December 17th, 2019. In return for their participation in the survey, respondents were invited to submit their contact information for a chance to win one of seven gift cards valued at (1x) $300 Amazon, (1x) $100 PayPal, and (5x) $50 PayPal. Response Rates Email invitations were sent to 7,302 member schools' alumni. Once the survey was closed, a total of 1,215 responses were collected -a response rate of approximately 17%. The margin of error for this sample is +/- 3%. Since it is impossible to survey all naturopathic medicine professionals, statisticians use a random sample to estimate the population parameters and then generalize the results of the sample to the larger group. The margin of error, or standard error, is a statistical term used to measure the random fluctuations inherent in samples; the smaller the standard of error, the more accurate the measurement of the population or universe. This study's significance level of .05 carries with it a 95 percent confidence interval. The confidence interval is established as the likelihood that the same results would be achieved in a similar study, meaning that if we were to conduct this study 100 times, the same results, plus or minus the margin of error (3%), would occur 95 out of 100 times .25 24About Kai Analytics Kai Analytics and Survey Research Inc. helps businesses understand their constituents through the analysis of text feedback.
